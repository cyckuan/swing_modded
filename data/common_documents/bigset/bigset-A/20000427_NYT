STATE 1ST TO REQUIRE SOME SUN POWER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

   &QL; 
(PHOENIX) - Arizona has become the first state to order utilities
to produce a certain percentage of their electricity from solar
sources, a move that puts it at the forefront of the clean-energy
movement and could revive Arizona's lagging solar indus try.
</P>
<P>
   The Corporation Commission on Wednesday, April 26, unanimously
approved a measure that will require utilities and other
electricity provid ers to derive a portion of their product from
solar and other renew able resources.
</P>
<P>
   Although 27 other states have such mandated portfolios, Arizona
is the first to require that solar energy make up a specific
portion of the mix.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is being hailed by solar groups as a godsend that
will jump-start their businesses. Environmen talists call it one of
the best things to ever happen to electricity generation in
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exactly what this industry has been crying for,'' said
Bud Annan, chairman of the Arizona Clean Industries Alliance, a
loose organiza tion of about 45 solar-related busi nesses.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Solar and Environmen tally Friendly Portfolio
Standard, electricity providers will have to derive 1.1 percent of
their total product from renewable resources by 2007.
</P>
<P>
   They must begin implementing the program this year to achieve a
mandated four-tenths of 1 percent by Jan. 1. For Arizona Public
Service Co., that would be about 22 mega watts, or enough
electricity for 1,100 homes.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the companies must derive at least 50 percent of
their renewable power from solar-generat ing facilities. The
remainder can come from such sources as landfill gas, wind and
biomass generators.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's action does not affect the quasipublic Salt River
Project, which is not governed by the Corpo ration Commission. The
SRP is developing an alternative-energy pro gram.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the solar power, which the utilities say is 10 times
that of conventionally generated electricity, will be paid for, in
part, by per-month surcharges, the maximums of which are 35 cents
for residential electric bills and a $13-per-meter charge for most
businesses. The largest businesses will pay $39 per month more.
Other funds will come from a systems benefit charge, which
customers are now paying for con sumer-education programs.
</P>
<P>
   Those charges are projected to raise $15 million to $20 million
a year for APS and Tucson Electric Power.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure, which include APS and Tucson Electric
Power, Phelps Dodge, Asarco and the Residential Utility Consumer
Office, argued that the requirement will create an undue financial
burden on utilities, which will result in higher rates for
consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents, which include the Grand Canyon Trust, Sierra Club,
Tucson and the solar industry, argued that national surveys show a
majority of consumers are willing to forgo a 5 percent reduction in
electric rates to be able to select power from renew able
resources. And they note the measure will help offset the impact of
the 13 gas-fired power plants planned for the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very progressive move and demonstrates some real
leadership on the part of the commission,'' said Rick Gillian,
technical adviser for the Land and Water Fund of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   APS says its Solar Partners program, which charges customers a
premium for power generated from small solar plants in Tempe and
Flagstaff, has been a tremendous success. It has more customers
than available prod uct.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Fox, APS' vice president of environmental resources, said,
``The problem (with the order) is that it will raise electric
rates, and that is inconsistent with the (deregulation) settlement
we reached with the com mission last fall. We had to oppose it.'' &QL;

AFTER TRADING HITS, KNICKS FLOOR THE RAPTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Vince Carter stared into the eyes of Latrell
Sprewell at the top of the 3-point arc, the noise blew up inside of
Madison Square Garden. Here was Carter looking at the one Knick who
had been able to counter him on Wednesday night, and he had a
chance to beat him one on one.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew it. But the play wasn't for Carter. It was for Dee
Brown. Just before the buzzer, Carter swung the ball to Brown, who
missed a 3-pointer that would have won the game for the Raptors and
devastated the Knicks. With Patrick Ewing charging toward him,
Brown's shot fell short as the time on the clock expired.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, the Knicks were using the court as their private
dance floor after winning, 84-83. They also took a 2-0 lead in
their first-round, three-of-five playoff series, which shifts to
Toronto for Game3 on Sunday afternoon, and absorbed the punch from
a sharper, more intense Raptor team.
</P>
<P>
   In a nearly 3-hour Game 2 that was filled with 60 personal
fouls, the Knicks endured whatever it took to come back from a
16-point, third-quarter deficit. They made their comeback with
Larry Johnson's 8 points early in the fourth and Sprewell's 13 to
end the game.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sprewell, who scored 25 points to shadow the 27 by
Carter, who gave the Knicks their first lead since the opening
minutes of the game. The Knicks had the ball with 25.6 seconds left
and trailed by 1 point. It was Sprewell and Carter, alone in
isolation. After he waited for the clock to spin down, Sprewell
darted from the left sideline into the paint, rose up over Carter
and hit a fallaway 6-footer with 7.9 seconds left to give the
Knicks an 84-83 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks finished the game shooting 40.3 percent; the Raptors
shot 41.4 percent. Allan Houston, nonexistent all night, scored 12
points on a 2-for-8 night while Ewing added 19 points despite
having foul trouble. The Knicks made 28 of 38 free throws and the
Raptors hit 33 of 41.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy worried about his
team's history of mishandling prosperity. Several players said he
was visibly angry about the team's bleary focus during Tuesday's
practice, and he wondered out loud if his team could unearth the
kind of hunger they had to start Game1.
</P>
<P>
   Even as game time approached, even after a successful
shoot-around on Wednesday morning, he was still concerned with the
Knicks' energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in Game 2's, and you look at what teams did yesterday,
and it's interesting for a team that wins Game 1,'' said Van Gundy,
referring to San Antonio and Charlotte's ability to come back and
even their respective series. ``I think there is a big difference
when you win Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important that we go for the win tonight. A lot
of times at 1-0, you're waiting for the other shoe to drop. What if
Vince Carter has a better night. All these things. We just have to
go for the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's pregame anxieties were justified. A sharper, more
prepared Raptors team took the floor with Muggsy Bogues inserted as
the starting point guard to guide them. With him, there was calm.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was over his opening-night jitters, and his teammates
were ready for whatever the Knicks had.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't much.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Raptors opened up a 15-point lead midway
through the second, an edge aided after six straight turnovers by
the clumsy Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   With Houston unable to get his shot off with Tracy McGrady
around and Marcus Camby missing a flurry of putbacks, the Knicks
were in a dire state until Ewing came back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing had two quick fouls in the first quarter. After sitting
for nearly 10 minutes, Ewing returned with his team down, 32-20.
Maneuvering around Kevin Willis, he made an immediate impact during
a 12-2 run. Ewing scored 7 points as the Knicks tightened their
defense and pulled back to 34-29 with 2 minutes remaining in the
half.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Oakley kept the game from being closer. He was already
beating the Knicks to loose balls and making the shots when Carter
fed him the ball out of double-teams. With 50 seconds left in the
half, Oakley was left open to hit a 3-pointer. His 9 first-half
points, combined with the 10 by a much more restrained Carter, gave
the Raptors a 41-34 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Knicks closed the gap, they expended a lot of
energy just to make up for their abysmal first quarter. They were
out of it as they exited the locker room while Carter was beginning
to feel it on his deadly fadeaway over Sprewell. Carter scored on 5
quick points, including a gravity-defying, hanging jumper on the
baseline, to give the Raptors a 52-37 lead with 7:35 left in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   Again, Ewing had to rescue the Knicks. By getting to the line,
he helped cut the Raptors lead to 55-46. But Carter continued to
counter Ewing's star treatment by the refs by also getting some
beneficial calls.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks couldn't afford to trade trips to the free-throw
line. With 3 minutes left in the third quarter, Camby came up one
of the easier blocks of his career when he slapped down a jumper by
the 5-foot-3-inch Bogues.
</P>
<P>
   With some active defense, plus a fadeaway jumper by Ewing over
Willis, the Knicks were just 8 points down with 1:50 left in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ewing or nothing. Houston was even struggling at the
free-throw line, and Sprewell was coated every time he touched the
ball by Carter, plus double teams. As the third quarter ended with
both teams marching to the line _ each team had 28 attempts through
three quarters _ the Raptors converted more to take a 67-55 lead
entering the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Each time the Knicks got close, the Raptors put on a spurt of
energy to pull away again. Their leader was Bogues. From the
beginning, Bogues gave the Knicks all kind of problems. This was a
lineup change Butch Carter made in an effort to get Toronto off to
a crisper start than the one that ended up with the Knicks taking a
19-point, first-quarter lead in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. Bogues put pressure on the Knicks' point guards,
squeezed minutes off the shot-clock and left Houston, Sprewell and
Ewing rushing jumpers and forcing up attempts as the aggressive
Raptors closed in with double teams.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Carter, who passed with more precision out of
double teams, and hit his first 2 shots after missing his first 12
in Game 1, was doing damage. If he wasn't scoring, he was
attracting enough attention so that Oakley was left alone to fire.
The toll of it all left the Knicks shooting just 15 percent and
down 26-15 at the end of the first.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were in suffer mode. Even though they pulled to 41-34
at the half, they were not getting the same production as they were
in Game 1 from the Knick starters. &QL;

 REVIEW: NEXTEL ONLINE  &HT;     By BECKY WARING 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Surfing the Web, getting e-mail and reading the
news on your cell phone?
</P>
<P>
   My first reaction was, ``Enough, already!''
</P>
<P>
   Do we really need (or want) to be connected to the Web every
second?
</P>
<P>
   While ``need'' is perhaps too strong a word, after using
Nextel's new Online service for a month, let's just say I've grown
accustomed to its face. Breaking up would be hard to do.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a look at Nextel Online, and what you can expect from the
new generation of digital PCS phones and wireless information
services.
</P>
<P>
   What does Nextel Online do, exactly? First, it gives you access
to the Web, albeit on a very small, text-only screen. It also
provides a number of information services through MSN Mobile, such
as stock quotes, weather reports, flight status, driving
directions, sports scores, news headlines, lottery numbers and so
on. E-commerce partners like Amazon.com even offer one-click
ordering by phone. Finally, paging and e-mail services let you send
and receive urgent messages while away from your computer.
</P>
<P>
   In order to take advantage of the Web-browsing and information
services, you first need a Web-enabled digital cell phone. Nextel
offers three Motorola models, the i500plus ($99), i700plus ($149)
and i1000plus ($199), to Bay Area users. We reviewed the basic
model, the i500plus. The i700plus adds vibrating ring capability,
as well as a missed-call indicator and lighted keypad; the compact
i1000plus model further adds a speakerphone.
</P>
<P>
   All include the Phone.com microbrowser for the Web, as well as
the ability to be used as wireless modems for your PC, Windows CE
or Palm device. Modem speeds are typically 19.2 Kbps, and
connection kits with software and cables cost $99 (no Macintosh
kits are available from Nextel, but third-party solutions may
work). You use the phone and cable to dial up to your regular ISP
or company network.
</P>
<P>
   At 19.2 Kbps, you won't want to rely on the wireless modem as
your main Net connection for a portable computer, but it's great
for occasional use, especially while traveling.
</P>
<P>
   Once you've got the phone, setting it up for information
services is a snap. You simply go to the MSN Mobile Web site (while
on your computer, not the phone) and give it basic information like
your Hotmail and Expedia account names, ZIP code, favorite sports
teams, stock symbols you want to track, and zodiac sign.
</P>
<P>
   Then, when you log on from the phone, your personalized data is
available. You can also get many types of information, including
stock prices, sent automatically as pager alerts.
</P>
<P>
   The Hotmail retrieval capability is by far the most valuable.
With Hotmail, you can access the same e-mail account on both
computer and phone, rather than requiring people to remember a
special account name to reach you by phone.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few snags, however. First, you won't be able to view
nontext messages, which seemed to comprise about half my mail.
Second, you'll need to wade through oceans of spam. I recommend
using Hotmail's new feature to direct spamlike mail to a special
folder, so it doesn't clog up your inbox. Finally, there's no way
to delete messages using the phone, a major oversight.
</P>
<P>
   You can also send mail from your Hotmail account on the phone,
but composing messages using the phone keypad is tedious, to say
the least. It's most useful for quick messages, like ``I'll be home
late'' or ``Meeting confirmed for 2 p.m.'' The phone does include
software called T9 that eases typing chores.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, T9 has a built-in dictionary that translates words
typed with the nine keys into the most likely candidate. Otherwise,
you would need to press the 2 key twice to represent the letter B,
the 9 key four times for the letter Z, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Some key combinations have more than one translation, but
hitting the ``next'' key cycles you through the options. This
system works amazingly well, saving a lot of keying time and
effort, although it will never be fast. We just wish there were a
special mode for entering e-mail addresses and URLs, which gave us
the most problems.
</P>
<P>
   The MSN Mobile information services are also handy, although not
essential for most people. Over the Easter weekend, I used the
flight status feature (through Expedia.com) to check on actual
flight times for various relatives coming in from around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   I could get the status repeatedly for delayed flights just by
pressing the back button. Watching the stock market indexes fall
last week was also entertaining, although since prices are delayed
15 to 20 minutes, day traders will need to look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   More useful was the local business directory. You can find
businesses by ZIP code in many categories, such as restaurants and
movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The address of my favorite local Chinese restaurant pops right
up when I click on ``Dining'' and ``Chinese.'' Then you can also
get driving directions if you need them.
</P>
<P>
   Other options range from bagel shops to ATM locations and car
repair services. MSN Mobile is also available for Palm and Windows
CE devices, so if you have a PDA as well, your account can do
double duty.
</P>
<P>
   Nextel Online is actually the second such service in the Bay
Area. Sprint's PCS Wireless Web, which uses information services
from Yahoo, CNN, MapQuest and several others, was the first. With
more time on the market, Sprint has signed up more information
partners than Nextel.
</P>
<P>
   Two examples: eCompare.com, which allows you to compare online
prices for items that you see as you shop in retail stores; and
Dictionary.com, a dictionary lookup and translation service.
</P>
<P>
   How do prices compare? Nextel Online adds $14.95 to your basic
calling plan, or $19.95 including the Web-browsing capability.
Since only a few Web pages are phone-friendly thus far, we
recommend going with the $14.95 service for now.
</P>
<P>
   This includes unlimited use of the MSN service, which does not
count toward calling-plan minutes; 300 text messages (such as the
automated alert services) are also included, more than enough for
most users.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Sprint's Wireless Web option costs $9.99 a month,
but you'll pay extra for text messages, starting at $1.99 for 30
messages, or $9.99 for 200. More importantly, you'll also pay 10
cents per minute for Web access to information services with
Sprint, a big advantage for Nextel.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking of making the leap to digital anyway, by all
means get a Web-enabled phone, even if you don't sign up for the
PCS services right away.
</P>
<P>
   And if you frequently check stock prices, need directions or
just want to check movie times, you're already a prime candidate
for a PCS service. I didn't think I was, but I got used to the
convenience very quickly.

 MEDIA BYTES: NEW-ECONOMY MAGS STILL GROWING  &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Upside update: The San Francisco monthly's
former editor, Adrian Mello, whose departure last month sparked
widespread defections at the magazine, has landed on his feet and
brought a few former colleagues with him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Upside Media, the mag's parent company, is showing
some signs of maturity: It's gone on a hiring binge, it's opening
new offices, it reorganized and it hired _ at last _ a chief
financial officer and a director of human resources.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to help recruit and retain employees, Upside has
even started matching 401(k) contributions, and even though the
company is privately held and events of recent weeks have sent the
market for new stocks into the dumper, it's giving all employees
stock options.
</P>
<P>
   The changes come too late for Mello and company, but perhaps
that's for the best. Mello will be editor of a new magazine and Web
operation in the (sorry, I'm about to use two terms I hate,
back-to-back) B2B space. That is, it'll be devoted to covering
businesses that cater to other businesses, over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It's a niche that makes sense to Mello, who cites forecasts that
predict the B2B market will rise to nearly $2 trillion by 2003, or
10 times the consumer Internet market. Companies are jumping into
B2B to save money and become more efficient _ and will be hungry
for information on how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   The publication is titled Line56, which must refer to something,
but I can't tell what from its Web site ( &LR; www.line56.com &LR; ). The
name may not stick, anyway. It's planning to launch July 1. The
site up now is merely a prototype, which is a good thing. It's a
jargon-packed listing of news stories that could use a hefty
revamping.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, Line56 is trying to carve out a niche in a crowded
marketplace. At least with Mello, it's off to a good start.
</P>
<P>
   Mello, a seasoned journalist who once edited Macworld, has
already signed up former Upside Features Editor Howard Baldwin as
executive editor for the magazine and former PC World and Cnet
Computers.com Editor Eric Knorr as executive producer of the Web
site. The parent company, B2B E-Commerce International Inc., is
based in Los Angeles, but execs were willing to let Mello establish
the editorial operations in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``They recognized this is where the pool of editorial talent is,
both for the magazine and the Web,'' Mello said.
</P>
<P>
   Mello's old boss, Upside CEO David Bunnell, couldn't resist a
poke, suggesting the publication change its name to ``2B or not
2B.'' Bunnell said with the latest challenges in the stock market,
investment in Internet firms will tighten _ and those companies
won't spend as much money on advertising. ``It's going to be
somewhat more difficult for newcomers to join the party,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People said the same thing when the Industry Standard came
out,'' Mello said. ``Who would think even a year ago you could have
the number of publications in this space, and they'd be doing as
well as they're doing. ... I would much rather be on a publication
that focuses on a specific need than be at one like Upside that's
one among many. What really distinguishes them from the market
leaders like the Industry Standard and Business 2.0?''
</P>
<P>
   It's funny that Bunnell describes a tightening ad market, since
that climate could hurt Upside, too. But Bunnell was typically
upbeat about his own prospects. Upside was the first new-economy
magazine, before even Wired, before there even was a new economy.
But as it approaches its 11th birthday, it has lost some luster to
newer, hotter magazines like the Industry Standard and Red Herring.
</P>
<P>
   Indefatigably, Bunnell plows ahead. He's hired 25 people in the
last three weeks, bringing the company to about 80 employees. He's
carved it into three divisions, devoted to the magazine, online and
events.
</P>
<P>
   He'll move the events business out of the Market Street offices
to 333 Sacramento St. in the Financial District, and the growing
online business _ run by his son, Aaron Bunnell, and posting 20
original stories a day _ will move to a new floor in the Market
Street headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   He hired Rambabu ``Bobby'' Yarlagawda to be his chief financial
officer, the first one at the firm; Yarlagawda had been CFO at
Living Books, once a high-flying joint venture between Random House
and Broderbund Software.
</P>
<P>
   On the news side, he's brought in Tom Coyle from Dow Jones as
senior editor, reporter Rex Crum from Investors Business Daily and
reporter Adam Feuerstein from the San Francisco Business Times. To
replace the ousted impresario David Coursey as host of the Digital
Living Room, one of Upside's most popular events, Bunnell has
tabbed veteran ``Computer Chronicles'' television host Stewart
Cheifet.
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell is luring these folks with the currency of the day:
stock options. Upside Media has only 3.5 million shares
outstanding, and Bunnell is giving employees the chance to buy in
at $10 a share _ even though he thinks the company is worth at
least triple the $35 million valuation that would bring.
</P>
<P>
   The catch is, at this point, they could only sell those shares
to another investor. But since most of Upside's investors are
venture capitalists and entrepreneurs, Bunnell said, ``There's
pressure on management to develop the company in a way that there's
going to be liquidity. ... Either to go public or be acquired.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words: The Upside story is not over yet.
</P>
<P>
   NOTEWORTHY BYLINE: The San Jose Mercury News placed an ad in a
recent issue of the Industry Standard showing a Merc front page
with certain words highlighted. But the funny thing was, the lead
story on that front page was by Jonathan Rabinovitz, who's no
longer at the Merc.
</P>
<P>
   You can now find Rabinovitz's byline in ... the Industry
Standard.
</P>
<P>
   HOT, AND NOT: Red Herring made it official: It will double in
frequency, going biweekly starting in November. (Not that I need to
get more Red Herrings, but at least they should be smaller: June's
issue is due to weigh in at 628 pages. Spare me!)
</P>
<P>
   And Imagine Media, which is pouring energy into launching new
mags _ five due out by next year _ has actually closed one. A
moment of silence, please, for PC Accelerator, a mag for die-hard
gamers, which is shutting down with its June issue. Its staff will
live on in the virtual world, contributing content to Imagine's
online game site, at  &LR; www.dailyradar.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   JUMPING JODI: Last week, I dinged Jodi Mardesich for writing a
column in Fortune about Drspock.com and then leaving the magazine
to go work for the Web startup. She e-mailed me: ``What's wrong
with that? It would be wrong if I wrote about the company with the
intent to get a job there. ... Problem is, that's not what
happened. I wrote about the company because I had a deadline and I
had the information and I thought it was an interesting subject _ a
well-known, instant brand that a dot-com was going to leverage. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't until after I wrote the article that I considered
what it might be like to work there. What it might be like to get
to do something meaningful and stop writing about the technology
business and rich people.''
</P>
<P>
   At Drspock.com, she said, ``We're taking a book and making it
into a kind of living encyclopedia. We have an opportunity to
influence the way people approach parenting, and one of my goals is
to make sure that all kinds of families are included in the
dialogue. I think it's an interesting project. There are a lot of
personal reasons that this particular startup appealed to me. The
money was one small reason.''

 VIDEO EDITING ISN'T A QUICK JOB  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``Desktop movies _ now premiering at an iMac
near you,'' proclaim the Apple ads.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the idea of using a desktop computer for video editing
_ capturing raw footage from a camcorder, VCR or TV, then
reorganizing it, adding special effects and putting out a finished
movie _ is neither new nor limited to the iMac.
</P>
<P>
   Apple itself has marketed video-ready Macs off and on since
1993, and a slew of PC add-ons have offered similar capabilities
for Windows users for at least as long.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Apple's video-capable iMacs, you don't need a
fancy new digital camcorder to turn your PC into an editing
station. Most of the PC products (as well as similar products for
older Macs) are designed to work with ordinary analog-format video
cameras, which still dominate the U.S. market, and with
conventional VCRs and televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the digital technology Apple is pushing has very real
advantages, including higher quality and faster transfers between
the video device and the computer. But you can get those benefits,
too, on a Windows PC, if you're so inclined.
</P>
<P>
   Among the dozens of video capture-and-edit packages for the PC,
I selected three that seemed particularly promising for review. All
are powerful enough to create high-quality finished videos, yet
they cost less than $300 and they're all designed for ordinary,
nonexpert users.
</P>
<P>
   Matrox Marvel G400-TV
</P>
<P>
   The first of the products I tried, Matrox Graphics' Marvel
G400-TV, is an example of what might be called a multifunction
graphics card: It serves as a standard display card for your
monitor, while also providing additional features such as video-in
and -out ports _ without taking up extra slots inside your PC.
</P>
<P>
   Like its competitors in this category _ ATI Technology's
All-in-Wonder 128 ($199 and up) and 3dfx's Voodoo3 3500 TV ($249
list) _ the G400-TV includes everything but the kitchen sink when
it comes to graphics: fast 2-D and 3-D acceleration, DVD player
software, and a TV tuner through which you can record your favorite
shows.
</P>
<P>
   The G400, which requires an AGP slot, also offers an unusual
feature Matrox calls Dual-Head Display, which lets you use a TV or
analog flat-panel LCD as a second display alongside your regular
monitor. You can use the extra screen space in any application to
keep more data, palettes and controls in sight simultaneously. It's
especially handy for video work.
</P>
<P>
   The card comes with an external ``break-out box,'' which
provides a convenient way to connect audio, video (composite or
S-video) and cable TV without having to crawl around behind your
PC.
</P>
<P>
   No PC today, at least without expensive special equipment, can
handle the huge volume of data video generates, so all mainstream
video-capture products use one or another form of compression.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the G400, it's Motion JPEG. The results aren't
quite up to broadcast or DVD standards, but to me, the quality
seemed perfectly adequate, both on the computer screen and when
written back to tape, at the default compression level.
</P>
<P>
   Matrox bundles several video applications and utilities with the
card, but the main capturing and editing tool is a program called
Avid Cinema. While Avid is best known for its professional editing
systems, this program (originally developed in collaboration with
Apple) was designed with novices in mind.
</P>
<P>
   It starts by offering you a choice among a dozen templates, or
preplanned sequences, for subjects from ``My Summer Vacation'' to
``Sales Training.'' Then you go to Storyboard mode, where you're
encouraged to flesh out the template or develop your own
shot-by-shot plan before you begin editing.
</P>
<P>
   The program then leads you step-by-step through the process of
capturing and editing your video. It makes it easy to arrange and
trim your clips, superimpose titles and captions (stationary or
scrolling), add music or narration, and choose among scores of
special effects for transitions between scenes, from ``barnyard''
to zig-zag.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I found quite a few problems mixed with the
program's virtues. First, there's no printed or even electronic
manual. An animated guided tour serves as a partial substitute, but
just when it got to editing it produced a dialog box reporting
``Script error: Cannot divide by zero'' and couldn't continue.
</P>
<P>
   While digitizing footage from my video camera, the program
repeatedly encountered errors that forced it to stop recording. It
uses QuickTime, Apple's cross-platform multimedia technology, but
requires Version 3 and isn't compatible with the current release,
Version 4.0.1. If you want to use the newer version with other
programs, you're forced into a constant shuffle of tedious
reinstallations.
</P>
<P>
   These are the sorts of glitches you might expect in a 1.0
release, which is exactly what the Matrox version of Avid Cinema
is. In this case, however, the program isn't about to get fixed:
Avid abandoned it last year. (There is actually a 1.5 version,
which fixes the QuickTime problem among others, but it's not
available for owners of the Matrox version.)
</P>
<P>
   The G400-TV is indisputably a graphics powerhouse, but features
alone don't compensate for problems like these. For nearly $300,
customers deserve better.
</P>
<P>
   Pinnacle Studio DC10 plus
</P>
<P>
   I had better luck with Pinnacle Systems' Studio DC10 plus, a PCI
card whose price has recently dropped to a suggested $149.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the Matrox Marvel, the DC10 plus is a one-trick
pony: It doesn't replace a standard display card, nor does it
include TV and DVD features; its sole function is digitizing video
and helping you edit it.
</P>
<P>
   Because Pinnacle develops its own software, it's fully supported
and much more cohesive than the Matrox mishmash. It lacks the
novice-oriented features of Avid Cinema, but it does come with a
comprehensive printed manual.
</P>
<P>
   And it incorporates a terrific feature Avid lacks: Using an
algorithm that studies composition, color and other variables, the
program automatically detects scene changes and on that basis
divides captured footage into a series of smaller clips, each
represented on-screen by a thumbnail image of its opening frame.
For novices, starting with a series of small clips that can be
easily manipulated is a whole lot less intimidating than facing one
long, undifferentiated sequence.
</P>
<P>
   In other respects, the Studio DC10 plus application works
similarly to Avid Cinema. Incoming video is compressed in Motion
JPEG format as it's digitized. To edit your footage, you drag
around the thumbnails, then add titles, sound and special effects.
Built into the program is a library of more than 130 wipes and
dissolves for scene transitions, a collection of canned sounds, and
a title generator that makes it easy to add TV-style flying credits
and other fancy touches.
</P>
<P>
   When you're satisfied with your work _ or just tired of it _ you
switch to Make Movie mode. If you choose to produce a videotape,
rendering takes a long time (as with Avid Cinema or any other
product). Alternatively, you can leave the film in Pinnacle's own
compact digital format and play it on a TV or video monitor
connected to the DC10 plus card, or output an AVI file that can be
played on any PC.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, I was delighted with how well the Studio DC10 plus
worked, especially considering its very reasonable price. The only
real catch: You need a free PCI slot for it, and you have to open
your PC to install it or find someone else to do that for you.
</P>
<P>
   Pinnacle Studio DV
</P>
<P>
   The basis for Apple's ``desktop movies'' marketing campaign is
FireWire, a high-speed digital data transfer technology originally
developed at Apple and then adopted by virtually all manufacturers
of digital camcorders as their standard for connecting to
computers.
</P>
<P>
   FireWire ports are built into the iMac DV series as well as
Apple's business-oriented products, the Power Mac G4 and the latest
PowerBook. Having this technology designed into hardware and the
operating system from the ground up gives Apple a big advantage in
digital video.
</P>
<P>
   But by no means does it have a monopoly on the technology.
Compaq, Gateway and Sony offer Windows desktops and notebooks that
also have it built in, although they call it by different names _
i.Link in Sony's case, and IEEE 1394 (the technical name for the
industry standard built around the Apple technology) in others.
Most of these come with bundled video-editing software.
</P>
<P>
   You can also add 1394 ports to a standard PC that didn't have
the technology built in at the factory. Provided that you're
running Windows 98 (Second Edition strongly recommended), all you
have to do is find a free PCI slot, install a card and some
software, and you're ready to connect to a digital camcorder.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies now offer such cards at street prices under
$100, with video-editing software included. Being so pleased with
Pinnacle's consumer-level analog-video product, I opted to test its
digital cousin, Studio DV ($149 list, as little as $80.95 online).
</P>
<P>
   The card provides three FireWire ports through which you can
bring in footage from MiniDV- and Digital8-format camcorders. (For
my testing, I used a Sony DCR-PC1 Handycam.)
</P>
<P>
   The downside of digital video's high quality is that it takes an
enormous amount of disk space when you move it to your hard drive.
Even though all DV footage is automatically compressed at a 5-1
ratio, it still fills 3.6 megabytes per  &LR; second &LR; , or almost a
quarter of a gigabyte per  &LR; minute &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Since even today's humongous hard drives fill up pretty quickly
at that rate, Studio DV lets you import and edit your footage in a
preview mode that requires only 150 to 300 megabytes of space per
 &LR; hour &LR; , depending on your quality settings. When you're done
editing, the program does have to import all the footage you've
decided to include in your finished film at full DV size, but the
preview mode at least saves you from wasting disk space on material
you don't want.
</P>
<P>
   Studio DV's editing features are similar to those of the analog
DC10 plus. Unlike that product and the Matrox Marvel, however, the
DV card doesn't have a video-out port for a TV or VCR. Instead, it
writes your edited film back to your camcorder. That's not a real
problem, though, because most digital camcorders have a video-out
port built in, so you just connect that to your display or VCR.
</P>
<P>
   If you choose to save your movie as a computer file, Studio DV
lets you choose between AVI, MPEG and RealVideo formats.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't test all these options, but everything I tested worked
well. In fact, though I like the iMovie application Apple bundles
with its FireWire-equipped iMacs, I liked Studio DV even better:
Its scene-detection feature worked better, and its preview mode
eases the pressure on your disk capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Closing Thoughts
</P>
<P>
   Whatever product you choose, whether analog or digital, video
editing places heavy demands on your hardware. You'll want a system
with the fastest processor and the largest, fastest hard drives you
can swing.
</P>
<P>
   You'll also need time and patience. You can flip through a roll
of still snapshots in a minute, but simply reviewing a half hour of
video takes a half hour _ even before you start your digitizing,
reorganizing, adding special effects and all the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that cost, you may not want to bother for every home
video _ I certainly don't. But for special occasions, and for
anyone who simply enjoys moviemaking for its own sake, it's nice to
know that you can now turn an ordinary PC into an amazingly
powerful editing station _ without even spending a fortune on it.

SPORTS COLUMN: EWING'S PLAY WON`T PASS UNNOTICED 
</HEADLINE>
   By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hello to you, too, Jeff Van Gundy. We, the people,
the true Knicks fans, know all too well that your team was 8-3 with
Patrick Ewing in the playoffs last season, and 4-5 without him. We
know we can't win the championship without him. Know what, Coach?
We like what we saw on Wednesday night better. We loved the sight
of Latrell Sprewell on the left side of the basket, sizing up Vince
Carter, readying his game-winning drive and jumper in the lane,
while not a groan could be heard in the house.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing personal. Good for you for defending your big fella. We,
too, respect his work ethic, his unshakable faith in himself. We
sure appreciated his 19 points and 9 rebounds in Wednesday night's
84-83 Game 2 victory, and the way he charged out of the lane with
7-feet worth of wingspan as Dee Brown clanged Toronto's last hope
off the back rim.
</P>
<P>
   We're still going to whine when he gets the ball in the post
during future tension-filled moments, and starts doing his
backing-in thing.
</P>
<P>
   It's an old habit, difficult to explain, harder to break. We are
New Yorkers and Knicks fans, cynical by nature and conditioned by
26 years of not winning the really big one. We have been fired up
so many times only to have our pilot lights blown out by events
unforeseen. When the ball goes inside and there is just too much
time to contemplate the failures of yore, the only viable
alternative to groaning is to not breathe at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other guys can miss and it's not the same reaction,'' Van
Gundy said before the Knicks took command of the first-round
series. ``There's something there, but I don't what it's all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Come on, Coach. We're smart enough to know Ewing isn't the
reason we are title-less, at least not directly. He is just the
window through which we see Charles Smith under the basket
surrounded by the Chicago skyline, and John Starks misfiring in the
fourth quarter in Houston, and Reggie Miller loading up in front of
Spike Lee.
</P>
<P>
   When Ewing gets the ball in the scary moments, we momentarily
have to forget we are looking at a certified Hall of Famer, one of
the greats. We can't help but see the silhouette of his
contemporaries who just happened to be greater. From Magic to Larry
to Hakeem to Michael to Tim Duncan, we have conceded too often that
it is some other star's turn.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, it is obviously not yet Vince Carter's. It is
supposed to be Shaquille O'Neal's. So yes, until Ewing wins, we
will groan. And then we will stand up and cheer like crazy people
if he happens to win his ring.
</P>
<P>
   Fickle? That's one way of looking at this love-hate
relationship, this complex affair. But that would be the wrong way.
Consider our groaning to be more of a greeting. Hello, Patrick. We,
the people, are still out here, still snatching up every ticket at
grossly inflated prices, still waiting, still with ya. Even if we
have to remind you now and then that we have much more confidence
in Sprewell and Allan Houston.
</P>
<P>
   No offense. We just prefer the new script after witnessing the
horribly timed torn Achilles' tendon, the coming and going of the
Bulls and every other act of finger-rolling fate that's conspired
against you, and us.
</P>
<P>
   If the rest of the playoffs are anything like these first two
games, hang in there, bear with us, it's going to be as tense, as
dicey, as that timeout Wednesday night with 54.8 seconds left and
the Raptors clinging to an 83-80 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing held Vince Carter flashing across the middle, without the
ball, putting him on the line. One of the faithful behind the bench
yelled in your face: ``Come on, Patrick. Use your brain. He wasn't
even in the play.''
</P>
<P>
   This was not what Ewing wanted to hear from the people who don't
appreciate him enough. Much more colorfully, he suggested the
paying customer sit down and mind his own business.
</P>
<P>
   Well, everything turned out fine, as Van Gundy made the wise
calls down the stretch, letting Sprewell and Houston take the game
from Carter and Tracy McGrady, who are long on talent and woefully
short on shot selection.
</P>
<P>
   Knicks fans could enjoy the 2-0 lead, and three days off to
dream about eventually turning the tables on Shaq and the Lakers,
who put the Knicks away like a folding chair, much like Toronto,
during the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   After 26 years, after 15 with Ewing, we are used to fantasy
ultimately being rejected by fate. We are entitled to worry that
this is not going to turn out like Wednesday night, especially when
Ewing gets the late call. Hello, Coach. Stop worrying that our
groaning ``takes away'' from your home-court advantage. Hello,
Coach. Just keep giving the ball to Sprewell and Houston at the
end.

CASHING IN AN OVERDUE RAIN CHECK

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
(PHOENIX) - Writer's note: Most of what follows was written on
March 6, a Monday, when the high tem perature was 52 degrees and we
got 1.53 inches of rain. The column was stored in the computer ice
chest and not published because there was other news to write about
that day. Besides, I figured it would be best to serve it up, like
a frosty beverage, on our first 100-degree day. Before you
continue, remember, in order to prevent brain freeze, take small
sips:
<TEXT>
<P>
   A woman called this morn ing to say she was worried about the
homeless out in the rain and cold. A lobbyist called to say she was
worried about a bill at the Legislature. A reader called to say he
was worried about his sanity. ``I agreed with you last week for the
first time ever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There was unopened mail on the desk, unread e-mail on the
computer screen, and it was the day before Super Tuesday. After
sifting through all the potential stories, weighing each against
the next, I did the only logical thing a longtime Arizona re porter
could do:
</P>
<P>
   I went to the zoo.
</P>
<P>
   I had no choice. It was raining. It wasn't one of those
late-summer thunderstorms that come boiling up from the south, then
barrel into town, muscles flexed.
</P>
<P>
   It was just rain.
</P>
<P>
   Gray skies. Cold damp air. The kind of weather that tasted
horrible to you as a kid, like wine, but tastes glo rious to you
now, like wine.
</P>
<P>
   It was our second day of rain, and even better than the first.
Colder, more gray and constant.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, fallen leaves stuck like postage stamps to the tops of
automobiles and the bottoms of shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Children walking to school reached out from under their
umbrellas to catch raindrops in the palms of their hands, then lick
them off.
</P>
<P>
   On a normal day in March, the Phoenix Zoo would be filled with
tourists _ 3,000 or so, I was told _ but not this day. The man
taking tickets at the main entrance said he'd counted 14 patrons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the animals are staying inside,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An Indian elephant stood in the doorway of her barnlike
residence, shifting her weight back and forth and gently shaking
her head, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the alligators rose from the depths of their muddy pond,
choosing to watch the dance of raindrops on the water's surface
from below.
</P>
<P>
   An Aldabra tortoise was outside, but tucked into its shell and
blending into the landscape like a slick boulder.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a day to see the animals. It was a day to see the zoo,
the grounds painted in dark colors by the rain.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a day to see downtown Phoenix, chilled and looking _
as it does only in the rain _ like a real downtown.
</P>
<P>
   And a day to study the city from the overlooks on South Mountain
Park, where the parking lot was empty except for my pickup.
</P>
<P>
   By noon, the full weight of the moist air fell like gauze over
town, obscuring the view, making it magical.
</P>
<P>
   Not in the way tourists find the desert magical, but in a way
that only people who have been here for a long time can appreciate.
Vaca tioners come to Phoenix ex pecting the typical day to be sunny
and warm. We live with the knowledge that just about every day is
sunny and warm. But the rest are even better.
</P>
<P>
   Like Monday, March 6, a typically beautiful day in the desert,
only more so. &QL;

BRIGHT, SLICK LABAUVE A STAR ON CYCLING HORIZON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRISCO, Texas _ We have seen the future of American sprint
cycling _ and it just shaved its hair off.
</P>
<P>
   Serious times call for serious haircuts. And Jeff Labauve, the
slick new hope on the U.S. track cycling scene, knows that the
Sydney Olympics are no longer just a dream on a distant calendar.
</P>
<P>
   His specialty, for now, is called the Olympic Sprint, a new
event on the Sydney card. Three cyclists from the same team circle
the track, racing against time. Each must lead for one lap and then
pull off the track.
</P>
<P>
   The premium is on teamwork and speed, and Labauve is all about
the latter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he rode a personal best this morning,'' Des Dickie,
coach of the American sprint team, said after yesterday's session
of the U.S. Olympic Trials for Track Cycling. ``But Jeff has been
doing that all week.''
</P>
<P>
   The country's two reigning Olympic track medalists, Marty
Nothstein and Erin Hartwell, can't sprint forever. Hartwell, a
medal winner both in Barcelona and Atlanta in the kilometer time
trial, has already bowed to injuries and seeks to remake himself in
the 4,000-meter individual pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   Labauve, on the other hand, is only 21 and, Dickie said, ``He
has just continued to improve all year, from the first camp we had
in December.''
</P>
<P>
   Though his threesome did not make the Olympic Sprint finals last
night, Labauve and his new haircut took them around the track in
18.34 seconds, the fastest opening lap of the session. Dickie was
more than pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a bright spot,'' said the coach, who could well team
Labauve, Nothstein and a third sprinter for the event in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, however, Labauve wasn't even a blip. He was
12-years-old when he started riding on the roads and levees around
his hometown of Metairie, La. And he was 15 when he first climbed
aboard a bike on a velodrome track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared out of my mind,'' Labauve said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I got over the fear of the 33-degree banking _ which is
nothing now _ I loved it. It was like a big roller coaster.''
</P>
<P>
   His cycling friends who watched him on that first track in Baton
Rouge, La., knew that young Labauve was on to something.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all pretty much in agreement that I was a talent,''
he recalled. ``They just didn't know what to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   So he trained himself. Made up his own schedule. Clocked his own
times.
</P>
<P>
   He showed up _ this kid from cycling Neverland _ at the 1997
Junior National Track Cycling Championships and qualified first in
the 200-meter sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just stronger than everybody else,'' Labauve reasoned.
``But when I got in there with the elite riders and we raced, I got
killed because I didn't know how to race.''
</P>
<P>
   Labauve's fourth-place finish, however, plus a third in the
kilometer time trial, had caught the eye of U.S. coaches. They
invited him in 1998 to a monthlong camp in the track cycling mecca
of Trexlertown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Frisco one month later for his first senior national
championships and finished fourth in the sprint and fifth in the
Olympic Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably my breakthrough,'' Labauve said.
</P>
<P>
   He was awarded a cycling scholarship to Collin County Community
College, home of the Superdrome, and moved to Frisco.
</P>
<P>
   The star was born. In 1999, the kid from Louisiana raced in
World Cup events in Spain and Italy. At the Open des Nations in
France, he raced in front of 10,000 Parisians chanting, ``U-S-A!
U-S-A!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like that,'' Labauve said, ``make me want to do this
sport.''
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet, 2 inches, and 210 pounds, Labauve is built like a
younger Nothstein. In the weight room, he squat-lifts 420 pounds
and clean-and-jerks 260 _ no one on the track does more, the
coaches say.
</P>
<P>
   As the resident hero at the Superdrome, Labauve's face adorns
the Olympic trials' souvenir poster. With Dickie, the national
sprint coach, now guiding his training program, Labauve has a firm
idea what the U.S. program's plans are for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we're planning on the Olympics this year,'' Labauve said.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate his commitment, he arrived at the starting line
yesterday sporting a menacing goatee and a no-nonsense shaved head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what I saw today,'' said Dickie, who meant the lap
time, presumably.
</P>
<P>
   It was the look of the future.
</P>
<P>
   Bright and slick.

 MACS BENEFIT FROM ADD-ONS  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Although Apple Computer has made ``desktop
movies'' the center of its marketing efforts this year, even Mac
owners are likely to have to add extra hardware or software before
their machines are ready for video-editing duty.
</P>
<P>
   IMac DV models (the ones now priced at $1,299 and $1,499) have
FireWire ports for connecting to digital camcorders, and they come
with an easy-to-use video capture and editing program called
iMovie. But they have no built-in capability to handle video from
analog sources such as TVs, VCRs and the vast majority of
camcorders in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Power Mac G4 models (like the blue-and-white G3 models) and the
latest PowerBook also have FireWire ports, but Apple chose not to
include editing software with those models and they too are
unprepared for analog video. If you have an older Mac, unless it's
one of Apple's old AV models or you've already added a card, you're
at square one.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, reasonably priced third-party products can fill
these gaps, even though the selection isn't as wide as Windows
users enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   If you already have FireWire ports and a digital camcorder,
Apple won't, at least for now, give or even sell you a copy of
iMovie, but a company called Digital Origin (a descendant of the
old Radius) offers a software-only package called EditDV Unplugged
for $149. The company also offers a free online DV primer
( &LR; www.digitalorigin.com/learn/default.html &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   If you're interested in professional-level applications, and you
can afford their hefty prices, Adobe's Premiere ($599) can handle
digital video, as can Apple's own Final Cut Pro ($999). At the
other extreme, there are several shareware capture and editing
programs and even a free, unsupported Apple program called HackTV
(see links at  &LR; www.macintouch.com/firewire.htmledit &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   If your Mac doesn't have FireWire ports but does have a free PCI
slot, several companies, including Adaptec, Orange Micro and
PowerLogix, sell cards that add FireWire ports. Macally, Newer
Technology and VST Technology also offer FireWire PC cards for
recent PowerBooks.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a Mac (old or new) with PCI slots and you're
interested in capturing video from analog sources, the best bet I
know of is ATI Technologies' Xclaim VR 128 card ($229 and up),
which offers QuickTime-based video editing along with fast 2-D and
3-D graphics and a TV tuner.
</P>
<P>
   An alternative for users who have FireWire ports: Sony's Media
Converter DVMC-DA1, a $399 external box, and a new model called the
DVMC-DA2 convert analog video to DV form and transfer it via 1394
( &LR; www.macintouch.com/dvmc.html &LR; ). Sony Digital8 camcorders have
similar conversion capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a Mac with USB ports but no PCI slots _ a non-DV
iMac, for example _ you can use a USB capture device for analog
video. Options include Ariston's iView ($119.95), Eskape Labs'
MyCapture II ($129.99) and XLR8's Interview ($79).

 EDITING OUTSIDE THE BOX  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Those who don't have room for a new card in
their PC, or don't want to face installing one, can look to a
variety of external video-capture devices that connect to your PC's
printer port or, in the case of newer products, to a Universal
Serial Bus port.
</P>
<P>
   Such solutions range from Play Inc.'s Snappy Deluxe ($139.95
list), an upgraded version of a classic PC product designed
originally for grabbing single frames from a video source, to
Dazzle Multimedia's $249.99 Digital Video Creator, which is
available with either a parallel-port or USB interface.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, TV-tuner add-ons for PCs, such as Hauppauge's WinTV
series and Pinnacle Systems' PCTV products, can digitize video from
other sources as well as TV.
</P>
<P>
   While all these products have their merits, their video
capabilities are no match for those of dedicated products like
Pinnacle Systems' Studio DC10 plus. Mini-movies made with Snappy
Deluxe 3.0, for example, display only two frames per second. The
Dazzle product is much more capable than that _ it can generate
MPEG-1 clips with 30 frames per second _ but its resolution is
limited to a maximum of 352 by 240 pixels.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine for clips to e-mail to friends or post on your Web
site _ the product even supports the RealVideo streaming format _
but not for output to tape.

 COMPUTING Q&AMP;A: FILE TRANSFER A SAFE BET WITH CD-R  &HT;     By DAVID EINSTEIN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: &LR;  I am considering a desktop PC with a built-in Zip drive. &LR; 
 &LR; However, my office computer doesn't have a Zip drive. A &LR; 
 &LR; salesperson suggested as an alternative a recordable CD drive, &LR; 
 &LR; which would let me create, back up and store files on CDs. That &LR; 
 &LR; way, I could take the CDs to work and access the files. What do &LR; 
 &LR; you think? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A: I think you ran into a salesman who knows what he's talking
about. A recordable CD drive (CD-R for short) is a good idea
because almost every PC can use CDs, while Zip drives are far less
common.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you can cram up to 650 megabytes of information on a CD,
whereas Iomega's Zip drives top out at 250 MB (Iomega also makes a
2-gigabyte Jaz drive, but it's priced at more than $300. For less
than that, you can get a CD-R drive _ and you'll pay even less if
the thing is built into the computer you buy (the Compaq 7588 PC,
with a CD-R drive, can be had for about $1,300).
</P>
<P>
   Blank CDs for recording also are coming down in price _ you can
get them for less than $1 apiece. Expect to pay maybe twice as much
for CD-RW discs (rewriteable disks that you can erase and reuse).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Don't Mix Vendors
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm thinking about getting a new iMac, but I also need a
laptop. Should I stay with Apple products for both, or can a
Windows laptop work just as well with the iMac? Apple Powerbooks
cost more, it seems, than comparable Windows laptops, and
unfortunately, I can't stand the looks of the iBook (Apple's entry
level laptop).
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  A: I'd stick with one or the other. Mixing Apples and
Windows is, well, like apples and oranges. The operating systems
are different, and the file formats are different, so you'll need
to buy both Mac and Windows versions of application programs if you
want them on both computers. (You could use software on the Mac
that emulates Windows, but then what's the point?)
</P>
<P>
   The only situation in which I'd endorse a mix of Mac and Windows
is if the computers don't have to share files. For instance, if you
intend to use the desktop computer mostly for the Internet and the
laptop mostly for work, then you can probably get away with an iMac
and a Windows laptop. Good luck.
</P>
<P>
   AUTOMATIC RESPONSE UPDATE: Last week, I suggested a way in which
DSL and cable users can rig their PCs to send automatic e-mail
responses when they're on vacation. A reader points out that some
ISPs will do this for you. So check with your ISP first. The reader
also noted that in some cases an automatic response may not be wise
for a couple of reasons: 1. it confirms to spammers that they've
found a valid e-mail address; and 2. it lets strangers know that
your house is empty.
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK
</P>
<P>
   Save your work. Often. I can't tell you how many times my
computer has frozen for some weird reason, forcing me to restart
the thing, only to find that I've lost something I'd written but
hadn't bothered to save. If it's too much trouble to click on the
disk icon in the toolbar or go to Save in the File menu, just press
the ``S'' key while holding down the Control key (usually labeled
``Ctrl''). This combination works with almost every Windows
program. An ounce of prevention, as they say.

 CHEVRON'S EARNINGS HIT RECORD  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sky-high oil prices resulted in record quarterly
earnings for San Francisco's Chevron Corp., with the company's
profits rising almost fourfold to more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a good year for Chevron,'' said Matthew
Warburton, an analyst with brokerage Warburg Dillon Read in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   But do not expect Chevron's windfall to result in lower prices
at the pump. The bulk of the company's earnings stemmed from
overseas sales of oil and natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Of the $1.1 billion pocketed in the first three months of the
year, only $55 million came from refining and selling fuel in the
United States, down 43 percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The lower U.S. gas returns reflect costly repairs to Chevron's
Richmond refinery, as well as extensive maintenance at a facility
in Pascagoula, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   For the average consumer, however, it may be hard to accept that
Chevron's bulging pockets are not a direct result of staggeringly
high gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials, apparently sensing a public relations
disaster in the making, were prepared yesterday to explain the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We empathize with the consumer,'' said Dawn Soper Lyon, a
Chevron spokeswoman. ``But the reality is that our record earnings
were dependent almost exclusively on a part of our business that
nobody here in the United States has anything to do with.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that it would not be feasible to apply profits from
overseas sales to reducing prices at U.S. pumps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't look at underwriting one segment of our business with
profits from another,'' Lyon said. ``Prices at the pump are
dictated by the market.''
</P>
<P>
   The market has not been especially friendly in recent months to
U.S. motorists, particularly those in the Bay Area. With oil prices
averaging almost $29 a barrel during the quarter _ more than double
a year ago _ gas prices have soared to record levels.
</P>
<P>
   In its most recent survey of gasoline costs, the state chapter
of the American Automobile Association found that San Francisco
motorists are paying an average $1.92 for a gallon of self-service
unleaded gas.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers in San Jose are paying $1.85, while those in Oakland are
paying $1.86 and in Santa Rosa $1.78.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Fortier, an energy-industry analyst with Olde Discount
Corp. in Detroit, said Chevron and other oil companies cannot
really be held accountable for high gas prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to blame anyone, blame OPEC,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   By limiting production in the first quarter, oil-producing
nations managed to drive crude oil prices as high as $34 a barrel.
Most analysts expect that figure to stay around $25 as production
increases over coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   This will result in lower profits for Chevron, but analysts
expect the company will continue having a banner year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their profits will remain very strong,'' said Eugene Nowak, an
analyst with brokerage ABN AMRO in New York. ``They've done a great
job with production around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of steady production and high crude oil costs
meant that Chevron was able to report first-quarter profit of $1.68
a share _ way up from 43 cents a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Such returns helped the company's stock resist an otherwise
gloomy day for financial markets. Chevron's share price rose $1.50
yesterday to close at $86.31.
</P>
<P>
   The company earned $653 million from finding and selling crude
oil overseas in the first quarter. It earned $365 million within
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Chevron plans to apply a portion of its quarterly winnings to
repurchasing its own stock _ a move intended to boost the share
price.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a public company, we have a responsibility to maximize
returns for shareholders,'' Lyon said.

 BAY VIEW BANK'S NO. 2 EXECUTIVE RESIGNS  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The No. 2 executive of Bay View Bank has
resigned, a move analysts said signals strategic trouble at the San
Mateo institution.
</P>
<P>
   David Heaberlin, president of the bank and executive vice
president of its parent company, Bay View Capital, announced his
departure late Tuesday, a week after the company reported
disappointing first-quarter earnings. The resignation takes effect
June 30 and no replacement has been announced.
</P>
<P>
   Bay View, with 58 branches and $6.4 billion in assets, is one of
the largest banks headquartered in the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   The bank gave no reason for the move and Heaberlin did not
return a call seeking comment. But analysts said they suspected the
50-year-old executive is leaving because the aggressive expansion
program he sponsored has lately gone awry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They went on an acquisition binge and it wasn't working,''
said Sutro &AMP; Co. analyst Campbell Chaney. ``Heaberlin was the fall
guy.``
</P>
<P>
   Bay View Chief Executive Officer Edward Sondker said the reasons
for Heaberlin's departure are confidential, but he emphatically
denied Heaberlin had been forced out. ``When (we're) getting beat
up, I'm the one who is accountable for that,'' Sondker said.
</P>
<P>
   With Heaberlin going, analysts said they expect Bay View's board
to give Sondker time to fix the bank's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Sondker and Heaberlin, both longtime financial services
executives, came to Bay View in 1995 when shareholders were
clamoring for a turnaround at the then-underperforming thrift.
</P>
<P>
   To rev up profits, the two decided to jettison Bay View's
low-margin mortgage business and concentrate on more lucrative
types of loans. Among other purchases, the thrift bought a
commercial finance and an auto loan company.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bay View built up its deposit franchise by buying
Foster City's EurekaBank in 1997. Two years later, signifying its
shift away from home loans, it converted from a thrift to a bank.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Bay View's purchases made money. But signs of trouble
emerged in 1998 when Bay View tried to buy a company that
specialized in high-risk loans to homeowners. The deal fell apart
when federal regulators proposed strict limits on the proportion of
such loans a thrift could hold.
</P>
<P>
   Investors ``were very nervous about that foray,'' said
PaineWebber analyst Gary Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in a deal analysts say Heaberlin pushed, Bay View
bought Franchise Mortgage Acceptance, which specialized in lending
money to buyers of chain restaurants and gas stations.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the purchase depended on Bay View's ability to
package the loans for sale to institutional investors. But the
institutional loan market has dried up in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Bay View's failure to sell off its franchise loans pushed net
income down to $500,000 in the first quarter, far below Wall
Street's expectations and down 90 percent from the same period in
1999. The bank's stock, meanwhile, has plunged to $7, far below its
1998 high of $38.25.
</P>
<P>
   Bay View's shares were the victim of rising interest rates and
investor distaste for small banks, Sondker said. But, he admitted,
the bank's first-quarter performance was ``ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got to get better performance or something has to
change,'' Sondker said. He predicted the bank's results will
improve once it finds a way to sell off its franchise loans.

GARDEN NO KINGDOM FOR VINCE THE PRINCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All he needed was one stop. He could poke the ball
away, block the shot, knock it off Latrell Sprewell's leg,
anything. One stop, and Vince Carter could vanquish this two-game
nightmare at Madison Square Garden, quiet the people who jeered
him, put an end to the perception he's not quite ready.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, the incomparable forward of the Toronto Raptors, had
helped the Knicks with their comeback, taking an off-balance jump
shot that missed with 9 seconds left on the shot clock and more
than 25 seconds left in the game.
</P>
<P>
   He also had five fouls, so now he could not play Sprewell as
aggressively as he wanted.
</P>
<P>
   But if he could just get a hand on the ball, everything would be
all right. That's what he was thinking as Sprewell released a
pretty jump shot over Carter's outstretched left arm with 7 seconds
left, a shot that gave the Knicks their first lead since the early
moments of the game and all but sealed Carter's inhospitable
welcome to a Madison Square Garden postseason.
</P>
<P>
   He passed up a shot at the top of the 3-point arc on Toronto's
last possession, giving it up to Dee Brown for a potential
game-winning 3-pointer. Brown missed, and Carter fell backward,
holding his hands to his head as if Toronto's season had come to an
unofficial end.
</P>
<P>
   He had heard the Game 1 jeers on Sunday, the cracks, the futile
attempts at humor. Carter especially heard the dozen or so Knick
zealots under the basket, derisively serenading him as he stepped
to the free-throw line in the final minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vi-ince! Vi-ince!''
</P>
<P>
   Everything he did, they mocked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something you see on TV and then you're a part of it,''
he said. ``I didn't really notice it until a little later in the
game. And then I was like, `Whoa.'''
</P>
<P>
   Two-0. Whoa.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto did not lose because of Carter. At times, he was
awesome. In the final minutes, he dropped in an impossible runner
with the shot clock about to expire. He rejected a Larry Johnson
layup and retrieved the ball. He penetrated and found Muggsy Bogues
for a critical late 3-pointer. And he made two clutch free throws
with 54.8 seconds left to keep the Raptors ahead by 3 points.
</P>
<P>
   He finished with 27 points and passed to the open man when
double-teamed. He did everything an All-Star should, except win.
Gone was the 3-for-20 showing on Sunday, the forced shots and the
ill-advised passes into traffic. But the noise was still there, the
throaty roar of the Garden, unleashed on another young superstar
trying to undo the home team.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Carter was awed by the way the crowd treated him like a
regular villain, as if he were Reggie or Michael or Scottie, or
some other despised opponent who had gunned down the Knicks with a
raised, clenched fist.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of him was wondering where all those appreciative
souls were from the regular season, the people who applauded his
30-plus-points nights and gasped at his breathtaking dunks.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Michelle Carter-Robinson, felt her son was disturbed
enough by his Game 1 showing that she made sure she sent him an
encouraging note to his hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew I was getting down on myself and thinking about it
too much,'' he said. ``It was just a nice reminder. You know when
everybody else in the world is against you, at least Mom is on your
side.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter shuffled his feet and smiled, showing his fallible side
like few players of his stature. He did not put his eye contacts
in, instead wearing wire-rimmed spectacles to the morning practice
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Looking more professorial than superhuman, the future of the
Toronto Raptors and the National Basketball Association took an
assortment of wild, off-kilter shots after practice ended, the kind
you want to get out of your system before the game begins.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he stood 10 rows back across from the Knicks
bench, throwing up a prayer from about 50 feet. It never touched
the rim, but he enjoyed merely seeing it come close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know about the history of the building and the Knicks,'' he
said. ``When you step in here, that's the first thing you think
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Van Gundy, who once labeled Jordan ``a con man,'' cannot
think of a disparaging thing to say about Carter. He was flattered
when the All-Star forward brought Van Gundy, the East coach, over
to meet his parents at the midseason event in February.
</P>
<P>
   Carter did not make excuses for his poor performance on Sunday.
Instead, he paid Latrell Sprewell numerous compliments after
Sprewell shadowed him in Game 1. Carter does not say, ``I hate the
Knicks,'' like Tim Hardaway did two years ago or refer to them as
``mental midgets'' as Scottie Pippen did in 1997 after several
players left the bench against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Gracious, genuine, unbelievably talented, this is your new
archenemy, New York _ the guy who went out of his way on Wednesdayy
to compliment the staff of the team hotel for its courtesy and
professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   He would be so much easier to detest if he scowled like Alonzo
Mourning or shimmied like Mark Jackson or did something uniquely
annoying, like file suit against Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we get Vince the Prince, the player with notes from his
mother next to his pillow.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Carter is expecting charity. He understands the
dynamics of playing on the road in the NBA; most of the time, he
relishes it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what basketball is all about,'' he said. ``Having the
home crowd yell against you and it gets all loud and everything. I
enjoy that. I love that. You couldn't tell it last game, but I
think that's the beauty of the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors started much faster on Wednesday night than in Game
1, going up 26-15 in the first quarter. Carter turned the ball over
the first time he touched the ball, but made his next two shots and
seemed to settle down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind,'' he had said of the Garden crowd getting on
him. ``I didn't really get to play here in college or in high
school. When I got the chance to play here, I enjoyed it. It's a
nice place to play. The history makes it so different.''
</P>
<P>
   Now if he could just make fun of the home team, curse or commit
a flagrant foul, he might deserve the villainous treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there he lay, his hands on his head, at the top of the
arc, wondering when, or if, his Garden nightmare will ever end. &QL;

GIULIANI IS TESTED FOR PROSTATE CANCER

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani underwent tests for prostate
cancer during a three-hour unannounced visit to Mount Sinai Medical
Center hospital on Wednesday morning, officials familiar with
Giuliani's schedule said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's advisers declined on Wednesday night to discuss the
reason for the visit, or the outcome of the tests. A spokesman at
Mount Sinai also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   However, a friend of Giuliani said the test was for prostate
cancer, and described it as more than a routine screening.
</P>
<P>
   The cable channel New York One reported on Wednesday night that
Giuliani, who is 55, had gone last week for a routine prostate
cancer screening, and had asked to return for a second round of
testing because of an anomaly discovered in the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's father, Harold, suffered from prostate cancer, which
led to his death in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has publicly counseled middle-aged men to undergo
annual visits for the exam.

TOWN HALL MEETING PRODUCES FAMILIAR QUESTIONS FOR MRS. CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN P. HICKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, N.Y. _ Answering questions on topics ranging from
economic growth and agriculture to health care and the fate of
Elian Gonzalez, Hillary Rodham Clinton held the first of a series
of town hall meetings on Wednesday night that her aides said would
be a new way of bringing her campaign directly to New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing relaxed, with her hands frequently clasped in front of
her, Clinton stood to respond to questions from an audience of 350
students, faculty members and residents at the State University of
New York at Buffalo. The first hour was broadcast live on CNN, but
she continued to take questions for 40 more minutes.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, she offered responses that have become part
of the stock of her campaign appearances. At the outset, for
example, Clinton faced the question that has been frequently
raised, when Wolf Blitzer, the program's moderator, asked her to
respond to criticisms that she was a carpetbagger.
</P>
<P>
   ``For more than 30 years, I've worked on issues concerning
children and families,'' Clinton said. ``Those are the concerns of
my lifetime. As I've visited with thousands of New Yorkers, those
are their concerns. To me, it's a commitment to continue a life's
work.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said that, if she won the Senate race, she would not
run for president in 2004 and that, if she lost, she would continue
to make New York her home. Some conservative groups and her
Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York City, have
said that Clinton is using the Senate campaign as a stepping stone
to be president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am going to serve my six-year term as senator,'' she said.
``I owe it to the people of New York. I want to help make things
happen in the state. That's what motivates me.''
</P>
<P>
   In many instances during questioning, Clinton was able to
showcase her growing knowledge of the state's characteristics,
rattling off, for example, the names of highways or companies in
western New York.
</P>
<P>
   She repeated her proposal to make the cost of college tuition
tax deductible up to $10,000 and reiterated her support for
creating a national program that would offer scholarships for
students who agreed to teach upon graduation in schools facing a
shortage of teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether her views had changed from her first years in the
White House, when she championed a health care plan that critics
called nationalized medicine, she said she had learned from those
days, ``and I'm now from the school of smaller steps.''
</P>
<P>
   She then listed several measures she favored, including
prescription drug coverage for Medicare recipients and having more
children and more of the underinsured covered by health care plans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton reiterated her support for abortion rights, but also
said she could support legislation backed by President Clinton that
would outlaw a procedure that critics call partial-birth abortion,
except in cases where the woman's health or life was at stake. She
said that congressional Republicans have refused to let that
legislation come up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   She also reiterated her support for Attorney General Janet
Reno's decision to use armed law enforcement officers to enter the
home of Elian Gonzalez. Clinton said, ``I think everyone would
agree that it was unfortunate that that kind of activity had to
take place.'' But then she added, ``I understand the concern and
the frustration of the Justice Department when faced with
continuing recalcitrance.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has repeatedly criticized the Clinton administration
this week for its handling of the situation, calling the agents who
took the boy from his relatives' home last Saturday ``storm
troopers.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the meeting began, Giuliani's aides were attacking
it, asserting that the crowd and questions had been fixed to spare
Clinton from any difficult moments, pointing to an article in The
Buffalo News that suggested the event had been carefully
controlled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her whole campaign is so heavily scripted and staged that Mrs.
Clinton's handlers must be confident that tonight's event is
safe,'' said Bruce J. Teitelbaum, Giuliani's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   But Blitzer said in an interview before the show that Clinton
had not requested, and CNN would not have permitted her to have,
any control over what questions would be asked or who would be
admitted to the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Blitzer said that CNN reviewed questions from audience members
only to ensure variety and to avoid repetition, and screened the
audience to make certain that it included only registered voters
who lived in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton has no ideas what the questions are,'' Blitzer
said. ``She has had no role in this whatsoever.''

   FONTANA, Calif. _ Dale Jarrett is hoping for a little deja vu
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The NASCAR veteran used a strong showing at last year's
California 500 to spark his march to the Winston Cup championship.
Jarrett, who is currently seventh in points, wouldn't mind a
similar scenario when qualifying for Sunday's NAPA Auto Parts 500
begins Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's activities, which include the Busch Grand National
Auto Club 300 and the Winston West Pontiac WideTrack Grand Prix 200
on Saturday, begin today with practice and first-round qualifying
for those two support races. Today's sessions are not open to the
public.

<P>
   ``California was definitely important to us last year,'' Jarrett
recalled. ``We had a lot of problems throughout the day, but to
fight back and finish fifth at the end of the day helped us. It
helped us mentally, and it helped us because we could have lost 60
or 70 points toward the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett is in a similar situation this year. After winning the
season-opening Daytona 500 in February, he has struggled with
inconsistency and is more than 200 points behind leader Mark
Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (weekend) is a big race for us, too,'' said Jarrett, one
of the nine different winners at the nine Winston Cup events this
season. ``As I look back on our season to this point, I (see) that
we have performed better this year than what we did last year to
this point. We just don't have the finishes to show that, yet we've
performed well. That gives me the confidence that we can get the
job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is going to be an important race to us. It's the
type of race track that we have done well in the past. We need a
boost right now and that boost is getting back to victory lane. I
realize that nobody has done that more than once to this point, but
that would help our confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's main competition this week could come from three-time
Winston Cup champion Jeff Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, who recently broke a 13-race winless streak by winning
the DieHard 500 two weeks ago, is one of only two drivers to finish
in the top five at all three Winston Cup events at California
Speedway. He won the race in 1997 and '99 and finished fourth two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Other favorites include Jack Roush racing entries Martin and
Jeff Burton; Bobby Labonte and Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Favorites in the Busch Auto Club 300, scheduled for noon
Saturday, are points leader Jeff Green and Palmdale native Ron
Hornaday, who is fifth in points with two top-five finishes.
Winston Cup rookie Matt Kenseth won the event last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Winston West race, scheduled for 3:30 p.m. on Saturday,
could be wide open.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas resident Brendan Gaughan is first in points, but he is
one of three different winners in the regional series. Others are
Kevin Richards (Phoenix) and David Star, who won last week's race
at Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup regulars Ken Schrader and Johnny Benson are also
entered in the 100-lap race. &QL;

WEIGHT-LOSS FIRM TO PAY MILLIONS IN SETTLEMENT

<P>
   ENCINO, Calif. _ In the largest settlement of its kind, an
company that markets a weight-loss system claiming to block fat and
burn calories without exercise agreed Wednesday to pay $10 million
to settle government charges that they used deceptive advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Trade Commission said Enforma Natural Products Inc.
used false claims about scientific testing to promote a combination
of pills as The Enforma System. The complaint names the company,
Chief Executive Officer Andrew Grey and former executive Fred
Zinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``We stand by our products and are settling the case to avoid
spending years battling the FTC,'' Grey said. ``We have been very
successful and helped a lot of people lose 10, 20, 30 and even 100
pounds. We have sold the product to over a million people.''
</P>
<P>
   By reaching a settlement with the government, Enforma doesn't
admit breaking any laws, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Grey added that the controversial infomercials pitching the
weight-loss product were pulled from the airwaves last month and
replaced by 30-second conventional spots that were approved by the
FTC.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its 30-minute infomercials, featuring former Los
Angeles Dodger Steve Garvey, the company used the Internet to sell
the product, which costs about $70 for a two-month supply of
capsules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lose weight without dieting? Not a chance,'' said Jodie
Bernstein, director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, in
a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miracle weight loss claims prey on people who are overweight
or obese,'' Bernstein said. ``When marketers promise effortless
weight loss, it's bad business. The fact is, there's only one sure
way to lose weight and keep it off: eat less and exercise more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Enforma System consists of two dietary supplements with
ingredients that are becoming increasingly popular with people
searching for weight loss remedies.
</P>
<P>
   The Fat Trapper is a chitosan-based product that purports to
prevent the absorption of dietary fat, while a pyruvate product
named Exercise In A Bottle supposedly increases the body's capacity
to burn fat.
</P>
<P>
   The company also claimed that Exercise In A Bottle works on a
cellular level, forcing every cell in a person's body to work
whether he is exercising or not.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FTC complaint, the government challenged these
assertions and said the company's advertising falsely claimed
scientific proof of its weight-loss, fat-absorption and fat-burning
claims.
</P>
<P>
   Grey disputed the government's claims that Enforma falsified
facts about its products in their infomercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we can support the claims,'' he said. ``We have years
of scientific studies that support our claims. We also have
conducted clinical trials.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Grey said from his point of view the dispute with the
FTC was not about the product, it was about the advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, Grey and his company will pay the FTC $10
million, which will be refunded to consumers who bought the weight
loss product directly from the Enforma prior to March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Zinos isn't required to make any payments, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the FTC decides the refunds are not practical, the agency
may choose to distribute the money to the U.S. Treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement doesn't affect the sale of The Enforma System in
stores, he said. However, the bottles will carry a disclaimer that
reads, ``A reduced caloric intake is required to lose weight.''
</P>
<P>
   Grey said the company began selling its weight-loss system
earlier this year in stores nationwide, including Rite Aid and
General Nutrition Centers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in retail (stores), because it works,'' Grey said. ``As
long as our customers continue to buy our products, which we think
they will, our retail trading partners will continue to be very
satisfied with Enforma.''

EARLY PATENT RULING FAVORS AMGEN
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. _ A federal judge in Boston gave Amgen
Inc. an initial victory in its patent infringement fight with a
genetic therapy rival Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Judge William G. Young issued a summary judgment finding that
Cambridge, Mass.-based Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. infringed on
one of Amgen's patents for Epogen, a blockbuster drug that
stimulates red blood cell production.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling covers one of 18 claims Amgen has made regarding five
patents it owns on the $1.76 billion-selling drug, its
manufacturing process and the cells used in its manufacture.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen's patent protection expires in 2013.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important first step,'' said Amgen spokesman David
Kaye. ``Summary judgments in case law are not normally given if
there's a material dispute of fact.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge rejected summary judgment motions on two other claims.
The companies will go to trial on the remaining 17 claims May 15.
</P>
<P>
   Also to be proved at trial is whether the patent ruled infringed
Wednesday is valid and whether it is enforceable, Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Doug Christopher, who follows Amgen's stock for Los
Angeles-based Crowell Weedon &AMP; Co., said the favorable ruling bodes
well for Amgen's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amgen developed this compound. It's just an initial step in
the right direction for Amgen,'' Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the case is whether Transkaryotic Therapies and its
partner, Hoechst Marion Roussel - now called Aventis SA - violated
Amgen's patent protection when they developed a new means of making
erythropoietin, the substance on which Epogen is based.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at a very early stage in the case, and we believe it's
premature to draw conclusions on the final outcome of the trial
based on today's ruling,'' TKT spokeswoman Justine Koenigsberg said
Wednesday. ``We believe we have compelling arguments and remain
confident in our legal position.''
</P>
<P>
   Amgen investors took the news well: Amgen's shares were higher
by 5.4 percent, closing at $57.25.
</P>
<P>
   TKT's shares lost 12.8 percent to close at $28 per share
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen's protection of its Epogen patent benefits not only Amgen,
but Johnson &AMP; Johnson as well, Christopher said. The pharmaceutical
giant markets Procrit, a version of Epogen sold under license from
Amgen.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of its product Propulsid, which was pulled from
the market because of concerns it caused heart problems, Johnson &AMP;
Johnson is especially vulnerable if it loses Epogen's patent
protection, Christopher said.

EDITORIAL: ETHICS ECLIPSE 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Thursday, April 27:
</P>
<P>
   The House Ethics Committee has quietly rescinded a 10-year-old
reform that required the committee to issue a report on its
findings when an investigation fails to result in charges against a
lawmaker. Members of the committee play down the change as a
mundane ``housekeeping matter'' that merely institutes a rule
approved by the full House in 1997 that gave the committee
discretion to withhold findings in such cases. But an ethics
watchdog group, the Congressional Accountability Project, points to
conflicting disclosure provisions in House rules and suggests the
committee's change may be timed to avoid issuing a potentially
embarrassing report in the event no charges result in the case of
Rep. Bud Shuster, the powerful Transportation and Infrastructure
Committee chairman. The committee has been conducting a prolonged
review of Shuster's financial and legislative dealings with a major
transportation lobbyist, Ann Eppard.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the committee's motives were pure, it should not be in
the business of burying its findings. Full disclosure is essential
to ensure full accountability of the House. It also provides a
vital check on the conscientiousness of a committee known to
deadlock on ethics cases along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   When the committee finally concludes the Shuster investigation,
the public is entitled to a report detailing its findings and
explaining its decision on whether or not to bring charges.
Meanwhile the full House needs to revisit the 1997 rules revisions
that expanded secrecy and foreclosed the filing of ethics
complaints by citizens, thereby weakening an already weak ethics
process. &QL;

DODGERS BATS QUIET AGAIN IN LOSS TO BRAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One well-pitched game turned into two, and at that
point it wasn't a big deal. But the Dodgers, who peppered
Cincinnati pitching last weekend, are now in a terrible slump in
which they've scored once in 30 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers stopped their scoreless streak at 24 innings
Wednesday night, but they mustered little else. They fell meekly to
the Atlanta Braves 5-1 at Turner Field as their losing streak
stretched to three. Atlanta has won nine in a row.
</P>
<P>
   After losing a pair of 1-0 games in which they had just three
hits in each, the Dodgers managed only five off Kevin Millwood
(2-0) in seven innings. Mike Remlinger and John Rocker, who walked
the bases loaded in the ninth, each pitched an inning of relief.
</P>
<P>
   The frustration of not hitting, combined with an erratic strike
zone the last two games, has left the Dodgers hitters confused. It
also was the reason left fielder Gary Sheffield became the second
Dodger in as many nights to be ejected. He was tossed by home-plate
umpire Tim Tschida after being called out on strikes in the eighth,
but it began with an at-bat earlier in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I questioned the call and I have a right to my opinion,''
Sheffield said. ``I didn't say anything to him the first time, I
just ran off the field and back to the dugout. Obviously, I was
frustrated and I went up there being aggressive and swinging at bad
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I struck out, he gestured to get out of here. I just
said, `The reason I swung at it is you're so brutal.' I wasn't
going to say anything until he made that gesture. That's showing me
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson, who was ejected Tuesday for
arguing a call on the bases, said he didn't go out and argue
immediately after Sheffield was tossed because he would have been
ejected as well. Instead, Johnson waited until between innings to
talk to Tschida, and they had a lively discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing on Sheff, I kind of saw it coming,'' said Johnson,
already ejected twice this season. ``He felt like (Tschida) called
a bad pitch on him the previous at-bat. I knew I'd get thrown if I
went out so I went out later. (Sheffield) felt he had a bad call
and it's a close ballgame. Sheff knows the strike zone very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The strike-zone situation isn't isolated to this series, though
it aided Tom Glavine's three-hit shutout Tuesday. Complaints have
been ongoing for years about how Braves pitchers get strike calls a
few inches off each side of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   But Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley said Eric Gagne (0-1) and Alan
Mills were also the beneficiaries of an expanded strike zone,
though they lacked the ability to hit spots effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called some pitches against them that were probably 12
inches out, but we couldn't hit it consistently,'' Hundley said.
``They kept hitting that spot consistently. The last two nights we
just had a tough time hitting. If we stay out there and hit it
consistently, we get those pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Gagne allowed back-to-back homers to Andruw Jones and
Chipper Jones in the third and a solo homer to Andres Galarraga in
the sixth. Mills continued to have problems as he allowed a pair of
runs on four hits in two innings of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some big mistakes that cost us runs, especially home
runs,'' Gagne said. ``You can't afford to give up three home runs
in one game. That's really bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who scored 36 runs in three games in sweeping the
Reds to begin the trip, need a win in today's series finale to end
the seven-game road trip with a winning record. &QL;

AFTER TRADING HITS, KNICKS FLOOR THE RAPTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout)   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the crescendo of noise began to bulge and push
against the pinwheel ceiling of Madison Square Garden on Wednesday
night, Vince Carter was standing under the weight of it all,
staring at his reflection in the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It was Latrell Sprewell, right in front of him, right where he
had been all night. For every flashbulb-drenched move Carter made,
Sprewell countered with one of his own. So it was only natural that
the game would come down to a one-on-one situation between two
players with career backgrounds in drama.
</P>
<P>
   Both understand one thing: It's how you exit a scene. With 14
seconds on the clock, it was Sprewell with the ball. As he waited
for the clock to spin down to 9 seconds, Sprewell darted from the
left sideline into the center of the paint, rose up over Carter and
hit a fallaway 6-footer with 7.9 seconds on the clock to give the
Knicks a 1-point lead, their first edge since the opening minutes
of Game 2. And it was Sprewell's 13th point of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it was Carter's turn. He grabbed an inbound pass, stared
into the eyes of Sprewell at the top of the 3-point arc and leaped
into the air. But as he took flight with Sprewell under his chin,
and Chris Childs running toward him, he snapped the ball to an open
Dee Brown on the left wing. With Patrick Ewing closing in on him
like an afternoon shadow, Brown's 3-pointer to win the game banged
off the rim as the time expired .
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, the Knicks were using the court as their private
dance floor after winning, 84-83. They also took a 2-0 lead in
their first-round playoff series and left the Raptors drained for
their second tight finish, and perhaps demoralized.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be,'' said Sprewell, who scored 25 points _ including
11 straight in the fourth _ and left the Knicks one victory away
from taking the three-of-five series. ``I hope that's the case
because I am getting a little tired of chasing Vince around. He's
tough, really tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just being there for your team and doing what you have to do
makes you feel good. It's an amazing matchup to be apart of. To
face Vince, it's a challenge. I hope everyone is enjoying it. When
it comes down to plays like tonight, it's what basketball is
supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   It was riveting despite the numbing number of fouls called (60)
and despite the complacent Knicks, who found themselves down by 14
points with 11 minutes left in the game. Once the fourth quarter
got warm, the nervousness in the crowd was eased. Once Larry
Johnson established himself as a low-post threat with 8 points to
pull the Knicks back into the game during a 10-1 run, there was
relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd been in foul trouble, so I was just trying to get in there
and help in whatever way I could,'' said Johnson who finished with
8 of his 11 points in the fourth quarter before fouling out. ``We
were stagnate, so I wanted to do something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Latrell was huge, though. Here's a cat that sat out a whole
year before coming to us and we got to the finals. He's a warrior.
I'd love to see how he used to do against Michael Jordan. Because
Latrell is fearless. I can't see Latrell backing down from
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   As the curtain closed, Carter was on his back with a his hands
over his eyes while Sprewell raised his arms in victory. His shot
with 7.9 seconds left was the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started hitting shots,'' said Carter, who finished with 27
points, including 7 in the fourth quarter. ``It's tough when a man
is feeling that confident to stop him. When he's in a zone, he can
hit from anywhere on the court. Once I got into foul trouble, it
was hard for me to judge how to play him. I have to give him
respect, he took a step back and hit that tough shot to ice the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks finished the game shooting 40.3; the Raptors shot
41.4 percent. Allan Houston, nonexistent all night, scored 12
points on a 2-for-8 night while Ewing added 19 points. The Knicks
made 28 of 38 free throws and the Raptors hit 33 of 41.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy worried about his
team's history of mishandling prosperity. Several players said he
was visibly angry about the team's bleary focus during Tuesday's
practice, and wondered out loud if his team could unearth the kind
of hunger they had to start Game1. Even as game time approached,
even after a successful shoot-around yesterday morning, he was
still concerned with the Knicks' energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in Game 2's, and you look at what team's did
yesterday, and it's interesting for a team that wins Game 1,'' said
Van Gundy, referring to San Antonio and Charlotte's ability to come
back and even their respective series. ``I think it's important
that we go for the win tonight. A lot of times at 1-0, you're
waiting for the other shoe to drop. What if Vince Carter has a
better night. All these things. We just have to go for the win.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's pregame anxieties were justified. A sharper, more
prepared Raptors team took the floor with Muggsy Bogues inserted as
the starting point guard to guide them. With him, there was calm.
Carter was over his opening-night jitters, and his teammates were
ready for whatever the Knicks had. It wasn't much. As a result, the
Raptors opened up a 15-point lead midway through the second, an
edge aided after six straight turnovers by the clumsy Knicks. It's
a pattern that continued in the third quarter when the fell behind
by 16 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toronto played great,'' Van Gundy said after the game.
``Defense, offense, we knew they would play extremely well. We just
didn't pass to each other. If you miss open shots in this league,
the basketball gods deem they won't go in.''
</P>
<P>
   After starting the game shooting 15 percent, after looking as if
they would be overwhelmed by Carter's constant attacks on the
basket to get him to the free-throw line 16 times, the Knicks
regrouped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once Larry got us going, the crowd really started getting into
it,'' Sprewell said. ``I stared to feed off the crowd, my
adrenaline started to really pump, and I started to feel my game a
little. It was a tight finish. It could have gone either way.''
</P>
<P>
   It could have been another Carter moment. He passed, Sprewell
did not. &QL;

DODGERS BULLPEN STARTING TO FILL UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A year ago, Dodgers manager Davey Johnson was watching
Mike Maddux throw a bullpen session and feeling giddy about adding
any kind of arm to a downtrodden bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Gregg Olson and Antonio Osuna could each be ready to pitch
in two weeks or less, and the Dodgers have nowhere to put them. The
abundance of right-handed setup men _ Terry Adams, Alan Mills, Mike
Fetters and Matt Herges _ gives the Dodgers a position of strength
from which to deal.
</P>
<P>
   But general manager Kevin Malone said a trade in the next few
weeks isn't an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that as viable,'' Malone said. ``I don't see a
trade at this point. You'd like to have that as a viable option,
and maybe that's what happens when you get deeper into the season,
but not now. In the next week or two, I don't see that as a
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The short-term fix is either go with 12 pitchers and lose a
position player or send down a pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things could happen between now and then,'' Malone
said. ``Right now, there's not a lot of talk going on with anyone.
Everyone's still settling in.''
</P>
<P>
   But things can change. Dodgers officials believe as the season
moves into the middle and end of May, teams with holes in the
bullpen will begin scrambling for help. By moving one of the
right-handers _ Mills' name is perpetually mentioned _ the Dodgers
could fill gaps on their 40-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation the Dodgers aren't in any hurry to resolve.
Olson threw a bullpen session before Wednesday's game with Atlanta,
but Johnson said he'd like Olson to throw one or two more before he
either throws in a simulated game or on a rehab assignment.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Osuna is rehabbing with Triple-A Albuquerque and
Johnson said he needs a few more outings before he'll be ready to
go. And even then the Dodgers might not be willing to activate him
since he can only be optioned one more time.
</P>
<P>
   There's also the issue of the Dodgers needing a lefty in the
bullpen. They've already shipped out Onan Masaoka and Jeff Williams
after they both failed in the role.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring, the Dodgers and Florida Marlins talked about a
trade involving lefty reliever Vic Darensbourg, but a match
couldn't be identified. With the Marlins coming to Los Angeles over
the weekend, it's likely Malone will again broach the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   In his third season, left-handers are hitting .207 against
Darensbourg. Right-handers are batting .297.
</P>
<P>
   BACK WHERE BROWN BELONGS: The day after returning to the
Dodgers' rotation, right-hander Kevin Brown said his right pinkie
was a little stiff but added it was nothing that should keep him
from making his Sunday start against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   He did say, however, how good it was to be back after spending
time on the 15-day disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't feel quite as guilty, I guess, when the team is
playing well,'' Brown said. ``It's always a matter of wanting to be
out there and trying to contribute and help the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   ODDS AND ENDS: Jose Vizcaino started at shortstop and Todd
Hollandsworth was in center field against right-hander Kevin
Millwood, setting up Kevin Elster and Devon White to play against
lefty Terry Mullholland today. With it being a day game after a
night game, it's also likely Chad Kreuter will catch Chan Ho Park
while Todd Hundley rests. &QL;

CITY APPROVES TOBACCO RETAIL LICENSING PROGRAM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles retailers who sell tobacco products
will have to apply for licenses that can be revoked if they are
caught selling to minors, under a new program tentatively approved
Wednesday by the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   City Attorney James Hahn, who designed the program to stem teen
smoking, estimates there are 11,000 supermarkets, gas stations and
other stores in the city that will need to apply annually for the
free permits.
</P>
<P>
   The city expects to send out license applications beginning in
June for the program, which is expected to cost $750,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   The state conducts its own investigations and issues fines, but
does not have a licensing system. But 14 other states and 258
cities and counties nationwide, including Chicago and New York,
have tobacco license programs, according to the Public Health
Institute. San Francisco is currently considering a similar law.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles program also incorporates a clause by Councilman
Alex Padilla that bans self-help displays, requiring tobacco
products to be placed behind the counter.
</P>
<P>
   Two teams of inspectors, including teen-age customers working
undercover, will conduct about 1,000 stings annually around the
city, looking for retailers who sell to minors or do not have a
permit, which is a misdemeanor under the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers will receive a warning letter on the first offense, a
30-day suspension of the license on the second offense, and a
12-month suspension on the next offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this will be the one-two punch to knock out illegal
sales to minors,'' Hahn said.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Health Services last week released the
results of an undercover survey of 455 retailers around the state,
which found that sales to minors in supermarkets grew by 238
percent, from 5 percent in in 1998 to 17 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, an ordinance setting fines for sales to minors has
been effective in deterring illegal sales, said Kory Nelson, an
assistant city attorney there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been doing stings for three years now, and the number of
prosecutions have gone down by more than half because retailers are
much more careful to check I.D.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Marissa Jaimes, a student from Bravo Medical Magnet High School
near downtown, was one of about 50 people at City Hall to urge
passage of the licensing program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids as young as 14 go into stores and buy cigarettes as easy
as buying candy,'' said Jaimes, who heads her school's chapter of
the school district's anti-vice Friday Night Live program. ``We see
it all the time and it has to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   But retailer groups, including the California Grocer's
Association, the Retail Tobacco Dealers of America and local
convenience store chains, expressed opposition to the program,
arguing that it punishes store owners for the wrongdoing of one
clerk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking our clerks, many of whom are students earning
minimum wage, to be policemen,'' said Joan Wilson, a spokeswoman
for 7-Eleven stores. ``Under our franchise contract, owners can
lose their store if they lose their license, and that just goes too
far.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Fader, a spokesman for the Baltimore-based Retail Tobacco
Dealers of America, said there isn't much stores can do to protest
the licensing program and investigations, other than to ``tell
their people to always ask for identification, and beware of stings
by agents that look older than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Reynolds, the grandson of tobacco giant founder R.J.
Reynolds and now an anti-smoking advocate, said that's exactly the
point of the new permit program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part about licensing programs is that they have real
teeth that get the retailers' attention,'' Reynolds said. ``We
estimate that up to 20 percent of revenues at convenience stores
come from tobacco sales, and they don't want to lose that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan's office had not seen the final proposal
and had no comment. But in his proposed budget, Riordan called for
unspecified funding for two additional positions in the City
Attorney's Office for administrative work related to an
anti-smoking campaign. Funding for the program will come from
tobacco settlement money received by the city.
</P>
<P>
   The council next week will give final consideration to the
ordinance in a second vote, which is required since one councilman,
Nate Holden, voted against the program, wanting to make sure the
state would not supersede the city's power.

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
THE WOODLANDS _ The Tournament Players Course is pristine. The
weather has promised to cooperate, a pledge that comes with all the
assurances of a used-car guarantee.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Predictions of warm, rain-free weather have been accompanied by
expectations that scores will go lower than ever. Players are
licking their chops after witnessing velvet greens, flawless
fairways and a relative absence of wind during practice rounds.
Round One of the Shell Houston Open today could be a birdie buffet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I expect a record score,'' Steve Elkington said Wednesday, and
he was echoed by Fred Couples, who said: ``This course is
beautiful. It's as nice as I've ever seen it. I think the scoring
is going to be extremely low.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not an indictment of the TPC but a compliment.
Considering the Shell Houston Open has produced a higher winning
score than most tournaments over the past few years, there is no
debating that, when the wind goes up, the TPC remains a good test
of golf for even the world's best players.
</P>
<P>
   But give them spinnable fairways and greens that are a lot
softer and smoother than Interstate 45, and these guys start to
salivate. A shootout will be a nice change of pace, if it comes to
pass.
</P>
<P>
   But before tournament officials post warning signs _ ``Danger:
falling scores'' _ they might want to consult the co-conspirators
at the 17th hole who are waiting to sabotage great rounds of golf.
They are known as the golf and water gods that call the Devil's
Bathtub home.
</P>
<P>
   The big lake on the 17th and the 382 yards players must
negotiate provide some of the most stressful moments on a TPC that,
unless the wind kicks up, will show its friendly side this week.
</P>
<P>
   Players at the SHO have a healthy respect for the 17th hole.
They know the past. They have seen or heard of Seve Ballesteros
making a fateful bogey there in 1990. And Hale Irwin plopped two
shots into the Bathtub in '85 to sink his hopes with a
quintuple-bogey 9, losing by five shots. Even last year, when Hal
Sutton came up short on his approach and made a bogey after Stuart
Appleby made birdie moments earlier, the 17th played a huge role in
determining the winner.
</P>
<P>
   And the players have no doubt that 17 will again be a focal
point of the 2000 tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The funniest impromptu line I've ever heard in a pro-am in 25
years of doing this was on that hole a few years ago,'' Bruce
Lietzke said. ``Bobby Rahal, the race-car driver, was one of my
partners, and he hit a perfect drive down the left side. He was in
great shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pin was over on that front-left corner, and Bobby had 140
yards left, and I went over to him and said, `OK, don't worry about
all that water. Just hit that 9-iron in there close.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So what does he do? He does what every other amateur would
have done. He bailed out over on the right into the middle of the
green.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're walking up to the green, and Bobby is just steaming.
He's so mad at himself, he can't see straight. And I asked him what
he was so mad about.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I drive race cars 240 mph for a living, and I was
scared to death that I was going to hit that ball in the water. I
was afraid I was going to lose a golf ball.'
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what No. 17 can do to you. It'll turn brave men into
cowards.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be other subplots at the TPC starting today, such as
whether this might be the first time a player repeats as champion
in the 51-year history of the event.
</P>
<P>
   It will be Appleby's job to do something about the defending
champion having a successful encore. If nothing else, his focus is
in the right place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it here, I'm not defending the title,'' he
said. ``I'm just trying to win it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Appleby can't think of any reason why he shouldn't be able to do
well again this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten better each year on tour, which is a goal of
mine,'' he said. ``I'm just trying to keep myself tight and my game
in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   While the TPC might be receptive to low scores because of its
sensational condition, parts of the course have not changed. It's
still a shot-maker's course that rewards those who can hit fairways
and greens.
</P>
<P>
   That's one of the reasons Sutton, who has won two of his last
three tournaments, is on the hook as the man to beat this week.
Hitting good golf shots is his strength, although his putting and
short game haven't been shabby of late, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like a course where you pick out places that you don't want
to be,'' Sutton said. ``I like it when there are places where, if
you hit it there, the price is high. And if you hit it off line
here, the price can be very high.''
</P>
<P>
   Just watch the 17th hole, and that much is obvious.

THE WOODLANDS _ There will be no Tiger prowling, no David Duval
wraparound shades, no Vijay Singh expressionless moments and no
pouty Colin Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   So you say the field for today's Houston Open is a mere Shell of
itself?
</P>
<P>
   I say, sure, it could be better. Who doesn't want to see Tiger
Woods plop one into the hole from 160 yards away with a 9-iron, or
Phil Mickelson work wonders with that lob wedge of his?
</P>
<P>
   You say the cup is half-empty? I say, sure, the leader board on
Sunday figures to have fans scratching their heads, reaching for
their pairings sheet and asking, ``Who's he?''
</P>
<P>
   For every Fred Couples and Hal Sutton, there will be more names
in the field like Todd Rosetti and Brandt Jobe, the ones only
hard-core golf fans will know well. For every international name,
like a Carlos Franco, Stuart Appleby or Esteban Toledo, there will
be half a dozen Brent Schwarzrocks, Brett Wetteriches and Ryan
Howisons roaming the TPC.
</P>
<P>
   You'll recognize Jeff Maggert, Steve Elkington, Justin Leonard
and Craig Stadler. You probably won't know Jason Buha, Jeff Gove
and Glen Hnatiuk.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as you can Buy.com into the idea that much of the
field that opens the SHO today might be a mere lipped-out putt or
two away from going back to the minor leagues, the cup on No. 17
does figure to be filled with great golf shots.
</P>
<P>
   No one will strip you of your season pass for complaining that
you won't be able to find the usual number of big-name autographs
or cram yourself 10-deep around the green in hopes of catching a
glimpse of the top of Duval's hat. You're right. It could be
better.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always looking for guys to put out there and sell
tickets,'' University of Houston ex Billy Ray Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   But if you think the SHO has become a place for bottom-dwellers,
you haven't been paying attention. And you'll probably be in for a
big surprise come Sunday afternoon _ again.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the SHO has been the PGA's version of Star Search
more than Stars on Parade. And until the purse grows measurably or
a more attractive date in the tour season is scheduled, the biggest
names surely will continue to find better places to spend glorious
late-April weekends like the one in store for us now.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the likes of Duval and Mickelson have played here, SHO
winners often have been an assortment of ``Who's he?'' tour players
on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Funk won his first PGA Tour event here. Jim McGovern
provided one of the best finishes ever in 1993 on the way to the
win. Mike Heinen posted his only PGA Tour victory here in 1994.
Fulton Allem, Tony Sills and Mike Sullivan have won here, while
Leonard, Couples, Elkington and Maggert have not.
</P>
<P>
   The name game, it seems, always gives way to a great golf game
when the tour arrives here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever Tiger Woods isn't in the field, or Jim Furyk, David
Duval, Vijay Singh you hear that the field is not that strong,''
tour rookie Matt Gogel said. ``But these are the greatest players
in the world. Anyone can beat you any week. We've seen it happen
all the time. You're going to see great golf. No one can play 42
tournaments.''
</P>
<P>
   So Tiger is not on the menu. Sure, we'll all miss him. But that
doesn't mean, as Brown put it, that the remaining SHO menu has been
reduced to ``chopped liver.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It does bother me that there's that (perception),'' Brown
said. ``I look at this field, and I see 156 guys that can win it.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, without Woods, Duval and Singh, and with only
Sutton playing the kind of golf that could lead to a runaway
victory, the SHO figures to provide one of its best finishes, which
is saying something for a tournament known to be decided on the
71st or 72nd hole. And with the forecast calling for perfect
weather and conditions at the TPC by most accounts the best they've
ever been, the scores should flirt with record lows.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greens are perfect,'' Elkington said. ``In the past, this
tournament has had some bad weather and the greens weren't up to
standards. Everything comes into play when players are scheduling
tournaments. They might think the locker room is small or it was
bad timing. Some guys consider those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I'm sure when players that aren't here see the scores this
week and the conditions and everything else, they'll all be back.
You never know what the story is going to be here, and you don't
know how good the golf is going to be. I predict a great story will
come out of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The story won't be Tiger sinking a snaking 60-footer. It won't
be Duval coming from five strokes back, or Mickelson chipping in
from the fringe on No. 17.
</P>
<P>
   But a mere Shell of itself? No.
</P>
<P>
   The SHO will go on, and come Sunday the winner might not be a
name with which the casual fan will be familiar, but in this
tournament, what else is new?
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever plays great golf is going to win,'' said Gogel, who is
among the hottest golfers on tour. ``We all have the same
opportunity. It's just going to come down to who gets hot and who's
making putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Like it always does.

STATE BUDGET EXPERTS FORECAST $5 BILLION EXTRA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ California tax revenues are pouring in so fast that
the state will be at least $5 billion richer than expected by the
end of the fiscal year, The Chronicle has learned.
</P>
<P>
   With that much ``surplus'' cash flowing to state coffers,
Capitol observers say, a fight is set up between ever-cautious Gov.
Gray Davis and his more liberal fellow Democrats, who control both
houses of the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Personal income tax collections for the first 26 days of April
are $1.2 billion more than anticipated. At least another $1 billion
will pour in by the end of the month on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say that cash infusion, together with other state tax
revenue, means the state will receive some $5 billion more than
previously anticipated by June 30, the end of the current fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   Because the state already has a budget for the current fiscal
year, the $5 billion ``surplus'' won't be spent until the next
fiscal year, which begins on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the state's surging economy has already led Davis
to amend earlier estimates for next fiscal year. He now projects $2
billion more than expected coming in after July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the current $5 billion surplus and next fiscal year's
expected $2 billion means legislative budget writers have more than
$7 billion in unexpected cash to earmark in the next budget. That
spending plan must go to the governor by June 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're expecting new revenues (over two years) of at least $6
billion and perhaps significantly more than that,'' said Sandy
Harrison, a spokesman for Davis' Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   The lastest fiscal forecast is substantially more than a $4
billion prediction released in February by Elizabeth Hill, the
state's legislative analyst.
</P>
<P>
   The state's bloated bank account, which has posted
multibillion-dollar surpluses for the past three years, is in sharp
contrast with revenues in the cash-starved years of the early
1990s, when at one point California faced a deficit of more than
$14 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But this year's $5 billion is high even by surplus standards and
is more than the $4.3 billion combined surplus the state had for
the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
   Having so much more money to play with will occupy Davis and his
Democratic colleagues in the Legislature for months to come.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, hyper-cautious in his spending, will want _ as he did
last year _ to devote much of the new cash to one-time expenditures
like transit projects or other capital improvements.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic leadership in the Legislature sees the added cash
as a way to boost state support for groups shorted by past
Republican administrations, such as welfare recipients, home-care
workers, the mentally ill and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``With that kind of dough, we should invest more in mental
health programs, aid to the developmentally disabled, bigger
payments to doctors and other Medi-Cal providers, more health care
for lower-income Californians and assistance to local
governments,'' said Senate President Pro Tem John Burton, D-San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   As they have in the past, GOP lawmakers will clamor for using
much of the money for a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   One thing all sides are likely to agree on is using a good chunk
of the cash to increase spending for education, which Davis has
repeatedly said is his ``first, second and third'' spending
priority.
</P>
<P>
   There will be disagreement, though, over whether that money is
given to school districts to pay for specific programs or to use at
their own discretion, the concept Burton prefers.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, the administration has acknowledged that there
will be a budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do all our economic forecasts in November,'' said Harrison.
``This particular year the tech stocks went through the roof in
December so there were a lot of capital gains we had no way of
foreseeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Through March, state revenue collections were running $2.5
billion over the $65.2 billion in revenue that Davis estimated the
state would take in this year.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the biggest tax collection month of the year, personal
income tax revenue has already exceeded estimates by $1.2 billion
with a few days of counting still left.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the state logged $701 million in personal income tax
payments. On Tuesday, $724 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bank and corporations taxes were running $314 million ahead of
estimates by the end of March and will likely be $434 million over
by the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   Withholding _ the money employers take out of employee paychecks
_ has also given the state $150 million more than expected.
</P>
<P>
   Sales tax, the third key part of the state's income stream,
won't be counted until the end of April. But its collections so far
this year have also exceeded administration estimates.
</P>
<P>
   And if revenue for May and June exceeds administration
expectations, that would push the cash balance even higher.

(Cave Creek, Ariz.) - Cave Creek taxpayers could be asked to cover
a $6 million shortfall in the $21 million price owners are asking
for Spur Cross Ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Some Town Council members are questioning what they claim is a
40 percent hike in the land's cost. &QL; 
On Monday, May 1, the Town Council will consider a plan backed by
Mayor Vincent Francia that would raise part of the $21 million
through a $6 million property tax. The tax would require the
approval of Cave Creek voters in the November election.
</P>
<P>
   That $6 million is on top of the $7.5 million pledged last year
by the Legislature and $7.5 million approved by Maricopa County.
The combined state and county contributions were widely believed to
be enough to buy the ranch and make it a park.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions ratcheted higher this week when Francia suggested that
the Attorney General's Office investigate whether information about
the proposed deal was illegally provided to The Arizona Republic.
He claimed council members were obligated to keep the information
confidential because they learned it in executive sessions by the
Town Council.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Councilman Dean Brewer has asked the attorney
general to investigate whether Francia and Town Attorney Gary
Birnbaum violated open-meetings laws by calling the closed
executive sessions. &QL; 
DIFFERING INTERESTS &QL; 
The shootout at Spur Cross Ranch is a case study in the risks
involved when governments attempt to buy private land to satisfy
the demands of preservation-hungry voters. Gov. Jane Hull staked
her prestige to the cause of preserving Spur Cross. In last year's
state of the state address, Hull called Spur Cross one of the
``natural areas that define the magnificence of our state.''
</P>
<P>
   Spur Cross, which lies just north of Phoenix, rolls across 2,220
acres of stunning high desert traversed by the lush green oasis of
Cave Creek, the Valley's largest remaining perennial stream.
Covered with broad stands of saguaros and ocotillos, it soars into
rugged uplands that hold the ruins of Hohokam farming settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can save Spur Cross, generations to come will understand
at least part of the magic of Arizona,'' said Hull, who helped
persuade the Legislature to act.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Sen. John McCain, &QL; 
R-Ariz., also pushed the bill after he tried unsuccessfully to
engineer a swap of Spur Cross for federal land north of Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   When Maricopa County agreed to match the state's contribution,
it seemed to be a done deal. Rep. Carolyn Allen, R-Scottsdale,
whose district includes Spur Cross, remembers the jubilation that
surrounded Hull's visit to Cave Creek last April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We high-fived that night and the crowd was all excited,''
Allen said. ``I truly believed that the $15 million was going to
cover the whole deal.''
</P>
<P>
   But something happened on the way to a sales contract. The
owners, Herb Dreiseszun of Phoenix and an insurance company
controlled by Cincinnati billionaire Karl Lindner, said it would
take more money to buy Spur Cross.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the land was likely to be transformed into another
golf-course development lined by million-dollar homes with $50,000
SUVs parked next to BMWs. &QL; 
A CHANGE IN PLAN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Tom Augherton said he got the bad news immediately after the
Legislature passed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Augherton, who was Cave Creek's mayor at the time, recounted a
conversation with Ed Wren, lobbyist for Great American Insurance
Co., which owns 70 percent of the ranch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `Now, you realize, mayor, that this $15 million is
only for our share,' '' Augherton said. ``I was astonished,'' the
former mayor said. ``I felt we had been deceived. I felt they had
just pulled a big bait and switch.''
</P>
<P>
   Wren insists that Great American is not to blame for the
misunderstanding. ``Great American's position from day one was that
they needed to have $14.7 million out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   A state Senate staff analysis supports Wren's position. It
reported that Great American had ``entered into discussions with
the Executive branch'' and had ``expressed willingness to sell its
portion of the property for between $14.7 million and $21
million.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate report made no mention of Spur Cross' other owner,
Herb Dreiseszun. He says he openly disagreed with the appraisal
that put the value of the entire ranch at $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I want is a fair process and a fair appraisal,'' said
Dreiseszun, who claims government officials ignored him as they
pursued negotiations with Great American. He said the state's
appraisal of $6,600 per acre flies in the face of nearby sales for
triple that amount.
</P>
<P>
   Dreiseszun said Francia's plan, developed by attorney Birnbaum,
``has some merit.'' Under the plan, Great American would receive
$14.7 million for its share, and Dreiseszun would get $6.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have every intention of securing this property for the
community of Cave Creek and the state,'' Francia said.
</P>
<P>
   But Councilman Dean Brewer claims that Francia and Birnbaum have
become too cozy with Great American, which is represented locally
by attorney Robert Kielty. ``It seems to me that things are
swinging too far in the direction of the property owners,'' Brewer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Laura Cox, puts it more bluntly, ``I think we're
being steamrollered.''
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Ralph Mozilo, a retired mortgage company executive
and an ally of Francia, says the sellers market is a product of
economic realities as well as political momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing has been frozen in its tracks,'' Mozilo said. ``If
somebody has a better plan, I'm more than willing to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Schmitt, a founder of Friends of Spur Cross, said the
political stakes are so high that politicians have become easy prey
for the landowners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There too much of a seller's market,'' Schmitt said. ``The
politicians know there is such a strong will to save Spur Cross
that they've adopted this mentality of `Save Spur Cross at any
price.'' &QL;

BELCHER'S BACK (WELL, ALMOST)
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Pitcher Tim Belcher has two more rehab starts
for Triple-A Edmonton before he'll join the big-league club. So
what was he doing in Anaheim on Wednesday?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it's about 40 degrees warmer here,'' he said. ``And they
had an off-day today and I needed to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher, recovering from offseason elbow surgery, made 68
pitches in five innings Tuesday night for Edmonton at Calgary,
allowing one run and five hits. He'll fly back to Edmonton on
Saturday and pitch Sunday. He'll make another start for Edmonton
five days later, after which he is expected to join the starting
rotation in Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has to get up to 100 pitches or so,'' manager Mike Scioscia
said. ``We have to make sure he's at the level he needs to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Belcher said his elbow feels good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pitching with better stuff right now than at any point
last season,'' Belcher said. ``Granted, it's come against two
A-ball clubs and one Triple-A club. It's not the Yankees. But
mentally I feel good about where I'm at. I'm much more capable of
putting together some good innings at the big league level.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he feels better than he has in years, Belcher drew the
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get past 34, 35, you've probably seen your best
days,'' said Belcher, 38. ``Some days you can perform like you're
younger, but as far as that invincible, 20-something feeling, it's
gone. Way gone.''
</P>
<P>
   FARM REPORT: The Angels are keeping an eye on lefty Jarrod
Washburn, who is pitching at Triple-A Edmonton. Washburn, who began
camp as a candidate for a spot in the starting rotation, was
sidelined by a strained muscle in his side for most of spring
training. He only now is beginning to build up strength and
endurance.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn is 1-0 with a 4.96 ERA in three starts for Edmonton,
but Scioscia said Washburn initially might be called up as a
reliever.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pen's a possibility,'' Scioscia said. ``But long range
he's definitely a starter. He'll be a force, give you 200 innings a
year.''
</P>
<P>
   MADDON'S SUPPORT: Bench coach Joe Maddon is wearing a neck brace
to help alleviate the symptoms caused by a pinched nerve in his
neck.
</P>
<P>
   Maddon went to the hospital during the last road trip because he
felt light-headed and short of breath. He has bone spurs in his
neck that doctors believe caused the pinched nerve. &QL;

BROCKOVICH TARGET OF REAL-LIFE EXTORTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID GREENBERG AND CECILIA CHAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENTURA, Calif. _ An ex-husband of Erin Brockovich, his attorney
and a former boyfriend were arrested Wednesday on suspicion of
trying to extort $310,000 from the subject of the recent Julia
Roberts hit movie and her boss.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects conspired to blackmail Brockovich and prominent
Westlake Village attorney Edward L. Masry with the threat that they
would go public with accusations that Brockovich was a bad mother
and that the now-famous legal duo was having an affair, according
to court records.
</P>
<P>
   After a Wednesday morning meeting in which Masry and Brockovich
turned over the money, authorities moved in and arrested her
ex-husband, Shawn William Brown, 38, of Simi Valley; Century City
lawyer John Jeffrey Reiner, 53; and Jorg Lawrence Halaby, 46, of
Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   All three remained in custody with bail set at $50,000 each,
with their arraignment scheduled for today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, this whole thing really makes me sick,'' said
Brockovich, an Agoura Hills resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to give anybody a dime for going out saying lies
about me and Ed when we never did anything but be good to these ...
guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Brockovich, director of research for Masry &AMP; Vititoe, accused
Brown of trying to avoid paying her $100,000 in back child support
and said the suspects' demand for money escalated over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back and forth with these guys for months,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a criminal complaint filed by the Ventura County
District Attorney's Office, Reiner called Masry on April 11, saying
Brown was ready to give news media interviews casting Masry and
Brockovich in a negative light.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure Brown's silence, Reiner said, his client wanted
$200,000. He reiterated the threat during an April 14 phone
conversation, this time claiming he also represented Halaby, a
former boyfriend of Brockovich's who was portrayed in the movie by
Aaron Eckhart, records indicate.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17, Reiner faxed Masry a proposed agreement, this time
calling for $280,000 for Brown and $30,000 for Halaby to keep them
from publicly questioning Brockovich's devotion to her children or
from claiming that she and Masry had been romantically involved.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Brown and Halaby promised Masry over the phone
that if they received the money, they would never bother him or
Brockovich again, records show.
</P>
<P>
   But Masry had notified authorities, who began building a case
against the suspects. A meeting was set for Wednesday morning at
which Masry and Brockovich gave the trio checks totaling $310,000.
</P>
<P>
   According to Masry, Brown was going to turn around and pay
Brockovich $100,000 of the money as the child support he owed her.
Brown was the first of Brockovich's three husbands, and the father
of two of her three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been rumbling and threatening this,'' Masry said.
``And after the movie came out, it really got hot the last two
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Masry also said he and Brockovich had never had an affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no proof because Erin and I have never had a sexual
relationship,'' he said. ``They wouldn't need proof if they went to
the tabloids. It wouldn't matter if it were true or false.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura County District Attorney Michael D. Bradbury said the
arrests culminated a two-week investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were looking for money not from the film, but from these
two individuals,'' said Bradbury. ``I don't recall in recent years
another extortion case in which we prosecuted a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradbury also termed the trio's threats a serious extortion
effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a case that is close to the line. I understand
it's not unusual in the entertainment industry for someone to try
to profit from some peripheral involvement in the making of a film.
Their efforts sometimes cross the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this prosecution will have a serious deterrent
effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin Brockovich,'' which has grossed more than $100 million
since its March 17 release, shows how the former beauty queen
joined Masry's firm as a down-on-her-luck file clerk and went on to
help him win a record $333 million settlement from corporate giant
Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric.
</P>
<P>
   The duo, portrayed in the film by Roberts and Albert Finney,
sued the utility on behalf of the residents of Hinkley, Calif.,
saying the company knowingly contaminated the community's water
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Roberts had been notified of the arrest through
her talent agency, ICM in New York.

IN GAY UNION VOTE, VERMONT KEEPS MIND OF ITS OWN
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. _ Vermont may be one of the last places in
America that still looks like a place. It is authentic New England,
a Disneyland without Disney. Church steeples rise from town
squares. Villages dot valleys, strung together by winding roads and
country stores with screened doors. Citizens gather at town
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, it seems an unlikely place for a social revolution.
</P>
<P>
   But in the space of the last four months, Vermont pitched itself
headlong into one of the most controversial issues in America,
wrestling in full-throated debate, citizen by citizen, over the
role of homosexuals in society. And this week, it was Vermont that
emerged at the vanguard of social change in America, granting gays
and lesbians every right of marriage in a new form of social
contract _ the civil union.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a lot of Vermonters are not happy about this. Many
have vowed to throw out their legislators who voted for the civil
union bill _ including their governor, Howard Dean, who signed it
into law Wednesday _ and replace them come November.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even so, people in Vermont are not all that surprised.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always got to be a first in Vermont,'' said Robert
Fusco, chatting at a country store in Middlesex, population 5,000.
He personally doesn't believe in gay marriage because, ``It just
isn't right. It's not the way Adam and Eve meant it.`` Nonetheless,
he shrugged, ``Vermont is a very liberal state.``
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's ``firsts`` and its liberalism go hand in hand _ and
they go way back, well before San Francisco was San Francisco.
There are more than 300 years of them, a long history of a
ferocious defense of personal freedom that never hesitated to defy
conventional thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont was a free Republic when the other colonies were still
fighting for independence. Vermont was the first state to join the
Union. It was the first to abolish property qualifications for
voting, and the first to call for direct election of its governor.
Vermont was the first state to abolish slavery. It was the first
state to elect a woman lieutenant governor. And it is the only
state that has a Socialist representative in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Vermont's hero of the American Revolution was Ethan Allen, who
declared in 1781 that he was ``resolutely determined to defend the
independence of Vermont _ and rather than fail, will retire with
the hardy Green Mountain Boys into the desolate caverns of the
mountains and wage war with Human Nature at large.``
</P>
<P>
   Is it any surprise that Vermont is now the first to grant the
closest thing to gay marriage short of marriage itself?
</P>
<P>
   ``Why Vermont? Why not?`` asked Lois Farnham, one of the
plaintiffs in the Supreme Court case that in December ruled
unconstitutional the state's denial of marital benefits and
privileges to gays, opening the debate that led Vermont this week
to create homosexual civil unions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Vermonter,`` Farnham said. ``I'm proud of the fact that
I was born here. My family's here and has been for generations.
Vermont is very independent. It's a live-and-let-live society.``
Farnham said she filed suit because, simply, ``Somebody's got to be
first.``
</P>
<P>
   Many Vermonters think their state is in fact waging Ethan
Allen's ``war with Human Nature'' by adopting the equivalent of gay
marriage. ``God's plan is one woman and one man,`` declared Elaine
Hoadley of Waterbury. Homosexuality, she said, ``is not acceptable
or normal behavior. I feel it's something in the genes when they
were born that went wrong.``
</P>
<P>
   And many believe that actual gay marriage, in name as well as
substance, is headed their way fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next step is gay marriage,`` said Tina, a 30-something
native who would only give her first name. ``I know in those small
towns, Chelsea, Washington, Cambridge, those people are old school,
and to them it's sick _ a lot of people just won't talk about it.
The older people especially _ people like my father _ are really
having a hard time with this.``
</P>
<P>
   But others, like George Spontak of Montpelier, said Vermont's
action ``made me so proud. Vermont is a very special place, it's
very free and open and very tolerant. I'm totally proud to be a
Vermonter.``
</P>
<P>
   And so the Vermont legislature plowed ahead. As the debate over
homosexuality raged inside the statehouse chamber on Tuesday, the
engraved marble plaques in the halls outside, quoting Vermont's
storied history of independence and liberty, took on a freshly
poignant meaning:
</P>
<P>
   ``Born of a resistance to arbitrary power _ her first voice a
declaration of equal rights of man _ how could her people be other
than haters of slavery _ how can they do less than sympathize with
every human being and every community which asserts the rights of
all men to blessings like their own?``
</P>
<P>
   Vermont acted again to extend its blessings to ``every
community,`` including gays and lesbians, based on the ``common
benefits`` clause of its constitution that predates the 14th
Amendment's ``equal protection`` clause of the U.S. constitution by
nearly a century.
</P>
<P>
   Its citizens, whether they agree or disagree with the action,
are not surprised that their picturesque rural state that appears
rooted in the 19th century is again at the vanguard of a
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just restating that we all have our rights made
inalienable under the Constitution,`` said Pamela Brady, stopping
at the Montpelier post office. ``I think we are setting a precedent
for the rest of the country, and soon other states will follow in
our footsteps.``

 ALASKA AIRLINES JET PLAGUED WITH HYDRAULIC DIFFICULTIES  &HT;     By HENRY K. LEE 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ An Alaska Airlines plane in Oakland that was
found this month to have incomplete maintenance records reported
hydraulic problems on four separate flights, in some cases forcing
passengers to evacuate, according to Federal Aviation
Administration records.
</P>
<P>
   In three cases in 1995, crew members reported identical problems
with the hydraulic line to the left engine of the MD-80, tail
number N932AS. In each instance, Alaska mechanics reported
replacing the hydraulic line and servicing the hydraulic system,
FAA records obtained by The Chronicle show.
</P>
<P>
   The records also show that mechanics reported fixing a variety
of other mechanical problems since the plane was acquired by Alaska
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's records have come under review after a special FAA
inspection of the airline this month found that the aircraft was
prematurely cleared for a test flight in Oakland despite
unspecified irregularities with its paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   The special FAA ``white glove'' audit of the airline, which came
in response to the January crash of Alaska Flight 261, also found
that records for a Boeing 737 in Seattle were missing a required
second signature.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosures come as Alaska's maintenance facility in Oakland
remains under investigation by a federal grand jury over
allegations that mechanics there falsified records. Since 1998, FBI
agents have seized records for 11 MD-80s that have been serviced at
the hangar.
</P>
<P>
   Records for the Flight 261 jet, tail number N963A, were not
under grand jury review.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska spokesman Greg Witter said Wednesday that all of the
carrier's 89 planes are safe, even as the airline, in response to
the ``white glove'' audit, continues to inspect the records of most
of its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we have the finest mechanics in the industry who
maintain our fleet in tip-top condition,'' Witter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Flight 261 crash off the Southern California coast, which
killed all 88 people on board, remains under investigation by the
National Transportation Safety Board, the FBI and the Department of
Transportation's inspector general. The probe has focused on the
possible failure of the jackscrew, a key part of the plane's
horizontal stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   According to FAA records, the horizontal stabilizer was the
subject of a repair on the N932AS plane in November 1998. Corrosion
was found on part of the stabilizer, and the part was replaced,
records show. That same day, mechanics also re-welded a previously
repaired crack on that MD-80.
</P>
<P>
   The more serious problems with the plane's hydraulic system were
reported on three occasions in 1995 and once in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   On July 25, 1995, passengers on a flight that landed at San
Francisco International Airport had to be evacuated after hydraulic
fluid fumes leaked into the cabin. A similar incident was reported
at Portland International Airport on Aug. 14, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 7, 1995, a low-pressure warning light went on after the
plane took off from Portland. After the plane landed without
incident, problems were again found with the hydraulic line.
</P>
<P>
   And on Dec. 17, 1997, passengers were evacuated after a
hydraulic line broke.
</P>
<P>
   Witter said the hydraulic problems ``happen periodically'' and
were unrelated to the paperwork problems highlighted by the FAA.
</P>
<P>
   The plane remains in service, as well as the 11 MD-80s for which
records are under review by the federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1998, the grand jury issued a subpoena for records
pertaining to three MD-80s in which mechanics alleged paperwork
discrepancies at the Oakland facility. In November 1999, the grand
jury issued a second subpoena for the records for eight additional
planes. The panel is continuing to meet in secret.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury probe began after John Liotine, 37, of Pittsburg,
who formerly worked as a lead mechanic at the Oakland facility,
came forward with allegations of misconduct. Liotine is on paid
leave. &QL;

IMAGES BACK NEW THEORY OF FLAT UNIVERSE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A balloon-born telescope that captured faint whispers of
radiation echoing from the ``Big Bang'' of 14 billion years ago has
confirmed an astonishing new view that the universe is flat and
expanding forever, not curved and closed in on itself.
</P>
<P>
   The observations, reported Wednesday, offer the first detailed
images of the universe as it existed shortly after its creation, a
vast and sizzling hot realm of gases that later cooled and
condensed into the galaxies, superclusters of galaxies and stars
that are visible today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow! Wow! and Wow!'' was the reaction Wednesday from Michael
Turner, a University of Chicago astrophysicist at a NASA press
conference in Washington. ``Euclid was right, and the pattern of
the images shows undeniably that the universe is flat.''
</P>
<P>
   The observations were captured by a sensitive telescope carried
23 miles over Antarctica for 10 days in late 1998 and early 1999. A
team of 36 astronomers and cosmologists from four nations were
involved in the mission, and the first detailed samples of their
images are being published today in the journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams of cosmic explorers _ using telescopes mounted on
balloons and mountain peaks as well as the orbiting Hubble Space
Telescope _ are gathering data and manipulating computer
calculations that confirm the report.
</P>
<P>
   The images support theorists' predictions that the embryonic
universe, barely 300,000 years after it was created in the Big
Bang, was composed entirely of vast waves of radiation hotter than
the sun, with clumpy structures of hydrogen stretched far across
empty space.
</P>
<P>
   After the universe cooled and condensed, the radiation left a
faint afterglow, known as cosmic background radiation. That
afterglow is what the ultra-sensitive microwave telescope suspended
from the balloon has seen in unprecedented detailed.
</P>
<P>
   The telescope mission, code named Boomerang, was led by Paolo de
Bernardis of the University of Rome's La Sapienza campus and Andrew
Lange of the California Institute of Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the first clear images of the early universe we have
ever seen,'' Lange said Wednesday at the Washington, D.C., press
conference. ``It's a fantastic idea that our entire universe is
built from the seeds we can see and measure.''
</P>
<P>
   The telescope detected unimaginably faint wave patterns, or
ripples, in the temperature of the cosmic background radiation.
These waves are barely three degrees above absolute zero _ 459
degrees below zero Fahrenheit _ and they vary in temperature by
only 100 millionths of a degree.
</P>
<P>
   If the universe is flat, said Saul Perlmutter, the Berkeley,
Calif. leader of another scientific team studying the birth pangs
of the universe, then physics and mathematics say it must follow
that the universe will continue expanding forever and not someday
collapse onto itself.
</P>
<P>
   Perlmutter and his group are studying more than 80 of the most
distant detectable exploding stars, called supernovae. They are
finding that the flat universe is not only expanding forever, but
that the expansion is in fact accelerating, propelled by a
mysterious force that Perlmutter and his colleagues call ``dark
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the data from the Boomerang team's findings was analyzed
by team members Julian Borrill and Andrew H. Jaffe at the Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory's supercomputing center. Borrill
reflected Wednesday on the excitement the new findings are
generating:
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit at my computer for weeks and weeks, and finally I just
marvel at what we're seeing _ the universe is an awesome thing!''
</P>
<P>
   The cosmic background radiation is all around us; it contributes
to snow on television sets. But only when scientists place their
detectors high above Earth's interfering atmosphere can it be
measured and imaged.
</P>
<P>
   That radiation was first detected in 1965, but the first hints
of its tiny ripples were not found until NASA's Cosmic Background
Explorer satellite, known as COBE, detected them. The satellite
covered the entire sky but had only a very coarse view, far too
rough for scientists to discern any complex structures.
</P>
<P>
   The Boomerang experiment, by comparison, covered 2.5 percent of
the sky but with a resolution 35 times higher. So sensitive is the
Boomerang telescope that its detector caught the minute variations
and gathered them into images showing clearly the complex patterns
that the ripples formed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really exciting to be able to see some of the
fundamental structures of the universe in their embryonic state,''
said de Bernardis. ``The light we have detected from them has
travelled across the entire universe before reaching us, and we are
perfectly able to distinguish it from the light generated in our
own galaxy.''
</P>
<P>
   The team that sent the Boomerang telescope aloft on its 10-day
mission plans to fly it again later this year, and other scientists
are planning to release new data within a few days on another
balloon-borne experiment called Maxima, which is also measuring the
cosmic background radiation.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Berkeley astrophysicists Paul L. Richards and George
Smoot, the Maxima team launched its balloon on a 12-hour flight to
125,000 feet from the National Science Foundation's scientific
ballooning base at Palestine, Texas last June.
</P>
<P>
   Smoot said Tuesday that Maxima's data, which are still being
analyzed, will confirm the Boomerang team's conclusions.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   In January, city officials turned up the pressure on Hearst to
find a buyer for the Examiner, and it was beginning to leak out who
they had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after the new year, Ted Fang called Brown and asked
whether the mayor knew of any potential investors who might be
interested in purchasing the Examiner with the Fangs. Hellman and
Fang met with the mayor in his office.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he began to ``shop the Fangs around.'' And for any
deal for the Examiner to work, Brown said, there would have to be
some kind of subsidy from the Hearst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In his second inaugural address on January 8, Brown called the
Examiner a ``civic treasure'' and said he hoped to find investors
to buy it. The same day, Hallinan, also during his second inaugural
address, called saving the paper a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two weeks later, on January 20, Brown called Examiner
editor and publisher Tim White and asked if they could meet. Later
that morning, Brown, Renne and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, who has been one
of the most outspoken members of the House of Representatives on
Chinese issues, drove to the Examiner building, and the delegation
met with White in the publisher's conference room.
</P>
<P>
   They made it clear that Hearst's first offer was simply not a
``viable one,'' according to Pelosi. If the Examiner was going to
survive, Hearst needed to sweeten the deal substantially.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 8 of SALE27 (27409 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  And the pressure to sell the paper to the Fangs grew even more
intense the next day, when Sen. Dianne Feinstein, whose husband,
Richard Blum, has long-standing business interests in China,
invited White and Florence Fang to lunch at Villa Taverna, a
private dining club in the Financial District.
</P>
<P>
   Like Pelosi, Feinstein has long enjoyed the support of the
Independent.
</P>
<P>
   Although no actual negotiations for the Examiner took place at
the Friday luncheon, the subtext was clear. White and Feinstein
listened as Fang described her life in China before immigrating to
the United States with her late husband.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, she said, from the time he attended UC Berkeley in
the 1950s, had dreamed of owning a daily metropolitan newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The next Tuesday, the Hearst Corp. put the Examiner up for sale
a second time.
</P>
<P>
   This time the ``turnkey'' offer included all the hard assets
needed to publish the newspaper, including a printing plant, the
Examiner building, trucks, news racks and editorial computer
system, as well as the paper's editorial staff and lists of
advertisers and subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   But a wild card had slipped into the deck _ and his name was
Clint Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   A wealthy San Francisco landlord and former political
consultant, Reilly had long-standing antipathy for the Examiner. In
1993, Reilly broke his ankle during a scuffle while meeting with
Bronstein at the Examiner. Reilly's assault-and-battery suit
eventually was settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Reilly ran for mayor, but his campaign derailed when
Davis, Brown's top campaign strategist, accused Reilly of
``savagely mauling'' a women during a domestic violence incident 20
years ago. The allegations, which were widely reported in The
Chronicle, Examiner and other media, sank Reilly's campaign, and he
finished fourth in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   On January 11, Reilly filed a suit in federal court to block the
sale of The Chronicle. Within weeks, however, Reilly was angling to
buy the Examiner, and, to the surprise of some observers, he
appeared to be serious about running it.
</P>
<P>
   In early February, during settlement talks with Hearst officials
in New York, Reilly orally outlined an offer to buy the Examiner if
at least a share of the joint operating agreement was included,
according to his attorney Joseph M. Alioto.
</P>
<P>
   The 50-50 profit split provided for under the current JOA could
be adjusted, Alioto said, to reflect the difference in circulation
of the two papers. The Chronicle's circulation is more than four
times that of the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst officials seemed willing to at least entertain the offer,
and shortly after the meeting in New York, according to a source
close to Reilly, he took his family on a vacation to Hong Kong and
Bali believing he was close to a deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department officials were still skeptical of
Hearst's new offer to sell the Examiner because it did not include
a piece of the JOA and they had refused to bless it. But the
prosecutors saw for the first time a sign of flexibility from the
Hearst Corp.
</P>
<P>
   And the strident political and community opposition in San
Francisco made it easier for the department to continue pressuring
Hearst officials to offer, if not a share of the JOA, at least a
subsidy that would help a new owner operate the Examiner for
several years.
</P>
<P>
   With the February 15 deadline for offers on the Examiner
approaching, the Hearst Corp. fielded a number of inquiries.
</P>
<P>
   The potential buyers ranged from the former owner of the Crazy
Carrot Juice Bar in Minneapolis, who said he was ``now ready for
the next thing,'' to Tony Ridder, chairman and CEO of Knight
Ridder, who was interested only if he could have a share of the
JOA.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, only three qualified buyers presented detailed
offers for the Examiner: Reilly, the Fangs and Leucadia, which had
first expressed interest in acquiring the paper in August.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 9 of SALE27 (27409 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Over the next four weeks, negotiations among Hearst officials and
the three prospective buyers intensified.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three potential buyers ``demanded subsidies in the
tens of millions of dollars as a condition to their acquisition,''
court records show. And according to a report in the Examiner,
Hearst told Reilly, the Fangs and Leucadia that it would be willing
to provide a ``substantial subsidy'' to operate the paper.
</P>
<P>
   But the amount of the subsidy was not high enough for Leucadia,
and negotiations soon narrowed to Reilly and Fang.
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of the Fangs, Hellman and his partner Joe Niehaus
continued to play a role in the negotiations. Shortly after the
Hearst Corp. put the Examiner back up for sale, Hellman talked with
White.
</P>
<P>
   He later formally notified the Hearst Corp. that he was working
with the Fangs and that any investment he made would be his
``personally'' rather than his investment firm's.
</P>
<P>
   Hellman also met with Justice Department officials, who were
impressed with his credentials, contacts and financial resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``He definitely added a luster to the Fangs,'' one Justice
Department source said.
</P>
<P>
   In late February, Ted Fang met with Hearst Vice President James
Asher to discuss the terms of a deal. Hearst offered a subsidy, but
it was interested in providing the lowest possible amount and the
shortest possible transition period.
</P>
<P>
   On March 6, Fang sent Hearst a letter stating that he intended
to publish the Examiner six or seven mornings a week with home
delivery and newspaper rack sales primarily in San Francisco. He
presented options for a transition subsidy period of up to four
years, and said he wanted delivery trucks, news racks, editorial
computer systems, archives, subscription lists and the paper's Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   He was not interested in the Examiner editorial office building
or a printing plant. And his proposal called for the Hearst Corp.
to keep the Examiner staff and honor ``all employee obligations''
such as union contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, after returning from vacation, Reilly resumed
negotiations with Hearst in late February.
</P>
<P>
   He thought the discussions were going well, but by early March,
Reilly began to feel that Hearst officials were stalling him,
according to a source close to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   In mid-March, Reilly was still waiting for Hearst to respond to
his latest offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He still thought he had a deal with Hearst,`` said one source.
``He didn't know whether (Hearst officials) were bluffing or
negotiating with someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The word came down on St. Patrick's Day, March 17.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial staffs of the Examiner and Chronicle were invited
to gather at the Examiner shortly before noon. Standing in the hub
of the newsroom, White and George Irish, president of Hearst
Newspapers, announced that the Fangs had acquired the Examiner. The
sale would become final on March 30.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the deal were strikingly similar to the proposal
Fang had made in early March. The Fangs would acquire the
Examiner's name, Web site, archives and lists of advertisers and
subscribers. The Fangs would publish the Examiner at least six
mornings a week.
</P>
<P>
   There would be a four-month transition period, during which the
Fangs would own the Examiner but Hearst and its editorial staff
would continue to publish the paper before the operation was turned
over to the Fangs. Hearst would provide a subsidy of up to $66
million during the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our deal today is the fulfillment of a dream for my family,
for myself, for my late father,'' Ted Fang said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 10 of SALE27 (27409 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  But the deal wasn't final yet.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Hearst Corp. and the Fangs had struck a deal for
the Examiner, they still needed approval from the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Justice Department would sign off, though, it wanted
to determine whether even with the Hearst subsidies the Fangs had
the financial backing to publish the Examiner _ and to compete with
The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   According to Justice Department sources, Hellman has an option
to provide future financing to the Fangs, if the family should need
it. Hellman says no such option exists.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if Fangs have obtained investments from China, a
source close to the deal said, ``Let's just say they have
resources.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, the day the sale was to become final, the Justice
Department formally approved the Hearst Corp.'s acquisition of The
Chronicle and the Fangs' purchase of the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in 35 years, San Francisco will have two
independent daily papers,'' said Assistant Attorney General Klein.
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone was so pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the mayor bought himself a newspaper,'' said the
leader of one political watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   On the day the two sales were to close, Reilly, who a source
said was ``crushed'' when he learned the Hearst Corp. had sold the
Examiner to the Fangs, went to court asking for a temporary
restraining order to block the sales.
</P>
<P>
   In his suit, Reilly argues that the Fangs' acquisition of the
Examiner is a sham, and if the newspaper fails _ as Hearst knows it
will, Reilly contends _ Hearst will monopolize the daily newspaper
business in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker granted Reilly's
restraining order, temporarily blocking the newspaper sales. The
next week, with the agreement of Hearst and Reilly, Walker set May
1 as the start of the expedited antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   For some participants in the process, the possibility that the
deal could come undone in Walker's courtroom is a terrifying
prospect.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was a 15-round championship fight,'' said one key player,
``has now turned into a wild back-alley brawl.''
</P>
<P>
   Few could have anticipated the trial when Hearst's Bennack first
walked into The Chronicle newsroom last August. But now, after
almost nine months of difficult negotiations and confounded
expectations, the fate of San Francisco's two daily newspapers will
be decided in a federal courtroom. And even the judge seemed
puzzled by how it got there.
</P>
<P>
   Told during a court hearing that no law required Hearst to
subsidize the Fangs' acquisition of the Examiner, Walker asked why
the company had agreed to such an extraordinary arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's politics,'' said Hearst attorney Gary Halling.

 POLITICS TANGLED UP S.F. NEWSPAPER DEALS  &HT;     By WILLIAM CARLSEN and REYNOLDS HOLDING 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Frank A. Bennack Jr., president of the Hearst
Corp., strode into The Chronicle newsroom shortly after noon August
6 and announced to the staff that the New York media conglomerate,
publisher of the Examiner, had struck a deal to purchase The
Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   And because antitrust law probably would prohibit Hearst from
publishing both papers, Bennack said, the Examiner was up for sale,
effective immediately. If no buyer emerged in the next ``three to
six weeks,'' the company would shut the Examiner down.
</P>
<P>
   The newsroom announcement had the tenor of a done deal, a swift
and foregone conclusion to a newspaper rivalry that had endured for
more than a century. But if Bennack and other Hearst officials
thought the fate of the city's two daily newspapers would be
quickly resolved, they were in for a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next nine months, Hearst's acquisition of The Chronicle
would be sidetracked by a convergence of political alliances,
hidden agendas and backroom negotiations that could not have
transpired anywhere but in San Francisco:
</P>
<P>
   -- The city's entrenched Democratic political machine
orchestrated a masterful campaign not only to preserve the two
daily newspapers but to serve its own political interests.
</P>
<P>
   -- Former mayoral candidate Clint Reilly filed a federal
antitrust lawsuit to block the sale and then used the suit to make
his own bid for the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   -- The U.S. Justice Department, with a long record of routinely
signing off on newspaper mergers, suddenly felt emboldened to
challenge the deal after several successes in its antitrust battle
against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   -- And in the center of it all was San Francisco's politically
connected Fang family, publishers of the Independent newspaper,
which campaigned against the sale of The Chronicle while quietly
doing everything possible to buy the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, in an extraordinary sequence of events watched from
Washington to China, the Hearst Corp. realized its best hope of
acquiring The Chronicle was to agree to pay the Fangs $66 million
for taking the Examiner off its hands.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a late-hour settlement of the Reilly suit, the final
chapter in this drama is expected to play out starting Monday in
the courtroom of U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker.
</P>
<P>
   From court documents, public records, published reports and
dozens of interviews, this is the untold story of Hearst's
unexpectedly difficult quest to acquire The Chronicle _ and how
members of the Fang family worked the corridors of power to win a
prize of their own.
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, 1999, the descendants of M.H. de Young _ who with
his brother Charles founded The Daily Dramatic Chronicle in 1865 _
crowded into the newspaper's oak-paneled editorial conference room
on Fifth and Mission streets in downtown San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   After years of infighting, family members temporarily put aside
their differences and under the large gilt-framed portrait of
Michael de Young agreed to sell their newspapers, television
stations and other media holdings while the value of those
properties was at an all-time high.
</P>
<P>
   Their decision marked the beginning of the end of an era for one
of the nation's last family-owned metropolitan newspapers. With a
daily circulation of 456,742, The Chronicle is the 12th-largest
newspaper in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Hearst Corp. immediately became the odds-on favorite to buy
The Chronicle. Although Hearst published 12 other papers, notably
the Houston Chronicle and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, the
conglomerate has its roots in San Francisco, where founder William
Randolph Hearst published his first newspaper _ the Examiner. The
Chronicle was likely to become the corporation's new flagship
paper.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly 35 years, The Chronicle and the Hearst-owned Examiner
have operated under an exemption to federal antitrust laws that
allowed the two newspapers to combine their business, production
and distribution operations under a joint operating agreement while
maintaining separate editorial departments. The JOA, which requires
the newspapers to split all profits, also gave each paper the right
to match any bid for the purchase of the other.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of SALE27 (27409 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The likelihood that the Hearst Corp. would acquire The Chronicle
posed what the Fang family perceived to be a serious threat to the
Independent, their free, thrice-weekly newspaper. The family also
publishes Asian Week and several other Bay Area publications.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 12 years, the Independent has operated in the
shadow of the two dailies, protected, ironically, by the JOA, which
implicitly bars either daily from publishing a free neighborhood
newspaper without the other daily's consent. But if Hearst were to
acquire The Chronicle and close the Examiner, the JOA would
disappear, and the Independent could be exposed to new competition.
</P>
<P>
   To protect its business interests, the Fangs had sued The
Chronicle, Examiner and the San Francisco Newspaper Agency, which
manages noneditorial operations for the two papers, for allegedly
undercutting the Independent on prices for grocery ads and had sued
the Examiner and the agency for undercutting the Independent on
bids for the city's contract to publish legal and public notices.
</P>
<P>
   The first suit was settled out of court. In the second suit, the
Fangs won a $1.15 million award in 1996 _ plus $2.3 million in
legal fees _ but the verdict was eventually overturned on appeal
last year.
</P>
<P>
   When the Fangs learned that The Chronicle was up for sale, they
worried about what it could mean to them, and in July they began a
campaign to prevent the Hearst Corp. from buying the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   On July 13, the day before a Board of Supervisors' committee
urged the city attorney to investigate the sale, Independent
columnist Darrell Salomon demanded action from the U.S. Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``When JOA newspapers in a city seek to merge to become a
monopoly,'' he wrote, ``the nation's antitrust enforcers need a
wake-up call.''
</P>
<P>
   But while publicly raising questions about Hearst acquiring The
Chronicle, the Fangs were also laying plans to acquire the Examiner
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   In late July, Hearst officials contacted Veronis, Suhler &AMP;
Associates, a New York investment bank that specializes in media
and communications industries. The officials told VSA that as soon
as the corporation had a deal to buy The Chronicle, they would put
the Examiner up for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst told VSA that the sale would include the Examiner's
editorial staff, a list of its subscribers and advertisers, the
paper's archives and its name. No hard assets, such as printing
presses, office space, delivery trucks or news racks, were for
sale.
</P>
<P>
   On July 30, Hearst officials met with VSA to discuss a list of
prospective buyers, focusing on major newspaper publishing
companies. The list included the SF Bay Guardian, San Francisco
Magazine and the Independent as well as other Bay Area firms and
individuals that might be considered ``trophy buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   On August 6, Hearst announced that it had agreed to buy The
Chronicle. Hearst had offered $660 million for the paper, and the
de Young descendants had accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 15 minutes after the announcement was posted on the
Examiner's Web site, VSA began contacting potential buyers for the
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, Ted Fang called San Francisco financier and
civic leader Warren Hellman in Hellman's office at One Maritime
Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Fang had known Hellman for several years. With offices in Hong
Kong and Sydney, Australia, Hellman and his firm were involved in
businesses throughout the Far East. The financier also had
investments in media properties in the United States and Australia
and recently acquired a small stake in San Francisco Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of SALE27 (27409 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  One of the Bay Area's most influential businessmen, Hellman had
helped keep the San Francisco Giants baseball team in the city,
advised Stanford and the University of California at San Francisco
on the merger of their respective hospitals and counseled The
Chronicle's owners on the company's business operations.
</P>
<P>
   When Fang called, Hellman was eager to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ted said, `We think we ought to look at (buying) the Examiner.
What do you think?''' Hellman recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Sure.'''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Fang and Hellman, whose investment firm VSA would
contact as a potential buyer for the Examiner, discussed pursuing
the Examiner together, but Hellman declined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept saying, `You're not going to need me,''' Hellman
recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But Hellman said he agreed to serve as a ``nonpaid adviser'' to
the Fangs and stressed that his investment firm was not involved in
any way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a deal junkie,'' he said. ``I thought this would be
interesting and very possible.''
</P>
<P>
   With one of the Bay Area's most respected financial minds in
their corner, the Fangs turned to City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years, the Fangs have been one of the most
prominent and outspoken families in the city's rapidly growing
Asian community.
</P>
<P>
   Family patriarch John Fang was a journalist in pre-Communist
China before he fled to Taiwan. He immigrated to San Francisco in
the early 1950s and in 1960 brought his wife, Florence, to the
city.
</P>
<P>
   After attending the University of California at Berkeley and
then establishing a printing business, Fang founded a national
weekly publication called Asian Week in 1979. Eight years later, he
bought a small neighborhood tabloid called the Lake Merced
Independent and gave it to his 24-year-old son Ted as a birthday
present.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, a longtime neighborhood newspaper called the
San Francisco Progress folded. Ted Fang moved quickly to snatch up
its advertisers and began increasing the Independent's circulation,
making it a citywide paper. Today the Independent says it delivers
379,000 copies of the free paper each week.
</P>
<P>
   John Fang died in 1992, but his widow, Florence, remains one of
the most powerful figures in the city's Asian community and is a
member of the city's Film and Video Commission. Their son James,
who is married to the daughter of the former mayor of Shanghai,
runs Asian Week and is an elected member of the BART board.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, the Fangs have used the Independent and
the Asian community's increasing political clout to forge strong
and far-reaching political connections. The Independent practices
what it calls advocacy journalism, using news stories to advance
the Fang family's views.
</P>
<P>
   In the city's 1991 mayoral race, the Fangs threw their support
behind former Police Chief Frank Jordan. With the help of the
Independent's endorsement _ as well as $150,000 in contributions
raised by the Fangs _ Jordan defeated incumbent Mayor Art Agnos.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after taking office, Jordan appointed James Fang to the
$65,000-a-year post of international trade director. But when the
Examiner reported that Fang had lied on his resume, claiming a law
degree he didn't have, the appointment turned into an embarrassment
for Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Before Jordan could fire Fang, though, brother Ted marched into
the mayor's office and, according to Jordan's former press
secretary Stephen Bloom, ``looked the mayor straight in the face
and said, `Frank, if you are asking James to resign, that will not
happen. Our family will not allow that to happen.'''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't, but the Fangs apparently never forgot Jordan's
hesitation to support James in the resume furor. And in 1995, when
Assembly Speaker Willie Brown announced he would run for mayor
against Jordan, the Fangs became early Brown supporters.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of SALE27 (27409 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  The Fangs were not alone in shifting their allegiance to Brown.
Jordan's campaign manager Jack Davis, the flamboyant and often
controversial political strategist, signed on to run Brown's
campaign, and that December Brown easily defeated Jordan in a
runoff.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had long been close to the Fang family, and with Brown's
election, the Fangs knew they could depend on two of the most
powerful men in the city's Democratic political machine to watch
out for their interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``People perceive me, rightfully, as a warlord for the Fang
family interests,'' Davis told The Chronicle late last year. ``Look
out to anyone who tries to harm their interests. They have to come
through me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs' endorsements were not only shrewd politically, they
also made good business sense.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Fangs supported former Supervisor Terence Hallinan
in his successful campaign for the district attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   As a supervisor, Hallinan worked diligently to help the
Independent win the city's contract to publish legal and other
public notices, advertising that last year the city budgeted at
more than $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   With Hallinan's help, the Fangs placed a measure on the November
1994 ballot that allowed the city to consider minority status and
other criteria in addition to cost when awarding the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed, and the next year the Board of Supervisors
awarded the contract to the Independent, even though a bid by the
Examiner was more than $200,000 lower.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 and 1997, the Fangs received more than $1 million in
federal job-generating loans through the mayor's community
development program. But after federal officials questioned whether
a sufficient number of jobs were created, the Fangs agreed to
reimburse a portion of the money.
</P>
<P>
   And last June the airport commission, whose members are
appointed by Brown, approved a $1 million, five-year lease for
office space in a Fang family building in Burlingame, even though
the airport terminal had space available. Airport officials said it
is often more economical to lease outside space for offices not
needed at the airport.
</P>
<P>
   When Hearst announced in August that it was buying The Chronicle
and selling the Examiner, the Fangs believed that they again could
count on City Hall for support.
</P>
<P>
   And Mayor Brown swung into action immediately, convinced that no
one would buy the Examiner under the terms offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first heard the news, I exploded,'' Brown said. ``I
said, `No way! This has to be a two-newspaper town.'''
</P>
<P>
   He called the White House, then fired off a letter to the
Justice Department, asking it not to approve The Chronicle's sale
until all anti-trust issues had been investigated and all options
for finding a buyer of the Examiner had been exhausted. He said he
was particularly worried about the deal's potential effect on the
Independent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early termination of the Joint Operating Agreement,'' he wrote
in his August 20 letter, ``... would result not only in the
immediate closing of the city's second daily newspaper, but also
threaten the existence of the city's third major newspaper as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, the same day the Board of Supervisors
unanimously passed a resolution asking the Justice Department to
take a closer look at the deal, Attorney General Janet Reno called
Brown back.
</P>
<P>
   They talked twice that day, Brown recalled. ``She said that they
would investigate (the sale) thoroughly.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 4 of SALE27 (27409 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  In late August, Ted Fang spoke with San Francisco political
consultant Dennis Collins on the telephone. Fang told Collins he
wanted someone to organize community groups against the sale, and
he asked if Collins would be interested.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was. One of his first moves was to form Stop the
Monopoly, an organization led unofficially by James Fang and
Supervisor Michael Yaki, a longtime Fang family friend and the
sponsor of the Board of Supervisor's resolution calling on the
Justice Department to take a hard look at the sale.
</P>
<P>
   On September 3, the Stop the Monopoly coalition held a press &LR; 
 &LR; news conference on the steps of City Hall, where Yaki, Supervisor
Mabel Teng and other Asian American leaders worried publicly that a
monopoly paper would give their community short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Francisco deserves to know what kind of a newspaper they
(the Hearst Corp. and The Chronicle) are thinking about,'' Yaki
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Fangs stepped up their crusade against the sale
in the Independent, which, they insisted, would be the Hearst
Corp.'s primary target.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Independent makes no bones about its self-preserving
instincts on this issue,'' read an editorial in the August 24
issue. ``The Hearst Corp. would use its postmerger monopoly power
to put out a free, home-delivered newspaper, once again attacking
the Independent, attempting to squash competing voices and
attempting to possess the only editorial voice in town.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next several months, the paper and its sister
publication, Asian Week, would deliver the same theme in stories,
editorials and write-in campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   On August 26, the Independent published a ``stop-the-monopoly
rainbow flag'' and a toll-free number for readers to call to
express support.
</P>
<P>
   On September 2, under a front-page banner headline ``Don't Let
Yellow Journalism Monopolize San Francisco,'' the Independent
printed three pre-addressed, clip-out letters _ one each in
English, Spanish and Chinese _ for readers to send to Reno, urging
the attorney general to block The Chronicle sale.
</P>
<P>
   And on September 7, the Independent debuted a full-page feature
titled ``The Hearst Chronicles,'' which included a new comic strip,
``The Life and Times of `Mr. Sharon Stone,''' an often vulgar
put-down of Examiner Executive Editor Phil Bronstein, who is
married to actress Sharon Stone.
</P>
<P>
   On their editorial pages, the Fangs continued to insist that the
motivation for their campaign to block The Chronicle sale was
survival. And they played down any interest in acquiring the
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fangs haven't ruled out such a dream (of buying the
Examiner) for the long term,'' said a September 2 article in Asian
Week, ``but (the Fangs) say they've had little chance to
contemplate it. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Fang, meanwhile, had been in telephone or written contact
with VSA, the investment bank retained by Hearst, since the day the
Chronicle sale was announced.
</P>
<P>
   During August, he had signed a standard confidentiality
agreement, had received a 47-page prospectus on all aspects of the
Examiner, and he had even made a tentative bid that was ``offering
a wide range of $1 million to $15 million,'' according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   By early September, VSA had contacted or had been contacted by
81 potential buyers for the Examiner, but only Fang and four others
sent VSA formal indications of interest.
</P>
<P>
   One of the interested parties, a private investor from
Philadelphia, quickly dropped out, according to court documents.
Two others, Spanish Broadcasting Systems and New Times Inc.,
publishers of SF Weekly, were interested in assets that were not
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 5 of SALE27 (27409 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  A fourth interested party was Leucadia National Corp., a New York
company working with Forward Newspapers, a national Jewish
publication. But Leucadia dropped out when company officials and
Hearst could not agree on the length of an ``exclusive negotiating
period.''
</P>
<P>
   The most serious interest was expressed by the Fangs'
Independent Newspaper Group.
</P>
<P>
   On September 8, Ted Fang visited a ``data room'' in the offices
of the Hearst Corp.'s lawyers and reviewed documents that described
virtually every aspect of the Examiner's operation, down to and
including the carrier routes used to deliver the papers.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Ted Fang and his lawyers met with Examiner
executives.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiations soon broke down. The Fangs, however, were not
discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``All auctions usually start unrealistically,'' said Hellman,
their financial adviser.
</P>
<P>
   By offering the Examiner for sale voluntarily, Hearst officials
believed they had done more than federal law required, and when no
buyer stepped forward, Hearst thought it would soon receive Justice
Department approval to complete the deal for The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   But since June, City Attorney Louise Renne had been
investigating the proposed deal. She was determined to do
everything she could to preserve two editorial voices in the city
and wanted to get an early start on the legal implications of The
Chronicle sale.
</P>
<P>
   A former San Francisco supervisor, Renne was elected city
attorney in 1989 and had earned a reputation as a self-starter
willing to take on big business. She had been one of the first city
attorneys to sue the tobacco companies and had wrung a $187.5
million settlement for the city from the Bank of America in a
municipal bond fraud suit.
</P>
<P>
   Informed during the summer that Hearst was the most likely buyer
of The Chronicle, she assigned two of her top attorneys to look at
possible antitrust issues. She hired an outside law firm, San
Francisco's Townsend, Townsend and Crew, to help.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Hearst announced on August 6 that it had an
agreement to purchase The Chronicle, Renne's office had already
researched many of the relevant legal issues.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect of challenging the deal in court did not look good.
Time constraints, precedents and the law itself seemed to favor the
proposed deal.
</P>
<P>
   Further, an antitrust lawsuit against Hearst would take enormous
resources that the city would not have without Justice Department
help. And in 12 previous cases in which joint operating agreements
between two papers were dissolved, the antitrust division of the
Justice Department had offered little opposition.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, the Justice Department's antitrust division
had clearly become more aggressive, led by a tough 53-year-old
assistant attorney general named Joel Klein. Since his appointment
as head of the division in 1996, Klein had stepped up federal
enforcement of antitrust law, taking on airlines, defense
contractors, credit card companies, agribusiness, even foreign
vitamin manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   But Klein's biggest case was against software giant Microsoft,
and his prosecutors were winning it.
</P>
<P>
   Renne contacted Klein and they quickly developed a working
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Renne had a good rapport with Klein,'' said one lawyer in the
city attorney's office. ``That helped a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But time was running short.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, the Justice Department had just 30 days after
receiving formal notification of The Chronicle sale to decide
whether to let the deal proceed. In early September, the department
sent a formal notice to the Hearst Corp. informing the company that
the agency intended to take a closer look at the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst had thought it was on the fast track, but now the process
slowed to a crawl.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 6 of SALE27 (27409 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Meanwhile, public opposition to the Hearst purchase of The
Chronicle was building steadily in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   On behalf of the Fangs, Collins continued to solicit support
from the city's neighborhood groups, merchants' organizations and
political clubs, prodding them to pass resolutions, write Attorney
General Reno, testify at public hearings and pressure local
officials.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen organizations eventually went on record
opposing the sale and supporting a federal antitrust investigation.
Those groups ranged from the San Francisco Democratic County
Central Committee to the city's Small Business Advisory Commission
and the Harvey Milk Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual Transgender Democratic
Club.
</P>
<P>
   It was an impressive coalition of disparate interests, but as it
leaked out that the Fang family was angling to buy the Examiner,
some members were outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``People felt used,'' said Gwenn Craig, a member of the Harvey
Milk club. ``I don't think this is what they had in mind when they
said they wanted a two-newspaper town.''
</P>
<P>
   The club had passed a resolution in September opposing a merger.
The club went so far as to later pass a second resolution harshly
criticizing the Independent for its biased political coverage
during the 1999 campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Other critics questioned whether Collins and the Stop the
Monopoly coalition had violated the city's ethics codes by
appearing before city agencies such as the Small Business Advisory
Commission and the Board of Supervisors, trying to persuade them to
oppose the merger but not registering as lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Critics charged that the appearances constituted lobbying under
the city's administrative code, which requires public disclosure of
the individuals behind the organization and the exact purpose of
their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   The rules are subject to interpretation, but according to the
San Francisco Ethics Commission, any entity that spends at least
$3,200 a quarter to influence local legislative or administrative
action must register and pay $300 _ or face fines of up to $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Fangs paid Collins more than $3,200 a quarter for his work
on their behalf, sources confirm.
</P>
<P>
   In October, Common Cause, a public-interest group, asked the
city's Ethics Commission to investigate. The commission has not
taken any action in the case and refuses to discuss it publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Collins says it never occurred to him that he was lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not lobbying for any financial gain,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., as it became clear that no one was
interested in buying the Examiner under the terms offered by the
Hearst Corp., the Justice Department's position began to harden.
</P>
<P>
   To attract a buyer for the Examiner, the government said, the
Hearst Corp. would have to offer a part of the JOA, which would
guarantee any new owner ``cash flow'' until the agreement ended in
2005 and prepare the new Examiner to compete with The Chronicle
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   But Hearst officials resisted.
</P>
<P>
   They believed that under federal antitrust law no company could
be forced to keep a failing enterprise going. Without the revenues
from the JOA, the Examiner would have been a money-losing operation
for years, they said. And they were adamant that no buyer would be
allowed to acquire the Examiner's share of the JOA.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was strictly nonnegotiable,'' said one Hearst official.
</P>
<P>
   Within the Justice Department, prosecutors agreed that the terms
of the Hearst offer of the Examiner were clearly insufficient to
attract a credible buyer. But there was considerable internal
debate about how hard the government could push Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 7 of SALE27 (27409 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``This was not an easy one,'' one department insider said.
</P>
<P>
   But the department hard-liners were winning, and they were
building a case to block the deal. First, they looked at the
earlier cities where JOAs had been dissolved and one newspaper
remained. The economic data from those cities convinced them that
they could make a solid case that such deals resulted in higher
advertising rates and were anticompetitive under federal antitrust
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Then on October 15, their case grew stronger when a federal
judge in Hawaii blocked Gannett Pacific Corp. from buying a rival
newspaper in Honolulu and closing it. Though the Hawaii case
differed in many ways from the proposed Chronicle deal, said one
justice department official, the judge had issued an opinion that
supported several key positions in the department's case against
the Hearst Corp. And in November, a federal appeals court let the
judge's decision stand.
</P>
<P>
   By this time, seven Justice Department attorneys _ all but one
operating out of the Washington office _ were assigned to the
Hearst case, and the department began preparing for trial.
</P>
<P>
   In December, at the government's request, the Hearst Corp. and
Chronicle Publishing Co. turned over 174 boxes of documents.
Meanwhile, in New York and San Francisco, top executives from both
companies submitted to days of intensive questioning under oath
from Justice Department attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to rough them up,'' said one official inside the
department, ``and let them know we were going to play hardball.''
</P>
<P>
   As the end of the year approached, the issue came to a head.
Hearst officials were eager to conclude negotiations with the
government and complete their acquisition of The Chronicle. But the
federal prosecutors held firm, insisting that Hearst had to offer
better sale terms for the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had an outstanding case prepared, and we felt if we went to
trial we'd beat the hell out of (the Hearst Corp.),'' said one of
the government's lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before Christmas, Hearst told investment bank VSA to
prepare another sale offer for the Examiner on terms more favorable
to a potential buyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been delicious on our part to take it to
trial,'' said a Hearst executive. ``But the government has all the
time in the world and unlimited resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials also were surprised by how informed key
players in San Francisco were about events in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just amazed at how much Jack Davis and the Fangs
seemed to know,'' said the Hearst executive. ``They were somehow
wired in.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis and Ted Fang did not respond to requests for interviews
for this story.

 ART IS FINE, BUT NOT THE SEXY KINE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Cowabunga, so to speak, there's an art
censorship story brewing in the wine country.
</P>
<P>
   The artist is Catherine Anderson, and she's big on cows. That's
not her only subject, but she paints a lot of cows.
</P>
<P>
   All of them naked.
</P>
<P>
   Bare-naked cows have helped make Anderson famous. Her paintings
hang in prestigious collections, galleries and museums all over the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But this is about where her paintings will  &UR; not  &LR; hang: in The
Lodge at Sonoma.
</P>
<P>
   The Lodge at Sonoma, due to open this fall, is a four-star
resort that is part of Renaissance Hotels and Resorts, which is a
division of Marriott.
</P>
<P>
   The Lodge people are busy buying the work of local artists.
Anderson is a local artist. The Lodge first considered buying her
painting of a row of cows in a field, but someone upstairs decided
the painting was ... well, it just wasn't, you know, right. There
were too many bovine back porches involved.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel decided it wanted instead Anderson's painting of some
baby cows, faces forward. But that painting was sold, so Anderson
brought the hotel people a third work titled ``Fresh Air.''
</P>
<P>
   A hotel representative accepted the painting and gave Anderson a
check.
</P>
<P>
   But soon afterward, the woman phoned Anderson and told her that
the painting could not be hung at the hotel because one of the cows
is in a ``provocative position.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson was stunned and flummoxed. She had never thought of her
paintings as cow porn.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's reply was, basically: ``Provocative?
 &UR; Provocative!? &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, said the hotel woman, we really want to hang your work,
but not this one. We want to swap.
</P>
<P>
   A representative for whoever makes final art decisions for the
hotel told me, ``We want to be careful not to have paintings that
might be construed as even slightly, remotely offensive to
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   She also told me, ``The Lodge has guidelines for the artwork.
One of the guidelines is no animals in provocative positions.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a hotel that covers its, uh, bases.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson says: ``It's sick.''
</P>
<P>
   The artist says she absolutely will not swap paintings. Her
artistic sensibility has been offended. She will not be cowed, so
to speak. She will not kowtow to the Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Now the hotel has a bigger problem. The cows Anderson painted
are still right there in Sonoma, moseying around their pastures,
naked, ready to do to Lodge guests what cows do: Mooooon.
</P>
<P>
   TAHOE JOLTED by big quake?
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say it could happen, and it could cause 30-foot waves
to crush everything in sight.
</P>
<P>
   We can only hope that the big one hits during the watch of
current state Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush.
</P>
<P>
   If insurance companies try to screw Tahoe policyholders, Chuck
will come to the rescue by demanding that the companies pay for
silly TV commercials featuring Chuck and Bay Area big-wave surfing
superstar Flea Virostko.
</P>
<P>
   REMEMBER WHEN the worst thing elected public officials did was
smoke crack?
</P>
<P>
   FLYING FROM LaPaz to Tijuana on Aero California, Chuck Brown
noticed the advertisement printed on his ticket envelope.
</P>
<P>
   It was an AT&AMP;T ad, bold red letters: ``Go down in history.''
</P>
<P>
   THE N.Y. TIMES calls El Camino Real in Palo Alto ``the Champs
Elysees of the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   And that would make the historic old radio tower in front of
Dinah's Garden Hotel the Eiffel Tower of Hightechtown.
</P>
<P>
   Please be careful when home-shopping in Silicone Valley, where
there is no longer any connection between realty and reality. Jerry
Matters notes, ``Because of sticker shock, Realtors now carry
condiments _ smelling salts and pepper spray. No Mace as yet (he
adds gingerly), but give them thyme.''
</P>
<P>
   YOU KNOW you're old, and totally unhip, if you refer to
cinematic previews of coming attractions as ``previews.''
</P>
<P>
   The proper term, of course, is ``trailers,'' although they don't
trail anything.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Delacorte wonders, ``Are all trailers now aimed at 13- to
24-year-old males? Or do trailer producers simply compete with one
another to see how many images, how much violent action, how many
incredibly loud noises they can cram into three minutes? Not to
mention that the trailers tend to be cinematic Cliff Notes.''
</P>
<P>
   Delacorte had a lot more to say. That's just a preview.
</P>
<P>
   WELSH TEEN SONGBIRD Charlotte Church taped a concert for A&AMP;E at
the Masonic last week, and Haley Joe Osment served as the program's
host. Osment is the 12-year-old who was nominated for an Oscar for
``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Osment mentioned that although he's an L.A. guy, he loves the
Giants and the 49ers. He told Jeff Knollmiller that he has a
football autographed by Jerry Rice and would love to attend a 49ers
game.
</P>
<P>
   Nice young man, but wouldn't it be kind of creepy to have him in
the stands? You know the 49ers are going to struggle this year,
anyway, and here's a kid who sees dead people.

   CHECHNYA-ORPHANS (Nadterechnoye, Russia) _ When Russian bombs
rained down on Grozny last fall, the city's only orphanage moved to
this small town in northern Chechnya. It was supposed to have been
a temporary stay. But seven months later the orphanage is still
here in a cramped former schoolhouse. And nobody can say when it
might move back. By Michael R. Gordon.

   MATH-SCHOOLS (Undated) _ Three years ago, one of New York City's
most innovative school districts set out to tackle a nagging
problem: the math phobia that afflicts many students, and the
disparity between the test scores of white middle-class and Asian
students and their poorer black and Hispanic counterparts. The
district, stretching from the wealthy Upper East Side to immigrant
Chinatown, embraced a new ``constructivist'' curriculum without
textbooks, which preaches that it is more important for children to
construct their own solutions than to learn the standard
theoretical rules. Now the district is at the center of a rebellion
by parents, mathematicians and many mathematics teachers over how
to teach math that has shaken the education establishment from New
York City to Plano, Texas, and Lincoln, Mass. A special report by
Anemona Hartocollis.

   SCI-COSMOLOGY (Undated) _ Astronomers are both elated and
puzzled over the first clear pictures ever taken of the infant
universe, before stars and galaxies formed and space was filled
with hot, turbulent gases. The images, produced by a balloon-borne
telescope that captured radiation emitted when the universe was a
mere 300,000 years old, were unveiled Wednesday at a NASA press
briefing. The images, which are being published in the journal
Nature, along with a separate commentary, hold both reassurance and
surprises for scientists trying to understand how the universe came
about in what they believe was a giant explosion, called the Big
Bang, some 13 billion years ago. By James Glanz.

   OBIT-MERRICK (Undated) _ David Merrick, the producer whose gift
for creating Broadway hits was matched only by his genius for
attracting publicity and making enemies, died Wednesday in his
sleep at St. George's Rest Home in London. He was 88. By Frank
Rich.
</P>
<P>
   CUBAN-BOY-MIAMI (Miami) _ After Elian: Who wins, who loses in
Miami? The mayors may have won with their constituents, but lost on
a national stage. The federal government did not trust them enough
to notify them of the raid. The Miami relatives will go into the
May 11 court hearing without the advantage of actually having Elian
in their possession. By Rick Bragg.

   PASSOVER-RESORTS (Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.) _ They're a far cry and
a long way from the Catskills. Luxury resorts around the world a

   MICROSOFT-SPLIT (Undated) _ The government faces a formidable
legal challenge in trying to persuade a federal judge to split up
Microsoft, but not an insurmountable one by any means, according to
antitrust experts. ``It would be somewhat of a stretch, but I think
the breakup that has been suggested is consistent with the broad
and flexible historical legal standard in antitrust,'' said William
Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University Law
School. By Steve Lohr.
</P>
<P>
   TAUBMAN-AUCTION (Undated) _ A. Alfred Taubman, 75, the shopping
mall magnate who has made a second career out of rescuing
companies-in-distress from the arms of unwelcome suitors, resigned
in February as chairman and is now stepping down as a director of
Sotheby's, the venerable auction house. The Sotheby's story
threatens to overshadow a life that might well qualify as a Horatio
Alger story come true. By Leslie Eaton.

   AT&AMP;T-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Individual investors who have been
frustrated in recent years as they have tried to buy into hot
initial offerings of high-technology stocks may be in for a
pleasant surprise Thursday. While AT&AMP;T's sale of shares meant to
track the company's far-flung wireless communications unit will be
the nation's richest initial offering yet, the sheer size of the
deal, 360 million shares, appears to have conspired with the recent
market turmoil to ensure that the offering will be warm at best. By
Seth Schiesel.
</P>
<P>
   GRADS-ECONSCENE (Undated) _ Until recently, there was a
consensus among economists that students who attend more selective
colleges _ ones with tougher admissions standards _ land better
paying jobs as a result. Having smart, motivated classmates and a
prestigious degree were thought to enhance learning and give
students access to job networks. But is it true? By Alan B.
Krueger.

Consumers may have often suspected computer companies of trying to
pick their pockets. Now the companies are trying to fill them.
Small enough to slip into a shirt pocket or purse, handheld
computers are appearing with capabilities that go far beyond their
original task of organizing personal information. Once viewed as
Silicon Valley fashion accessories, geek toys and portable
sidekicks for desktop computers, these miniature computers are
reaching for a broader consumer audience as they add power and an
expanded repertoire of tricks. By Peter H. Lewis.

   JUNKYARD ( Baxter, Ga.) _ ``This probably won't be too thrilling
to you, a wrecking yard like this,'' Franklin Ray said, stepping
out of his jumbled homemade house and leading the way through piles
of tires and aluminum cans, decades of rusting cars and tractors,
entwined in wisteria and wild grapevines, sunk to their hubcaps in
years of pine needles and magnolia leaves. ``Daddy, what are you
going to do with this boat?'' Janisse Ray, a poet and nature
writer, asked, narrowing her dark eyes at a cabin cruiser blocking
her path. ``Who knows?'' he said, walking past a tricycle perched
on a 1958 Chevrolet Biscayne. Ms. Ray, 37, was born in this
junkyard. In her first book, ``Ecology of a Cracker Childhood,''
part memoir, part clarion call to save the longleaf pine, published
in December by Milkweed Editions, she casts a loving but
unflinching eye on growing up poor and fundamentalist in southeast
Georgia, with mental illness snaking through her clan like a dark
tributary of the Altamaha River. Her daddy ran the junkyard (he
still does), and his quicksilver mind could just as easily
resurrect a dead machine as answer the voice of God. By Ann Raver.
</P>
<P>
   DECORATOR-SHOWCASE (New York) _ You would become a white wine
drinker pretty quickly if you lived in the Kips Bay Boys and Girls
Club Decorator Showhouse, as I did for three days last weekend. Or
straight vodka. You'd think twice about chocolate ice cream. The
28th annual showhouse, open through May 21, is packed to its
sixth-story rafters with white lampskin and goatskin rugs, pale
linen walls, cream-colored microfiber, ivory silk and white-peach
velvet. Red burgundy and bordeaux drinkers: check your weapons at
the door. Lotus-eaters, step right in. By William L. Hamilton.

   MOMA-SCULPTURE (New York) _ ``They were expecting some kind of
experimental house like the one I built in Kobe,'' said the
architect Shigeru Ban last Monday, referring to the cardboard `log'
houses he designed, along with a paper church, for victims of the
earthquake in 1995. But Ban proposed something unexpected: a
soaring lattice arch made of cardboard tubes, which covers about a
third of the Sculpture Garden of the Museum of Modern Art. Weighing
six tons and spanning 87 feet, it has a lightness of being, a
kinetic energy. And even though it is solidly bolted in place, it
looks like a giant box kite about to snap its string and take off
into the sky. By Ann Raver.

GALAXY, CHIVAS PLAY TO 1-1 DRAW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ For a night at least, the Rose Bowl looked like
Jalisco Stadium _ the red, white and blue-dressed fans not decked
out because of American patriotism, but because Chivas Rayadas de
Guadalajara was in town Wednesday to face the Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't a surprise. Next to the Dodgers and Lakers, Chivas is
probably the most popular team in Los Angeles, having won 10
Mexican League championships and a pride that runs deep because
Guadalajara is known for fielding only Mexican players _ not highly
paid foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite playing in home-away-from-home conditions, Chivas
could only manage a 1-1 draw, failing to beat the Galaxy for the
third consecutive match, in front of 20,688.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy nearly won the game in regulation after Clint Mathis'
goal in the 22nd minute, but Chivas' Manuel Rios scored in the 90th
minute to tie the score. In two other matches, the Galaxy beat
Chivas 4-2 in penalty kicks in 1997 and 3-1 last year at the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   On the international stage, the Galaxy record moved to 3-5-2 in
five seasons, which includes two victories over Chivas, a 4-1
victory over Santos Laguna (Mexico) and draws against El Salvador's
national team and Aston Villa of the English Premiership.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid said that the difference between Chivas
and other Mexican clubs compared to MLS teams is closing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year a lot of people felt we won against Chivas, but they
didn't bring their best players,'' said Schmid. ``Tonight they
played it like us, some guys in, some guys out; it was the same for
both teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we've shown we can play with teams like that and
compete. Now if we played five more times, who would win that
series? I don't know. But that's the nice point about it, I don't
know. It used to be that people assumed automatically that if a
U.S. team played a Mexican team the quality of Chivas, you had no
chance. I don't think that's the case anymore. We can hold our own
and play with them.''
</P>
<P>
   MLS all-stars Cobi Jones and Robin Fraser were out of town
Wednesday, in Moscow as the U.S. national team lost to Russia 2-0.
Jones and Fraser will rejoin the team in time for Saturday's game
against New York/New Jersey and former coach Octavio Zambrano at
Giants Stadium. &QL;

SQUEEZE DIDN'T WORK BUT IT SHOWS HOW MARINERS ARE DIFFERENT TEAM 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Mariners' first workday matinee at Safeco turned out to be a
long day's journey into night.
</P>
<P>
   But, oh, what a night.
</P>
<P>
   And what a game.
</P>
<P>
   Where do we begin to tell the story?
</P>
<P>
   Definitely not at the end, which saw Cleveland score two runs in
the top of the 10th to beat the M's, 5-3. That doesn't matter,
really.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, let us start with the squeeze play. That is the heart
of the matter, since it is not every day you see a suicide squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, in fact, was another such day.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners came close. Oh, so close. And there is a great
deal to be said for attempting the gutsy move.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the Mariners are already racking up juicy TV and
radio ratings and why, if small ball and near-perfectly executed
games such as Wednesday's continue, this is going to be a summer of
fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``You lay it down, you win the ballgame,'' Mariners manager Lou
Piniella said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Dejected? Yes, the Mariners were a little quiet in their locker
room after their awesome, old-time baseball fantasia turned into a
loss.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite some low voices and a few hanging heads, nearly
everyone involved in the game was found to be capable of cracking a
smile, even when it came to talking about the failed squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like having money on the red and the black on the
roulette table. You score on the squeeze play, you win. If you
don't, you've still got runners on second and third with another
chance to score,'' Piniella said, laughing in hindsight. ``And then
you come up with double zeroes.''
</P>
<P>
   If there has to be losing, the Mariners will take this kind of
losing.
</P>
<P>
   It was epic, with home run-robbing catches by Kenny Lofton,
double plays from Omar Vizquel and Roberto Alomar good enough for
Hall of Fame highlight reels. There was a no-hitter taken into the
seventh inning by Cleveland's Jaret Wright, whose father once
pitched a no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   It was eventful, with a homer from Alex Rodriguez and a
ninth-inning rally that had Safeco Field feeling like it was
playoff time.
</P>
<P>
   It was everything and more you could wish for in a big-league
affair, right down to the suicide squeeze _ a bit of baseball
trickery that Piniella has been aching to put in play. Now he can,
thanks to a suddenly versatile, patient, small ball-minded club.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella has been waiting a long time for days like Wednesday.
And the payoff was almost as sweet as it was exciting and tense.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the ninth, with the Mariners having just tied
Cleveland at 3 on Jay Buhner's RBI single, the sacks were loaded
when Piniella sent Carlos Hernandez in to pinch run for John Olerud
at third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew right away what it was. It was the squeeze play. It was
not too easy to bunt but it was the chance to do it. It was fun,''
Hernandez said afterward.
</P>
<P>
   With 37,086 spectators on their feet and every player on both
sides tingling in anticipation, Hernandez took the sign and waited
for Paul Shuey to deliver the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   When the Cleveland hurler released the ball, the Mariners rookie
was three-quarters the way down the line, his body straining toward
home, when the batter, David Bell, nudged his bat over the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Time stood still.
</P>
<P>
   Until the ball landed in the catcher's glove.
</P>
<P>
   Uh oh, big trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I missed the bunt,'' said Bell, attempting to be stoic but
clearly feeling crummy for what happened, especially since he then
ended the inning by getting punched out on a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty simple to analyze. I didn't get the bunt down.
That's the point of a squeeze play,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Bell had failed to make contact and Hernandez, almost falling
toward the plate, tried to scramble back. It was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nowhere to go,'' said Hernandez, who was tagged out
at third, where Buhner now occupied the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella was asked if maybe the ball came in too high for Bell
to handle. The skipper smiled, not angry or upset, just still
racing with the idea that such a magnificent game almost ended on
the most exciting call he could make.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, it was a good pitch to bunt. It was a curve. They're a
little softer pitch. You can really deaden the ball,'' Piniella
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good play. It didn't work. What are you going to
do?''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the M's ended their second homestand of the season
with a 12-8 record and an early season competitive ability to keep
up with the Indians, the Yankees and the Red Sox, Piniella is
heartened.
</P>
<P>
   It's early, yes. But games like Wednesday's show the M's are
different, they're better, they're in it to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a heck of a ballgame. The game was played well
defensively. The pitching was excellent. I saw as many great
defensive plays as I've seen in any game I've watched,'' Piniella
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, that was fun to watch. This is what major league
baseball is all about. The pitchers weren't wild. They made the
hitters hit the ball. The players behind them made great plays.
There was power hitting. There was two-out hitting. We didn't lose
the game. We got beat.''
</P>
<P>
   And he wasn't done.
</P>
<P>
   ``I commend the way my kids are playing their butts off,''
Piniella said. ``They're playing good, aggressive baseball and if
we continue to play the way we have, we're going to be just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   One day, that squeeze play's going to work, which is why we'll
keep watching.

ANDERSON BACK IN FORM FOR ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Garret Anderson simply needed a day to smell the,
well, the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   A reluctant but slumping Anderson was put in the designated
hitter spot Wednesday by Angels manager Mike Scioscia, a chance to
give him some rest but keep him in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson looked refreshed in his first at-bat, slugging a pitch
from Detroit Tigers starter C.J. Nitkowski into the right-field
seats for a two-run homer in the second inning, sparking the Angels
to a 6-1 victory before 16,153 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's homer would have been enough for Angels starter Scott
Schoeneweis, who bounced back from a poor outing in Tampa Bay to
improve to 4-0. Schoeneweis went eight innings, gave up one run and
five hits and lowered his ERA to 3.06. He struck out three and
walked only one, the Tigers' only run scoring on Deivi Cruz's home
run in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis got help from more than just Anderson. Troy Glaus
immediately followed Anderson's homer with one of his own, his
team-leading sixth of the season. And Mo Vaughn added a two-run
homer (No. 5) in the eighth inning for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis also benefited from the defense, particularly the
play on the left side of the infield by Glaus at third and Gary
DiSarcina at shortstop. They combined to field all 11 chances
cleanly. In all, 22 of the 24 outs Schoeneweis recorded didn't
leave the infield.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson didn't miss much in the outfield _ Darin Erstad made
only one putout in center field all night. So Anderson got his
chance to relax, even though he instinctively grabbed his glove to
go to the outfield a couple times after the third out was made.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson went into the game slumping, having gone hitless in 10
at-bats and his batting average dipping to .247. The reason for his
recent slide is open for debate, but whatever the reason, Scioscia
thought Wednesday would be a good day to put Anderson in the DH
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to get his legs a little break,'' Scioscia said. ``I
think this guy has really been pushing himself to excel, probably a
little too much. It's a good time to get a little breather. The
beauty of it is he still can get his at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a discussion before the game that basically was along
the lines of, `Hey Garret. You don't have to hold the weight of the
whole club on your shoulders. Just relax and play the game.'''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson recently signed a four-year, $20 million contract
extension, so he has nothing to prove other than showing the club
he's worth the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometime you push against the wall, and you need to take a
step back so you can just walk through the door,'' Scioscia said.
``I don't want him to feel any pressure to carry the club.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, however, said an early-season slump isn't unusual and
he hasn't been feeling any added pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm pressing,'' said Anderson, whose three
homers have all come against lefties. ``I go through this every
year early in the season. But you guys know how it always ends
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson went into the season with a lifetime average of .300,
and he's never hit below .285.
</P>
<P>
   For Schoeneweis, the game was typical of his other victories. He
kept the ball down and got batters to hit the ball on the ground.
However, his biggest out of the game was a fly ball in the sixth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels led 3-1 but the Tigers had two on with two out and
Juan Gonzalez at the plate. Pitching coach Bud Black came to the
mound, and after a brief chat, Schoeneweis got Gonzalez to fly out
to right field to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's money,'' Schoeneweis said of Black. ``Every time he comes
out to talk like that, it seems there's a double play or a clutch
out. Let him keep coming out. He's like Merlin.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia is most impressed with Schoeneweis' demeanor on the
mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy is really impressing me with his ability to stick
with his game plan,'' Scioscia said. ``He'll make slight
adjustments, but even if he gets touched up, he comes back and
makes a good pitch. That consistency builds his confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to keep doing what I'm doing, and stay locked
in,'' said Schoeneweis, whose four wins is tied for tops in the
American League with Pedro Martinez and Orlando Hernandez. ``The
team scores runs when I pitch and they play incredible defense for
me. That makes it real easy on me.'' &QL;

MARINERS JAMMED IN GEM, LOSE TO INDIANS IN EXTRA INNINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A game for the ages? Maybe not. But close.
</P>
<P>
   A game for the aging? Absolutely. No question.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran infielders Omar Vizquel and Roberto Alomar, both 32
going on 22, put on a symposium of the infield arts Wednesday,
making plays that took the breath away from the Seattle Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   Worse still from the Mariners' point of view, the
Omar-and-Roberto show took runs away from the Seattle offense. Runs
that kept the Mariners from putting the finishing touches on a
marvel of a ballgame.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of winning in nine innings, the Mariners lost 5-3 in 10
innings when Cleveland scored twice off usually invulnerable
reliever Arthur Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   It's true David Bell missed a squeeze bunt that could have won
the game in the ninth. And it's true the M's bullpen could have
saved the day by posting zero on the scoreboard somewhere in the
late going.
</P>
<P>
   It's equally true, however, that without the seamless play of
Vizquel and Alomar, the Mariners wouldn't have needed all the other
parts of the game to click.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept hitting balls that I thought they had no chance on,''
outfielder Stan Javier said. ``Then they made the plays _
unbelievable plays.''
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth inning, Alex Rodriguez lost a hit when Vizquel
tracked down a grounder from behind, jumped to his feet like a
Pop-Tart ready for the feasting and gunned the surprised Rodriguez
out at first.
</P>
<P>
   ``Watching them make plays like that makes a player like me
sick,'' M's second baseman Mark McLemore said, a wry grin spreading
over his face. ``They do it, and they make it look so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, John Olerud thought he'd given the Mariners the
lead with a homer, but Kenny Lofton climbed the wall to get his
glove into the fan zone, pulling the ball back into play. What
should have been two runs was nothing. But the plays that created
that nothing were something _ something spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lofton's shoulder may not be 100 percent, but there's nothing
wrong with his legs,'' McLemore said. ``The way he jumps, he can
create havoc out there. No one else on their roster can do what he
did right there. That changed the whole complexion of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to be outdone, Alomar saved his grace-under-fire performance
for the seventh inning, just after the Mariners, who'd been facing
a no-hitter at the hands of Cleveland's Jaret Wright for six
innings, had broken through to tie the score. Javier singled.
Rodriguez homered to center. Boom. Tie game, 2-all.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle didn't want to stop there. But Alomar stole a hit from
Olerud with a grass-grazing dive to stop a grounder for the first
out. Then, after Jay Buhner walked, Alomar went the other way,
diving in the dirt toward the middle of the diamond to scoop up a
Tom Lampkin grounder.
</P>
<P>
   He flipped the ball in the direction of the bag, where Vizquel
was floating. Vizquel held onto the ball only long enough to zip a
throw to first for an inning-ending double play so special that it
had the Mariners close to applauding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's great about those two is that they make all
the fundamental plays,'' Rodriguez said. ``Then, on top of that,
they make all the great plays like that one, too. But making the
fundamental plays is what separates them from guys who just make
the flashy plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland had a chance to win the game in regulation after Manny
Ramirez _ somehow when the Indians play the Mariners, it always
comes down to Ramirez _ homered off Jose Mesa in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle erased that deficit in the ninth. Rodriguez walked with
one out, and Olerud and Buhner singled, tying the game. When
Lampkin was hit by a Paul Shuey pitch, the bases were loaded. And
now, with just one out, it was the Mariners' chance to put the game
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our chance,'' manager Lou Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   Piniella put on the squeeze sign for the second pitch with Bell
batting. The Indians infield was in, but Cleveland seemed
completely unprepared for the squeeze. Bell, who'd put in hours of
time in spring training working on getting the bunt down, had a
curve from Shuey, a pitch that was all but grooved for bunting.
</P>
<P>
   Bell missed it. Pinch-runner Carlos Hernandez was out, caught in
a rundown between third and home. Suddenly the Indians were one out
away from forcing extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I've got to do is put the ball in play,'' Bell said. ``I
didn't. I'm not going to go out and strangle myself over it. If I
get a hit, we still win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell didn't, taking a called third strike. And in the top of
10th, Rhodes fell victim to a series of just-out-of-each singles by
the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Vizquel and Alomar could have gotten to the hits the
Indians converted into victory. No one else could.

RED SOX THROW A BASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Red Sox 14, Rangers 4)
</P>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Long before Boston caught onto his act, Brian
Daubach knew all about Carl Everett.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played against him my very first year in pro baseball, 1990,
in my very first game,'' Daubach said. ``Tampa Yankees versus the
Sarasota Mets. I remember being overmatched in that game. I went 0
for 2 with two strikeouts. I don't remember what Carl did, but I
knew who he was. You always notice the first-round picks,
especially the year they got drafted.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no overlooking Everett or Daubach Wednesday as they
led the Red Sox to 21 hits and a 14-4 beating of Texas. It gave the
Sox two wins in three games at The Ballpark, where they were mauled
three straight in their only visit last season.
</P>
<P>
   The Belleville Basher had four hits, including three doubles,
and scored three runs. The first double began a five-run rally with
two out in the first inning that set up Rangers starter Mark Clark
for a short workday, especially after he surrendered a three-run
home run to Everett, his seventh of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Daubach's last double instigated a four-run burst in the ninth
inning that included an RBI double by Everett, who also singled,
walked, and scored twice. The Sox center fielder also made an
over-the-shoulder backhand catch that mirrored the play he made the
night before. The only difference? The outfield fence was spared
having to absorb another body blow from the 6-foot, 215-pounder.
</P>
<P>
   It was the type of performance expected from Everett from the
day he first put on a uniform as the Yankees' No. 1 pick 10 years
ago. Back then, Daubach, taken in the 19th round by the Mets the
same year, was just another guy hoping for some attention. What's
surprising, Daubach said, are the parallels in the routes that have
brought them both to the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say in a way he's like me, because it took him a while to
develop,'' said Daubach, who lifted his average to .373, placing
him just behind Nomar Garciaparra (.386 after a 3-for-5 day) and
Everett (.377) on the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, he has a lot more tools, obviously, but things didn't
come easily for him, either. Now, he's to where the tools have just
taken over.''
</P>
<P>
   Sox lefthander Jeff Fassero, whose career appeared to have
touched bottom last fall when the Rangers didn't invite him back
after acquiring him from Seattle, benefited from his teammates'
offensive largesse. Fassero (2-1) gave up hits in each of the six
innings he worked, including three doubles and a two-run home run
by Pudge Rodriguez in the fifth. Manager Jimy Williams lifted him
with a 9-3 lead after a leadoff single in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the same as the other two guys (the brothers Martinez)
_ because of the layoff, he wasn't as sharp as he's going to be,''
said catcher Jason Varitek, who hit a 412-foot home run onto the
center-field lawn, singled, walked, and had a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he pitched well,'' said Varitek, pointing to the second
inning, when the Rangers had runners on second and third with no
out but failed to score. ``When your team scores some runs, and
then you're in a position to give up some runs and get out of a
jam, that's a total bust to the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who traded two-time American League MVP Juan
Gonzalez last winter, are reeling. They've lost 8 of 10, unsung
left fielder Rusty Greer is out after ankle surgery, outfielder
Gabe Kapler (who came from Detroit in the Gonzalez deal) is batting
.200, Clark has a 9.53 ERA after the shortest outing of his career
(1 1/3 innings), and the team's vaunted bullpen is 1-5 with just
two saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're struggling,'' Clark said, ``they hit everything.''
</P>
<P>
   No time to be in the Rangers' shoes. No time, it turns out, to
be in Daubach's shoes, either, after he hit three doubles in a game
for the first time in his career. Asked if he enjoyed the rare
opportunity to show off his wheels, he grimaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feet are hurting right now,'' he said. ``I broke in some
new shoes today. I guess that was a bad idea, because I ran the
bases so many times. But I'm not complaining. I'll take it.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: THE GOVERNMENT'S MICROSOFT STUMBLE
 &HT;    Moving in the (k) commentary and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, April 30.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More often than not, when you enter the 90-seat
chamber where U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson holds
court, you'll see a parade of prisoners in orange jumpsuits copping
pleas.
</P>
<P>
   During the 77 days when Jackson weighed the fate of the world's
largest software company, he would handle those criminal matters
early in the day, before the Microsoft antitrust trial convened and
the seats filled up.
</P>
<P>
   Government prosecutors once foresaw Jackson juggling his
criminal docket for years to come. Under such a formula, the judge
would serve as a sort of corporate truant officer, monitoring
Microsoft's conduct to bar any further illegal acts.
</P>
<P>
   The model for such a federal exercise could once be found just
down the hall from Jackson's courtroom, where in 1984 the late
Judge Harold Greene mapped out the negotiated breakup of the AT&AMP;T
telephone monopoly. Greene subsequently spent much of his time on
the bench framing the rules that the Baby Bells lived by.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, the government switched gears, dropping its earlier
reliance on a ``conduct'' remedy in favor of a ``structural'' one _
a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the change: a feeling that even after Jackson
ruled that Microsoft had abused its monopoly, the company refused
to bow its head. If all its appeals left Microsoft a loser in the
end, prosecutors envisioned still-obstinate executives giving the
judge a hard time.
</P>
<P>
   The signal for such a potential dark victory came from Steve
Ballmer, the hard-charging Harvard classmate of Bill Gates who took
over this year as Microsoft's chief executive officer. Even as
prosecutors focused on what items to put on Jackson's menu, Ballmer
came to town for a series of sales meetings. (The U.S. government
is Microsoft's biggest customer.)
</P>
<P>
   Between sales pitches, Ballmer met with reporters to tell them
how little he thought of the government's case and Jackson's
scathing verdict. ``We continue to believe absolutely that our
position will be vindicated in the end,'' he also told Microsoft's
employees via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Such a blatant lack of contrition sat poorly with Joel Klein,
the top government honcho in antitrust matters.
</P>
<P>
   Klein fretted about the split within his own ranks over how to
punish Microsoft; about a tanking high-tech securities market, a
drop fueled at least in part by the case and one that worried the
White House; the chance that Jackson would toss out whatever Klein
came up with; the chance that the appeals' courts would toss out
whatever Jackson came up with, and the chance that Klein would be
tossed out by a Republican president.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with all these pressures, Klein opted for a clean break.
The solution is easy to fathom, although, to be sure, there's a
problem.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing in the verdict that suggests Jackson would favor
a breakup. The trial record fails to reflect the notion that
dividing Microsoft into separate Windows and Office suite firms
would solve the antitrust issues raised by the case.
</P>
<P>
   So, likely as not, down the road, the orange-suited defendants
may still have to give way to Jackson's heavy Microsoft calendar.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Juvenile justice in black and white
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here's another study that tells us what we already know. Do you
suppose we'll pay attention this time? Not a chance. We'd have to
change some bad habits and give up some prejudices that, if not
exactly comforting, at least enjoy the cache of familiarity.
</P>
<P>
   ``And Justice for Some,'' a study commissioned by the Youth Law
Center and conducted by the National Council on Crime and
Delinquency, has found that at every step in the juvenile justice
system, minority kids are treated more harshly than white kids.
</P>
<P>
   If you are wondering where that grotesque disproportion of
African-American men in state and federal prisons comes from,
here's the starting point. From their first arrests as children,
the inequities visited on Latino and, especially, black kids begin
compounding.
</P>
<P>
   And Congress and President Clinton, grandstanding in this
election year, seem more or less literally hellbent on making
matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at some of these numbers and how they pile up:
</P>
<P>
   Black kids are 15 percent of the under-18 population, but
between 1990 and '98 _ the latest data _ black youths were 26
percent of juvenile arrests, 44 percent of youth detainees, 46
percent of young people tried as adults and 58 percent of youths
sent to adult prisons.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, 373 of every 100,000 black youths with no record were
incarcerated for their offense _ but only 59 of every 100,000 white
youth offenders were. Black youths are charged with 40 percent of
drug crimes, but 63 percent of all youths tried as adults for drug
crimes were black.
</P>
<P>
   Note: When white and black kids are charged for the same
offenses, blacks with no prior record are six times more likely
than whites to be incarcerated. (Latinos, three times.) White kids
are sent home with a warning for transgressions that land minority
kids in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Even granting that black youths proportionally commit more
crimes than white youths _ itself questionable, but that's another
story _ the outcomes for minority kids at every step of the
criminal justice process are on average grossly more draconian than
for white kids.
</P>
<P>
   The consequences are devastating black commnity life and
undermining job opportunities, economic accumulation and even
family formation. (Ex-cons are not top-notch husband prospects.)
And the disturbances from those pathologies ripple through all
American life.
</P>
<P>
   Pandering to a perceived national hysteria about juvenile crime
_ which in fact has been steadily falling for years _ Congress,
with the president's encouragement, is pushing juvenile justice
``reforms'' that in fact would have the effect of trying more
youths as adults and of easing the legal hesitations to sending
more to adult prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate bill would even scrap the current, mild injunction to
states to work at reducing disproportionate minority confinement.
</P>
<P>
   It is a screwy politics that, faced with challenges like these,
assiduously goes about fashioning legislative products that will
deepen them.

 &HT;    Great facts, less filling
 &HT;    By Ernest Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ From time to time, I receive lists from readers
of ``little known facts'' that I think are interesting enough to
share. And without fail, someone will point out that I've
unwittingly passed off a ``fact'' that every second-grader knows is
bogus. (OK, so for the record, I now realize your right arm and
right leg don't swing together as you walk. Unless of course you
are invading Poland at the time).
</P>
<P>
   For your consideration, with a no money back guarantee if you
are not completely satisfied, is a list of interesting and possibly
true facts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pearls melt in vinegar.
</P>
<P>
   _ Thirty-five percent of the people who use personal ads for
dating are already married.
</P>
<P>
   _ The three most valuable brand names on earth: Marlboro,
Coca-Cola, and Budweiser, in that order.
</P>
<P>
   _ It's possible to lead a cow upstairs, but not downstairs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Humans are the only primates that don't have pigment in the
palms of their hands.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ten percent of the Russian government's income comes from the
sale of vodka.
</P>
<P>
   _ The sentence ``The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog''
uses every letter in the alphabet.
</P>
<P>
   _ The only 15 letter word that can be spelled without repeating
a letter is uncopyrightable.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Stewardesses'' is the longest word that is typed with only
the left hand.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I am'' is the shortest complete sentence in the English
language.
</P>
<P>
   _ Average life span of a major league baseball: seven pitches.
</P>
<P>
   _ A duck's quack doesn't echo, and no one knows why.
</P>
<P>
   _ The reason firehouses have circular stairways is from the days
of yore when the engines were pulled by horses. The horses were
stabled on the ground floor and figured out how to walk up straight
staircases.
</P>
<P>
   _ The airplane Buddy Holly died in was the ``American Pie.''
(Thus the name of the Don McLean song.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Each king in a deck of playing cards represents a great king
from history. Spades, King David; Clubs, Alexander the Great;
Hearts, Charlemagne; and Diamonds, Julius Caesar.
</P>
<P>
   _ 111,111,111 times 111,111,111 equals 12,345,678,987,654,321.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clans of long ago that wanted to get rid of their unwanted
people without killing them used to burn their houses down _ hence
the expression ``to get fired.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Only two people signed the Declaration of Independence on July
4th, John Hancock and Charles Thomson. Most of the rest signed on
Aug. 2, but the last signature wasn't added until five years later.
</P>
<P>
   _ Hershey's Kisses are called that because the machine that
makes them looks like it's kissing the conveyor belt.
</P>
<P>
   _ An ostrich's eye is bigger that it's brain.
</P>
<P>
   _ The longest recorded flight of a chicken is 13 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   _ The name Jeep came from the abbreviation used in the army for
the ``General Purpose'' vehicle, G.P.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nutmeg is extremely poisonous if injected intravenously.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you have three quarters, four dimes, and four pennies, you
have $1.19. You also have the largest amount of money in coins
without being able to make change for a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   _ No NFL team that plays its home games in a domed stadium has
ever won a Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>

professional sports games (MLB, NBA, NHL or NFL) are the day before
and the day after the Major League All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Only one person in 2 billion will live to be 116 or older.
</P>
<P>
   _ The mask used by Michael Myers in the original ``Halloween''
was actually a Captain Kirk mask painted white.
</P>
<P>
   _ Snails can sleep for three years without eating.
</P>
<P>
   _ The fingerprints of koala bears are virtually
indistinguishable from those of humans, so much so that they could
be confused at a crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   _ Months that begin on a Sunday will always have a ``Friday the
13th.''
</P>
<P>
   _ The Eisenhower interstate system requires that one mile in
every five must be straight. These straight sections are usable as
airstrips in times of war or other emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   _ There are 293 ways to make change for a dollar.
</P>
<P>
   _ All of the clocks in the movie ``Pulp Fiction'' are stuck on
4:20.

 &HT;    Flying stinks, and after two days, so did I
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Texas _ I recently spent three of four weeks
traveling by airplane to various meetings across the country. We've
just ended the meeting season in my line of work, when we make
plans for the rest of the year, exchange ideas and do the corporate
thing. Lucky for me, this is not my everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   I average about five plane trips a year, and the more I do it
the less I like it, but not for what you might think. Dying in a
plane crash used to top my worries. I was a white-knuckled traveler
who had to knock back a libation or two before boarding. But I am
past that and don't really think about dying in a plane crash
anymore. It could happen, but there are an infinite number of ways
to meet the Grim Reaper, and flying is way down on the list of
likely ways to meet one's end.
</P>
<P>
   Getting past the worry of dying in a crash has opened my eyes to
the true horrors of air travel. Put simply, commercial flying
stinks. It is an unpleasant experience made tolerable only because
you get to where you're going quickly _ and cheaply if you plan
ahead. I flew to Atlanta, Raleigh, N.C., and Washington from Texas
on three trips, and no round-trip ticket cost more than $240.
That's cheap. You can't drive it for that amount of money if you
count hotel rooms and the time spent pounding the interstate,
dodging tractor-trailers and yuppie wackos talking on cell phones
and driving 20 miles over the speed limit. Talk about putting your
life in your hands.
</P>
<P>
   So we fly and put up with a system that reduces us to submissive
cattle, at the mercy of people who are highly stressed and on
occasion take it out on us passengers for not knowing the rules.
</P>
<P>
   I watched while stuck in one airport as a friend was berated
after standing in line for 30 minutes to re-book a flight after the
original one was canceled. He got to the counter with his driver's
license and two boarding passes _ one for him and one for his wife.
But he had neglected to bring his wife's driver's license. She was
sitting in a nearby chair, doing needlepoint. The clerk, as my
friend tells it, proceeded to lecture him sternly as if he were a
child, make him go get her driver's license and then wait for a
while before finally deigning to book him on a flight that had been
canceled through no fault of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Flight attendants wake sleeping passengers to tell them to put
their seats upright as landing approaches, as if sitting upright
instead of at the approximate 9-degree angle of reclination allowed
in those miserable seats will mean the difference between life and
death if the plane misses the runway and lands in the Potomac
River. Upright or reclining, your obituary will be in the newspaper
if that happens.
</P>
<P>
   My personal travel nightmare came on the final trip, which went
from Shreveport to Dallas to Washington and then in reverse order
to return. We landed in Dallas just as a strong line of
thunderstorms arrived, canceling all flights and stranding hundreds
of us for hours. I understood and agreed. One does not want to get
in a small twin-prop that doesn't even have a bathroom when a Texas
trash-hauler is in the neighborhood. (One would think a
multi-million-dollar plane would have a bathroom, but there you
go). I hung around the terminal, reading and pacing, and after five
hours gave up and headed to Motel 6, luggageless.
</P>
<P>
   I talked the cab driver into stopping at a convenience store to
let me buy a toothbrush and deodorant. The sole choice was Old
Spice, which is the aromatic equivalent of Shlitz beer, both being
brands largely ignored in current culture. That reminds me of a
Robert Earl Keen story. A friend of the Austin singer/songwriter
was driving around a few years ago and spied a group of men
drinking Schlitz beer. ``Schlitz beer!'' Keen exclaimed. ``I
haven't had a Schlitz beer since elementary school.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, I returned to the airport at 6 a.m. the next morning
reeking of a scent that isn't much better than Schlitz beer, hoping
it hid the funky smell of two-day-worn clothes that had been twice
soaked in the rain while trying to find a motel room. Luckily, most
of my fellow misfortunates were in the same boat. Flying stinks,
and so did we.
</P>
<P>
   Three hours later, I was struck by a hard truth. I would not
leave this airport by air on this day. It was still raining, softly
now, fog had set in, and flights on the puddle-jumpers had backed
up so badly it would have taken a C-41 to get everyone where they
were supposed to go, to the lesser airports in Shreveport,
Longview, Tyler and Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   So I rented a car and drove to Shreveport to get my luggage and
Jeep. I beat the plane by untold hours. I still don't understand
how my luggage arrived even though I couldn't get a ticket, but
there you go again.
</P>
<P>
   Heading down Interstate 20 after escaping DFW airport some 16
hours after arriving, I felt a heady sense of freedom. Once again,
I was in control of my own destiny, even if it was in a Chevy
Lumina that smelled of cigars. Sure I was once again trying to
escape the backdraft of trucks heading hellbent to somewhere at 80
mph, oblivious to the fog and rain. But the Dallas NPR station
featured an interesting interview with Jeremy Rifkin, an articulate
left-wing ecological doomsayer, and I was fueled with a cappuccino
and a package of oatmeal cookies.
</P>
<P>
   My seat was tilted back further than one can ever do in an
airplane, and the road was mine once again.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ My mother was born three blocks from Churchill
Downs, but it wasn't until she was 44 that she attended her first
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Thrilled to be sitting in the grandstand, she asked me, then 14,
if I'd seen anyone famous while I wandered around. Some old guy was
attracting attention, I told her.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gregory Peck, and she hasn't stopped laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Natives love to complain about the traffic and pretend the horse
race isn't a big deal, but they relish the attention and the
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there are plenty of times to visit Kentucky and tour the
historic homes, the Louisville Slugger Museum or the horse farms of
Lexington. But you can't beat Derby time in Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   Lawns, already trim with the state's famous grass, look bluer
and trimmer around Derby time. Museum renovations and road projects
are timed to finish by the time the horses are running. Stores sell
cheap plastic racing hats and collectors' glasses and pre-mixed
mint juleps. Fancy women buy hats that will stand out at Derby
parties, even if they don't get to the actual race, which is May 6.
</P>
<P>
   A teen-age cousin said the Derby is just a feeling he gets every
spring, because the whole town is preparing for company.
</P>
<P>
   My grandparents, who lived above their drugstore three blocks
from Churchill Downs until the early 1950s, could listen to the
announcer if they stepped outside. Derby day was never much for
business anyway, because the street was open only to buses and
taxis. For them, the race was something other people attended but
nonetheless was a time to celebrate with friends.
</P>
<P>
   In May, even the novice begins earnest conversations about the
intricacies of breeding. Doctors' offices and beauty parlors become
low-stakes betting pools.
</P>
<P>
   Few events of mass culture, gambling and drinking comprise so
much dignity.
</P>
<P>
   The entire town parties before, during and after the Derby,
which is expected to draw more than 100,000 people. Some of the
better-known parties _ like the one held yearly for all the world's
Kentucky Colonels _ attract thousands of people. Those who aren't
invited or don't want to attend the big galas have backyard parties
or barbecues where they drink mint juleps and engage in small-time
gambling while they watch the race on television.
</P>
<P>
   The box seats in Churchill Downs are filled with gentry and
corporate sponsors, but regular people can make their way in, too.
Two years ago, my cousin won the right to buy yearly tickets, after
spending 22 years on the waiting list.
</P>
<P>
   These days, most of the celebrities at the race are second-tier
types. And rumor has it they're paid to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Even without celebrities, it's a great opportunity to see hats.
Local television news people devote large portions of their daylong
Derby coverage to this subject. The high, elegant hats with
feathers and flowers contrast nicely with the homemade miniature
racetracks some people affix to their heads.
</P>
<P>
   The back stalls aren't open to the public, just horse people.
But if you know someone in the business, it's a good way to gain
access to the people who actually know what it is to breed a horse.
</P>
<P>
   While it's wise to mail in requests for grandstand seats a year
in advance, Churchill Downs promises to sell unlimited infield
seats the day of the race.
</P>
<P>
   The infield is its own universe, a Mardi Gras with fewer
bathrooms. It's packed so densely, most in attendance cannot even
see the race. There are other attractions, though, like bare
breasts, for those who enjoy that sort of thing. I'm told I should
get there before my 20s expire, and then never go again.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid shuttle buses, clogged streets and impossible tickets,
locals have traditionally gone a day early and watched the Kentucky
Oaks, which features fillies (female horses). That, too, has become
a premier event _ with 100,000 people expected this year _ but it's
still more accessible than the Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Reserve rooms and restaurants early, of course. Many of the
popular restaurants and fun bars crowd Bardstown Road. Cafe Metro,
Club Grotto and the Uptown offer imaginative dishes with goat
cheese and the like. (Don't worry, just about every restaurant in
town offers a version of the patented Derby Pie, a pecan- and
bourbon-inspired confection.)
</P>
<P>
   Louisville's young adults will be drinking at the Phoenix Hill,
a multilevel, live music venue. Smaller bars, like O'Shea's, will
also be jammed tight. Poets and the people who dress like them will
sip coffee at Heine Bros. Coffee, a sure step up from Starbucks.
</P>
<P>
   The area around Churchill Downs has boarded-up store windows and
other signs of urban decay. It's disappointing because Louisville
has so many lush parks and well-kept neighborhoods. But the
Churchill Downs Corp. is slowly redeveloping the surrounding
properties. The museum, which chronicles the history of the race
and the grounds, was being renovated when I visited in winter but
opened recently in time for this year's Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill Downs also bought the land housing an old drugstore
called Wagner's. For years, jockeys and trainers ate at the lunch
counter and bought medicines for their horses there. The store
remains open, a few blocks away. But the horse supplies, which
include silks worn by jockeys, have moved to a second nearby store,
Becker and Durski Turf Goods.
</P>
<P>
   When you finally make it to the race, pause for a moment for a
private toast. Raise your glass of bourbon, take a swig and then
close your eyes and think about how lucky you are to be there.
</P>
<P>
   Then throw away that losing ticket and finish the glass.
</P>
<P>
   (sidebar) HOW TO MAKE A MINT JULEP
</P>
<P>
   Whether you're going to the Derby or a Derby party, you'll want
to drink one of these. Here's the Early Times recipe, found online
at www.kentuckyderby.com
</P>
<P>
   INGREDIENTS
</P>
<P>
   2 cups sugar, 2 cups water, fresh mint, crushed ice, bourbon,
silver cup
</P>
<P>
   DIRECTIONS
</P>
<P>
   Boil sugar and water 5 minutes into a syrup. Place in covered
container with 6-8 sprigs of mint and refrigerate overnight. Fill
each cup with crushed ice, 1 ounce of syrup, 2 ounces of bourbon
and another sprig of mint.

 &HT;    The war against dropouts needs youth
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The future got snarled in traffic.
</P>
<P>
   So, the buses delivering middle and high school students to last
week's Greater Austin Youth Symposium were late, but the kids
arrived in plenty of time to hear a collection of adults tell them
how important they are.
</P>
<P>
   But those who needed to hear it most likely weren't there. That
old saw about preaching to the choir springs to mind. But then,
it's not the sinners who routinely show up for the sermon.
</P>
<P>
   You have go to them and try to get them to listen. And that's
exactly what some of the participants at last week's event were
prepared to do, knowing that they are best positioned for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever other societal changes we have experienced, there is
one constant: Teen-agers are more prone to listen to each other
than the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   More than one participant at the symposium who took time out to
talk to me said the value of the gathering was that it gave them
talking points to launch a conversation with their peers about the
importance of staying in school.
</P>
<P>
   And this is a battle in which we need as many allies as we can
put together.
</P>
<P>
   There are several ways to kill an economic boom. You can
strangle it in traffic. You can murder it with overconfidence, or
you can you dumb it to death.
</P>
<P>
   That is why it is essential that we as a community focus on
dropouts. It is an expensive problem that will keep sucking the
economic vitality out of the region. The overall dropout rate at
AISD is around 8 percent, but at some schools it is closer to 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   That is a community scandal.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of moral arguments that can be made about
stanching that hemorrhage of potential, but let's just look at the
problem from an economic perspective.
</P>
<P>
   If we are losing half of a student population, that's that many
workers who are unprepared to participate in the boom. In fact,
that's that many citizens who will pick our pockets either
literally or with their needs for public assistance, including
housing and health care. And we all know that incarceration isn't
cheap.
</P>
<P>
   But we can't reach ``at-risk'' youngsters without help from
their peers.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Thomas, who graduates next month from Gonzalo Garza High,
summed it up aptly. ``A $6 or $7 an hour job looks better than
teachers telling you that you're failing.''
</P>
<P>
   And dropping out is way too easy.
</P>
<P>
   Students just disappear, sometimes despite the best efforts and
arguments of their peers. Amy Haugval, a senior, recounted her
attempts to keep a friend from becoming a statistic. It didn't
work.
</P>
<P>
   Amy learned early that life doesn't come with guarantees, but
she made the effort and for that she should be commended.
</P>
<P>
   Now, we can do our part to foster that by focusing serious time,
money and attention to this problem. And anyone who thinks there is
a quick fix is not living on the same planet as the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the problem is compounded by the school district's
shredded credibility on the issue. It will take a long time for the
district to recover from the indictment of falsifying data.
</P>
<P>
   As painful as the experience was, it should guide us all in
urging the district to share the bad news quickly and completely so
that we can attack the problem in ways that will get results.
</P>
<P>
   There are many recommendations that the 55-member task force on
dropouts looked at. They are expensive, but then so is the
situation. Dropouts never quit costing us money.
</P>
<P>
   While we're at it, we should keep encouraging Amy and others
like her to help us as much as they can.

 &HT;    A strategy that Democrats can love
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Al From, chairman of the Democratic Leadership
Council, recalled President Lyndon B. Johnson's lament on signing a
civil-rights bill in the 1960s ``that we're giving away the South
(to the Republicans) for a generation.''
</P>
<P>
   It came true. But a generation is up, From said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have recaptured Southern governorships they'd lost _
some thought forever _ in Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, South
Carolina and North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   The key, From said, is ``we've finally figured out how to put
together a coalition of blacks, who vote in greater numbers now,
and basically moderate whites, who have appeal in the black
community.''
</P>
<P>
   The DLC was formed in the mid-1980s, after Republican Ronald
Reagan's landslide re-election. One of its first stalwarts was an
Arkansas governor named Bill Clinton. He combined business-friendly
economics with sensitivity to traditionally Democratic social
issues and won the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Those center-left politics also elected leaders in countries
such as England, Germany and others that a decade ago were led by
conservatives, From said.
</P>
<P>
   The DLC's success has been ``spectacular,'' particularly at the
presidential level, From said. ``Bill Clinton's sitting there with
approval ratings higher than when he took office, because the
economy's good, crime's down, welfare's down _ and all the stuff
that we set out to do, we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   And even as From seeks to elect another DLC stalwart, Vice
President Al Gore, as president over Texas' Republican governor,
George W. Bush, he's talking with Texans such as Austin Mayor Kirk
Watson and other Democrats from around the state about the party's
future here.
</P>
<P>
   From calls the DLC's success strategy ``the third way.'' It
drops the big-government approach Democrats carried forth from the
New Deal and World War II. As the industrial age has given way to
the information age, From said, centralized government often
doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too slow,'' From said. ``It doesn't respond quickly
enough. And so you've got to modernize it, move control more to the
local level. It doesn't mean you have to lower standards, but you
have to increase flexibility. It's ideas like charter schools, like
community policing, like civic environmentalism _ where individual
communities can figure out how they implement environmental
standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The third way stresses private-sector economic growth,
opportunity with responsibility, a global outlook that includes
free trade, and innovative and flexible government with as little
bureaucracy as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, the key for Democrats is real simple: If you're credible
on fiscal discipline, crime and welfare, then you get to the agenda
that favors us _ which is education and health care and the
environment. Those are sort of threshold issues _ and if you think
about what Clinton did, that's what he did. I mean, we're going to
balance the budget, protect education, Medicaid, Medicare and the
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sound familiar? Bush's recent stress on housing programs for
minorities, federal help to teach kids to read and cleaning up
industrial pollution seem like echoes of Clinton's 1996 re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   But while Democrats have to overcome suspicion from voters that
they're just tax-and-spend big-government liberals, ``Bush has the
opposite problem,'' From said. ``That's why he has to call himself
a `compassionate conservative' _ because people don't trust the
Republicans to be compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   From believes the DLC's brand of politics appeals to the rapidly
growing number of upper-middle class ``wired'' workers who are
quickly becoming a political majority.
</P>
<P>
   The question for the DLC, From said, is ``whether we continue to
own the politics we've created'' and ``take it to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you have a candidate who runs on the new Democrat
message in Texas,'' From said, ``he or she can be the next governor
of this state.''

 &HT;    Bourbon: Proof of a higher power
 &HT;    By Noah Bierman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE, Ky. _ Congress declared bourbon our national drink
in 1964 and Kentucky is the biggest producer in the country. Many
of the state's distilleries offer tours, but no samples.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beam, the largest bourbon distillery in the world, features
a promotional film laced with company propaganda, but several good
displays about the history and process of the drink. More than
anything you'll see there, it's nice to smell the charred oak
housed in huge warehouses.
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky's sweet limestone water and an aging process that
requires two years in charred white oak barrels that can be used
just once give the drink its color and sweet taste.
</P>
<P>
   A few facts about the drink:
</P>
<P>
   _ A couple of centuries ago, corn whiskey was popular currency
in trading because it was easier to store and to transport than
grain. Abraham Lincoln's father, among others, would accept it
instead of cash. The ``proof'' of its content was measured by its
ability to burn gunpowder. A steady blue flame was worth 100 proof.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bourbon is a kind of whiskey made from at least 51 percent
corn. To be called bourbon, it must be made in the United States.
Most bourbon is made in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rev. Elijah Craig of Georgetown, Ky., invented bourbon in 1789
when he accidentally charred his barrel.

 &HT;    Officials hopeful Elian furor won't turn off tourists
 &HT;    By Stephanie Smith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Police in riot armor standing guard as
trash bins and tires burn. Threats of citywide strikes and blocked
traffic by angry, defiant protesters.
</P>
<P>
   The violent images broadcast around the world as a result of
federal agents' removal of Elian Gonzalez from Miami's Little
Havana district are not the ``sun and fun'' pictures that sell
South Florida tourism.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a region whose image is already as a powder keg, a region
in the news because of corrupt politicians, raging fires,
hurricanes, crime, I don't think the Elian case helped,'' said
hospitality industry analyst Mark Lunt of Ernst &AMP; Young in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   While the protests have been mostly peaceful, with few injuries
and little property damage, the images have not been.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just see the images, it looks like Miami was this huge
flaming protest,'' Lunt said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Warren ``Mac'' McLaughlin, president of Palm Beach County's
Convention and Visitors Bureau, said this week that any time
there's talk of strikes and protests, tourists are turned off.
</P>
<P>
   People like to avoid trouble spots on their vacations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were a tourist, you darn sure wouldn't want to go
anywhere near where there was a citywide strike,'' McLaughlin said
Monday. ``Then there's the fires. All it really was was tires
burning.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, perception is not reality,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But perception is everything in tourism.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1998 Florida wildfires, tourism-related sales tax
collections dropped 34 percent statewide in June and July from the
previous year because tourists stayed away, thinking the entire
state was on fire, tourism officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, three separate killings of foreign tourists in Miami
caused a loss of 100,000 visitors over 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials said the weekend's tumultuous events
shouldn't hurt the state's $42 billion tourism industry. Even if it
did, there's little to be done about it, said Visit Florida
spokesman Tom Flanigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you do? What do you say? It's a lose-lose
proposition,'' Flanigan said.
</P>
<P>
   Any effects should be limited to Miami-Dade County because 92
percent of visitors to Florida have been to the state before and
have some idea that Miami is near the southern tip of the state,
Flanigan said.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami itself so far, there has not been any measurable
effect, said Jeanne Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the Greater Miami
Convention and Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't really been seeing major cancellations or any major
concerns,'' Sullivan said. ``We have had people speculating ... and
I don't want to start fueling a fire that's not already there.''

 &HT;    Thriller unmasks FBI's counterspy operation
 &HT;    By Tom Blackburn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The best entry point to ``Cassidy's
Run'' may be, of all places, one of the jacket blurbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bag the novels,'' urges R. James Woolsey, ``Read `Cassidy's
Run'.'' Woolsey is a former director of the CIA. His approval means
David Wise isn't making this stuff up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This stuff'' is a long-running counterspy operation by the
FBI, an agency toward which former CIA directors tend to mumble
their praise.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy was an Army sergeant in a job that would interest the
Soviets. The FBI dangled him before a known spy in the Soviets'
Washington embassy. The spy _ in time, there were four, all calling
themselves ``Mike'' _ played volleyball at a YMCA. So Cassidy
played volleyball at the same YMCA, changing back into his uniform
after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Playing led to conversation, to dinner, to Mike recruiting
Cassidy. It was a neat seduction, but Cassidy wasn't hard to get.
From the summer of 1959 until the summer of 1978, the Soviets
thought Cassidy was their guy.
</P>
<P>
   Through him, the FBI identified 10 Soviet spies, including a
``sleeper'' _ a book editor in New York whose only role was to take
the coded phone call if a Soviet agent needed to tell the Russians
the Pentagon was about to go on a war alert and pass on the
message.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was called Shocker. It gave the FBI a close look
at what the Soviets wanted to know and at their codes, invisible
inks and special cameras. The bureau learned how the Soviets made
fake rocks. Yes, spies actually drop hollow, rock-looking
containers holding documents for other spies to pick up. The book
has photos of a college professor and his wife picking up a fake
rock Cassidy left for them.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI also collected the $200,000 the Russians paid Cassidy
over the years for what they thought were his services. But the FBI
gave something in return.
</P>
<P>
   When Cassidy was dangled, he was working at the Edgewood
Arsenal, east of Baltimore, where top-secret nerve gas research was
carried out. The Kremlin wanted to know what the researchers were
learning. Cassidy was in a position to shed light.
</P>
<P>
   The papers he ``stole'' had to be real. Who knew what other
sources the Soviets had? The documents were cleared by a secret
committee so we would tell the Soviets only what we were pretty
sure they already knew. This is smoke and mirrors straight from
John LeCarre.
</P>
<P>
   Wise found a scary, ironic twist. He doesn't make an
open-and-shut case, but here is the outline:
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 4,500 documents slipped to the Soviet embassy
concerned a theoretical nerve gas that U.S. scientists were sure
couldn't be turned into a usable weapon. A huge fish die-off
followed a few years later, in 1965, on the Volga River close to
the Soviet equivalent of Edgewood.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1991, as communism collapsed, a scientist revealed that
his country has a top-secret gas it is telling no one about.
``Without access to the top-secret archives of the Soviet nerve-gas
program, it is not possible to know whether the nerve gas formulas
passed to the Russians by Operation Shocker led, directly or
indirectly, to the development of (the gas),'' Wise writes. ``But
there is evidence that information obtained by Soviet intelligence
about the American nerve-gas program did influence Moscow's own
decisions and efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   David Wise is a veteran reporter with proven intelligence
sources. The FBI didn't give him the story of Operation Shocker. He
had to interview the men and women who were involved to get it.
There are no ``re-created'' quotes, so if you take Woolsey's advice
to ``bag the novel,'' you don't get dialogue. But you get a true
story of how the FBI spied on Russian diplomats and others while
they spied on the United States, and a feel for the personalities
involved. In the secret history of spying, Shocker must hold some
records. It ran longer than ``Cats.''

 &HT;    Eire force: Liam O'Flaherty is back in print
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In this country, Liam O'Flaherty is
remembered, when he's remembered at all, as the author of ``The
Informer,'' the seminal story of the Irish troubles and of Gypo
Nolan, the confused boyo who turns a friend in for a few English
pounds. Even ``The Informer'' would have been forgotten if not for
John Ford's 1935 film, which won Victor McLaglen a Best Actor
Oscar.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Flaherty has always been regarded as one of the major
Irish writers, and St. Martin's is bringing out his ``Collected
Stories'' in three volumes ($35 apiece). The stories span the years
from 1922 to '58, and they're often short, lyrical pieces about
rural Ireland, especially the forbidding Aran islands, where
O'Flaherty was born.
</P>
<P>
   The volumes include several stories that were written in Irish,
as well as some stories that have never been published until now.
</P>
<P>
   EVERYTHING OLD IS NEW AGAIN
</P>
<P>
   On the reissue front, Modern Library's War imprint is in high
gear with ``The Book of War'' ($18.95), which includes Sun-Tzu and
Von Clausewitz. In the same series, there's Teddy Roosevelt's ``The
Rough Riders'' ($12.95), with an introduction by Edmund Morris,
Roosevelt's best biographer and Reagan's worst. Both volumes
feature a few words from series editor Caleb Carr, and the texts
have been completely reset.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a real obscurity, Jack London's ``Before Adam,'' has
been issued by Bison Books, the pop-culture imprint of the
University of Nebraska Press. Originally written as a magazine
serial in 1906-07, it's a fantasia about a modern man who regresses
to the consciousness of an ancestor called Big Tooth, struggling to
survive in Africa during the Pleistocene era.
</P>
<P>
   It's not really very good, but it's really interesting _ London,
as anybody who's read ``The Call of the Wild'' knows, knew animals,
and infuses Big Tooth and the other cavemen with the empathetic
understanding he brought to his dog stories. ``Before Adam''
undoubtedly served as inspiration for a couple of D.W. Griffith
film shorts made at Biograph that centered on cavemen.
</P>
<P>
   QUOTE UNQUOTE
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have skill and no imagination, it can nonetheless
result in very attractive and interesting things, like wickerwork
and picnic baskets _ usable, pleasant. On the other hand, if you've
got a great deal of imagination and no skill, what results is
modern art.'' _Tom Stoppard

 &HT;    `Get Happy' goes deeper than just judging Judy
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The picture that emerges from Gerald
Clarke's biography of Judy Garland is not a radical departure _
she's the same more or less hopeless case she's always been.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Get Happy'' does go deeper, does have more simpatico with
its subject, perhaps because Clarke got access to the tape
recordings Garland made for a never-completed autobiography.
Garland's venomous ramblings give portions of his book a startling
immediacy, as she lashes out at her mother and all the other people
she believed failed her.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke, whose previous biographical subject was Truman Capote,
thereby indicating a specialty in celebrity junkies, is a better
writer than many who till these particular fields.
</P>
<P>
   But, like most people who tackle Garland, he grows a little weak
in the knees in describing her talent: ``Her pipes, as Variety
called them, had ripened into the rutilant maturity of midsummer
...''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, David Begelman, usually known as a shyster agent and
embezzler, is here compared to one of Milton's fallen angels.
</P>
<P>
   But any serious book about Judy Garland has to attempt to span
the large gap between the fragmentary brilliance of her art and the
unholy mess of her life, and the process by which the latter
overwhelmed the former. Hyperbole is probably justified, for
Garland was greatly gifted, and greatly disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   She was the daughter of small-time vaudevillians. Her mother was
a joyless, slave-driving bitch who denied her daughter any
semblance of childhood or emotional warmth. It was Momma Ethel who
started giving the child pills to get her to the peak excitement
she thought the girl needed to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Garland's father was extremely loving, extremely warm and
extremely homosexual, always getting kicked out of towns because of
his behavior with the local boys.
</P>
<P>
   If everything else in Garland's life had gone right, it would
have been difficult to overcome such a dreadful environment, such
an irresponsible pair of parental influences.
</P>
<P>
   Even after she became a star, Garland had a series of
relationships with men who were either bisexual (Tyrone Power) or
homosexual (Vincente Minnelli). Her first suicide attempt came when
she discovered Minnelli, by then her husband, in bed with a male
friend.
</P>
<P>
   (That Garland's daughter Lizareenacted a similar pathology is
obvious. In one of Clarke's less-than-kind moments, he informs us
that Peter Allen, Liza Minnelli's first husband, was having an
affair with Mark Herron, Garland's fourth, while they were married
to their respective spouses.)
</P>
<P>
   After Minnelli, who was at least a top talent, Garland tended to
involve herself with hustlers who used her, separated her from her
money, then moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the last days, there was something ragged and
helpless about Garland. Joseph Mankiewicz was unlike many of her
men in that he was both heterosexual and smart. He was also
married, but you can't have everything. In any case, he and Garland
had a fairly serious romance, but, he told Clarke, ``I wasn't in
love that way. I was in love _ and I know this is a terrible
analogy _ the way you love an animal, a pet.''
</P>
<P>
   True masochists never have to search hard for the punishment
they believe they deserve.
</P>
<P>
   What justifies the morass of Garland's life? Well, there was
that spectacular voice, a great silver trumpet that she could
direct with discretion and a sense of drama second to none. (She
was like Sinatra in one aspect only _ she acted a song at least as
much as she sang it.) She could dance, she could act, she could, at
her best, be a machine for giving an audience joy.
</P>
<P>
   Her talent meant that she was born to be in show business,
except that show business was the worst possible business for
someone with Garland's neediness, her insecurity. No amount of
praise or love could ever ameliorate her desperation. Even the most
rapturous audience can applaud for only five or 10 minutes, and
then there's just more unnerving silence.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, she was wildly unreliable; of the 135 days it took to
rehearse and shoot the MGM musical ``The Pirate,'' Garland was
absent for 99 of them. No wonder so many of her middle and late
films are strangely jagged and dramatically unsatisfying; the
filmmakers had to get what they could when they could. Shaping a
performance, a movie, was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   The ending was particularly grim, with Garland, looking 30 years
older than she was, one step ahead of the tax man, flogging her
deteriorated voice, unemployable in any venue except concerts,
where undiscriminating audiences gathered to watch a ghoulish
horror show.
</P>
<P>
   She was unhinged by now, years of booze and pills finally
eroding what seems to have been a warm, essentially decent person.
Finally, she OD'd on the toilet, a death that failed to serve as a
cautionary tale for Elvis Presley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get Happy'' is not a salacious book, although there are
salacious things in it. Clarke seems to genuinely like Garland and
revere her talent, although he's stronger on her singing than on
her movies, which he gives short shrift. But he misses the humor
that people who knew Garland insist she had, and he fails to
communicate her capacity for joy.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just me, but perhaps this is one story that doesn't
really benefit from repeated tellings. Perhaps it's better to leave
this ravaged spirit in peace, once and for all.

John McCain with Spencer Tracy and Martin Sheen and stars him in a
glib made-for-TV variation on the 1948 Capra movie, ``State of the

 &HT;    Great rooms, excellent service greet visitors at Gardens Hotel
 &HT;    By Mary Thurwachter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. _ We can thank ``the lady of the orchids,'' as
locals called her, for the stunning tropical botanical gardens.
</P>
<P>
   The lady, also known as Peggy Mills, transformed a quarter of a
city block surrounding one of Key West's oldest Bahama-style homes
from a barren property with a sickly avocado tree to the lush
display that surrounds The Gardens Hotel today.
</P>
<P>
   Bill and Corinna Hettinger, who bought the property in 1992, 13
years after Mills died, spent 14 months and millions of dollars to
restore, refurbish and add two buildings to make it one of Key
West's premier inns.
</P>
<P>
   Original structures include the main house (which dates to the
1870s and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places),
carriage house and a Bahama-style ``eyebrow'' cottage, which refers
to the slanting roof that partially covers the second-level
windows. Two new buildings, designed and built to blend with the
existing architecture, provide additional guest lodging.
</P>
<P>
   Between the time Mills (who opened her gardens to the public in
1968) died and the Hettingers came aboard, the property changed
hands several times and had become totally overgrown. So the
Hettingers had irrigation installed and suitable ground cover
planted.
</P>
<P>
   All the attention paid to detail shows. Furnishings for the
hotel were collected from around the globe. Fine American antiques,
Old World craftsmanship and 20th-century design combine to create
an ambiance similar to the small hotels of Europe that the
Hettingers found so appealing during their extensive travels.
</P>
<P>
   Hundred-year-old bricks from England, Honduras and the United
States, once used as ships' ballast, pave the walkways. The bricks,
like the four tinajones (teene-HONE-ez), huge earthenware jars used
to collect rainwater during the Spanish colonial period, remain
from Mills' time. The jars date to 1785 and were imported from Cuba
in the 1950s. Hotel employees say that each one weighs a ton and
can't be found anywhere else in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms are airy and bright during the day and, with the help of
shutters and draperies, dark enough for even the most
light-sensitive guests at night. The garden rooms and courtyard
rooms have hardwood oak floors, king-size beds with antique
headboards and white marble bathrooms with Jacuzzi bathtubs.
</P>
<P>
   The second-floor garden room we stayed in was next to the pool
and had a couple of cushy white wicker chairs on the porch outside.
We found this an ideal place to perch while watching birds, sipping
lemonade and enjoying the sights and scents of the gardens
(including orange jasmine, magnolia, lantana and orchids).
</P>
<P>
   Our room had a TV, two phones, hair dryer, minibar, king-sized
brass bed, English-style desk and chairs and, like all the rooms,
an impressionistic, oil painting of the gardens by New Zealand
artist Peter Williams.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoons, guests can order drinks from the poolside
bar, or have the bartender deliver the libations to their lounge
chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast, served in the solarium on the porch outside the main
house, was buffet-style and included fresh-baked pastries, fruit,
cheeses, cereals, fresh-squeezed juices and coffee.
</P>
<P>
   The staff was friendly and helpful. They seemed happy to share
facts about the house's history, recommend restaurants and carry
our bags to the room. We liked the turn-down service, complete with
imported chocolates, provided before bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   Although the excitement of Duval Street was only a block and a
half away, it was almost hard for us to leave the secluded grounds.
Fortunately, everything we wanted to do was within walking
distance. We strolled to Mallory Square to catch up with the
jugglers, fortunetellers, T-shirt artists and conch-fritter
salesman in time for the sunset celebration. We toasted the sunset
and dined at the restaurant at the Pier House. And we did a bit of
shopping in Old Town. (We never leave the island without stocking
up on frangipani soap or sampling at least one piece of Key lime
pie.)
</P>
<P>
   Stars, including actor Michael Keaton and singer John
Mellencamp, have been known to vacation at The Gardens Hotel. Rooms
are pricey _ during the season, they range from $245 to $675 a
night. For that kind of money, guests expect great rooms and
excellent service. They get both _ plus an exquisite tropical
setting in the heart of historic Old Town Key West.
</P>

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: This book bag weighs heavy on me
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUFKIN, Texas _ I'd been feeling low.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing _ 5,000 things _ I'm still sending out free books
for kids. I figure I'm about halfway done, but many of the
addresses are to schools, and the end of school is looming. It
looms, I'm doomed.
</P>
<P>
   Problem this year, in promising a book to any child who writes
in, the offer made it onto the Internet. We're swamped with letters
_ 5,000 still pending _ and teachers are beginning to write now
wanting to know where the books are.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I am alone in this titanic undertaking. My wife works
right along beside me, and never, never complains. Still, I'm
feeling low.
</P>
<P>
   Another thing, I had been watching a network prime-time news
program. One report was about a products test group that straps
umbrellas to cars and then determines at what speed the umbrella
will collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The next show coming up, which I didn't watch, was an
investigation into whether a beauty pageant was fixed.
</P>
<P>
   And a promo for the next day's show involved sending undercover
reporters into big cities in the guise of tourists, to stand on
street corners holding city maps and looking lost. The idea is to
reveal which cities are friendly to visitors and which are not.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to running tests on cars to determine at what
speed they would collapse and kill their passengers?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to investigation whether public elections had
been rigged?
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to sending undercover reporters into big
cities in the guise of the down-and-out to reveal in which cities
cops will shoot you if you look scary?
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this is modern journalism, and I don't know much
about modern journalism. Still I was feeling low.
</P>
<P>
   The closest I ever came to modern journalism was the newspaper
business, and that was a long time ago when life was simpler.
</P>
<P>
   Readers wanted to know what was going on _ particularly anything
that shouldn't be going on _ at their courthouse, schoolhouse and
city hall. Their umbrellas they could take care of themselves.
</P>
<P>
   On a newspaper, the idea was that you got the news, you got it
right and you got it first.
</P>
<P>
   Radio and TV, eventually, made it difficult for papers to get
the news first.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that has changed in the past few years, thanks to the
Internet. Newspapers with their own web sites pop the news to their
readers at the speed of light, big improvement over the speed of a
linotype machine.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we have the technology working for us, I just hope we
remember what we're working for.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper business, we used to say, is not a complicated
business. What you do, you get some paper and put some news on it,
preferably stuff that everybody doesn't already know about.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven only knows what's going on at your courthouse, your
schoolhouse and your city hall that you don't know about. You make
book on it.
</P>
<P>
   Which reminds me ...
</P>
<P>
   I gotta get back to work mailing these books.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, people still want to read.

   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ When it comes to the dilemma of

 &HT;    Memories linger 25 years after Vietnam
 &HT;    EDs: EMBARGOED for Sunday, April 30
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Ho Chi Minh Trail, napalm and body bags, fragging, Khe Sanh,
the Tet Offensive. ...''
</P>
<P>
   To Americans over 40, certain words and phrases once seemed to
hang thick in the air we breathed, seemed suspended in the water we
drank. They were part of the atmosphere in which a generation came
of age, and in which the nation as a whole matured into something
wiser and perhaps stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kent State, humping the boonies, Hendrix, gooks, draft cards,
4-F, the Americal Division. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Even now, the words retain the power to summon memories.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago today, Saigon fell to the Vietnamese
Communists, the consequence of a decision by President Nixon two
years earlier to pull all U.S. troops out of the country. Once the
last helicopter had lifted off Vietnamese rooftops, once the guns
had fallen quiet there, all those words that had seemed so fraught
with meaning suddenly ceased to matter, and ceased to be heard as
well.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, for a long time we didn't even talk about Vietnam much,
because any discussion tended to spiral into blame and
recrimination. Everyone had a theory, a favorite bad guy. The
politicians lied to us and misled us, miring the country in a war
they wouldn't let the military win. Or, the military lost the war
through sheer incompetence, trying to win a guerrilla conflict
through traditional means. Or, the peaceniks had betrayed the
country by demonstrating while American kids were fighting and
dying overseas. Or, the leftist media had confused the American
public by focusing only on what was going wrong in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the war, the United States and its people seemed
to go into an odd sort of sleepwalk, a ``malaise,'' as former
President Jimmy Carter infamously but accurately phrased it.
Vietnam _ and the division it inspired among us _ became the
unspoken, unacknowledged and unconfronted subtext to almost every
political dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Gradually, however, we found other, less confrontational means
of talking about it. Writers such as Michael Herr, in his
extraordinarily honest book ``Dispatches,'' depicted the moral
horror of life as a grunt. Stanley Karnow, Neil Sheehan and others
explored the policy mistakes and misconceptions that led us to
disaster. Novelist Tim O'Brien, a veteran himself, depicted 'Nam as
a surreal nightmare in ``The Things They Carried,'' and Bobbie Ann
Mason explored the reconciliation of veterans with their families
in the poignant ``In Country.'' Movie depictions ranged from the
operatic ``Apocalypse Now'' to the almost saccharine ``Forrest
Gump.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of that material, particularly the movies, failed as an
expression of truth about Vietnam. But it did at least expose the
nation to a complexity of viewpoints about the subject. Art
penetrates bias; it forces us to see as others might see. In this
case, however, the biggest contribution to understanding and
reconciliation came from the unlikeliest art of all, architecture.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, a 21-year-old student named Maya Lin won a design
contest for a Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington. Her concept,
as Lin described it in documents submitted to contest judges, was
eloquent and simple:
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking through this park, the memorial appears as a rift in
the earth. A long, polished, black stone wall, emerging from and
receding on either side, growing out of the earth, extend and
converge at a point below and ahead. Walking into this grassy site
contained by the walls of the Memorial, we can barely make out the
carved names upon the Memorial's walls. These names, seemingly
infinite in number, convey the sense of overwhelming numbers, while
unifying these individuals into a whole.''
</P>
<P>
   While initially controversial, Lin's memorial was quickly
recognized as a work of great power and beauty. It does not preach,
but its quiet simplicity forces visitors to think and to
contemplate. It's the perfect memorial to a war that still defies
understanding.
</P>
<P>
   We do agree now that those who fought in Vietnam were the
victims, not the villains, of a way gone awry. We understand now
that no democracy should engage in war without overwhelming public
support, and that U.S. power, however vast, still has limits.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of that last lesson is best expressed by the contrast
in two statements that bookended the American experience in
Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   In 1961, President Kennedy pledged the United States ``to pay
any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend,
oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1973, Nixon, in his second Inaugural Address, was expressing
a sadder wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time has passed when America will make every other
nation's conflict our own, or make every other nation's future our
responsibility, or presume to tell the people of other nations how
to manage their own affairs,'' Nixon told the country.
</P>
<P>
   We acquired wisdom in Vietnam, hard-earned wisdom about
ourselves and the world around us. But it came at a high price:
58,000 dead soldiers; 58,000 promises never kept; 58,000 names on a
stark black wall. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry Michael Allen; Willie Edward Mack; Ronald Alex Staley,
William Thomas Wallace Jr. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Those words too have the power to summon memories.

DRIVING WHILE INTOXICATED CAN LAND YOU IN JAIL  
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa , Calif.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As we pulled into town that night we saw the flashing lights but
we were wrapped up in a conversation and didn't realize until it
was too late that we were at a sobriety check point.
</P>
<P>
   I had no time to rehearse, no time to grab the piece of gum my
friend was sliding across the seat to me before there was a uniform
at the window. The officer greeted us and then asked if I, the
driver, had had anything to drink.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, I said, because that was the truth and I had no time to
consider the wisdom of telling the truth. What time had I had
something to drink, he wondered. I said I had a glass of wine with
dinner, at 6 p.m. or so.
</P>
<P>
   And what time do you think it is now, he asked.
</P>
<P>
   This is when I started thinking there might be trick questions,
like when you're at a border stop on a foreign train and they bring
on the drug-sniffing dogs and ask for your passport. You're pretty
sure you're not guilty but are positive you look guilty anyhow and
hope they don't ask questions because no one's told you what you're
supposed to answer.
</P>
<P>
   The logical thing to do when asked the time is to look at one's
watch or one's dashboard clock, but my brain decided he wanted to
know if I had any sense of the actual hour. So I said probably
around 11 p.m. And then I looked over at the clock and saw I was 20
minutes off. My friend thought for sure I was a goner.
</P>
<P>
   But it satisfied the officer who waved us on and told us to have
a nice night.
</P>
<P>
   Did we scream with relief as soon as we turned the corner? Yes.
Had I lied?
</P>
<P>
   Well, I omitted parts of the truth. In the last hour I'd also
had a glass and a half of wine with some crackers and cheese. Was I
lucky? Incredibly so. Would I have failed a breathalyzer test? I
have no idea. Have I learned my lesson? Yes, yes, yes.
</P>
<P>
   Another friend was not so lucky. She drove home from a dinner
party and was stopped by two officers who said she overshot the
stop sign. She explained that was the only way she could see
oncoming cars. They asked if she had been drinking. She said yes,
one glass of wine.
</P>
<P>
   She says now, ``What was I going to say? Five?'' They asked her
to step up out of her car, tested her and took her to jail.
</P>
<P>
   I've been noticing that the imbibing world is divided into
believers and scoffers. The scoffers drink and drive like we used
to, not realizing that the cop who took a whiff but gave you only a
warning ``to get home now and be careful'' doesn't exist much
anymore. The believers have learned firsthand or from the chilling
account of a friend.
</P>
<P>
   My friend, who I'll call Betsy, had to walk a straight line,
follow a flashlight beam with her eyes and stand with her feet
together, head back with eyes closed, a feat she doubts she could
accomplish stone sober. Then they had her blow into a breathalyzer,
at which point they arrested her for drunk driving and handcuffed
her.
</P>
<P>
   In jail they told Betsy she was uncooperative. Her story is
while waiting to be processed her nose itched and she slipped her
hand from her cuffs to scratch it.
</P>
<P>
   Then she spoke up for her cell mate, a woman arrested driving
home from a baby shower where she drank a couple of beers. The
woman asked to call her husband and was refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `This isn't right. Her husband will think she had an
accident.' The officer basically said that I should mind my own
business. He said they don't cater to drunks and the next time we
ladies went out drinking we should remember that.''
</P>
<P>
   Betsy left the next morning after her boyfriend posted bail. She
went home and took a bath but that wasn't the end. She went to
court and pleaded no contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have a lawyer because I was guilty. I did what I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   She attended drunk driving school for 16 weeks, two hours a
week, ``for which there are no excuses. You almost have to die to
miss a class.''
</P>
<P>
   One hour was spent watching videos on drug and alcohol abuse _
she liked the Bill Moyers' one. The other hour was for group
discussion ``in which we tried to figure out who really had an
alcohol problem and who didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   She was given a suspended license which allowed her to drive
only to the class and to work. She ended up paying close to $2,000
in fines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a horrible experience. It messes you up financially.
And it messes your head up about drinking which maybe is a good
thing since I've had to look at how much I drink. The cops treat
you like scum, but I guess that's the point. You are risking other
people's lives when you do this and that makes you sort of a
crumb.''
</P>
<P>
   Me, too. It was my wine that she drank that night. I remember
thinking when she pulled out of the driveway that I hoped she'd get
home OK.
</P>
<P>
   Do I feel guilty? Sure.

   On this day in 1789, Fletcher Christian led the ``mutiny on the
Bounty,'' rebelling against the stern captain of the HMS Bounty,
Lt. William Bligh.
</P>
<P>
   Also on this day in 1758, the fifth president of the United
States was born in Virginia. James Monroe died July 4,1831. What
other two U.S. presidents died on Independence Day _ and the same
day, at that? &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you like high-quality California cabernet, but your wallet is
about to mutiny, then check out the 1996 Gallo-Sonoma ``Frei
Ranch'' Cabernet Sauvignon _ 4 1/2 stars _ a ``mini''-version of
the inestimable Gallo Estate Cabernet, one of California's best.
The Frei Ranch is rich but well-structured, and with a nice
``grip.'' Think heavy red meats or pastas with tomatoes and garlic.
Lots of garlic.
</P>
<P>
   The low-$20s price tag is more than reasonable for a wine of
this quality.
</P>

   Answer: John Adams and Thomas Jefferson both died July 4, 1826,
the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Declaration of
Independence.

NEW PASSAT WAGON IS ALL 4MOTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was either the last howl of winter or a young spring behaving
very badly, but the conditions were perfect: hammering winds that
were knocking down trees and spreading debris across roads and
highways, deep puddles that threatened hydroplaning, swirling spits
of snow.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Passat 4MOTION station wagon, Volkswagen's entry, along
with a Passat sedan, in the ever-expanding all-wheel-drive market,
was made for weather like this.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Volkswagen made an AWD wagon in the past _ its last
was the Quantum wagon in 1988 _ but those were hardly the halcyon
days of the German manufacturer and the time was not too far away
when the minivan would kill off demand for station wagons.
</P>
<P>
   But as they say in the land of Citroen, plus c'est change and
all that. Station wagons are making a comeback and, equipped with
AWD systems, they are viable options to minivans and even SUVs. And
as I have seen with the Volvo Cross Country, Subarus and Audis, the
new generation of AWD is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   The Passat, its system born of Audi's Quattro, is among the
best.
</P>
<P>
   4MOTION refers to the fact that when the car is in motion, all
four wheels are driving, all the time, no matter what the speed. In
normal conditions, engine torque is distributed 50/50 front and
rear. If conditions get slippery and one set of wheels can get
better grip than the other, an automatic-locking center
differential ships engine torque where it is needed and the split
can be as much as 67-33 either way.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all. A separate monitoring system watches for
individual wheel slippage, and should any wheel threaten to break
into a spin applies the brakes individually at that wheel to get it
gripping again.
</P>
<P>
   It is a seamless driving experience and you are not even aware
it is all taking place unless you test it _ say on a wet road
littered with snow, early-blown tree buds, puddles, twigs _ so hard
you expect the car to try to break away from you. Trust me. It
won't. I took it into a big, empty parking lot, with all the
storm's flotsam and jetsam strewn about, cranked the wheel around
and tried to lose control. I couldn't, because the car was in
control.
</P>
<P>
   And this is a comforting experience when you are sitting in what
is a fairly luxurious car: in this GLS model, leather seats, walnut
wood trim, even heated windshield washer nozzles (what a fine
winter idea).
</P>
<P>
   The view all around was expansive, with a low dash and a chopped
hood giving the appearance that the road is right there where you
could touch it and the big glass of the back, sides and rear,
providing good vision all around. Even the rear pillars, often an
obstacle in wagons, are thin and do not block the line of sight.
</P>
<P>
   The front buckets have fairly flat leather planks for seats and
could use some lateral wings and a slight bump at the front edge to
give the sense you're better held in them. Lateral wings on the
sides are fine. The back seat is comfortable and there is good
legroom, though three adults do not fit comfortably. Fold those
seats down, however (60/40 split), and you've got what seems an
enormous cargo area for a midsize wagon. The big rear hatch, which
opens way up high, lets you easily load large objects.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, what the Passat has in big space is offset by
what it lacks in small storage areas, those nooks and crannies that
families, in day-to-day hauling of children and their associated
goods, or couples on vacation and the paraphernalia that entails,
so desire. Door slots are small, the bin in the fold-down armrest
between the front seats is tiny, and an ashtray front and center on
the console is a waste of what could be useful space for most
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   One very nice touch is the way all four doors have been scooped
out up high, giving extra room all around and providing useful
armrests.
</P>
<P>
   The Passat is powered by a 2.8-liter, 190-horsepower V6, not a
screamer when it comes to passing, but sneaky fast just rolling
down the highway. The AWD system could handle lots more power, but
this car isn't aimed at folks looking for performance. It had a
wide band of torque, which really kicked in at about 3,500 RPMs and
held steady to beyond faster than you can legally travel. The AWD
system does seem to eat gasoline _ I got about 18.5 miles per
gallon over a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Passat comes with a five-speed automatic that gives you a
Tiptronic manual option that lets you shift without a clutch. I'd
prefer a standard transmission in an AWD, but at least the
Tiptronic comes close to letting me feel as though I'm in control.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is rigid in a good way and the Passat holds firm in the
corners. This is a tightly engineered car and is remarkably quiet
inside, even as winds swirl about outside.
</P>
<P>
   It's the 4MOTION that keeps you moving in bad conditions, but it
is the suspension that makes the ride comfortable. Up front, it has
a four-link setup with coil springs, telescopic shocks and
stabilizer bar. The rear has fully independent wishbone with the
rest of the goodies found in the front.
</P>
<P>
   Four-wheel ventilated disc brakes, with ABS, bring you to
straight, sure stops and if you can't stop in an emergency, there's
a sound safety system to protect you: a rigid body with crumple
zones that fold up like cheap accordions and protect the passenger
compartment. There are front and side airbags up front and in a
neat touch, the side bags are built into the seats so that when you
move your seat the bag travels with you. The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration has given the Passat its highest
rating for occupant protection both front and rear.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not one who's sorry to see winter go, but I wish I had had
the chance to try this out in deep snow or on ice. I suspect its
performance would have been an eye opener.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The side mirrors are small rectangles and didn't give me as
good a look backward as I would like.
</P>
<P>
   --The cupholders, all of a half-inch deep, were useless.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The wiper control stem that is so simple to use: up and down
for front wipers, in and out for rear wiper. No fiddling with
separate controls or looking for just the right spot on some dial.

<P>
   Boneless, skinless chicken breast may be among the best meat
values in the market because you're not paying for the parts of the
bird you don't eat. It's also one of the most versatile, a blank
canvas on which to paint a variety of colors and flavors.
</P>
<P>
   When breast meat is removed from the bones, it separates into
two parts. The larger pieces are sold as the breast, while the
smaller pieces are packed separately and sold as chicken
``tenders.'' Anything you can do with chicken tenders, you can do
with a whole breast piece. You just have to take the time to cut it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Here is what you can do with chicken breasts:
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BAKE IT
</P>
<P>
   _ Combine chicken and a bottle of lemon-pepper marinade in a
resealable plastic bag. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours. Bake at
325 degrees for 20 minutes or until internal temperature reaches
155 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Place chicken breasts in a greased baking pan. Top each breast
with 1 slice Swiss cheese and 1 slice bacon cut into two pieces.
Refrigerate. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large saucepan. Stir in
2 tablespoons flour, salt and pepper until well blended. Stir in 2
cups warm milk. Cook, stirring, until mixture boils. Pour white
sauce over chicken and bake at 350 degrees until chicken reaches an
internal temperature of 155 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ___
</P>
<P>
   BREAD IT
</P>
<P>
   _ To make chicken parmesan, dip chicken breasts in beaten egg

KEEPING TEENS' BAD NEWS QUIET CAN COMPOUND THE PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA F. MELTZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chances are that sometime between when your child turns into a
teenager (12, 13, 14, or 15) and comes out the other side (17, 18,
19, or 20), she'll do something that deeply shames you.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Warren's turn came in 1996 and '97, when her son was a
sophomore and junior in high school. A progression of events that
began with him hanging with an older group of boys led to his
smoking marijuana and his arrest on drug and weapon charges.
</P>
<P>
   Warren, who lives in a small south-central Massachusetts town,
normally thinks of herself as a high-energy, empowered parent. But
even as she stood by her son literally, in court, and through his
emotional struggle, there were days when she was so ashamed she
couldn't pick herself up off the couch to eat or sleep, couldn't
control the trembling in her limbs or the paralyzing fear in her
brain. ``I felt that I had failed as a parent,'' she says. Except
for her ex-husband and sister-in-law, Warren told no one of her
son's problems and her feelings, partly to protect him, partly out
of shame. It became her secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I went to a community event, I felt that others must know
(what he did) and be thinking what a terrible parent I was,'' she
says. ``It was isolating. It was horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren's experience resonates for psychologist Jodie Kliman, and
not just because she's heard it from clients. A parent of teens
herself, she says, ``There are times when I've felt I'm a failure,
too. Knowing I'm not unique is very comforting.''
</P>
<P>
   She also understands the instinct to keep things to yourself.
``We live in a society that is quick to blame parents,'' says
Kliman, who is coordinator of family therapy training at the Center
for Multicultural Training at Boston Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   When we make our teens' transgressions our secrets, however,
even for the sake of family- or self-preservation, we hurt
ourselves, losing out on support from others as well as their
perspectives or ideas for coping.
</P>
<P>
   What humiliates one parent may not be what disgraces another, of
course. But no matter what issue pushes your button, from a failing
grade to a wrecked car, ``shame is the hardest emotion to cope
with. It's when we are most apt to make mistakes,'' says
psychologist Norine Johnson. She is an adolescent specialist at
Boston University School of Medicine and president elect of the
American Psychological Association.
</P>
<P>
   Shame immobilizes us and undermines our parenting. ``It makes
you pull away from the relationship and minimize the issues rather
than help the person struggle with them. And when that person is a
teen who may also feel ashamed of what she's done, it can be a
disaster,'' says Kliman. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Talking about it &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A parent's first task, of course, is to deal with whatever
fallout the transgression creates. If that's all we do, however,
and we don't talk about it again with our child, there's no
positive interpretation a teen can make.
</P>
<P>
   She may conclude either ``My parents don't care,'' ``It's not a
big deal,'' both of which give her permission to do it again, or
``What happened is so shameful, they can't even talk about it.''
When that's what a teen internalizes, it increases her own sense of
shame and failure, says family and child psychologist Sharon
Gordetsky of Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most teens know they have done something wrong. They don't
want us to blow it out of proportion, but they do want us to deal
with it,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   There are two ways parents typically find out that a teen is in
trouble. The first is to sense something is wrong and go snooping.
If the search yields fruit, many parents feel remorseful for spying
and ashamed of failing. That double whammy is so powerful it keeps
us from confronting our child at the same time that it alters our
view of him. That, in turn, affects our relationship: Perhaps we're
more distant, less patient, quicker to jump on him.
</P>
<P>
   We may or may not sense this change. A teen will for sure, and
it's exactly what she doesn't want, says Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason she keeps something from you in the first place
isn't just because she fears punishment, but also because she's
afraid it will hurt your relationship,'' she says. Now her fear is
coming true, only it's happening in secret, without any discussion,
for reasons she's not entirely sure of. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A cry for help &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The second way we learn about trouble is if it stares us in the
face: He comes in drunk, leaves a joint around, stays out all
night.
</P>
<P>
   A teen who transgresses so blatantly wants you to find out, says
Johnson. It's as if he's saying, ``Pay attention!'' If we notice
but keep silent, his only recourse is to escalate the behavior in
the hopes that maybe that will get our attention.
</P>
<P>
   Even if we do notice, even if we have constructive,
soul-searching conversations, if we keep silent to the rest of the
world as if nothing is different or wrong, that makes the behavior
a secret. Here's how a teen likely interprets that:
</P>
<P>
   --What I've done is too shameful to speak of;
</P>
<P>
   --Mom and Dad are hypocrites: They care more about what their
friends think than they do about me;
</P>
<P>
   --Only perfection is good enough;
</P>
<P>
   --Mom and Dad can't face the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson says teens turn these messages on themselves. ``They'll
see your silence as reflecting on them: `Underneath, I'm so bad,
even they have given up on me.' For girls, that can fuel depression
and eating disorders. For boys, it turns into anger and more acting
out,'' she says. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Private, not secret &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If we consider this a matter of privacy, boundaries, and respect
rather than secrecy, which implies shame and failure, the picture
changes dramatically. ``We all have situations we don't want to
share outside the family,'' says child psychologist Carolyn
Newberger of Judge Baker Children's Center. ``That's not the same
as denying problems exist.''
</P>
<P>
   She says the best outcomes occur when we talk with our teen
about whether, who, and how anyone not involved in the situation
needs to know.
</P>
<P>
   Many teens will say, ``I don't want anyone to know,'' and that's
a decision we should respect as far as their friends go, says
Newberger. It is not a teen's decision, however, to keep it from
the other parent.
</P>
<P>
   Except if that parent has a history of being explosive and could
harm a child, keeping the problem from him or her gives a teen a
sense of extraordinary power and creates an unhealthy alliance
between the two of you. Your agreement to secrecy also endorses
that parent's inadequacies, according to Gordetsy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very destructive,'' she says. A response she recommends:
``Your father needs to know about this too, so we can work together
to help you.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Participatory parenting &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for telling other people, Johnson suggests what she calls
participatory parenting: ``Once the problem is stated out loud _
`You got arrested for drunk driving' _ and there's a plan in place
for discipline, prevention and/or reparation, then you can say, `We
need to talk about whom to tell.' For instance, `Can Grandpa handle
this?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Talk also about whom you want to tell for your own needs: ``I
want to tell Aunt Peg. I trust her, and she's a good sounding board
for me.'' Or: ``I have feelings about this, too. I need to talk to
a few people I trust.''
</P>
<P>
   It's OK, indeed healthy, to want to protect your child and to be
realistic with him, says psychologist Mary Ann Rafoth, who is chair
of educational psychology at Indiana University of Pennsylvania.
She suggests saying, ``There are some people who will think less of
you if they know about this. We know you're not a bad kid, and we
don't want other people to jump to conclusions. Whom do you think
we can trust with this?''
</P>
<P>
   If the transgression is public knowledge, acknowledge that there
may be nasty gossip: ``This is hard stuff, what you're going
through right now. But we know how hard you're working to undo the
damage, and we love you and believe in you.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordetsky says that by making these decisions collaborative,
there's no room for the insidious, negative messages that secrets
spawn. The conversations can even be healing, she says: ``They're
important statements about your family. That you take things
seriously, face things together, and work together.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
A need for support &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is nearly two years since Judith Warren's son's troubles
surfaced. In that time, she's worked through her sense of shame,
and he's worked through his problems. ``He became an Eagle Scout,
graduated high school, is self-employed and off drugs,'' she says
proudly.
</P>
<P>
   She speaks today in the hope that other parents won't repeat her
mistake. ``What I wanted more than anything,'' she says, ``was
someone to support the hope inside of me that everything would turn
out OK. It was a desperate hope based on my love that the core
inside him was good and he could get back to that.'' She's grateful
to her sister-in-law, but one person was not nearly enough. &QL; 
 &QL; 
TIPS FOR PARENTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --Don't leave younger siblings in the dark. If the transgression
is public, they need to know what people might say, and how to
respond. If it's something that can be kept within the family, tell
him, ``What your brother did was wrong, and we're taking steps to
make sure it never happens again. It's up to him and us to decide
whether to tell anyone outside the family.''
</P>
<P>
   --Reassure siblings that a teen is safe: ``I know you've learned
how bad drugs are. Josh realizes how bad they are now, too, and
we're getting him help so he'll never do drugs again.'' If it's
appropriate, be clear that Josh is taking responsibility for his
actions: ``He's working to pay for what he stole.''
</P>
<P>
   --If you want to share a secret from your teenage years, along
the lines of ``I did the same thing once,'' be clear about why
you're sharing: ``I'm telling you not because it's OK to do this
but because I realized what a bad choice I made.'' Otherwise, a
teen may throw it in your face later on: ``Well, you did it!''
</P>
<P>
   --Don't blow out of proportion a mistake made by a good kid who
learns his lesson. The typical teen will be grateful if you say,
``OK, that's done. Let's move on.'' At the same time, be clear that
if there is a repeat, you will need outside help.
</P>
<P>
   --The more support parents have before a crisis, the better.
School psychologist Mary Ann Raforth encourages schools to set up
occasional informal discussion groups so parents can be connected
to one another and clued in to peer issues.

MILLBURY: HERE WE GO AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The news Wednesday from Uniondale, N.Y., was that the Islanders
were sold. That should sound familiar. In fact, given the frequency
that it occurs, it almost doesn't qualify as news.
</P>
<P>
   A headline that read, ``Islander ownership refuses to sell,'' or
maybe ``Isles owner: I'm with this club to bitter end,'' now that
would be something to cause a stir out there in the forgotten spit
of a raggedy rink that once was hallowed Stanley Cup ground.
</P>
<P>
   But another Islander sale? Perhaps only Liz Taylor has seen more
partnerships dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it's been tough,'' said Islander general manager Mike
Milbury, who once was the heir apparent to take over Harry Sinden's
job in Boston. ``In fact, a lot of it through the years has been
uncomfortably tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider: Milbury this spring wrapped up his fifth year as the
Islanders' full-time GM. By his count, dating back to his arrival
on the Island in '95, the Islanders have been held by seven
ownership groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anybody,'' lamented the 47-year-old Milbury,
``who's gone through more changes and turmoil than this club.''
</P>
<P>
   Seemingly almost every nine months, a new bunch of millionaires
wash ashore on Long Island like some ``Gilligan's Island''
castaways, mistakingly identifying Nassau Coliseum as a lifeboat
that will sail them to even greater riches.
</P>
<P>
   It just hasn't been the case, of course. One after another the
owners have fallen by the wayside, often vacating Islander
headquarters at warp speed, left with egos bruised and wallets
battered. Meanwhile, Milbury has had to live out a mandate,
repeated by each owner, to make the team interesting and
competitive while shaving its payroll, which is now last in the
league.
</P>
<P>
   Free economics being what it is, be it on Wall Street or along
the hockey highway, you usually get what you pay for. For the
Islanders, that has meant a product that barely brings fans to the
building anymore. They have missed the playoffs six consecutive
seasons, a streak that is three times longer than they had to
endure as an expansion team.
</P>
<P>
   Last in payroll. Last in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   And now, most likely, last chance.
</P>
<P>
   Into the breach this time wanders Charles Wang, a Long Island
computer executive who has ponied up some $190 million to purchase
the franchise that rattled off four straight Cups (1980-83). At
least he's bought that faint memory. For today, he's purchased a
money drain, knowing full well he'll lose millions of dollars in
the short-term.
</P>
<P>
   Wang's hope is that, with some seed money, Milbury can fill out
around a young nucleus of talent, prop up the dispirited franchise,
and get it moving in the right direction.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury's contract has three years remaining. ``And if I can't
do it in three seasons, well then, off with my head,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury said he has been assured that he'll have money to spend.
He can shop for free agents, although, by his own admission,
``(this summer's group) is the worst free agent class in a few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Islanders own the No. 5 pick in the June amateur draft, but
they could be enticed to deal it if a team wants to move a
high-ticket player.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury is well-versed in getting the dollars down. ``Last
summer, I had to get the payroll down,'' he said. ``I came back
with three plans, ways to get to $15 million, then $12.5 million,
and then $10 million. We got to $15 million and I said, `Well, we
can get rid, of (Felix) Potvin (ultimately dealt to Vancouver) and
that will put us around $12.5 million. But to get to $10 million,
you might as well get rid of everybody and just hire 20 guys off
the street and pay 'em $125,000 each.'''
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Hub, where the Bruins have been owned by Jeremy
Jacobs since the creation of fire, fans and media have railed
against the club's out-of-town, bottom-line ownership for years.
For the better part of 10 seasons, the club has been run as a real
budget operation, almost K Mart in context, and the result has been
a team that has failed to make the playoffs twice in the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
   Turn on sports talk radio, be it noon or midnight, and it's a
virtual guarantee that someone will spew venom over Jacobs, then
move on to Sinden and Mike O'Connell, and eventually get to the
real culprits: the media who allow this sham to perpetuate.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, the carnage on Causeway has not been pretty. Jacobs's
lean-and-mean approach has alienated a huge portion of the fan
base. Not since Bobby Orr left town as a free agent has Bruins
Nation been as hot to trot, so willing, almost eager to find
something else to do with their average $50-a-night game ticket.
Faithfully, they've waited 28 years for another Cup and some are
just now giving up their prime parade positions at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   But for those who seek some solace, all it takes is a look some
225 miles southwest for a touch of perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt, it can be worse,'' said Milbury, comparing the
situations. ``Look, Jeremy Jacobs has been what he's been since he
bought that team. He's made no bones about the fact that, `I've
invested a lot of money here, in the team and the building . . . Do
I want to make money? Yes! Do I want to lose money? No!' Most of
all, he's consistent, he's never wavered, and, by and large, the
club's benefited from that commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think they've got a pretty good club there, when
everyone's healthy. They've got good management, a good coach _ I'm
glad that's all patched up _ and I'll betcha dollars to doughnuts
that they're back in the playoffs next year.''
</P>
<P>
   It's one day since Charles Wang took control of the Islanders. A
quick check of the transactions this morning didn't turn up another
ownership swap. The club that once ruled the spring with the NHL's
most potent power play is going on 24 hours of granite-slab
stability.
</P>
<P>
   Milbury, ex-defenseman, ex-minor league coach, ex-NHL coach,
ex-assistant GM, maintains his grip on what has been a very
unsteady wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still standing,'' he said, his voice a blend of the
wistful and whimsical. ``I'm still here. I'm not embarrassed to
tell you, I had the moving boxes ready to load. I'm just kidding,
but hey, in some ways . . . I was prepared.''

GRIM NEWS IN LATEST REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you thought Wednesday morning's snow was depressing, brace
yourself for what could be another rotten day.
</P>
<P>
   The government is releasing two economic reports _ one on
growth, the other on wages _ that have the potential to move the
markets in the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we get numbers that suggest booming growth and developing
labor-cost pressures, that could be a lethal combination,'' said
Mark Zandi, chief economist at RFA Dismal Sciences, a Pennsylvania
forecasting firm. ``It would support the case for much more
tightening by the Federal Reserve, and that would be difficult for
stocks and bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Fridays ago, an inflation report that came in higher than
expected sent the Nasdaq Composite index tumbling almost 10
percent. Both new- and old-economy stocks have since rallied, on
the belief that there really isn't much to worry about. The latest
reports may put that view to the test.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go to the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   First there's the gross domestic product for the first quarter.
While estimates vary, forecasters agree on one thing: ``It will be
a big number,'' said Fred Breimyer, chief economist at State Street
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The betting is that GDP will come in at an annual pace of around
6 percent. That follows 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter and 5.7
percent in the third quarter. These are numbers you would expect
from Singapore or South Korea, not from the world's largest
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Growth has been powered by consumer spending on houses, cars,
and just about everything else. Business investment has been
strong, too. Five rates hikes by the Fed have not done anything yet
to dent the economy's momentum. Wayne Ayers, chief economist at
FleetBoston Financial Corp., said the Fed would like to see growth
in the 3.5 to 4 percent range. A 6 percent number would not make
Greenspan and company happy.
</P>
<P>
   The GDP report also will measure first-quarter inflation. The
March consumer price index revealed that prices have started to
climb on items besides gasoline and heating oil. A big move up in
the price component of the GDP could add fuel to that fire.
</P>
<P>
   A more important guage of inflationary pressure will be this
morning's second report, the employment cost index. The ECI
measures the growth in wages and benefits. If you assume that labor
costs are the biggest expense a company faces, rising personnel
costs make it more likely that a company will consider raising
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters expect total compensation _ a blend of wages and
benefits _ to show a 1.1 percent gain for the quarter. That doesn't
sound like a big number, but it represents an increase from where
gains have been over the past few years. Potentially more troubling
is the fact that increases may come from both the wage and benefit
sides of the ledger.
</P>
<P>
   For a number of years, corporate America got a break on the
benefit side because health care costs had flattened out. Those
costs are on the rise again _ health insurance premiums are up 8 to
10 percent this year _ and the ECI may reflect that trend.
</P>
<P>
   Add it all up and what do you get?
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the idea that the Fed has a lot more work to do,''
Zandi said. Conventional wisdom says the Fed will increase rates
two more times this year, and that will be enough to bring the
economy in for a soft landing.
</P>
<P>
   That view, Zandi said, may be way too sanguine. He thinks it
could take as many as four more rates hikes to do the trick. If
he's right, and investors recognize it, the impact on the market
may not be pretty.
</P>
<P>
   New-economy fans will counter this doom and gloom by pointing to
productivity numbers that have been very strong for the past year.
Who cares if wages are rising, they will say, as long as workers
are producing more with less?
</P>
<P>
   They will also note that even if inflation is rising, the
increases are very modest. What's wrong with, say, 3 percent
inflation, if everything else is going so well?
</P>
<P>
   Right or wrong, the Fed is not likely to subscribe to that
benign view of the world.
</P>
<P>
   What does all this mean for investors?
</P>
<P>
   It may mean that there will be no safe place in the market to
hide. Over the past few weeks, investors have been rotating out of
technology stocks into more traditional holdings on the theory that
traditional stocks are less risky. But if rates are going up, maybe
substantially, those old-economy stocks will not offer much shelter
from the storm.

NEW YORK CITY MAYOR RECEIVES DIAGNOSIS OF PROSTATE CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN and DANIEL J. WAKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Thursday that he has
prostate cancer but that it was too early to know whether it would
affect his expected run for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference at City Hall, Giuliani said routine tests
during a physical examination a little more than two weeks
suggested he might have the disease. A biopsy of his prostate
Wednesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center confirmed a diagnosis of
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani told reporters that ``The good news is that there
are lots of possible options.'' He said his form of cancer was in a
very early stage and was ``treatable.'' He also stressed that he
was otherwise in ``terrific'' health.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great,'' said the 55-year-old mayor, who appeared
relaxed and at times joked with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   When questioned repeatedly about whether the illness would
interfere with the Senate race, Giuliani said, ``I don't think it's
fair to answer questions about the Senate race right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some forms of treatment might require him to take time off,
Giuliani said. ``I may have to reschedule a few things,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani will not change his schedule of campaign appearances
because of the cancer diagnosis, said a spokeswoman, Juleanna
Glover Weiss. ``We're proceeding ahead as planned,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said it would be several weeks before he decided what
to do. ``I need to know what the course of treatment is before I
can do anything about it,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to a range of treatments, including radiation,
hormones and surgery to remove the prostate gland. The surgical
operation is called a radical prostatectomy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to evaluate all of these different options,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said the cancer had been caught early enough that
there was no need for emergency treatment, but he added, ``It
wouldn't be a good idea to extend it for a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, Giuliani's Democratic opponent in the
Senate race, said before a campaign stop in Penn Yan, N.Y., that
``Like all New Yorkers, my prayers and best wishes are with the
mayor for a full and speedy recovery, and I hope that everyone
joins me in wishing him well.''
</P>
<P>
   Political figures from both parties sought to separate
Giuliani's health problem from politics.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, who had talked of challenging the mayor for the
Senate nomination, said that now should be a ``private time'' for
the mayor and his family. ``Issues that cut to the core of a
person's health and life transcend election campaigns and
politics,'' Lazio said.
</P>
<P>
   The New York state chairman of the Republican Party, William D.
Powers, said it was a day for prayers, not politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our hopes and prayers are with Mayor Giuliani and his family,
and we are glad to hear that he has caught this in the early stages
and that the prognosis is good,'' Powers said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as he had the strength and courage to turn New York City
around, I know he has the strength and courage to take on this
challenge and win,'' Powers said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Giuliani's father died of prostate cancer at the age of 73 in
1981. But Giuliani noted that his father lived until 73, and that
many advances had been made in treating the disease. The mayor said
that having prostate cancer in the family increased the likelihood
of contracting the disease by only 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   On a philosophical note, Giuliani said that learning he had
cancer ``makes you think about what's important in life.'' But he
added, ``You should be doing that anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's cancer was detected through a P.S.A. test, which
measures the level of a protein in the prostate that would indicate
cancer. P.S.A. stands for prostate specific antigen. The protein
becomes detectable when cancerous tumors exist.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he took the test twice, and it confirmed an
elevated P.S.A. level. The doctor called him Wednesday with the
diagnosis. ``I kind of expected it,'' Giuliani said. ``The P.S.A.
was high twice.''
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed malignancy in
American men, and the second leading cause of death from cancer in
American men. One out of four who are diagnosed with the disease
die of it.
</P>
<P>
   When the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate _ as Giuliani
said applied to his case _ it is generally curable. More than
179,000 U.S. men were diagnosed with prostate cancer last year.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent Americans who have been treated successfully for
prostate cancer include former Sen. Bob Dole, Gen. Norman
Schwarzkopf and Joe Torre, manager of the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, an avid Yankee fan, said he hoped to speak to Torre
because the Yankee manager had ``been through this.'' Giuliani
added that, `` I'm sure he'll be a source of strength and good
advice.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor said the owner of the Yankees, George Steinbrenner,
had been among the first to call him to express support.

CRACKPOTS, BROUGHT TO YOU BY `BALANCE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK JURKOWITZ  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, investigative journalists gathered at Harvard
University to talk about their craft. The Associated Press's
Charles Hanley _ who unearthed the Pulitzer Prize-winning story of
the slaughter of civilians at No Gun Ri Bridge during the Korean
War _ explained that one obstacle to good reporting is the axiom
about ``two sides to every story.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after amassing overwhelming evidence of the massacre,
Hanley's team had to find and cite a retired officer who claimed no
knowledge of the event, ``exposing him as either a fool or liar or
whatever else.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Always get the other side,'' Hanley added sardonically.
``That's the motto.''
</P>
<P>
   The notion that there are two sides to every story can obscure
reality. The point took center stage after last weekend's dramatic
events in Miami as newspapers weighed the merits of balancing the
image of the federal agent brandishing the gun in front of Elian
Gonzalez with photos of him comfortably reuniting with his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Where the concept has truly distorted the media's mission of
clarity and accuracy is in the frantic world of 24/7 cable
coverage. There, the idea that there are two equal sides to every
aspect of the Gonzalez saga served to do what shouting-head TV does
best _ pour gasoline on a flammable situation.
</P>
<P>
   The belief that every issue requires two opposing viewpoints is
the first commandment of the cable news talk show. On any given
``Crossfire,'' ``Hardball,'' or ``Hannity &AMP; Colmes,'' and on any
given issue _ guns, abortion, or whether the sun rises in the east
_ ideological foes do battle without hint of resolution,
concession, or compromise.
</P>
<P>
   There were already enough legitimate angles to the Elian
Gonzalez story to launch 1,000 sensible sound bites. Echoes of the
Cold War, civil disobediance, and of course, family values are
subjects worth debating. But in the wake of Saturday's three-minute
raid to seize the boy, the rhetoric that flowed in the name of
balance hit an all-time low.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN's ``Evans, Novak, Hunt &AMP; Shields,'' fuming congressman
Lincoln Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) insisted the brainwashing and
``drugging'' of Elian had begun with his transfer. Appearing on
Larry King's program, Senator Bob Smith (R-N.H.) managed, in one
Evel Knievel-esque leap, to tie the Miami raid to the
administration's decision to renew diplomatic ties with Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, the host feels compelled to supply the other side of
the story. When Chuck Vance, a former Secret Service agent and CEO
of a large security firm, gave a calm and reasoned rationale for
the tactics used to grab the boy, King could only sputter that the
pictures sure looked ``terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   King's Saturday show was a model of ``journalistic balance.''
Four critics of the raid squared off against five defenders. When
the argue-fest had ended, the host hoped his viewers found the
program ``illuminating.'' With so much more heat than light?
</P>
<P>
   ``No rumor was too outlandish and no tale too silly to gain
credence,'' wrote Jane Sutton of Reuters. So it is in a media
culture where allegations of doctored photographs and a drugged
6-year-old command instant and equal footing with the denials.
</P>
<P>
   The good news is that the public seems increasingly immune to
the media sideshow. Polls consistently
</P>
<P>
   show citizens supporting the removal of the boy from the Miami
home, concurring that the government had exercised patience, and
disdaining the idea of congressional hearings on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   These people absorbed the emotional impact of the story. They
were concerned about the amount of force used to transfer Elian and
by a narrow ratio, believed the photograph of the armed agent
finding the boy was more powerful than that of the father-and-son
reunion. But unlike the TV debate shows that pass themselves off as
enlightened discussion, the public can separate emotion from
reason, rhetoric from rationality.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and by the way. A CNN-Gallup poll indicates that by a
whopping 66-to-30 percent ratio, the public disapproves of the
media's performance in this saga. I'm afraid there aren't two sides
to that story, either.

IN NYC _ TRUCKS, TRUCKS, AND MORE TRUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many of you have asked, sometimes in anger over their
very existence or simply out of befuddlement over their popularity,
when the big truck/SUV craze will die down. Doesn't everybody who
wants a high-riding big rig have one by now? Won't rising gasoline
prices send consumers looking for smaller vehicles and
manufacturers back to the ramps for new products?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, in a New York minute: Faggedaboudit.
</P>
<P>
   At the 100th year of the New York International Auto Show,
trucks and SUVs were everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Pickup trucks are becoming SUV-like. Some SUVs are becoming more
carlike _ downright station wagony, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Zarella, executive vice president at General Motors, said
the message from customers is clear: ``Give us more trucks. Give us
more trucks. And keep 'em coming.''
</P>
<P>
   So GM will comply, and this year, for the first time, Zarella
said, the company will sell more trucks than cars. And they'll
equip them with ever more powerful, Vortec 6000 V8 engines. After
all, you wouldn't want some whining little power plant under the
hood as you motor along in your Chevrolet Silverado 3500 Big Dooley
Crew Cab would you?
</P>
<P>
   Also notable from GM was the announcement that its Denali XL
(used to be the GMC Suburban) will get full-time all-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan, which got left behind without a big truck when the
big-truck/SUV wave arose, announced that it, too, will begin
building big trucks. Its first V8 pickup will be here in 2003. And
once you've got the big-truck platform and the engine, four-door
pickup trucks and a line of big SUVs obviously will not be far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   For proof of that, look no further than Toyota's presentation at
this year's show.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota made big news last year with its highly acclaimed Toyota
Tundra, the first non-American V8 truck. Today, they can't build
them fast enough. But they aren't stopping there.
</P>
<P>
   The Tacoma pickup will now be offered with four doors _ just
like the Tundra.
</P>
<P>
   And with the unveiling of two new SUV models here this week,
Toyota now will offer five SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that Don Esmond, group vice president and general
manager for Toyota Motor Sales, boasted at the presentation that
America now has a Big Four group of auto manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the SUV lineup that already includes the Land Cruiser
and 4Runner will be a redesigned RAV4, a big SUV called the Sequoia
(based on the Tundra platform), and a ground-up model called the
Highlander.
</P>
<P>
   The new RAV4 is taller and bigger than previous models, looking
much like the BMW and Mercedes SUVs. Toyota is aiming this car at
younger buyers, a market that the company acknowledges it left
behind in recent years. That's why on the non-SUV front, Toyota is
also pushing its new MR2 sports car, a new Celica, and the all-new
Echo.
</P>
<P>
   The Sequoia, introduced earlier in Detroit, is a luxurious SUV,
and with the Lexus-based V8 that powers the Tundra under the
Sequoia's hood, it will be a silky, powerful vehicle. The
Highlander will be more carlike _ for those who want good driving
in bad weather, who want to sit a bit higher, and who want the
expansiveness of an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood before Toyota's lineup of five SUVs, Esmond was
upfront about the conflicting mission of trying to build cleaner,
more environmentally friendly cars while at the same time meeting
customer demand.
</P>
<P>
   There is ``no argument about what customers are demanding,''
Esmond said, referring to the demand for trucks and SUVs. So while
building its SUV and truck fleet, he said, Toyota will also begin
selling its hybrid gasoline-electric Prius this summer at under
$20,000. For the anti-SUV crowd, this is a chance to bolster the
manufacture of a car that not only runs clean, but gets more than
50 miles per gallon and seats five. If some folks can demand trucks
and SUVs, it will be up to others to show demand for hybrid
vehicles such as the Prius and Honda's Insight.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the demand for bigger, for more powerful, for
taller, longer, roomier continues unabated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the American market, V8 power rules,'' Esmond summarized.
``It gets you into the big games.''
</P>
<P>
   Other auto show highlights:
</P>
<P>
   --Oldsmobile showed off a new Bravada, promising that this
6-cylinder SUV will perform like it's got a V8. Interestingly, its
platform will be shared with Honda Passport, Isuzu Rodeo, Chevrolet
Blazer, and the GMC Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   --More on SUVs: Audi got into the
is-it-an-SUV-or-is-it-a-station-wagon game with the Audi 2.7
Allroad Quattro, which looked very much like a Volvo Cross Country
set higher off the road and made taller and more muscular.
</P>
<P>
   --And speaking of Subaru, they introduced a new engine, the H6
3.0, a horizontally opposed engine that will deliver 212
horsepower. Slap that in your Outback and you're ready to rumble.
</P>
<P>
   --And finally, as that guy Fitzgerald said, writing about that
other guy Gatsby, we seem to be borne back ceaselessly to the past.
So it was with great pleasure that I toured a small exhibit of cars
that had been introduced down the years at earlier New York shows.
Among my favorites: A 1903 Olds Doctor's Coupe with a single
cylinder engine, a 1916 Cadillac Town Car, a 1927 Pierce Arrow
Limousine, a 1930 Franklin Sport Runabout, a 1955 Ford Thunderbird,
a 1958 Dual Ghia ``400'' prototype with a record player installed,
a 1948 Chelvrolet Fleetmaster ``Woody'' Station Wagon, and finally,
from among all of them, the car I would take home with me, if I
could: a 1929 Stutz Vertical 8 Black Hawk Speedster.

NEW LIFE FOR AN OLD BUTCHER BLOCK

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My butcher-block countertop needs some TLC; it is badly
stained from food prepared on it. How would I clean and refinish it
_ with oil? The spouse says why not olive oil? She also wants a
nice shiny poly finish, while I'm at it
</P>
<P>
   NAME withheld to protect the guilty, Bedford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Brother, you are on thin ice with She Who Must Be Obeyed, and
so is the handyman, who is about to disagree with her.
</P>
<P>
   The top was probably treated with oil, so to clean it, sand it
to the bare wood. Use a power sander. Then treat with mineral oil.
Do not use olive oil; as good as it is, it will turn rancid. The
mineral oil, less toxic than linseed oil, will not turn. The nice
thing about an oil finish is that you can prepare food on it. You
can even cut on it, but don't; use a cutting board instead. And,
you can apply more oil any time you feel like it.
</P>
<P>
   How about a nice shiny poly finish, asks the spouse? Coming up:
Use an oil-based, high-gloss polyurethane varnish _ two coats,
preferably three. It is a hard finish and will scratch, but still
will give good service. When it looks as if it needs TLC, sand and
refinish.
</P>
<P>
   Good luck to us all, AIGF (all in good faith).
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My garage is made of clay blocks that look like concrete, but
are hollow. Some are broken, and sparrows and other small birds
nest in the cavities. I don't mind the birds, only the mess they
make on the wall and on the ground below. How can I fill or cover
those cavities?
</P>
<P>
   JEFF LEVITT, Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. You could fill them with concrete or mortar, but be sure
there's a bottom and sides to those cavities; I would hate to think
of you filling up the whole wall and wondering where all that
mortar went.
</P>
<P>
   Or, stuff the cavities nearly full of wadded paper, then apply
mortar to that to fill. You can tint the mortar to match the clay
blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Another method is to cover everything: Attach vertical strapping
to the blocks, then apply cedar clapboards and stain them with a
semitransparent stain. Or, apply horizontal strapping and apply
white cedar shingles, letting them weather forever.
</P>
<P>
   Attach the strapping with molly bolts; predrilled holes are
necessary for that. Or, glue them on with construction adhesive.
Then nail on the clapboards or shingles _ carefully.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. One of the options for upgrading my kitchen is to change the
hardware on the cabinets. Trouble is, the handles are set on bolts
3 inches apart, while the replacements I can find at Home Depot are
only 2 3/4 inches apart. I don't like the idea of drilling new
holes and filling old ones. Where can I find new handles that will
fit?
</P>
<P>
   FREDA CANAVAN, Winchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Stores and lumber places don't always have the widest of
selections, and unfortunately don't tell you where you can get what
you want. But try the Renovators catalog at 800-659-2211 or the
Rockler catalog (formerly the Woodworkers' Store) at 800-279-4441.
</P>
<P>
   Both have 3-inch boring handles, and large selections.
Renovators has mostly traditional with some modern; Rockler has a
lot of both.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am building a hardwood bookcase 12 feet long and 7 feet
high, which I will stain and finish. I would like the shelves to be
more than 3/4-inch thick, but am not sure how to do that. Thicker
hardwood shelves would cost a lot more for an already pricey
project. I was thinking of plywood with a hardwood veneer, but how
would I make the shelves thicker?
</P>
<P>
   RALPH LeBLANC, Braintree, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. That should be relatively easy. Don't make the shelves
thicker, only make them look thicker by applying a piece of 1 x 2
hardwood or a fancier molding 1 1/2 inches thick. This is a common
practice, and no disgrace to cabinetmaking.
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, support your shelves every 3 feet. You don't want
them sagging after having spent so much labor and cash. Nothing
spoils the looks of a bookcase like a sagging shelf. That 3-foot
span may sound conservative, but I would not take the chance of
anything wider.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I left a rubber bath mat on a white vinyl bathroom floor.
When I picked it up, it left a yellow stain on the vinyl Can I
remove it? I have tried a few things without success.
</P>
<P>
   KELLY MAJOR, Upton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Oops, the old yellow stain on vinyl _ again. It's a plague,
caused by water. And because it's a chemical stain, it's permanent.
Even the white vinyl flooring people have no real answer. But, you
might try sanding the spots with fine sandpaper. If the stain
disappears, then coat the whole floor with Future. Sometimes, the
stain is caused by water trapped on top of the vinyl (as under the
bath mat), sometimes when the water is under the vinyl, but no
matter how it got there, removal is almost impossible.

MEN'S GROUPS TAKING A STAND AGAINST ABUSE, SEXUAL ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOSEPH P. KAHN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLOUCESTER, Mass. _ Waving signs (``Hands Are Not for Hitting,''
``Strong Men Don't Bully'') condemning domestic violence, a group
of men was marching down Main Street during last year's July Fourth
parade here when a woman caught Ted Hoague's attention.
</P>
<P>
   She was in her 70s, Hoague guessed, and a stranger to him,
although Hoague, one of the group's organizers, has lived and
worked in this community for decades. She stood well back in the
crowd, one face in a rolling sea of faces taking in a festive
holiday parade on a sunny summer morning.
</P>
<P>
   The woman stared at Hoague, her eyes locked on his. The whole
transaction lasted _ what? _ a couple of seconds, at most. Her
mouth opened as he and the other marchers passed by.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Thank you,(unitals) the woman said silently.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)Thank you.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Hoague trembled as he walked on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I talked to afterwards had experiences like that,''
Hoague recalls. ``Maybe the women didn't say anything because they
were standing beside a husband or boyfriend, but they made eye
contact. You could tell what they were feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoague, a 55-year-old carpenter and father of two, belongs to a
scattered but growing army of volunteers: men who are taking a
public stand against domestic violence and sexual assault and are
encouraging other men to do likewise.
</P>
<P>
   The movement has quietly taken root from the North Shore to the
South Shore, from the streets of Gloucester to the State House and
beyond. Though often perceived as a ``women's issue,'' violence
against women and children _ and in some instances against men, too
_ affects everyone, Hoague and others in the movement say. And
while batterers and rapists are often forced by the criminal
justice system to face the consequences of their actions, these men
are in the fight because they want to be. As sons, brothers,
husbands, and fathers, they choose not to remain silent on the
issue, even at the risk of being ridiculed as ``unmanly'' for
speaking out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are men everywhere waiting to do something,''
says William Greenbaum, a Gloucester art dealer who was the prime
catalyst behind last summer's march here. ``They just don't know
what's appropriate to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum in many ways epitomizes the initiative's grass-roots
nature. The son of a Russian immigrant, he is an ex-journalist with
a PhD from Harvard whose professional and social circles flow
across class, race, and gender boundaries. Five years ago, says
Greenbaum, a close woman friend who had been sexually abused as a
teenager began to experience severe post-trauma symptoms. At the
same time, another friend was opening the Cape Ann office of Help
for Abused Women and Their Children (HAWC), a Salem-based
organization that serves an estimated 11,000 clients annually.
Greenbaum wondered if there was some way he could help. Something
beyond a consoling arm around a shoulder or a check sent to a
worthy cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``As men, we haven't really been doing anything,'' reflects
Greenbaum, a lanky, balding man with three grown daughters of his
own. ``There was a feeling that our silence had been condoning the
violence, that the culture reinforces that message. It's like drunk
driving was 20 years ago. Nobody said much about it then, but
attitudes have changed dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenbaum approached a handful of men he knew locally and asked
them, one on one, if they would be willing to march against
violence in the upcoming holiday parade. The men, mostly in their
40s and 50s, included Greenbaum's car mechanic and barber, several
fishermen, a local bar owner, and a power company lineman. His
strategy, which he has come to embrace with a near-religious
fervor, was to stay within the boundaries of Gloucester itself,
recruiting men well known to their neighbors. Just by virtue of
being there, Greenbaum reasoned, these men would make a powerful
statement to the larger community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mainly looking for men who'd had to make a choice in
their lives somewhere along the line _ about anger, about alcohol,
about their marriages, whatever,'' Greenbaum says. ``Some guys who
said they believed in the cause said they weren't ready to march,
and that was OK. Guys in the trades don't usually associate
themselves with this sort of action. It did take some courage to
risk being called a sissy or unmasculine.''
</P>
<P>
   Few mentioned to Greenbaum any direct connection to domestic
violence, such as having grown up with an abusive parent. Most
simply acknowledged that it was the right time and place to make
the statement. The holiday parade typically draws about 25,000
spectators to the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   On parade day, 86 men _ bankers, clergymen, and artists, too _
turned up to march. They called their ad hoc group Gloucester Men
Against Domestic Abuse and opted for a consciously funky, homegrown
look, marching with props that were in keeping with the event's
lighthearted atmosphere. A few hecklers took verbal shots at the
group, says Greenbaum, but not many.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not being accusatory,'' notes Greenbaum, who through a
support group called Men for HAWC is helping similar efforts get
under way in Lynn and Danvers. He will also march in a Walk for
HAWC rally in Salem on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The display of giant papier-mache hands ``symbolized our
reaching out to other men,'' Greenbaum adds. ``The message was that
this mechanic, this plumber doesn't want to hear any of this sexist
stuff anymore. On the job or anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the marchers was Dennis Flavin, who owns the Halibut Point
restaurant here. Flavin, a self-described ``old hippie who believes
in nonviolence,'' had already begun to notice a change in the way
men talk about domestic violence cases.
</P>
<P>
   Around the bar in his restaurant, says Flavin, where men often
gather to watch sports, the conversation kept drifting to a number
of high-profile assault cases involving star athletes, including
ex-Red Sox Wilfredo Cordero and ex-Patriot Dave Meggett. These
cases, Flavin theorizes, caused men to talk with uncharacteristic
candor about what happens when a man loses control and lashes out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when it reaches what I'd call the normal person,'' says
Flavin, seated beside Greenbaum and Hoague during a recent luncheon
meeting. ``Guys may not want to talk to their friends about it, but
when something like this happens to their sports heroes, when a
football player'' _ Carolina Panthers receiver Rae Carruth _ ``gets
arrested for (allegedly) murdering his pregnant girlfriend, then
everyone talks about it. And the more conversation you get going,
the more people get involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Much as the AIDS crisis forced men to talk about condom use more
frankly, adds Flavin, seeing athletes in handcuffs has had a
trickle-down effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you read about them, it's drugs or domestic
violence,'' says Flavin. ``For a lot of guys, the idea of men
hitting women or kids makes them sick.''

 GLOUCESTER, Mass.: ... them sick.''

<P>
   Another group of men sits around a conference table at the
Boston offices of the Massachusetts Coalition Against Sexual
Assault and Domestic Violence. The group was recruited over the
past few months by Jane Doe Inc. executive director Judith E.
Beals, and it includes, in addition to Greenbaum, a police officer,
a state legislator, a youth corps leader, and the board chairman of
a Cambridge, Mass. program for recovering batterers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To solve the problem,'' Beals says, ``you need boys and men
talking to other boys and men.''
</P>
<P>
   The talk this night drifts from the broadly political to the
intensely personal.
</P>
<P>
   Winchester police detective James Pierce mentions one ``horrific
incident'' in 1992, when a Winchester woman took out a restraining
order against her ex-boyfriend, a man named Ernest Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had been an abusive relationship, but she thought she could
change him,'' recalls Pierce. ``Finally he smashed the windows of
her car. She was in my office that morning. We drew up a safety
plan. At 5 o'clock that afternoon, he put a gun to the mother's
head, executed the mother in her driveway, kidnapped the
ex-girlfriend, and took her to Florida, where he eventually killed
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude was, things like that don't happen in
Winchester,'' Pierce continues. ``But that case proved it could
happen anywhere. And with something as horrific as that, you
couldn't help but be affected.''
</P>
<P>
   State Representative Peter Koutoujian of Newton, a former
Middlesex County assistant district attorney who prosecuted
hundreds of abuse cases, tells the group he was somewhat taken
aback when he sent a letter to each male legislator late last year,
asking for his pledge to neither commit nor condone domestic
violence. The pledge is taken from the White Ribbon Campaign, an
antiviolence initiative that began in Canada nearly a decade ago
and has since spread worldwide. So far only 40 legislators have
committed their signatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would be immediately embraced,'' says Koutoujian.
``But even close friends who cared about their families razzed me
about it. They said this was political correctness, a women's
issue. It's not. It's really a public health issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Men may say it's jumping ship to oppose violence, but I'm a
father, too,'' adds Craig Norberg-Bohm, board chairman of Emerge, a
program for batterers. ``Being perceived in our work as hating men
is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was 12 years old, Norberg-Bohm says, he was sexually
assaulted by an older man whom he had admired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an awful start to my sexual history,'' he says, ``so
this is a good place to start for men like me. My closest friend
was also sexually assaulted. A woman in my apartment building was
raped. It's on our street, it's among our friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Amir Femi, another group member, agrees. Femi, 41, grew up in
Dorchester and Roxbury, raised mostly by his mother and a
stepfather who struggled with violent tendencies of his own. Femi
not only witnessed the effect of abuse on his mother but also saw
its more crippling impact on the households and lives of his
childhood friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the whole cycle laid out,'' recalls Femi, who runs a
City Year program focused on educating schoolchildren about
domestic violence. ``The belittling, the economic control, the
verbal threats, the physical assault. I saw guns, knives, even an
ax come out on one occasion. I witnessed one bloody knife fight
between two men over my mother. It didn't take much to see how
destructive it was, to the women, the children, even the men
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   For the women Femi knew growing up, the physical and emotional
battery ``made their worlds smaller and smaller. Could they have
friends? And if so, which ones? What could they talk about? Some of
these women lived like shut-ins. They would doubt themselves, or
feel the violence was their fault, like they somehow deserved it.
It made me wonder how could they negotiate in life when they felt
so demoralized.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more insidious, Femi adds, is the effect violence and abuse
have on the men involved, including himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the part that's generally overlooked,'' he says. ``I
mean, we all struggle with this distorted view of what it means to
be a man. With what's appropriate in a relationship with someone
who's smaller and weaker than you are. The suppressor role is well
learned. We all have it, including myself.''
</P>
<P>
   For years Femi harbored a fear of getting married and having
children, a fear that one day, despite his best intentions, he
would resort to violence against the people he most loved. That
fear haunted his relationships with women, he says, until one day
in his mid-20s when he was talking to a woman friend on the phone
and the thought floated into his head, (itals)I'm a monster. A
no-good monster.(unitals) Femi began to sob. And then, he says, a
revelation came to him.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)I will never do that,(unitals) he thought to himself.
</P>
<P>
   (itals)I don't have to do that.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Six months ago, Femi got married. He and his wife hope to start
a family someday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided that my peer group will be the end of the line for
this family violence stuff,'' Femi murmurs. ``My father, the
stepfather who's been in my life for 31 years, he's wrestled with
it. He grew up with violence in his home. I don't see anyone's life
improved one micron by it.''

DISSENT AT YOUR PERIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LINDA WELTNER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of my favorite young women was in the thick of the battle
against the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Sadie's one of those people who stick out in a crowd. I've known
her since her parents began bringing her to our
Unitarian-Universalist church as a child, and I always thought she
was just about everything you'd ever want in a daughter: outspoken
yet constructive, independent yet cooperative, friendly, kind, and
thoughtful. There's a special light in Sadie's eyes that expresses
her undampened curiosity, and she still has an idealistic streak
that most kids have crushed out of them by the time they get to
college. Sadie spent her teen years feeding the homeless, acting in
school plays, and studying hard enough to rank at the top of her
class. Our whole church was delighted when she got into Wesleyan.
</P>
<P>
   I knew she'd gone to Washington because she wrote a letter that
was printed in our church newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over this semester,'' Sadie wrote, ``I have learned bits and
pieces about world economic inequality and globalization. My
roommate Jess was organizing a group to go to D.C. for a protest,
and I went to a Road Show with street performers who are trying to
spread the message about why we should protest against what the IMF
and World Bank are doing. I went more in support of Jess than
because I knew a lot about the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that exactly the way your four years at college unfolded?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road Show covered the environment, human rights,
sweatshops, capital globalization, the damage of high interest
rates to struggling third-world countries, and the real effects of
the IMF and World Bank. I learned not one country has had their
poverty level decrease. The atmosphere was full of energy and hope
for change and I realized that this was something I wanted to be
part of. I've signed petitions and been to student rallies on
campus, but I've never done anything like this before. There will
be thousands of people there, and cops.''
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't it amaze you that year after year, young people have
hope for a better future? Doesn't it warm your heart that a new
generation can still be inspired to work on behalf of those less
fortunate than themselves? Because they believe they have a
responsibility to improve the world, Sadie and about 150 other
Wesleyan students crowded into dormitories at American University
and joined affinity groups to form human blockades, to document
what was happening, to call lawyers and parents if necessary, and,
above all, to keep one another safe.
</P>
<P>
   Sadie signed up to be part of a blockade that would move if so
directed by the police. She reassured us all that this was not a
``directly arrestable action,'' but she was wrong. The police
surrounded and then arrested 600 students who were doing nothing
more provocative than walking peacefully along a sidewalk. The
police also shut down the group's headquarters as a ``fire hazard''
so that the internal discipline the protesters were counting on to
show the world their seriousness of purpose would be disrupted.
Clearly, the police were attempting to discredit the demonstration
by provoking confusion and violence. This is hard for mothers to
accept. After all, we're the ones who taught our kids that the
police were good guys who protected citizens who'd done nothing
wrong. Now they're learning that the police are there to protect
the status quo and are willing to bend the rules to do so. We
raised our kids to believe dissent was a precious aspect of
democracy, cherished by all. Now they're finding out that the
highest priority of people in power is to hold on to it, despite
paying lip service to the democratic process. Having ripped away
the veneer of a free society, they now see that capitalism is
indifferent to everything but its own advancement.
</P>
<P>
   This painful disillusionment is what radicalized us in the '60s.
Repeating our experience, Sadie and her friends must now rethink
whether a government subservient to corporate interests is worthy
of their trust. When those who want to improve the system are
labeled troublemakers and those who look out solely for their own
interests are admired, we turn idealistic people like Sadie into
cynics and end up with a generation whose loftiest goal is its own
affluence.
</P>
<P>
   We can't let that happen.
</P>
<P>
   Sadie ended her letter, ``I'm excited about going and am glad to
have so much support from those I care about and who care about
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Include me on your list. Sadie. You go, girl!

&HT;     AMERICAN CULTURE HITS A NEW LOW 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This is America, and you need a drilling rig to
plumb the depths of our culture's bad taste.
</P>
<P>
   When the head of the National Rifle Association said President
Clinton tolerated a certain level of murder in this country for his
political gain, I thought that was the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   But no, there were depths of bad taste below that.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, who excuses shootings of
unarmed citizens by his cops, called the federal agents who rescued
Elian Gonzalez from his loony relatives ``storm troopers.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought that was the pits, but no, it turns out there are pits
beneath that.
</P>
<P>
   This has to be the very bottom. A firefighter in Littleton,
Colo., has made a music video from the tapes of the bloody murder
scenes in the cafeteria and library at Columbine High School. The
Littleton Fire Department goes around showing the tape as a
``training video.''
</P>
<P>
   Public safety officers set the carnage at Columbine to pop
music? Is Littleton a sick cartoon town somewhere near South Park?
</P>
<P>
   It's enough to make a patriotic American want to flee to Canada
or even France, where they already think our culture is beneath
contempt.
</P>
<P>
   No, wait. There's more contempt beneath that contempt. On
Wednesday, the Jefferson County Sheriff's Department in Colorado
began selling copies of the music video of the Columbine murder
scenes for $25 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   One of the songs on the music video was written and performed by
students at Columbine. Another, ``I Will Remember You,'' is by
Sarah McLachlan.
</P>
<P>
   You have to wonder if the ghouls in the Littleton sheriff's
office and Fire Department got her permission to use the song. If I
were McLachlan, I'd remember them in court.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another song on the murder music video is called ``If It
Were Up to Me,'' a protest against guns by someone named Cheryl
Wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   The song has deep, meaningful lines like, ``Maybe it's the
movies, maybe it's the books, maybe it's the bullets, maybe it's
the real crooks, maybe it's the drugs, maybe it's the parents . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   No maybes about it, this song stinks.
</P>
<P>
   It concludes, ``Maybe it's the end, but I know one thing. If it
were up to me, I'd take away the guns.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no rhyme and no reason, and the hell with that. The song
I have in mind is ``I Shot the Sheriff.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson County Sheriff's Department has been in constant
trouble with the local citizenry since the smoke cleared from the
assault by students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold.
</P>
<P>
   Nine lawsuits have been filed against the department claiming
deputies could have prevented the attack and failed to react
quickly enough after the shooting started.
</P>
<P>
   Bad enough that deputies stood around outside the school in
their SWAT armor long after Harris and Klebold were dead. The
sheriff's office also angered families of dead students by
circulating surveillance tapes of the murder scene in the
cafeteria, and letting Time magazine get some of the gory pictures
into its pages.
</P>
<P>
   Now the sheriff's and fire departments have gotten into the
music video racket. They're VJs for MTV, and the M stands for
``murder.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all right to jump all over Littleton and Jefferson County
authorities for producing and selling a music video about murder.
They deserve every bit of abuse they get.
</P>
<P>
   But keep in mind they're just small-time idiots who were
well-positioned to plumb the depths of bad taste about Columbine.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't the first to set mass murder to music, either.
</P>
<P>
   TV networks compose mini-theme music and design logos to
introduce their segments on school shootings, terrorist bombings
and celebrity murder trials. They're just not as long and corny as
that song about ``Maybe it's the movies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jefferson County Sheriff's Department decided to price its
murder music video at $25. That's pretty crass, but you have to ask
yourself how much CNN and MSNBC made from showing the footage of a
bloody kid falling out of a school window over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   Millions, that's how much. And on last week's first anniversary
of the murders, they made millions more with reruns.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between the major networks and the podunk
Littleton fire and sheriff's departments is that the networks
exploit the murder scenes with a little more class.
</P>
<P>
   Grave newspeople try to discern moral and public-policy lessons
(usually wrong) in the carnage. So-called experts on media violence
are summoned to accompany videos of violence with their droning
opinions.
</P>
<P>
   The city slickers take home big salaries pretending to make
sense of senselessness. The hick sheriffs and firefighters set
senselessness to bad music and sell it at $25 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is the nadir, so far, of bad taste. You know which.
</P>

YEMEN 
The Unknown Arabia 
By Tim Mackintosh-Smith 
Overlook, 280 pp., $35 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yemen, a small poor country at the lonely tip of the Arabian
peninsula, is one of those places that seem to exist in a dimension
all their own _ in sight of the modern world, yet somehow removed
from it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a country where landcapes are either overwhelmingly lush or
terrifyingly barren, where cities seem to be baked out of
gingerbread rather than built of bricks, and where rigid codes of
hospitality and social conduct coexist with official brutality and
tolerated lawlessness. (Tourists are frequently kidnapped by
tribesmen.) The Middle Ages can seem like the day before yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Some people might willingly pay to avoid a prolonged stay in
Yemen, but Tim Mackintosh-Smith _ an engagingly eccentric and
erudite Briton _ could hardly wait to get there. Armchair travelers
have reason to be grateful.
</P>
<P>
   It began when he studied Arabic at Oxford and became hooked on a
language in which a word usually meant ``itself, the opposite and
some kind of camel.'' He began fantasizing about what he calls
``Dictionary Land,'' a surreal lexical kingdom in which a puppy is
also a demon and a rotten walnut also an uncircumcised person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exotic beckoned,'' Mackintosh-Smith decided. When he told
an Oxford professor that he was considering a trip to Yemen and was
urged to go ``somewhere respectable'' instead, his choice was
clear. That was 1982, and Mackintosh-Smith has lived in Yemen ever
since. He is now so thoroughly assimilated that he regularly chews
qat, the mildly stimulating green leaf that in strictly Muslim
Yemen replaces alcohol as a social icebreaker.
</P>
<P>
   The book is a beguiling hybrid, a combination memoir, guide,
history, and love letter to his adopted homeland and its prickly
but poetic people. Love, of course, is a state of mind: Even
getting caught in a civil war in 1994 couldn't diminish
Mackintosh-Smith's enthusiasm for Yemen.
</P>
<P>
   With British understatement, he describes the country's history
as ``complex.'' It's certainly long: San'a, the capital and chief
city, claims it was founded after the biblical flood by Noah's son
Shem. Given Yemen's stormy past, it's a miracle that sprawling
San'a still exists. As recently as 1948, an army of 250,000
tribesmen descended on the city after a military coup and, like the
Visigoths sacking Rome, spent a week looting it. ``They vandalized
and plundered, taking anything moveable,'' Mackintosh-Smith writes,
adding that ``some of the plunderers were themselves plundered by
late comers.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he writes wonderfully lucid prose, it is sometimes hard
to keep track of which century, bloody uprising, or ruthless and/or
peculiar leader (they come in both monarchist and Marxist
varieties) Mackintosh-Smith is describing.
</P>
<P>
   The most lyrical parts of the book are accounts of the author's
travels around Yemen, journeys that took him into the country's
interior, its multilayered past, and its unique national psyche.
His descriptions are vivid and insightful when he's introducing us
to places like Marib, where the remains of a massive dam built in
the eighth century BCE still stand (according to legend a rat
gnawed a hole in it, causing both dam and the kingdom it irrigated
to collapse); Shibam, the Manhattan of the desert, where hundreds
of tightly packed mud-brick towers rise abruptly out of a flat
plain; and Tarim, ``the Venice of Sand,'' where the grand palaces
of vanished merchant princes are slowly sinking into the desert.
</P>
<P>
   In the great stiff-upper-lip tradition of travel writing,
Mackintosh-Smith maintains a cheery, mustn't-grumble tone while
describing arduous and sometimes dangerous expeditions by foot,
donkey, rattletrap truck, and leaky wooden sailboats of the sort
Sinbad the sailor captained. On one particularly harrowing hike he
had to be on the lookout for both scorpions and the local tahish, a
monster ``the size of a cow, but it's got a head like a hyena's,
with a wide jaw.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time you get to the final pages, an affectionate portrait
of his San'a neighborhood, the reasons that Yemen remains
relatively unknown are clear _ and so are the attractions that hold
the author there. Not many of his readers are likely to follow
Mackintosh-Smith's example and set off for Dictionary Land, but we
should all be glad that he did.

MUDGE LEAVES PLENTY OF DOUBT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To judge from his performance under cross-examination, Dr.
Gilbert H. Mudge Jr. is in a tight spot.
</P>
<P>
   He seemed to say that he didn't quite tell the truth six years
ago, before his most famous patient died, but that he's telling the
truth now. He knew when he made his memorable declaration that
Celtics captain Reggie Lewis had a ``normal athlete's heart'' his
diagnosis might be wrong, but he said it anyway. But he is
definitely telling the whole truth now when he says the Lewises
were well aware that the verdict on his ailment was not clear-cut.
</P>
<P>
   Of course that is not how the eminent cardiologist put it. In
explaining the hugely divergent views doctors had formed of Lewis's
condition, he said there was a ``differential diagnosis'' between
the original Dream Team of doctors who treated Lewis at New England
Baptist Hospital and his own judgment that Lewis could eventually
resume his playing career.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he and the Lewises had agreed on the spin of the
memorable press conference in which he insisted that Lewis's
condition was benign. He said they had agreed it would be best not
to reveal any detailed medical information, which apparently
extended to the detail that he was not sure his diagnosis was
right.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was originally diagnosed as having a life-threatening
arrhythmia, but Mudge, at least publicly, declared that he suffered
from a far less serious condition that he could live with, and
probably play with.
</P>
<P>
   Mudge reiterated on the stand Wednesday that Lewis confided in
him 15 days before he died that he had used cocaine. He added that
he had never given Lewis permission to play basketball or to
heavily exert himself. Yet that account seemed at odds with his
other statements about Lewis's condition.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two hours before Lewis died, Mudge told the Globe's
Will McDonough in an interview that Lewis was doing the things an
athlete normally does to prepare for a basketball season and that
there would likely be an escalation of those activities in the
``next two weeks.'' But he claimed on the stand he didn't mean that
Lewis was to go anywhere near a basketball. He said he had signed
off on tai chi, stretching, and lifting five-pound weights. That is
hardly the regimen an NBA player follows to prepare for a season.
But Mudge explained that his comments to McDonough were just part
of the plan, which was to answer questions vaguely and put the best
public face on the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those statements were entirely consistent with what I said to
other sportswriters,'' Mudge testified. But they were not
consistent with his own insistence on the stand that he had ordered
Lewis not to exert himself.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most damaging, Mudge admitted that he did not directly
tell Lewis he had a potentially life-threatening condition when he
left the hospital. He said Lewis knew doctors were trying to
reconcile different opinions _ and, indeed, the Lewises did
eventually travel to California, where Reggie Lewis was examined by
four other doctors, one of whom said he should immediately retire.
Still, it seems reasonable to conclude that Mudge could have left
his patient more comfortable than he should have been, through both
his public and private reassurances.
</P>
<P>
   None of this means Mudge will lose, of course. It is easy in
retrospect to say that a doctor whose patient died did not get
proper care. That isn't necessarily true, and it's far below the
standard Harris-Lewis's attorneys must reach to prove malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lewis II feels like less of a can't-lose proposition for
Mudge than its predecessor. The doctor didn't help himself in the
course of his testy sparring with Neil Rossman, Harris-Lewis's
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't recall some statements he made in depositions, or in
the previous trial. He didn't recall what he said to McDonough,
although he took no issue with the account of the conversation the
Globe published. At times he said he didn't remember exactly what
he said to Reggie and Donna, or what they said to him. He
remembered every detail of the conversation with no witnesses,
though, the conversation about cocaine use that he now says
thwarted his ability to properly diagnose Reggie's condition.
</P>
<P>
   The best doctors in the world lose patients. But it is hard to
square the cocksure Mudge of the press conference six years ago
with the witness taking refuge in talk about divergent diagnoses.
On one point, at least, there is no divergence at all. A man who
seemed to be in the prime of life fell suddenly ill, and the most
celebrated medical care in town failed to save him.

IT'S THE E-CLUB TO THE RESCUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Bamberger never doubted his concept, not for one minute.
But try moving a concept _ even a well-developed one _ through a
maze as daunting as the golf equipment industry, where open arms
and welcome mats are hardly part of the landscape.
</P>
<P>
   So in his hands Bamberger held his idea, a golf club that he
wasn't promoting as revolutionary but merely as a new tool that
could help tens of thousands _ perhaps millions _ of players. He
called it the E-club _ part 3-wood, part putter _ and if Tiger
Woods, the world's greatest player, could bump delicate little
shots around the green with his fairway metal, Bamberger was sure
the average golfer could find a way to use it.
</P>
<P>
   On these finesse shots around the green, the E-club is easier to
control than a fairway metal, for what Bamberger has done is give
you a putter with the head of a 3-wood on a 35-inch shaft (as
opposed to 44- and 45-inch shafts). With 19-degree loft, the club
has a weighted, sole plate to easily lift the ball off of fringe or
out of light rough, and the 72-degree lie allows you a closer
stance and gets your eyes over the ball as you do when you putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in the tradition of a utility club,'' said Bamberger,
whose fascination with the concept goes back to the early 1990s,
when he pursued a dream and headed to Europe to explore the soul of
golf. He absorbed its essence, visited its roots, and spent weeks
upon weeks as a caddie on the European Tour, much of the time for
Duxbury native Peter Teravainen.
</P>
<P>
   His experience produced ``To the Linksland,'' a superb book that
captured the game's spirit. But it also planted the seeds for the
E-club as Bamberger vividly remembered watching players negotiate
fragile little shots around the greens on courses where it was best
to keep the ball on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glen Day (who now is on the American PGA Tour) is the one I
remember,'' said Bamberger. ``He would chip with a Ping 3-wood, and
I was intrigued by how he would play that shot. I'd try it, but you
stood so far away (because of the long shaft to a 3-wood) that it
was easy to ground your club. I preferred my putter for my recovery
shots.''
</P>
<P>
   So, he eventually reasoned, why not a combination 3-wood and
putter? ``It just took a lot less skill to hit the E-club'' than
try and finesse a Woods-like 3-wood from around the green.
</P>
<P>
   The concept having been planted, all Bamberger had to do was
come up with the design, get a patent, receive USGA approval, find
financial backing, and sell it to the public. He laughs, for
shooting 62 in the final round of a US Open would perhaps be easier
than the route he has traveled with the E-club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nowhere that simple,'' he said. But the setbacks _ such
as the marquee PGA Tour name set to lend credibility to the club
until his equipment company squashed the deal _ have given way to
success: Bamberger's E-club is on the market, and in just five
weeks, 10,000 of them have been purchased.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' said Bamberger, who readily concedes that not
everything went against him. There is the matter of meeting
Weston's Tim Neher, who eventually backed the E-club with about
$400,000 to help produce a 30-minute infomercial _ starring Nick
Price, no less _ that moved the product into public view.
</P>
<P>
   That Bamberger, a veteran golf writer with Sports Illustrated,
would form a partnership with Neher, a hugely successful executive
from the cable television industry, is a twist to the story that
makes both of them chuckle. They had never met, but they had a
mutual friend _ Brian Roberts, the CEO of Comcast, which owns two
pro teams in Philadelphia (76ers, Flyers), where Bamberger lives.
</P>
<P>
   Neher, for 25 years the president of Continental Cablevision
before it was sold to MediaOne, had a guiding hand in the birth of
The Golf Channel along with Arnold Palmer and cable TV mogul Joe
Gibbs. Through business he became friendly with Roberts, who one
day called on behalf of his friend, Bamberger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me the story,'' said Neher, ``that he had this friend
who had designed a golf club, but didn't know where to go with it.
Would I help him? I told him I wasn't sure I knew what to do
either, so why was he calling me?
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I enjoy the game and have always had a hand in golf, but
I had no interest in golf equipment.''
</P>
<P>
   But he couldn't say no to Roberts, so the E-club was mailed to
his home in Weston, Mass. ``I didn't necessarily buy into the club
right away,'' said Neher, ``but I knew that Michael had done a lot
of work.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bamberger had already secured a patent and received
affirmation from the USGA that it conformed to its rules. He had
also been turned down by some big equipment makers, but then again,
those equipment makers didn't have Tory Neher testing their club.
</P>
<P>
   Tory is Neher's 25-year-old daughter, a 20-handicap who has
played the game for more than 10 years. When Neher decided to test
the E-club, he handed it to Tory. ``She said to me, `You, of all
people, to give me this club,' '' said Neher, laughing. True, he
wasn't one for gimmicks, but what happened next was not done with
mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first hole at Weston (Golf Club), the pin was stuck back
right of the green. She was off the green and knocked it in,'' said
Neher, who turned to his wife, Molly, and said, ``It was lucky, but
it tells me something.''
</P>
<P>
   It told him that he should meet Bamberger, who flew to Boston
and sat down with Neher. ``I was so intrigued, so charmed by
Michael,'' said Neher.
</P>
<P>
   They formed Bantam Golf and had some immediate pipelines _
Q-Direct, which is a division of Comcast, would sell the club, and
Neher guided the project toward a California infomercial company
called Script to Screen. In recent weeks, deals have been signed
with Carbite Golf and chipshot.com, a popular Web site for on-line
shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael gets all the credit,'' said Neher. ``My involvement
after the business side of it was I thought it would be fun to do
for two primary reasons. I would learn about informercials, which
is a new phenomenon; and I think it's a club of enormous help. The
club is so unique in a lot of different respects.''
</P>
<P>
   The response, said Bamberger, has been positive. At first,
people thought he was re-inventing the old chipper, but ``you can
hit this club out of bunkers without lips, from underneath trees,
for long bump-and-runs. It's not a chipper.''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's the E-club. And why the E-club?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody can hit it from everywhere,'' said Bamberger.

GRANT SPARS WITH LEWIS OVER CHOICE OF GLOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The fight isn't for three more days, but the
hand-to-hand combat has already begun.
</P>
<P>
   Undisputed heavyweight champion Lennox Lewis is set to fight
Michael Grant Saturday night at Madison Square Garden in a battle
that has been dubbed ``Two Big'' because Lewis stands nearly 6 feet
6 inches and weighs approximately 250 pounds while Grant stands 6-7
and weighs about the same. Too Big, as things have turned out, has
become a problem because Wednesday Grant insisted his left hand was
too big to fit into the gloves the champion has demanded he wear.
</P>
<P>
   As champion, Lewis has the right to dictate what brand of
mashing mitts the fighters wear. He has opted for Reyes gloves, a
Mexican-made product known to do serious damage if properly used.
But Grant has always worn Grant gloves, a brand made by Elvis
Phillips. Reyes gloves, in the vernacular of the sport, are
considered punchers gloves. The bulk of their 10 ounces of padding
is around the wrist, while the business portion (the knuckles) are
tightly formed around the fist, which allows a power puncher to do
more damage because there is less padding between his knuckles and
his opponent's bridge work.
</P>
<P>
   That the gloves will weigh the same would seem to make this a
bit of a moot point when you are throwing your hands around with
250 pounds of fury behind them, but Grant insisted he had a more
direct problem. He insisted that if Johnnie Cochran were pressing
his case, he would have to tell Lewis and the New York State
Athletic Commission, ``If the gloves don't fit, you must outfit my
man with something else.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because, according to Grant, his left hand does not fit
inside a Reyes glove, a situation he described as ``a health
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My right hand fits fine,'' Grant said. ``I admit that. But I
can't make a proper fist with my left hand. I can't make a fist at
all. And if you can't make a fist, that's a broken hand right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant claims to have tried on 16 pairs of Reyes gloves, all with
the same result. Although he said he would continue to try to find
a pair that fits, he added, ``If you sit me and Lennox down and I
say, `If you couldn't make a fist, would you fight?' I'm sure he'd
say no.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe not.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a discussion of the issue during a press
conference Wednesday at the Garden, Lewis suddenly stood up and put
his large left hand into the air, palm stretched wide. He hovered
over Grant for several minutes as more than 100 reporters watched
to see what would happen.
</P>
<P>
   Reluctantly, Grant got up and put his left palm to Lewis's.
``Same size!'' Lewis scoffed before sitting down, a grin on his
face. ``Michael says they don't fit his hand, but I find that very
hard to believe. He doesn't have bigger hands than I have. He
better stop his noise. He's just saying that because he doesn't
want to wear Reyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether this is a psychological ploy by Grant or the beginning
of a psychological meltdown will remain unknown until the opening
bell. But one thing is sure: Reyes gloves or no Reyes gloves, Grant
will fight Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Grant has 4 million reasons to do this. He will surely be
reminded of that by his manager, Craig Hamilton, who negotiated the
purse in US dollars. To get it, he would fight wearing Isotoner
gloves if he had to, a fact Hamilton half acknowledged even as he
tried to defend his man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Commission has asked us to wear conforming gloves,''
Hamilton said. ``Lennox Lewis is the champion so he picks the
gloves. Lennox says his hand is bigger than Michael's. Well, he's
the only one who will get an up-close-and-personal view of how big
that hand is and how powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, his guy's gonna fight. The question is, will he
fight with confidence or has his mental breakdown already begun
over a nonissue like this?
</P>
<P>
   Grant appeared tight Wednesday when asked to speak in front of
Lewis. He spoke haltingly of how he was destined to win and that
the skeptics picking Lewis would ``see the truth and the light.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, Lewis said, ``Michael sounded a bit upset there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed he did, and not about the brand of gloves he'd be
wearing.

DIARRA'S DREAMS ARE UNDERSTOOD IN ANY LANGUAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He left West Africa three years ago, arriving at New York's JFK
Airport with bloodshot eyes, a single piece of luggage, and no
comprehension of English.
</P>
<P>
   Modibo Diarra was easy for his basketball coach, John Kelly, to
recognize. He was the 6-foot-10-inch kid with the brilliant smile.
And he was smiling on that autumn day in New York, even though a
severe case of malaria had him close to death.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a sad story about an athlete who lost his way.
Far from it. Diarra is one of the most intriguing young people I
have ever met. Maybe I'm breaking the rules by saying this, but
I've quietly rooted for him since 1998 when I interviewed him at
Notre Dame Academy in Fitchburg. After you realize what he's done
in three years, you'll want to root for him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Diarra couldn't articulate his plan _ in English _ when he came
to the United States, but he knew what he wanted. He would go to
prep school, educate himself in college, and then move on to the
NBA so he could make money for his family. He is one of 14
children. He is from historic Mali, the land that introduced the
world to Timbuktu and Songhai kings. He believes that all children
should submit to their parents and negate the self. ``He's told me
so much about his family and his culture,'' Kelly said Wednesday.
``He's an extraordinary person. I don't think I'll appreciate him
fully until he's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Diarra will be gone in the fall. He will play for John Calipari
at the University of Memphis. Calipari said he expects the center
to play immediately. He'll be eligible because he surpassed the
minimum SAT standard (820) required to participate. He wants to
major in a field that allows him to work with computers.
</P>
<P>
   None of this seemed probable a few months ago. Some major
schools shied away from Diarra because they didn't think he would
be able to pass the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bright kid,'' Calipari said. ``You have to understand
that English is his third language. I told him that one of our
goals, before he leaves here, is to make English his second
language (he also speaks French and a native language).
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great person. I asked him about his family and he told
me about his brothers and sisters. Then he wrote down all their
names and ages. Just like that. How about that?''
</P>
<P>
   If you meet Diarra, you will notice that he is teeming with joy.
Because of his constant smile, he was given the nickname ``Good
Man.'' He made friends quickly at Notre Dame, a school with fewer
than 100 students. His intelligence and sense of humor were
obvious. Really, how could a guy with a smile like that not have a
sense of humor?
</P>
<P>
   He also knows how to work. When he arrived at JFK in '97, all he
could do was nod. A couple months later, the only English word he
knew was ``yes.'' When I interviewed him late in '98, he insisted
on struggling through the session without interpreters. He did a
terrific job for 20 minutes. When I showed him a map of Mali, he
took the printout and schooled me on the land's languages and
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   He also emphasized that, yes, it was about the money. For his
parents. Diarra may have picked up some of the habits of American
teenagers _ such as playing video games and listening to hip-hop _
but he was not interested in following the parent-child
relationships in the United States. In his mind, there is no such
thing as his job and his income. It's more like his job and their
income. ``He's selfless,'' Kelly said. ``His idea of a good life is
being religious, sharing, taking care of his parents, and never
saying a bad word about anybody. He's not a complainer.''
</P>
<P>
   In late '98, his English comprehension had improved enough for
him to use American slang, but he was still reading English at a
grade-school level. Bill Barton, his coach last season, tutored him
in English for four classes. Craig DeLisle and Jeff Hammond tutored
him in math. Last summer, Diarra went to Philadelphia and
participated in a two-week English as a Second Language program. As
he became more comfortable with his words, his game got better as
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``People told me that he didn't have an offensive game,''
Calipari said. ``They're full of it. He has a jump hook. He's
strong. He can drop step. He can make a shot from 10 to 15 feet. He
has more skills than some people believe.''
</P>
<P>
   Diarra should be an immediate shot-blocking and rebounding
threat at Memphis. He is quicker than most big men and has superior
jumping ability.
</P>
<P>
   I think he will be a good player. I also think he will play in
the NBA. But that's not why I root for him.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes when people talk about kids focusing on the NBA, there
seems to be dismay and condescension at the thought; Diarra takes
the taint away from that discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there are days when you hope that anarchists dismantle
the NCAA; Diarra takes the taint away from the organization, too,
reminding you of how significant it is for some athletes to get a
college scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there are depressing lectures on what people _ young,
old, African or American _ cannot do; Diarra makes that chatter
irrelevant, too. That's why, earlier this week, Notre Dame retired
his No. 44 jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``We retired it because of his character,'' Barton said. ``I
talked to the headmaster about it. This is for the way _ the
nonbasketball way _ he pulled the whole community together. People
love him here, all around town.''
</P>
<P>
   On the night his jersey was retired, Diarra stood at a podium
and thanked about 20 people. There were tears as he spoke. His
English was coherent, although there were still snags in his verb
tenses. But he still read a speech, which he wrote by himself. He
wrote it in English.

NETGENESIS TELLS RETAILERS WHERE THE SHOPPING IS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Executives at SmarterKids.com were tickled by the sudden deluge
of customer traffic generated by their product search box on
Microsoft's Encarta reference site last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Just as suddenly, the back-patting ended. Using
customer-tracking software from NetGenesis Corp., the online
education store discovered that many of the people clicking into
the online education store were immediately clicking off.
</P>
<P>
   NetGenesis analysis revealed that users believed the search
button belonged to Encarta. And in their confusion, they were
asking SmarterKids.com about Anaconda snakes and Uruguay rather
than its Monopoly games.
</P>
<P>
   ``What seemed good on the surface was not all that great,'' said
Al Noyes, executive vice president of SmarterKids.com Inc. ``We
redesigned everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Noyes said his company would have had a hard time spotting the
glitch without NetGenesis, a developer of sophisticated software
that has helped revolutionize the way companies run their
electronic businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Merchants such as barnesandnoble.com (bn.com) and the Gap Inc.
use NetGenesis software to figure out why online shoppers avoid
certain aisles and balk at check-out counters. The information has
helped them fine-tune marketing campaigns, convert browsers into
buyers and offer more personalized content.
</P>
<P>
   But here's a revelation that NetGenesis executives have made:
Developing a groundbreaking technology doesn't necessarily lead to
market stardom. The company now needs to get big fast through
acquisitions and alliances, analysts said. And it has to prove it
has a product that will enable it to grow even as investors grow
impatient with money-losing businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Any grand expansion plans may have to be shelved, however.
Technology stocks have cooled in recent weeks, and NetGenesis'
escent on the Nasdaq Stock Market has been particularly drastic.
The company's shares more than tripled to $56.8125 on its first day
of trading in February. Wednesday, NetGenesis stock closed at
$15.125 a share, up $1.25 for the day but still below its $18
offering price two months ago. NetGenesis announces its
first-quarter earnings Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company was started in 1994, when two MIT students, Matt
Cutler and Eric Richard, discovered they could do fun things with
the Web. Through their start-up firm, then called net.Genesis, they
began building software that followed customers as they clicked
through Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   But signing up clients was more difficult than the founders had
anticipated. NetGenesis, they discovered, had zoomed so far ahead
of the curve that most businesses had not yet recognized the
importance of analyzing activity on their Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine if the whole market hadn't built stores yet,'' said
Cutler, now the firm's chief e-business intelligence officer.
``They're looking for someone to build shelves to hold merchandise.
They were saying, `That's interesting, guys. But we need cash
registers.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The founders grew frustrated with their attempts to grow the
business. ``We had sort of plateaued,'' Cutler said. ``Our head
count was flat and our sales were flat. High-tech companies need to
be growing like gangbusters. . . . At the time, it seemed like it
was harder than it should have been.''
</P>
<P>
   To keep the business alive, NetGenesis' founders realized they
needed to attract more capital and a sophisticated chief executive
officer. They lured Charles River Ventures, a Waltham, Mass.
venture capital firm, and then Larry Bohn, an executive who was
experienced in the software industry.
</P>
<P>
   After joining the company in 1998, Bohn opted for rapid change.
The new chief executive expanded the company's services, and raised
prices. Previously, the company was charging less than $10,000 for
its software. Now, the average price is more than $100,000, but the
package includes an array of analytical and consulting services.
</P>
<P>
   He also took the dot out of net.Genesis, concluding it wasn't
such a cute name, after all. Search engines, particularly those on
financial information and news sites, have had trouble recognizing
the company's dotted name.
</P>
<P>
   Under Bohn, sales at NetGenesis more than quadrupled to $6.5
million last year, though its losses ballooned to $17.9 million. In
February, he helped take NetGenesis public, raising $76.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   But NetGenesis faces new challenges. Rivals such as Accrue
Software Inc., WebTrends Corp. and Macromedia Inc. have deeper
pockets. Each is racing to get bigger by gobbling up software firms
and joining forces with giant service providers that help
businesses build Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``The better mousetrap might not always win,'' said Rob DeSisto,
an analyst with the Gartner Group. ``You either need to acquire or
really deepen your ties.''
</P>
<P>
   NetGenesis has heeded that advice. It has been cozying up to
IBM, Proxicom Inc. and other large providers of software and
consulting services. The agreements will give NetGenesis access to
the companies' extensive client lists.
</P>
<P>
   But with Internet stocks falling back to earth, technology
companies are increasingly tabling more aggressive expansion plans.
NetGenesis, for instance, will now grow ``more organically,'' Bohn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the market for NetGenesis' products is clearly growing.
The growth in online business-to-business trade has a steady line
of new clients knocking on NetGenesis' doors. The company now
counts Bell Atlantic Corp., General Electric Co.'s aircraft-engine
division and Akamai Technologies Inc. as customers.
</P>
<P>
   Often, companies say they were flying in the dark until they
began tracking their customers. Then, they uncovered all sorts of
snags: dead ends built into sites, hidden check-out buttons and
confusing storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a classic one,'' Bohn said. ``A retailer of consumer
goods complained that the average (customer) stay was one page. You
look at the site and say, `I understand why. Your site stinks.'''
</P>
<P>
   In response, the merchant said he visited the site all the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's good,'' said Bohn, snorting with laughter as he
recalled the conversation. ``Because no one else does.''

   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ When it comes to the dilemma of limited San
Francisco real estate and the crushing demand for dot-com
commercial space, there are plenty of valid points for debate.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is NOT whether dot-com working areas constitute
``offices.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad no one has been able to convey this truth to the dot-com
cheerleaders. Just as they argue that Internet goods and services
providers should not have to pay sales taxes the way
bricks-and-mortar companies do, they contend they should be exempt
from many of the planning and zoning rules everyone else must
follow.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   Well, because dot-coms are special. They sell stuff in
cyberspace, you see. They are cutting edge. Revolutionary. The
future.
</P>
<P>
   As for adherence to Proposition M, San Francisco's 14-year-old
law limiting office space development _ why, that's like using an
apple limit for oranges, they say. Old-fashioned businesses have
offices; dot-coms have, um, WORK SPACES, and oughtn't to be subject
to the city's development cap.
</P>
<P>
   This almost-touching arrogance surfaced repeatedly during a
recent hot hour on Michael Krasny's excellent ``Forum'' on KQED-FM
here.
</P>
<P>
   The topic was dot-com needs vs. city planning laws.
</P>
<P>
   In one corner were neighborhood activist David Maltz and
longtime slow-growth advocate Calvin Welch, of the Council of
Community Housing Organizations. In the other corner was former San
Francisco Supervisor Jim Gonzalez, now the executive director of a
powerful dot-com lobbying group called Information Technology
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle (sort of) was Supervisor Leslie Katz, who has been
promising for awhile now some curative legislation for the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   (Naturally, though invited, no one from the actual Planning
Commission showed up.)
</P>
<P>
   Besides arguing that dot-coms are an unappreciated economic
godsend to San Francisco, Gonzalez (and several callers to the
program) reasoned that the companies' unique nature distinguishes
them from traditional businesses.
</P>
<P>
   All you have to do to see that dot-commers don't work in mere
offices, said Gonzalez, is just walk through any new Internet
commerce company's space and look around.
</P>
<P>
   What Gonzalez then described _ partitioned cubicles instead of
rows of desks, common conference areas instead of walled-off
meeting rooms, lots of open, common space and computers _ sounded
exactly like thousands of other regular old offices in this town.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Welch (as usual) had come armed with the letter of
the law. He read the official, legal definition of ``office space''
from the City Planning Code, or Master Plan. To wit:
</P>
<P>
   ```Office space' shall mean space within a structure intended or
primarily suitable for occupancy by persons or entities which
perform for their own benefit, or provide to others, services at
that location, including, but not limited to, professional,
banking, insurance, management, consulting, technical, sales and
design, or the office function of manufacturing and warehousing
businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, with Proposition M, the voters of San Francisco chose
to limit development of the above-described space to 950,000 square
feet each year.
</P>
<P>
   Until the voters choose to repeal that law, everybody who works
in any room, complex, suite or converted barn that matches the
definition should have to obey the law. No matter how much revenue
nor how many jobs they supposedly generate.
</P>
<P>
   Now, can we get on with the legitimate issues around dot-com
development and see if we can mitigate this mess before the whole
city's wrecked and we're all irrevocably at each other's throats?
</P>

   SAN FRANCISCO _ The liberal argument that bias is senseless
because we're all the same under the skin always struck me as a
weak rebuttal to the Klansmen and Nazis of the world, who thrive on
our manifest differences.
</P>
<P>
   But it turns out the liberals weren't lily-livered apologists
for racial and ethnic peculiarities after all. They were correct.
Genetically, we are the same under the skin _ so much so,
scientists now tell us, that a concept as fundamental as ``race''
may be meaningless. The bushman in the Kalahari Desert of Namibia,
in other words, is the brother of the white Anglo-Saxon Protestant.
</P>
<P>
   Don't believe it? Well, the fact is many experts think we're all
descended from a few small bands of Homo sapiens who first arose in
Africa about 100,000 years ago and began to go exploring, in groups
of up to 100 individuals, some 50 millennia later. These people
looked just like us because they are us.
</P>
<P>
   The chief proponent of this theory is Stanford University
population geneticist Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, whose name is
almost as big as his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   A near-octogenarian who divides his time between Palo Alto,
Calif., and Milan, Italy, Cavalli-Sforza is the author of the newly
published ``Genes, People, and Languages'' (North Point
Press/Farrar, Straus and Giroux).
</P>
<P>
   The book is a succinct recapitulation of a controversial theory
he has been propounding for half a century, most of it spent at a
Stanford lab where his staff has been looking at DNA samples from
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   According to Cavalli-Sforza, there are indeed molecular
differences, but they are few and far between and often due to what
are known as ``founder effects.''
</P>
<P>
   The frequency of the gene that predisposes some Ashkenazi Jewish
women to breast cancer, for example, results from a natural
reduction in the original population _ due to famine? flood?
disease? _ that accidentally spared women with the bad gene,
creating a kind of bottleneck. The remaining population was the
only genetic game in town.
</P>
<P>
   But once you get back out to the surface of the organism, you
find that differences (skin color, size and the like) are only
adaptations to the local material conditions of our existence and
to accidents of geographic and climatological history.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is because they are external that these racial differences
strike us so forcibly,'' Cavalli-Sforza has written, ``and we
automatically assume that differences of similar magnitude exist
below the surface, in the rest of our genetic makeup. This is
simply not so: the remainder of our genetic makeup hardly differs
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from his home in Milan last week,
Cavalli-Sforza expanded on this, drawing from his own experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I settled in the States when I was 49 years old and I now have
great problems recognizing Italian-Americans,'' he said.
``Sometimes I can recognize one for some superficial behavior, but
it is extremely rare. There are differences of social origin, but
in the long run, they disappear.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, Cavalli-Sforza added, they should, for the sake
of the broader community.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there are differences in ethical beliefs that can be
dangerous,'' he said. ``For example, in the Sicilian code of honor,
you have almost a duty to kill your wife if she is unfaithful, and
until not long ago, the Italian legal code treated a crime of
murder for reasons of `honor' very leniently.''
</P>
<P>
   Cavalli-Sforza's dismissal or minimalization of things such as
skin color and social custom as truly distinguishing
characteristics surely will come as a disappointment to people like
Joerg Haider, the Austrian anti-immigrant politician.
</P>
<P>
   However, it should make every man, woman and child who has ever
faced discrimination feel as good as anyone else on the face of the
Earth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Luca's position is that there really are no such things as
races, just racism,'' said his top assistant, molecular biologist
Peter Underhill. ``These people in the Balkans, the Kosovars and
the Serbs, are killing each other like crazy, because they have
different religions and cultural practices and suspicions, but they
are very closely related genetically.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of the family of man is validated more and more by
genetic research. Some people find this offensive. You might find
some neo-Nazi idiot up in Idaho and if I did a genetic profile of
him, I might find that he has a lot of Ashkenazi Jewish genes.''
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to me that all this science has to cast doubt on the
value of diversity programs in the workplace, in education and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   We make a very big deal about diversity today. Certainly,
celebrating the cultural diversity of differing racial and ethnic
groups seems like a good idea, in so far as it teaches us to be
tolerant.
</P>
<P>
   But I wonder if tolerance always is the byproduct. Diversity
programs also inevitably draw attention to our significant
differences, and in that sense they may be counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe we're better off with the old family-of-man concept.
</P>
<P>
   Underhill says: ``One of the strengths of our country is
diversity, but it creates tensions, because people aren't familiar
with each other, they look different, they have different languages
and customs. There's this dynamic that goes back a long way. But it
has nothing to do with genetics.''

TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN ZIMBABWE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two wrongs still add up to two wrongs, even if the second wrong
is a delayed response to the first.
</P>
<P>
   That unassailable axiom of morality and law applies to the
social and political tragedy now being played out in Zimbabwe. From
a historical perspective, one can find a high degree of
justification for some squatters' occupation of about 1,000 of the
country's large white-owned farms and ranches. They have
long-standing ancestral claims to the land that was stolen from
their forebears by the British colonials.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the squatters' efforts to occupy those farms
cannot be uncoupled, morally or legally, from the violence that has
been perpetrated by some of them against the white landowners and
their black farm workers.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago this month, Southern Rhodesia ceased to be and
a new country called the Republic of Zimbabwe officially took its
place on the political map of southern Africa. That transformation
brought with it some dramatic change.
</P>
<P>
   Political control shifted to the black majority. Justice was
rendered almost color-blind. Educational, employment and business
opportunities were expanded for black citizens. But ownership of
the land did not change significantly, although land reform was one
of the primary objectives of the guerrilla movement that toppled
the white supremacist Ian Smith government.
</P>
<P>
   Now, two decades after that transformation, 4,500 white farmers
own most of the country's best agricultural land, while the
majority of black farmers struggle to scratch out a living from
minuscule plots of inferior soil.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't supposed to go down that way. Part of the deal that
ended the country's war of independence was a commitment by Britain
and the United States to provide Zimbabwe with $2 billion for land
reform. That didn't happen. Not even close.
</P>
<P>
   And although Britain admits that over the years it has sent
Zimbabwe only a fraction of that amount, it accuses the government
of President Robert Mugabe of having mismanaged the land reform
assistance that it did provide.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the British are now willing to talk with the
Mugabe government about fulfilling its pledge to provide the
resources to buy the land from the large landowners instead of
confiscating it.
</P>
<P>
   The takeovers, of course, are not technically acts of the Mugabe
government. Supposedly they are grassroots actions being taken by
veterans of the war for independence. But the government clearly is
encouraging them and looking the other way while they happen.
</P>
<P>
   That's immoral and blatantly political. Mugabe, who has been in
power since 1980, faces his first real political test. Although he
is not running for re-election, Mugabe's party (the Zimbabwe
African National Union _ Patriotic Front) faces a stiff challenge
from the Movement for Democratic Change in the parliamentary
elections next month.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe obviously is stoking the coals of the long-simmering land
redistribution issue to distract the voters from other sources of
dissatisfaction with his government. Unemployment in the country
has reached 50 percent; inflation has risen to 70 percent. Fuel
supplies are perilously low, and AIDS has reached epidemic
proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Mugabe would not have the land redistribution
issue to exploit if the Western powers had kept their word and
provided Zimbabwe with the promised wherewithal to buy a
substantial part of the country's most arable land from the white
plantation owners and distribute it to the poor black peasants.
</P>
<P>
   Britain says it stands ready to help on condition that the
violence that has taken the lives of two white farmers and two
members of the Movement of Democratic Change ends.
</P>
<P>
   Although Britain's re-committing to provide land reform funds is
the right thing do, it could have troublesome repercussions. Other
former colonies of Britain and other European powers in Africa and
other parts of the world have similar post-independence carryover
grievances against their former colonial masters.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's squatting, therefore, could become contagious.
Although Mugabe's land redistribution extortion obviously is wrong,
land-poor peasants and political leaders may only care that it
appears to have worked.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In this city of monuments in which I live there is
only one monument that is not a monument to glory. It is the
Vietnam Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Until that war, which ended 25 years ago today as the last
American helicopter lifted off from the US embassy and the tanks of
the North Vietnamese Army thrust into Saigon, all American wars had
been good wars. They had been crusades, morally unifying
experiences, beginning with the revolution to free the Thirteen
Colonies from English tyranny and found the nation.
</P>
<P>
   There had been deviations, of course. The war with Mexico in the
1840s had been a war of conquest and we had fought another war of
conquest in the Philippines, our first imperial possession in Asia,
at the turn of the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   But these had been pushed out of the American historical memory.
Our monuments had always reflected the good American wars _ a
Grecian temple of worship to Lincoln, the godlike President who had
kept the nation one through the agony of the Civil War; the Marines
raising the Stars and Stripes over Mt. Suribachi on Iwo Jima in the
ulimate of good American wars, World War II, when our cause had
been the cause of humanity and we had crushed the most hideous of
enemies, Hitler's Germany and Imperial Japan.
</P>
<P>
   We had gone off to Vietnam in the halo of that triumph. The
result had been the longest war in our history, the most divisive
since the Civil War, and to commemorate it, this funereal monument
of defeat and mourning was erected.
</P>
<P>
   It is a wall of polished black granite inscribed with 58,219
names of the dead. The wall descends into the earth in a great V
like a mass grave, the panels growing larger as one walks down into
the grave, from a few names on the small panels at the ends of the
V to the thousands that fill the big panels that rise above one's
head at the V's sunken vortex.
</P>
<P>
   Yet defeat can be as precious as victory if we learn from it, if
we face the bitter but necessary truths that must be faced to
redeem the lives of the 58,219 men. And the most important of those
truths is that we were fortunate to lose the war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The catastrophe could have been worse. The same kind of mindset
that sent the youth of Europe by the millions into the barbed wire
and machine guns of World War I sent our infantrymen into the
mantrap bunker complexes that the Vietnamese constructed under the
canopy of their rain forests to kill our soldiers and wear us down.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders we had acquired by the 1960s were men who had lost
the capacity to grasp reality, men overcome by hubris as they
contemplated their power. And we the citizenry, inebriated from the
same cup, had followed them. In the spirit of John Kennedy's
grandiose inaugural address, we saw ourselves as the new Romans
holding back the barbarians at the frontiers of our beneficent
empire.
</P>
<P>
   Ho Chi Minh and his followers were pawns of the Soviets and the
Chinese, ``the Sino-Soviet bloc,'' as the Army security-clearance
forms termed them. And if we did not stop them in South Vietnam,
the dominoes of Southeast Asia would topple one by one and
Communist-inspired guerrilla wars would sweep the whole of the
underdeveloped world until we were battling in Central America.
</P>
<P>
   It was all delusions. The Vietnamese were no one's pawns and
they never threatened us. They simply wanted us to go home and
leave them alone. Ho Chi Minh had become a Communist as an accident
of French domestic politics. Only the far left in France had
favored independence for the colonies when Ho had gone there as a
youth during World War I to seek help to free his country from
French colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   The motivating force within him and those who became his
disciples had always been nationalism. The Vietnamese are a people
who will not tolerate foreign domination. They demonstrated that
spirit by their willingness to resist us as long as it took, and to
pay whatever price was required in blood to achieve the unification
and independence of their land. In our delusions, we made them pay.
By the end of the war we had killed a million and a half of those
Vietnamese who fought us in the cause of their nation.
</P>
<P>
   Our folly was not limited to the devastation of Vietnam and the
neighboring lands of Cambodia and Laos. At home we were undermining
our most precious possession _ our constitutional republic with its
rights and liberties embodied in law.
</P>
<P>
   The system of checks and balances between the Executive,
Legislative, and Judiciary branches which the Founding Fathers had
crafted to perpetuate this ideal of republican government had been
profoundly unbalanced. The power of the Presidency and the
executive branch that had grown up under it since World War II
outweighed that of the other two branches to the point of becoming
monarchal.
</P>
<P>
   The Watergate affair _ when Richard Nixon and his henchmen
attempted to rig a national election by burglarizing and bugging
the headquarters of the opposition party, freely wiretapped anyone
else they perceived as an enemy, and then paid out hundreds of
thousands of dollars in hush money to obstruct justice _ was a
harbinger of the loss of our rights and liberties under an
authoritarian state if the power of the Presidency had not later
been humbled by defeat in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   We have emerged a skeptical people who have learned the price of
vowing to ``pay any price, bear any burden,'' as JFK had summoned
us to do, in what he mistakenly imagined to be a call to greatness.
We no longer march off as automatons to war. We are selective in
our interventions, more realistic about our role in the world
because we sense our limitations.
</P>
<P>
   From the bestarred circle of the Joint Chiefs to the hardhats on
a construction site, we now want to know whether the venture is
necessary, feasible, what it will cost in treasure and in blood,
whether there will be an end to it. Sometimes we are too timid, as
we were in Bosnia and at the outset in Kosovo, when we might have
saved so many lives by a willingness to intervene on the ground.
But timidity in accepting casualties is understandable after 58,219
lives have been wasted.
</P>
<P>
   Some would say we have become a cynical people, but I do not
believe that. We have merely learned that doubt can lead to less
harm than credulity.
</P>
<P>
   The worst folly now would be to forget, but the Wall helps us to
remember. It is a holy place. Children grow quiet there as they
sense its reverence. To reach up and touch a name is to see again
the man you knew when you and he were young. And in their
thousands, these names cry out for remembrance. The war in Vietnam
must remain an adamant memory for us. We must never again send
American soldiers abroad to die foolishly, and we must never again
play God with another people who mean us no harm.
</P>
<P>
   To remember Vietnam is to understand that we Americans are not
the exceptions to history we once thought we were, rather that we
share a fallible humanity with the rest of humankind. To remember
Vietnam is to see our all-too-human capacity to do evil as easily
as we can do good.

International and the New York Times in the 1960s, and he obtained
the Pentagon Papers for the Times in 1971. His 1988 book, ``A
Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam,'' won a
Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award. He's currently writing a
book about the arms race and the Cold War.

   (itals)We were the children of the 1950s and John F. Kennedy's
young stalwarts of the early 1960s. He told the world that
Americans would ``pay any price, bear any burden, meet any
hardship'' in the defense of freedom. We were the down payment on
that costly contract, but the man who signed it was not there when
we fulfilled his promise. John F. Kennedy waited for us on a hill
in Arlington National Cemetery, and in time we came by the
thousands to fill those slopes with our white marble markers and to
ask on the murmur of the wind if that was truly the future he had
envisioned for us.(unitals) &QL;

   For those of us who lived through it, it seems scarcely credible
that the Vietnam War ended 25 years ago today, when North
Vietnamese tanks crashed through the presidential palace gates in
Saigon. The memories of those tumultuous times seem as vivid as if
they happened yesterday. For those of us too young to remember,
however _ more than a third of all Americans _ Vietnam may seem as
long ago as the Spanish-American War.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Vietnam seems not ever really to go away. In the 1980s Henry
Kissinger said that Vietnam had ``created doubts about American
judgment, about American credibility, about American power _ not
only at home, but throughout the world. It has poisoned our
domestic debate. So we paid an exorbitant price for the decisions
that were made in good faith and for good purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   George Bush thought he had banished the ``Vietnam syndrome''
after his remarkable Gulf War victory. But Vietnam crept back and
remains deep in the American psyche. More than 700 novels about
Vietnam have been published, and the Library of Congress lists
12,000 nonfiction titles, many of them by authors trying to rid
themselves of ghosts.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was the most divisive American war of this century,
setting sons against fathers and the governed against those who
governed. It scarred the American military, which vowed never again
to get in a war for ambiguous political ends, that could cost
casualties without American support, and that could not be won
quickly with overwhelming superior force.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam stayed the hand of a generation of American politicians
who might otherwise have committed American troops to battle more
quickly. For better or worse, Vietnam probably kept American
soldiers out of Central America in the '80s and kept American
soldiers out of Bosnia long after our European allies had committed
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam radicalized many who, for the first time, saw their
country not as a benevolent power, but as a country doing harm in
the world. For others the sight of fellow Americans burning the
flag in the street or waving Viet Cong flags in protest against the
war was a sickening and unpatriotic event.
</P>
<P>
   And Vietnam gave birth to an unprecedented determination of
families whose missing sons and husbands have never been accounted
for to achieve an accounting. It was the administration of Governor
Michael Dukakis that caused the black flag of the Prisoner of
War/Missing in Action movement to fly over every Massachusetts
municipality.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was also our longest war. The United States made the
decision soon after World War II to back the French against Ho Chi
Minh and the nationalist/communist cause. Ho had hoped America
might oppose the return of the French, but the United States needed
France as the Cold War developed in Europe, and Mao Tse Tung's
victory in China's civil war brought communism to Indochina's
borders in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   The next year the Korean War was on, and America's leaders
perceived that international communism was on the march everywhere.
In the end America ended up spending more money supporting the
French military effort in Indochina than it spent on Marshall Plan
aid to France itself.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that, given Vietnam's history of China's 1,000-year
occupation, Ho Chi Minh's army might well have been a bulwark
against the spread of China's influence in Southeast Asia. In 1979,
30 years after Mao's victory in China and scant weeks after Vietnam
invaded Cambodia to oust the Khmer Rouge, Vietnam and China were at
war with each other on their frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after the demise of the Soviet Union, it is hard to
remember now what a threat the Cold War posed. But it was very real
from the late '40s to the early '60s, when President Kennedy made
his ringing commitment to freedom and liberty worldwide. Americans
saw themselves as leaders of the free world, even if some of our
anticommunist allies were not entirely free.
</P>
<P>
   America's involvement in Vietnam also had to do with what
Harvard's Daniel Bell once called ``American exceptionalism'': the
long-held belief that Americans were a special people with a higher
destiny, with a mission to proselytize and to spread enlightenment
and democracy in a darkening world. We were, in a sense, inheritors
of a Western expansionist tradition that drove crusaders to
liberate Jerusalem from the infidels and mariners into the dark
oceans never before sailed and colonists into continents not our
own. That tradition was not all based on greed, power, and gold. It
was accompanied by a belief in a missionary purpose, at first
religious and then secular, and it was not all hypocrisy. The
French in Indochina called it their ``mission civilisatrice.''
Americans called it nation-building and spreading democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after the Vietnam War was over, Robert McNamara,
one of the chief architects of American involvement, wrote: ``We of
the Kennedy and Johnson administrations who participated in the
decision on Vietnam acted according to what we thought were the
principles and traditions of this nation. We made our decisions in
light of those values. Yet we were wrong, terribly wrong. We owe it
to future generations to explain why.''
</P>
<P>
   McNamara blamed it on American ignorance about Vietnam, but it
was more hubris than ignorance. Many people who read his book
thought: ``Now he tells us!''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, 25 years on, it becomes clearer that the United States
sought no commercial advantage in defending Vietnam. The motives of
presidents Truman, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, and Ford _
all of whom were involved in the Indochina tragedy _ were not
greed. They believed that American values were being challenged and
that they had a duty to protect them around the world.
</P>
<P>
   And despite Vietnam, that belief still lives; more temperate,
less ambitious than before, at times a little arrogant, perhaps,
but less likely to do harm as it did in Vietnam and with the
potential of doing great good. It is American ``soft power,'' a
term coined by Harvard's Joseph Nye, that is in the forefront of
American exceptionalism today: Its educational system, its
entrepreneurial drive, and its democratic values are making an
impression on the world, in the place of brute force.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, therefore, let us remember those who lie under
their marble markers in Arlington Cemetery as men who did not shirk
their duty and did all they could for their country. They whose
names are inscribed on that black wall across the river from
Arlington, could they but speak, would direct us, the living, to
fulfill another presidential promise written on the Lincoln
Memorial just a short distance away:
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not
have died in vain, that this nation under God shall have a new
birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people,
and for the people shall not perish from the earth.''

<P>
   This is the reward you get for sitting through 30 weeks of
reruns repackaged as ``encore presentations.''
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time the networks truck out their best movies and
miniseries, and the sitcoms and dramas wrap up their seasons with
weddings and deaths and guest stars _ not to mention more than a
few pink slips as the dead meat limp off to the butcher.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the May sweeps (Through May 24), when the best
programs are clumped together like a tightly packed snowball. Like
November and February, it's a time when viewership is closely
gauged so advertising rates can be set for local affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Despite, or rather because of, all the specials and special
episodes and finales, the May sweeps are frustrating. Not only does
this time of year leave us trying to figure out how to tape two
shows and watch a third all at once, but it's a stark reminder of
how we've been force-fed weeks upon weeks of reruns.
</P>
<P>
   Just look at Sunday night, for example: ABC is offering
``Arabian Nights,'' as NBC counters with its own miniseries, ``The
'70s,'' and Fox features a unique episode of ``The X-Files.'' (CBS
serves ``Take Me Home: The John Denver Story,'' but it's not very
good and blows my argument, so let's ignore it.) On most nights you
could comfortably watch any of these three and be happy; sweeps
forces you to make a choice. (Our choice in a runaway: ``Arabian
Nights.'')
</P>
<P>
   But don't blame the networks for the sweeps: These seasonal
surveys are for the sole benefit of the local affiliates (national
ratings are compiled throughout the year). To be sure, it's a
stupid system, one that forces the networks to keep running repeats
of many shows for extended periods to ensure enough new material is
saved up for the ratings periods.
</P>
<P>
   Here are just some of the highlights the networks will air in
the coming weeks before reverting to the rerun rut:
</P>
<P>
   In a twist for Fox this year, the network says goodbye to a pair
of shows that actually lasted more than a couple of episodes.
``Party of Five'' departs for good on Wednesday, while ``Beverly
Hills, 90210'' ends its run on May 17 with a two-hour finale
featuring many former cast members.
</P>
<P>
   Julianna Marguilies, whose Nurse Hathaway almost died in the
first episode of ``ER,'' departs the medical drama on May 11.
Michael J. Fox leaves ``Spin City'' on ABC on May 24. And Andrea
Thompson's Jill Kirkendall leaves ``NYPD Blue'' on May 23.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``Boy Meets World'' is another show going off the air, and
certainly others will follow when the networks announce their fall
schedules next month.
</P>
<P>
   After NBC's lackluster ``Mary, Mother of Jesus,'' CBS takes a
stab at the divine with ``Jesus'' on May 14 and 17. CBS will tackle
a more worldly subject Sunday in ``Take Me Home: The John Denver
Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping with that Me Generation theme is ``The '70s,'' an NBC
miniseries (Sunday and Monday) founded in the spirit of last year's
miniseries ``The '60s.'' Look for ``The '80s,'' ``The '90s'' and
``The Decade Yet to Be Named'' to go into production in the months
to come.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of Robert Halmi productions are slated: ``Arabian
Nights'' (Sunday and Monday) and the NBC ``Jason and the
Argonauts'' (May 7-8). Also on May 7, Drew Carey will star in the
ABC ``Wonderful World of Disney'' movie ``Gepetto,'' a different
take on the Pinocchio tale.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are those battling Bradys. NBC presents ``Growing
Up Brady'' (May 21), based on the book by Barry Williams, a k a
Greg. Fox has an hourlong behind-the-scenes ``Brady Bunch'' movie
slated for May 16, the same night it has scheduled an hourlong
behind-the-scenes ``Diff'rent Strokes'' movie. As of last week,
that movie had yet to go into production, a Fox spokeswoman said:
Hmmm _ sounds like a real winner.
</P>
<P>
   And we know you've been waiting for this: CBS has a ``Dukes of
Hazzard'' reunion slated for May 19.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Willis will guest-star for three episodes on ``Friends,''
which will also see the return of Tom Selleck. This Sunday on ``The
X-Files,'' Garry Shandling and Tea Leoni (real-life wife of David
Duchovny) star in a movie based on Mulder and Scully.
</P>
<P>
   And as if it needs help, ``Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' will
feature celebrities Monday through Wednesday playing for charity.
</P>
<P>
   Enjoy it while you can: Months of reruns are only weeks away.

SITUATIONAL ETHICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 30)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX

<P>
   Today I carry 165 pounds on my 5-foot-9-inch frame. But 30 years
ago, I starved myself down to a cadaverous 106 pounds (from an
already skinny 125) because of the Vietnam War. Some readers of a
certain age will immediately guess why. They will also understand
that this episode is not my proudest moment.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't start out to be a draft dodger. The draft hung out
there in the haze of my postgraduate school future, but I took no
steps to avoid it. No conscience-searching interviews with a
sympathetic pastor to build a credible record as a conscientious
objector; that would be dishonest, I thought, even though I
couldn't imagine actually killing someone. No visits to draft
counselors who knew how to trump up a medical disqualification. No
thought about fleeing into northern exile, even after I drew the
clinchingly low number of 66 in the draft lottery. I just drifted
toward the inevitable, assuming I'd endure my destiny.
</P>
<P>
   I was against the war, but I never thought I'd end up in Vietnam
anyway. Someone said _ I clung to the rumor as a certainty _ that
draftees who had master's degrees in journalism did their time in
Kansas City writing hometown press releases. Getting into a nasty
struggle with my draft board did not figure into my imagined
scenario. But that's what happened.
</P>
<P>
   The story began in the bleak midwinter of 1969. I was at
Columbia University working toward that long-planned master's when
the dreaded notice arrived from Selective Service (a misnomer if
there ever was one). I was thereby directed to present myself at
0700 sharp on February something-or-other in southern Manhattan to
undergo a preinduction physical.
</P>
<P>
   On the appointed morning, I was sick. I mean truly, feverishly,
diarrhea-and-vomiting sick. I called the Manhattan Selective
Service number and explained. No problem, the woman on the other
end of the line said, she'd notify my draft board and reschedule
me. As I sank bank into my sickbed, I did not think to write down
her name.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, and inevitably, the draft board back in southern
Illinois didn't get the word. Some weeks later the board dispatched
a terse ``Dear Registrant'' letter. Since I had failed to report as
ordered on February whatever for my physical, I was thereby
declared delinquent, my student deferment was revoked. They could
now swoop into my life and send me off to 'Nam at any moment, where
my records would be stamped with a big red `DELINQUENT' so all my
superior officers would know at a glance I was an (unsuccessful)
draft dodger.
</P>
<P>
   Panic? Outrage? Despair? You have no idea. But as a
college-educated son of the '60s, I was wise to things like legal
process. Every draft board, it turned out, had an attorney
appointed to look after the rights of registrants. My draft board's
lawyer was a decent guy, and he instructed me on how to appeal the
``delinquent'' status. All I was looking for at that point was to
be inducted in the normal course, without that scarlet ``D'' on my
record.
</P>
<P>
   But my life didn't stop pending a Selective Service appeal.
Graduation approached. To my astonishment, The Boston Globe, where
I had interned the previous summer, asked if I wanted to be a
medical writer. My iffy draft status was no obstacle, they said. So
my cats and I moved into a $200-a-month basement apartment on
Beacon Hill, and within two weeks I knew that writing about
medicine and health care in Boston was, for me, journalistic
nirvana.
</P>
<P>
   My boxes weren't even unpacked before I was summoned back to
Illinois, clean-shaven and shorn, for my appeals hearing. It did
not go well. Outrageously and illegally, the board barred its own
attorney from the proceedings. I recall five beefy guys shouting
things like ``Why did you go to Columbia anyway?'' It probably
didn't help that the local newspaper, of which my dad was
publisher, had been running articles about the draft board's
roughshod handling of (other) registrants. Appeal denied. ``You're
going in the Army tomorrow, boy,'' one of the board members
actually said. I slunk back to my father's office and called Ian
Menzies, then the Globe's managing editor, to explain they wouldn't
even let me go back and collect my cats. ``That doesn't sound
right,'' Menzies said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later I had a call from the draft board's attorney.
The board had heard from the state Selective Service office in
Springfield, which had received a call from The Globe's Boston law
firm. Decision reversed. I was no longer ``delinquent'' and I'd be
afforded the privilege of a preinduction physical.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the pivot point of this confession. Back in Boston, I
contemplated my undeserved luck and became . . . well, radicalized
is too strong a word, but angry _ the anger of a naive liberal who
believes that if you play by the rules you'll be treated fairly. I
determined to beat the system. And not just out of anger; by now I
had a good, solid reason. I wanted to remain a medical writer, and
while The Globe would have to hire me back after my stint in the
Army, I couldn't count on them holding open that particular job.
</P>
<P>
   Consultation with a Quaker draft counselor in Cambridge revealed
few options. One, to be precise, but it was surefire. You could not
be drafted if you weighed more than a certain amount for your
height, or less than a certain poundage. More was out of the
question for my ectomorphic frame, but I thought I could do less.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing what one can do with motivation, but I can tell
you: 500 calories a day is truly punishing. To stave off the hunger
pangs, I got hold of some dextroamphetamine diet pills, otherwise
known as ``speed.'' Even though I broke the pills in half to make
them last longer, my bodily functions were still dramatically
speeded up. Colleagues used to gather around to watch me type.
Hunger was vanquished, though, and there was a silver lining: my
sphincter muscles were so clenched I developed hemorrhoids. Duly
documented, of course.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of friends and colleagues in thoroughly antiwar
Boston, I maintained the dietary discipline. By the time I got my
induction physical notice I had met the goal and then some. So
absorbed was I in the task that the ethics of my choice didn't hit
me fully until I boarded a chartered bus in Uphams Corner early one
drizzly morning to be ferried over to the South Boston induction
center. In the next seat was a kid from Dorchester with an asthma
inhaler in his hand. Armed as I was with doctors' letters
documenting my hemorrhoids and a benign bone tumor _ just in case
the Army's scales were way out of whack _ I asked my seatmate if he
had any doctors' letters of his own to attest to the asthma. He
didn't.
</P>
<P>
   I've thought about that kid often over the last 30 years, and
about the utter unfairness of my good luck, connections, and
knowledge of how to play the game. And so, a quarter-century after
the bitter conclusion of that war _ and of a formative era that
taught situational ethics to me and so many of my contemporaries,
including First Draft Dodger Bill Clinton _ I ask that Dorchester
boy's forgiveness here and now.
</P>
<P>
   I just hope to God he's still alive.

PAYING ANY PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 30)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT TIMBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I graduated from the US Naval Academy in June 1964. At the time,
the war in Vietnam seemed far away, a brush fire smoldering on the
horizon. In August, two months later, the Tonkin Gulf incidents
triggered an American military response. By then, I was going
through Marine Officers Basic School in Quantico, Va. The war
suddenly seemed a lot closer.
</P>
<P>
   My battalion mounted out from Long Beach, Calif., in February
1966, beginning a journey that would deposit us in the coastal
lowlands of South Vietnam a few weeks later. Did I think about not
boarding that ship? No. Not once. I was a child of World War II. I
came of age in the 1950s. In 1961, a plebe at Annapolis, I marched
in John Kennedy's inaugural parade. On that day the new president
proclaimed that Americans were willing to pay any price, bear any
burden, meet any hardship to advance the cause of freedom in the
world. I believed him. We were both wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In February 1967, two weeks before I was to rotate home, I was
wounded in a way that resulted in severe facial scarring. I spent
the better part of the next year and a half in the hospital, a dark
time.
</P>
<P>
   The country had changed dramatically while I was gone. The
antiwar movement, little more than a curiosity when I left, had
taken root. Its members had become the heroes of the mass media.
Beneath their bluster and self-absorption, they raised troubling
questions about the war that our leaders seemed at a loss to
answer.
</P>
<P>
   With survivor's instinct, I dropped out of the debate and made a
decision. I told myself that whatever life had in store for me,
good or bad, I was going to fulfill it, Vietnam or no Vietnam. I
sought to neutralize the war's impact on my life by ignoring it,
moving it off to the side, letting it scab over.
</P>
<P>
   My game plan, such as it was, worked. I became a newspaperman, a
profession I found pretty much by throwing a dart. In those days,
it didn't really matter what I did, as long as I did something.
</P>
<P>
   The years passed. By the early 1980s, I was the White House
correspondent for the Baltimore Sun. Few of my colleagues had been
to Vietnam. One who had, Walter Robinson of the Boston Globe,
mentioned to me one day, as if he had surprised himself by
noticing, that there were only a handful of Vietnam veterans among
the scores of journalists in Washington. We exchanged a look that
said _ though the phrase had not yet come into vogue _ ``don't go
there.''
</P>
<P>
   In November 1986, the Iran-Contra scandal erupted. At its heart
were three Annapolis men: Oliver North, Robert McFarlane, and John
Poindexter. I smelled Vietnam right from the start, wondered if the
burgeoning scandal might be in part the bill for the war finally
coming due. I thought about writing a book on Iran-Contra, but
quickly realized that I was less interested in the scandal itself
than in what it might say about my generation of well-meaning, if
ill-starred, warriors. On that score, the Iran-Contra crew only
took me so far. I expanded the book to include two other Annapolis
graduates: John McCain, senator and POW, and James Webb, decorated
Marine, Secretary of the Navy, and critically acclaimed novelist.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 1995 book, ``The Nightingale's Song,'' in which
I chronicled the lives of all five men in order to illuminate the
generational divide that I discerned between those who served in
Vietnam and those who used money, wit, and connections to avoid
serving. I don't think of the book as cathartic, but I now realize
that it allowed me to say things I had long submerged.
</P>
<P>
   For me, the crucial issue in the Vietnam era is how you answered
the summons, how you responded to the call to arms.
</P>
<P>
   If you believed the war made sense, you had an obligation, I
think, to serve. That means you didn't play the deferment game, or
get married, or have a baby so you didn't have to go.
</P>
<P>
   If you felt the war was a mistake, and I think that was a
legitimate political position, I think you had to keep faith with
your generation by opposing the war in a manner in which you put
yourself in peril, peril that in some way mirrored what others were
experiencing in Southeast Asia. That means walking into your draft
board, saying ``I'm 1-A and I'm not going to go.''
</P>
<P>
   If enough young men had done that, especially the white middle
class kids that were the center of gravity for the antiwar
movement, I believe the machinery of the Selective Service System
would have ground to a halt, the war would have ended, and a lot of
blood would never have been spilled. As it was, most men used a
vast smorgasbord of deferments to beat the system and avoid or
evade the draft.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, it wasn't the war that was the problem. Vietnam
was hell, but so are all wars. The problem was the homecoming. I
think this generational fault line emerged when men and women came
home from Vietnam. Many had seen friends and comrades die. Others
came home maimed themselves. And yet, when they got back to the
States, they were condemned by some as baby-killers. Others were
spit on. It was as if they had barely dragged themselves out of the
primordial sludge.
</P>
<P>
   Across this generational divide, meanwhile, they saw their
unbloodied contemporaries flourishing. Not only was there no stigma
attached to what used to be called draft-dodging, the other half of
this generation wore its antiwar credentials like combat
decorations.
</P>
<P>
   That was what turned Vietnam into what has been called an
indigestible lump. It was as if a social contract had been broken,
as if we had gone to bed one night and awakened to find the world
had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Milt Copulos, a Vietnam veteran, put it this way: ``There's a
wall 10 miles high and 50 miles thick between those of us who went
and those who didn't, and that wall is never going to come down.
</P>
<P>
   That seems too strong to me, but who knows? Since the dedication
of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in 1982 there has been a lot of
talk about reconciliation, an amorphous phrase that means, I
suppose, that both sides say everything's forgiven. I'm not angry
at anyone, but on this point I'm with Jim Webb. He says he doesn't
want to be reconciled, and neither do I.

   BOSTON _ Joe Zinck grew up on a Dorchester street corner,
graduated from English High and went to war in Vietnam in 1968 the
way a lot of guys did: without much forethought, without making a
big deal of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was what you did,'' says Zinck, who lived through the epic
77-day North Vietnamese siege of Khe Sanh. ``It was what our
fathers did before us.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Zinck brought back memories of foxholes full of
mangled people did not stop him from marrying his sweetheart,
getting a college degree, or becoming lieutenant detective of
police in his old neighborhood. He is completing work on a master's
degree in criminal justice at Curry College.
</P>
<P>
   But Zinck, like most Vietnam vets, had to endure a period when
fellow Americans viewed him as something he was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movies made us out to be crazy, drug-crazed people without
feelings about other people, without emotions,'' Zinck said
recently while having coffee with the friends who work with him to
maintain Dorchester's Vietnam memorial. The image ``just wasn't
true. The vast majority came back and just got on with life.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they did better than that.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some Vietnam veterans still are emotionally
troubled. Some are homeless. But as a group, they are far from the
unemployables of Sylvester Stallone movies, with heads wrapped in
bandanas and minds messed up with post-combat trauma. Vietnam vets
are leaders today in many areas of society _ bank executives and
senators, car salesmen and social workers, university
administrators and small businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   But for years, ``when you picked up the paper, you didn't see
the CEO of the bank, the head of the Court Street shelter, the guys
selling cars,'' Zinck said. ``The media wanted a story, and there
wasn't a story in writing about our lives. You'd see the guy in the
cemetery shooting at the Quincy police, the guy walking down
Neponset Avenue with a bandana on his head and a bayonet in his
boot.''
</P>
<P>
   The images of confused, bitter men capable of vengeance and
cruelty were compounded by intense public opposition to the mission
they were sent to perform, and by a government that did not care
for them once their tours of duty were up. The result was a lasting
impression that Vietnam vets did not fare well after the shooting
stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably, soldiers who returned from Vietnam faced
challenges and prejudices that did not confront their predecessors.
It was difficult for some to fit back into society. They were much
younger, on average _ 19, compared with 26 in World War II _ and
were using immensely more powerful weapons. They got little help
coping, during and after service, mentally or physically. And they
paid a price.
</P>
<P>
   Studies in the 1970s showed that the suicide rate for Vietnam
vets was more than 20 percent higher than that of nonveterans of
the same age, according to Bobby Mueller, founder of Vietnam
Veterans of America. Other studies showed the vets were at a
disadvantage in education compared with their peers who got draft
deferments and were more susceptible to certain diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys came back from World War I, World War II, and
Korea and never recovered, and drank or smoked themselves into the
grave,'' says US Senator John Kerry, who was a patrol boat
commander in Vietnam and later a leader of Vietnam Veterans Against
the War. ``The reason the Vietnam veterans' suicide rate is higher
ought to be clear to everyone. They didn't go as a team, they
didn't return as a team, and they weren't rewarded when they came
back. . . . You had to sublimate the whole experience.''
</P>
<P>
   About a third of homeless people in Boston today are veterans,
and over 60 percent of them _ 1,940 in this year's count _ are
Vietnam-era vets, according to Tom Materazzo, longtime commissioner
of veterans' services in the city. But he estimates that more than
85 percent of the 3 million Vietnam veterans were reabsorbed into
mainstream America without incident.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Marsh Carter is a poster boy for those who want it
understood that Vietnam veterans have as proud a record of
post-service accomplishment as those who fought in earlier wars. A
West Point graduate, son and grandson of generals, he is chairman
and chief executive officer of State Street Corp., one of the
nation's oldest financial houses.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls with some rancor how, when he left the service as a
Marine major in 1965, he encountered the stereotype of the Vietnam
vet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote to 75 or 80 companies'' seeking a job ``and only three
even gave me interviews,'' Carter said. ``I had a wife and two
kids. I was a heavy-combat veteran, with 13 or 14 years in the
military, and people made me feel like that time was worthless.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to proven ability to lead people under the most
stressful conditions, for which he won the Navy Cross and a Purple
Heart, Carter had two master's degrees _ one in operations research
and systems analysis and one in foreign policy. But when he came
home, companies told him he did not seem to have many skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``One guy said to me, `The general view is that you did a lot of
things over there that are going to give you trouble,' '' Carter
said. ``He told me they didn't want to take the chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter still avoids doing business with some of the companies
that snubbed him back then, but like many of his comrades he is at
peace with the Vietnamese and is going back. During this month's
observances of the 25th anniversary of the end of the war, he will
be one of a delegation of American business leaders visiting the
country to consult with officials there on how to energize the
Vietnamese economy.
</P>
<P>
   They will be building on the work of other veterans, people like
Tom Vallely, who grew up in privileged circumstances in Newton, and
came home with a Silver Star on his chest and a craving for
politics _ antiwar and otherwise _ in his blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to Vietnam the first time, I came home happily,''
Vallely said. ``The second time I went to Vietnam (in 1985), I
didn't come home. . . . I became a Vietnam specialist,'' working on
educational and economic exchanges growing out of the normalization
efforts launched by senators Kerry and John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, Vallely has worked on Vietnam issues through Harvard
University's Institute for International Development. Among other
things, he has helped 300 Vietnamese obtain higher education in the
United States and 700 obtain economics training in their own
country.
</P>
<P>
   As complex as the legacy of Vietnam is for all veterans, it is
more so for black veterans.
</P>
<P>
   In the early years of the war, blacks fought and died in
disproportionate numbers. By the conflict's end, this imbalance
largely disappeared, though the heavy toll on poor and
working-class people did not. Black veterans generally recall their
war years as a time of high racial tension, while most whites say
they were unaware of any racial strains.
</P>
<P>
   Ed DeBity, associate executive director of the Veterans Benefits
Clearinghouse Inc., in Roxbury, participated in antiwar
demonstrations at Syracuse University, joined the Student
Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and was photographed picketing
draft boards. When his draft notice arrived, he initially did not
report. But the army came after him. Faced with a choice of five
years in jail and a $10,000 fine or two years in the Army, he went
to war.
</P>
<P>
   ``In those years, if a black man went to jail in America he was
never going to be acceptable when he came out, so I kind of sold
out my lofty (antiwar) ideals,'' DeBity said, in an interview in an
old building on Warren Street where he and Ralph Cooper, also a
Vietnam veteran, run the clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   When he came back to the United States, ``in 24 hours, I got a
haircut, a steak dinner, a clean uniform, and my back pay, and was
told to be off this base by midnight,'' he said. He slept that
night in the Seattle-Tacoma airport. Looking at the veterans around
him, Cooper realized he had reached a kind of equality, because the
military and Veterans Administration ``didn't pay any better
attention to the white guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Black veterans came home to communities in flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``The return was more traumatic than Vietnam,'' said Ernie
Washington, a Roxbury native who served in Carter's Marine unit.
Washington arrived at Logan International Airport on April 4, 1968
_ the day Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated. ``The cabs
wouldn't take me to Roxbury. The community was ablaze, plagued with
drugs, in a shambles.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of a generation of black men hurt the communities from
which they came, said Washington, who attended college nights and
eventually prospered running a security company and parking lot
business. ``So many men killed, so many out of whack .. . . We miss
those black males. The loss of those guys is still hurting us.
Older men who could have calmed some of the storm.''
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was a particularly transforming experience for Charles
Desmond, an aimless, mediocre student from a troubled family in
Malden who won a Silver Star and a Bronze Star for heroism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely see my life in three phases _ before I went to
Vietnam, in country, and post-Vietnam,'' said Desmond.
</P>
<P>
   On a battlefield overrun with enemy soldiers, ``I promised God
if I get out of here alive I will do something constructive with my
life,'' Desmond said.
</P>
<P>
   Returning highly motivated, he graduated from Northeastern
University with high honors, and made a career of helping young
people ``a lot like me _ poor, from broken homes, without many
people trying to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   He became vice chancellor of UMass-Boston, founder of the Urban
Scholars Program, and chairman of the William Joyner Center for the
Study of War and Social Consequences.
</P>
<P>
   The paths taken by Desmond and Vallely were not uncommon for men
returning from Vietnam, said Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The healing thing for many of us was helping others,'' he
said. ``By helping others, you wound up helping yourself.''

 TAKE-BOS  
 (For release Sunday, April 30)  
 KENT, Ohio: ... blended together.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We were effectively fighting the birthrate of Vietnam. We had
absolute military superiority. We could win any set-piece battle,
but they had absolute political superiority: they would always keep
recruiting and coming. They did not have to win the war to triumph,
they had only not to lose it. Sooner or later we would tire and go
home.
</P>
<P>
   The antiwar movement was seen by so many as a sign of American
weakness, of citizens who shirked their responsibilities and were
less patriotic than their forebears. Former Ohio Governor Jim
Rhodes, running for the Senate in the days after the Kent State
incident, referred to the antiwar protesters as worse than
vigilantes, communists, and brownshirts. But to me the movement was
a sign of strength. It was the mark of a youthful, vigorous, indeed
even passionate, democratic society reconstituting itself
politically outside the normal political channels, because the
party of normal protest on this particular issue was the party from
which the war's architects had come. Had we watched a comparable
citizen uprising elsewhere _ Russian people protesting against the
use of their forces in Afghanistan, the French population
protesting against their war in Algeria _ I am sure we would have
seen it as a sign of strength.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the war did terrible damage to those who went and did
not come back, or who came back in some way or another changed and
wounded, either physically or emotionally, and to their families _
homes that would never be the same. It did great damage to the
Vietnamese, who endured on both sides a brutal war and the heaviest
bombing in the history of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   For a time the war damaged the US economy. There was a major
inflationary cycle because Lyndon Johnson deliberately hid the real
price of the war in his budget. The concept of broad
internationalism was damaged, and there developed a parallel
wariness of getting involved anywhere else in the world, lest it be
another Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Though this is harder to prove, I suspect there was also damage
to the broader concept of public service, damage to the political
system in a variety of ways. Certainly the Republicans in general
tend to run on the concept of minimizing government, but after
Vietnam, many traditional liberals were equally wary of the role of
government. The system, after all, did not work very well during
Vietnam. The Democrats were the architects of the war, largely
because John Kennedy and Johnson feared that losing Saigon would
weaken their chances for reelection and would hand the Republicans
a golden issue: that the Democrats were once again, as had been
charged before, soft on communism.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans were not much better in terms of using the
political system to make public service seem attractive. Nixon was
elected largely because 1968 was a plebiscite against the war and
he claimed he had a plan to end it. But he had no real plan.
Rather, he exploited the existing domestic tensions to pick up
alienated blue-collar Democrats; in the end he managed to keep the
war going another six years. Peace with honor was for a long time
neither. We simply changed the color of the bodies. And finally of
course, Nixon's own callous disregard for the elemental political
rights of his fellow citizens led us into Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of the Vietnam War on the liberalism of the era was
in some ways considerable. Certainly the Great Society, which
Johnson wanted as his legacy, was stillborn: it competed against
the war from the start for financial resources and the attention
span of those who governed. Moreover, a number of the political
constituencies whose support might have been so crucial for any
success from it, had already turned against the President because
of the war.
</P>
<P>
   If there was long-standing damage done by Vietnam, that is
damage which has taken a long time to heal, I am inclined to think
it took place in two institutions critically important to this
country: the Democratic Party and the United States Army.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam was a disaster for the Army. In Korea, the saying went
among military men, we sent over a bad Army and got back a good
Army. In Vietnam, it was the exact reverse. We sent over a very
good Army and got back a bad Army. That tends to happen when the
people presiding over a foreign adventure lie and deceive from the
start, and as they significantly underestimate their opponent.
</P>
<P>
   In Vietnam it became clear to a generation of officers who went
that it could not be done as it was supposed to be done. What
happened then was not a pretty thing to watch. Some high officers
played the game and got their tickets punched. They cynically gave
both Saigon and the Pentagon what they wanted: greatly inflated
reports of victories which were probably not victories, but
reflected instead that we were caught in an endless stalemate. A
great many men who should not have been promoted were, and a lot of
men who played it straight were, for a time, punished.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the United States Army lost in Vietnam,'' noted my friend
Charles Mohr of the New York Times, one of the best reporters to
cover that war, ``was its intellectual integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   General Colin Powell, who did two tours in Vietnam, the first as
a young major, would later write quite bitterly about the corrosive
careerism of the senior officers which he and other younger
officers had too often seen at work _ the cynical reporting, the
games played by so many senior officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of my generation, the career captains, majors, and
lieutenant colonels seasoned in that war vowed that when our turn
came to call the shots, we would not acquiesce in half-hearted
warfare for half-baked reasons that the American people could not
understand or support,'' Powell wrote. ``If we could make good on
that promise to ourselves, to the civilian leadership and to the
country, then the sacrifices in Vietnam would not have been in
vain.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army that came home from that war was dispirited, its morale
was terrible, its leadership in doubt. The cleansing of the Army
during the '70s, under the leadership of a number of gifted men,
the reinstitution of old and important virtues was, I think, a
signal success. It is not surprising that Powell says in his memoir
the thing that he is proudest of is his role in bringing back and
modernizing the Army, rather than his leadership during the Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
   By chance, in the current book I am working on, I have spent a
good deal of time with recent three- and four-star generals of the
post-Vietnam era, and become a genuine fan of these men. I've often
pondered why they seem so impressive.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, I think, is in where they came from and what they've
gone through. They are almost all self-made, men of the modern
meritocracy. They are more travelled, less narrowly focused, and
more broadly educated outside the classroom than most high-level
executives in civilian positions. Most of these senior officers
went through something terrible in Vietnam, and come out of it
tempered, and stronger, with a sobered view of their own
institution and their country, and a healthy skepticism about the
arrogance of power. It is no surprise that John McCain, whose
personal story is not unlike theirs, and whose breadth of
experience also parallels theirs, was by far the most captivating
candidate of the recent primary season.
</P>
<P>
   The other institution badly damaged was the Democratic Party. At
the time of the initial troop commitments, the Democrats had been
the dominant party. Through the 1964 election, with Johnson's huge
victory over Barry Goldwater, they had won seven of nine elections.
Since then, they have won three of eight _ one because of Nixon's
crimes and the fact that Gerald Ford forgot where Poland was, and
two because of Bill Clinton's deft ability to exploit the
vulnerabilities of an increasingly divided Republican Party. By all
rights, the Republicans should be the majority party now. The
Democrats, though in power for eight years, are most definitely a
minority party.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of that can be blamed on Vietnam. More important,
perhaps, were other factors like the fragmenting of the traditional
alliance between blacks and urban blue-collar workers, the decline
of labor, the shift of affluence from the North and Northeast to
the South and Southwest, and the effect of the Voting Rights Act of
1965 on former Southern Democrats. All this has given the
Republicans a new basis for a majority.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the Democratic malaise does spring from Vietnam _
the Reagan Democrats became what they did as much because of the
war and perceived weakness on foreign policy as because of race. In
1968, a defining year, the great struggle in American politics was
over Vietnam, and it took place within the Democratic Party. It was
as if there was a giant football stadium and down on the field
there were two teams playing: one led by people like Kennedy,
McCarthy, and McGovern, the other led by people named Johnson,
Humphrey, and Jackson. In the stands cheering wildly were 60,000
people, all of them Republicans. Echoes of that campaign, and of
those divisions, still exist within the party.
</P>
<P>
   I am not sure the Democrats have entirely righted themselves and
found a new center. Some of that is from Vietnam, some of it the
result of broader changes in the society. Despite winning twice
under Clinton, the party still seems like a collection of rather
selfish one-issue groups brought together uneasily under the same
roof. And it still seems somewhat schizophrenic, in no small way
because of Vietnam, about the use of power in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, despite the size of the force we sent, very few
Americans went to Vietnam. For most of them, it was a kind of
geopolitical entertainment _ the living room war, in Michael
Arlen's apt phrase. The number of people it touched directly, in a
nation then of some 216 million, seems now almost infinitesimal.
</P>
<P>
   When I was young and in college back in the '50s, I thought the
veterans of the Great War, my father among them, were older men
from another, long-past era. Now I realize that to today's college
students, my daughter among them, those of us who went to Vietnam
and who were so young then, must seem as old as the World War I
veterans did to me.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us who went and were lucky enough to come back, went
through our own evolution _ at first anger and bitterness, even
rage. Then if we were lucky, we tried to use the experience to
strengthen ourselves. We had, whatever else, done it. We had paid a
price, and we had survived.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as Vietnam moves into the distant past, those of us who
once seemed to be in such bitter debate over the war have bonded.
We've shared part of a painful experience, with which we have
mutually struggled for a very long time, in order to get on with
the rest of our lives.
</P>
<P>

   David Halberstam was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1964 for his
reporting from Vietnam for the New York Times. He has written 16
books, including ``The Best and the Brightest'' and ``The Powers
That Be.'' His new book, about what American policy on Bosnia and
Kosovo tells us about ourselves, will be published next year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KENT, Ohio _ Kent State is a large state-supported school
located in northeast Ohio, and last month I went out for a visit,
as part of a larger program commemorating the 30th anniversary of
the terrible day in May when Ohio National Guardsmen fired on
students here.
</P>
<P>
   The university lies in a relatively conservative part of the
heartland, and even now it strikes me as being among the least
likely places to find a shrine commemorating civilian victims of a
bad war which took place some 12,000 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   What happened at Kent State on that day in 1970 still seems
inconceivable to me. First that it happened at all, second that it
happened on a campus like this _ so distanced physically and
emotionally from the center of the antiwar movement.
</P>
<P>
   It was a campus where a large number of the students were
first-generation college-educated, and therefore innately wary of
political protests. To them, the degree was the most serious
business of college, and protests were for rich kids.
</P>
<P>
   Let me set the scene: Richard Nixon, having pledged to end the
war, had just sent American troops into Cambodia, and that
incursion had triggered a rage across a large number of campuses
because of the fear that Nixon, rather than ending the war, was
expanding it. There had already been some picketing at Kent State,
a reflection of a growing edginess about what was happening in
Vietnam. Up to then, it had been a school where the peace movement
lacked the kind of deep roots it had gained earlier on more elite
campuses favored by children of the upper middle class. But in the
midst of these protests, most of which had been peaceful, there had
been some looting in the downtown area, though apparently not by
the protesters. Then things got uglier: someone burned down the
local ROTC building. The National Guard was called out at the
request of the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   On May 4, there had been more protests and the National Guard
troops _ poorly led, poorly commanded, using, it still seems
unbelievable to me, live ammunition _ had fired on the students.
The troops were scared kids themselves, many in the guard because
they did not want to go to Vietnam, firing on other scared kids who
did not want to go to Vietnam. Four students were killed. A fifth
was permanently paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   What happened that day at Kent State was important. It was what
separated the Vietnam War from so much else in the American
experience: it was us against us, or as Walt Kelly once wrote in
Pogo, ``We have met the enemy and he is us.''
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of that quote a few years ago when Robert
McNamara's book, ``In Retrospect: The Tragedy and Lessons of
Vietnam,'' came out, some 30 years after he apparently turned on
the war. I was summoned to the Charlie Rose Show to talk about the
book and the subject. McNamara's bizarre book had opened a
firestorm of protest from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly it was as if all the stitches of a wound that had never
entirely healed had been ripped out. The country was once again
very much in pain. Rose asked our panel why Vietnam still hung so
heavily over us. I said it was in some way a smaller version of the
second American Civil War, not just us against the Vietnamese, but
Americans against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   I still think that is true. It touched all kinds of fault lines
within our country, some which existed by generation, some by
region, some by class, and some by ethnicity. And of course, it
also reflected vastly conflicting visions of what we wanted our
country to be, and what we thought was the principal threat to its
greatness. Does the greatest threat to us as a free, strong, and
just society come from external enemies, or from ourselves, from
our failure to be what we're supposed to be?
</P>
<P>
   Now, 25 years after the last helicopters left the American
embassy in Saigon, it is still hard to assess the impact of the
Vietnam war on the United States. The Cold War is over. The only
dominoes that fell _ to the degree that there ever were dominoes _
did so not in Southeast Asia but in Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As the Vietnam war ended, I came to think of it as an
aberration, a bitter one to be sure, one to which we had diverted
valuable lives and resources in a hopeless cause, but an aberration
nonetheless. It represented a terrible misreading of history, first
of the impact and political viability of McCarthyism post-McCarthy,
and second, over there, of the probable impact of the French
Indochina war.
</P>
<P>
   By the first point I mean the architects who decided to send
troops feared too much their own domestic political vulnerability
if Saigon fell; they feared the passions of the past rather than
the realities of the present. Lyndon Johnson, in particular, made a
bad political call, that of a man failing to read the larger lesson
of his own landslide victory in 1964. We were, if treated as
grown-ups by the President, quite capable of understanding why the
Administration had not sent combat troops to do, in the immortal
words of LBJ, for Asian boys what Asian boys should do for
themselves. Secondly, the same architects underestimated why the
other side had so powerful a political-military dynamic, and
therefore would be able to sustain the technological pounding we
gave it.
</P>
<P>
   But our failure in Indochina was not a reflection of American
weakness, or of a broader communist strength in other countries
where there was no preceding colonial war. The lessons of Vietnam
were localized, as were the unique strengths of the other side. It
was a place where, tragically, we applied our power where power was
not applicable.
</P>
<P>
   It was nationalism that was the central issue in both Eastern
Europe and in Southeast Asia. (I had an unusually good view of this
because I had gone from Saigon in the early '60s to Eastern Europe
in the mid-'60s, and then back to Saigon in 1967.) In Vietnam,
where Catholicism was identified by much of the predominantly
Buddhist population as an instrument of the former colonial power,
cmmunists represented the indigenous anti-Western forces which had
defeated the French. Because of that, the people in a small Mekong
Delta village would hide a Viet Cong commissar from the forces of
the government.
</P>
<P>
   Comparably, in Poland, where the government was seen as an
extension of a Soviet occupation and where the Catholic Church was
historically twined with the country's nationalism and was, of
course, anticommunist, the exact reverse was true. If a commissar
came into a village looking for a local priest, the villagers would
hide the priest.
</P>
<P>
   Let me take that one step further: I believe that in the end,
when Gorbachev made his fateful decisions to change the Soviet
system, he did so because he was a patriot and a nationalist. In
the end he was a better Russian than he was a communist. I think he
realized that the system had blocked the nation; communism had
suppressed the true energies of his people. It was one thing to
fall behind the United States, Western Europe, even Japan, in terms
of industrial production and technological achievement. But when
you were falling behind South Korea, that was something to alarm
any patriot.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened in Vietnam _ for better or worse, for all the
pain it caused us at the time _ had, I suspect, little to do with
the eventual outcome of the world as it stands today.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Vietnam weakened us momentarily. That sense of weakness
was probably heightened by two succeeding events. The first was the
hostage crisis in Iran, overamplified as it was by network
television reporting, which gave off an impression of American
weakness, rather than frustration. The second event was the
subsequent dramatic change in oil prices, with its parallel arrival
of massive inflation which was so hard on the middle class. But I
don't think the war affected our core strengths. We were strong
before Vietnam in any true reading of our innate qualities and our
resilience as a society, we were strong during it, and we were
strong after it.
</P>
<P>
   The weaknesses that the war underlined seem in retrospect those
of perception to me rather than reality. The failure of our
military there did not mean that we were weak militarily. It meant
instead that we were fighting the wrong war in the wrong place at
the wrong time. We had ended up fighting alongside a feudal ally
whose generals had more often than not served with the French. And
we were fighting against a force in which communism and nationalism
were blended together.

DOWNTOWN REBOUND: MARKETING DRIVE AIMS TO BRING BACK PATRONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Saying they won't let a ``stiff breeze'' get
them down, Fort Worth business and civic leaders have launched a
marketing campaign that takes a humorous approach to letting people
know that downtown is open for activity after the deadly tornado a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ads are fun in spirit, but they are no way intended to
downplay the losses,'' said John Stevenson, chairman of Downtown
Fort Worth Inc., the business booster group. Downtown businesses
need ``our business to stay in business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In unveiling the campaign Wednesday, the leaders also announced
that they formed a coalition called Fort Worth TUFF, or Team United
for the Future.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-member group includes representatives from the city, Fort
Worth Chamber of Commerce, Downtown Fort Worth Inc., the Fort Worth
Convention &AMP; Visitors Bureau, and Sundance Square. They will meet
regularly to develop programs and events to attract people downtown
while repairs and renovations are being made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plans are on the drawing board,'' said Stevenson, who will be
chairman. He declined to say what kinds of events the group is
discussing.
</P>
<P>
   Storms heavily damaged parts of the city March 28, killing five
people, causing damage estimated at more than $450 million, and
paralyzing downtown for several days. Streets once closed for
cleanup have reopened, but business owners have said they believe
that many people are staying away and mistakenly think it is not
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not the case anymore,'' Mayor Kenneth Barr said,
calling the tornado a ``stiff breeze.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Downtown is on the rebound,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the hardest-hit office buildings are also reopening. The
UPR Plaza at Seventh and Commerce streets became fully accessible
again late last week, and Bank One officials said they expect
operations to reopen this week in the Bank One tower at Fifth and
Throckmorton streets. The building will be open to tenants in about
three weeks and the Reata restaurant, at the top of the tower,
should open by May 9, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that is really good news,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Witherspoon &AMP; Associates, a Fort Worth ad and public relations
agency whose downtown offices were heavily damaged, created the ad
campaign. Witherspoon has temporarily moved to offices on the
city's west side while its downtown building is repaired.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will carry the tagline ``Making It Better Than
Ever,'' a logo of the downtown skyline, and the Fort Worth TUFF
acronym. Ads will carry text such as ``You Can't Judge a Town By
Its Plywood,'' ``When Life Hands You Tornadoes, Play Twister,''
``No Gusts, No Glory'' and ``It's Been a Whirlwind Few Weeks. But
Now We're Ready for Company.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will include ads in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram
and The Business Press, and advertising on bus benches and the T
buses.
</P>
<P>
   Both newspapers are donating space for the advertising, the
business group said. The group declined to say how much the
campaign will cost or how long it will run. The group is bearing
any costs outside of contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Harman, president of the Fort Worth Convention &AMP; Visitors
Bureau, said the campaign is on target. He said he has had
inquiries nationwide from groups looking for convention space,
wondering if it is all right to come to Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to know downtown is safe,'' Harman said. ``We've
had those kinds of questions raised. That's the kind of thing we've
had to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Boecker, president of Sundance Square Management, said
downtown has lost some momentum, even though many restaurants and
businesses opened within days after the storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody pulled together in a hurry,'' Boecker said. ``We've
largely been open from the start.''
</P>
<P>
   Jan Brenneman, executive director of the Sid Richardson
Collection on Main Street, said she is pleased with the
post-tornado publicity campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're on the right track,'' she said, adding that
``we need to promote the trolley service'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   Since the tornado, attendance has crept back to about two-thirds
of what it was before the storm, Brenneman said.

`IT WAS A SHEER CRIME. HOW CAN I FORGET THAT' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 30)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THAI BA TAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   HANOI -- Twenty-five years have passed since Vietnam's war with
America ended. But is 25 years long enough for people who lived
through the war, experienced its hardships and cruelties, to forget
it? Of course not.
</P>
<P>
   I was one of the few lucky young Vietnamese to be sent abroad by
my government for studies during that difficult time. I left for
Moscow in August 1967, and when I came back, in June 1974, the war
was over, at least in the North. Perhaps I have no right to judge a
war I didn't participate in, let alone speak for those who died or
became permanently disabled. But I did see a lot of the war's
horrors, and I had a brother killed by American bombs. Strangely
enough, as time passes, the memories of those days don't fade. More
often, I find myself thinking about them.
</P>
<P>
   I still remember when the United States started its destruction
of North Vietnam. It was shortly after the so-called Gulf of Tonkin
incident in August 1964. A group of about five American fighter
planes were coming from the sea to bomb Vinh, the provincial center
of Nghe An. That's less than 200 miles south of Hanoi and 19 miles
from the village where we lived. All the villagers, especially the
children like me, went out to watch the planes from a distance.
Some of us even waved at them cheerfully, unaware of what would
come later.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, our quiet village, located on the bank of a
small river used to transport food and military supplies from the
North to the South, became a strategic target for the US Navy's
Seventh Fleet. We were shelled regularly from the sea and bombed by
planes from the air. One morning we were asleep when a rocket hit
our house. Fortunately, no one was killed or wounded, but we were
bombed several more times later, so we had to move to another
village, further from the river.
</P>
<P>
   It was during this time that I saw my first American. Actually,
it was the silhouette of a pilot in his cockpit, diving down to
bomb a small boat in the river. He got so low that the bamboos bent
down and the roofs on thatched houses flew away. For years that
image has stuck with me and influenced the way I think of
Americans. You can imagine the destruction and losses our poor
village suffered as well as the hatred we felt toward the invaders.
In those days, we called them the ``devil Americans,'' the
``murdererous Americans,'' or the ``death sowers.''
</P>
<P>
   The official line here now is to put the war behind us, to look
forward to a friendly future with the United States. It makes
sense. No one is against that, really. It's an imperative of the
times. But in our hearts it's not so simple and clear-cut. Look
toward a friendly future, yes, but forget the war? That's not easy,
because it simply doesn't let you do that.
</P>
<P>
   The war is still present everywhere, every day in Vietnam, and
probably will be for years to come. We have no national cemetery
like Arlington, but every community has a small cemetery for fallen
soldiers. People go there every day to tend the graves of their
relatives, to burn incense, to make kow-tows, to live with the war
again and again. In almost every Vietnamese family there is someone
who died or is missing from the war. How can we forget that?
</P>
<P>
   In late 1996, as part of a delegation of Vietnamese writers, I
spent a month visiting the United States, including Boston. I
enjoyed your city. I also enjoyed meeting Americans who had fought
in the war. They are good people, those veterans, but each time I
shook one of their hands a painful thought struck my mind: that
maybe this very hand, at about 3 o'clock one morning in mid-1968,
had been the one that dropped bombs onto the new village our family
was evacuated to.
</P>
<P>
   The bombs killed my 14-year-old brother, Thai Ba Qui, all eight
members of a family nearby, and many others. Everything can be said
to justify wartime atrocities, but bombing a small village with
absolutely no military targets, with only rice fields, water
buffaloes, and barefoot peasants, was not warfare. It was a sheer
crime. How can I forget that?
</P>
<P>
   When in Washington, I forced myself to stand before the Pentagon
and the State Department to ponder the past and the present. I
resisted the temptation to go inside the White House, where
Presidents Johnson and Nixon ordered the war escalated.
</P>
<P>
   During my stay in the United States, I came to understand it
better. I admired the nation for its dynamism, its great economic
and technological achievements. I do see the differences between
politicians and ordinary people. I've even started saving to send
my daughter to study in America some time in the future. Of course,
she'll have her own way of thinking about the war and those
Americans who took part in it. But I feel it my duty to tell her
all that happened. After all, knowing the past sometimes helps
better prepare for the future.

<P>
   WINNIPEG _ ``Let sleeping dogs lie,'' is how my father put it,
the day after a tearful reunion on my return from Canada in 1976.
And so the eight years of estrangement remains one of those family
mysteries that is not discussed.
</P>
<P>
   I had had no contact with my family since an emotional meeting
in June of 1968, during which I insisted on going ahead with my
decision to leave the country rather than serve in the Vietnam War,
a decision my parents were unable to accept.
</P>
<P>
   While I was away, I taught school, become a Canadian citizen,
got divorced, and waited _ without much optimism _ for a change in
US policy toward draft resisters. I knew that by leaving when I did
I automatically became wanted by the FBI, which had to be the most
bizarre part of the experience. I mean, I grew up with TV shows
about FBI agents as heroes fighting evil and catching the bad guys,
so it was pretty disconcerting to become one of the bad guys by
driving 400 miles and not coming back.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, as part of President Gerald Ford's clemency program,
a legal review of the outstanding draft-resistance cases resulted
in most of them being thrown out. But it was not until I got
official confirmation from a Wisconsin district attorney that my
case was among those that had been dropped that I determined to
return and contact my parents.
</P>
<P>
   I had often dreamed of my family during those eight years. In my
dreams they were always happy, and much younger than they had been
when I left. It kept me hopeful that one day we'd be together again
and, however improbable it seemed at the time, things could go back
to the way they had been in my childhood.
</P>
<P>
   My father had been a dentist and my mother a housewife. My
younger brother and sister and I had grown up in rural northern
Wisconsin. Our house was on a hillside overlooking a lake, and was
filled with books, music, and art from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   My father had an ardent love of literature and a deep, resonant,
magical voice. I still remember hearing him read stories like ``The
Swiss Family Robinson'' at bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   Self-sufficiency and critical thinking, independence of mind,
courage, respect for human rights, and a determination to do the
right thing no matter the consequences _ those were my parents'
gifts to me. And I remember my father once warning me very
seriously about how easily an unscrupulous person could abuse logic
to persuade others to follow him in an evil course of action. When
I read some of the government's attempts to justify the US
involvement in Vietnam, my first thought was, ``You got that right,
Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   It was painful to be accused of treason by my own parents, but I
can honestly say I was never angry at them, or even upset. It just
seemed strange, because I felt that in deciding to leave, I was
really making use of everything they had taught me.
</P>
<P>
   But my father was stubborn, and I always avoided any conflict
with him. In the end, I believe the breakup was both our faults. It
was just a bad combination of my father's stubbornness on the one
hand and my reluctance to argue with him about why I was leaving
the country, on the other.
</P>
<P>
   After high school, I went on to Macalester College in St. Paul,
where I was attempting to finish a graduate degree in education
while the Vietnam War seemed to be spinning out of control.
</P>
<P>
   As the situation in Vietnam deteriorated, it was puzzling to see
the frequency with which the abuses of logic my father had warned
me about started appearing in official statements promoting the
war. It was even more puzzling to find similar abuses in the
statements opposing it. It seemed impossible to judge whom to trust
about what on Vietnam. But I knew that eventually I could be made
to go there, regardless.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I couldn't talk to my parents about what I was
going through; it was too confusing. I barely know how to describe
it now, never mind back then as an immature college student. When I
was informed in the spring of 1968 that I'd be drafted in the
summer, however, it really didn't occur to me that I might leave
the country until I had considered and rejected every other option.
</P>
<P>
   My first option was to do the expected thing and serve; but it
would have required a lot more trust in the official line on the
war, and more confidence in the beneficial effects of military
service on its participants.
</P>
<P>
   I also considered going to prison, as a form of protest, but was
advised against it by the assistant chaplain at Macalester, who was
a bit of a radical. He said he used to recommend going to jail, but
that the American prison system had become too dangerous. I even
attended a couple of Quaker meetings to see if I might turn out to
be a pacifist. I decided I wasn't, and quit.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, some lunchtime conversations in the teachers' lounge
at the suburban high school where I was student-teaching got me to
consider going to Canada. A group of social studies teachers I'd
come to know, all middle-aged men with families, spent several
lunch hours talking about how if Nixon won the 1968 election, they
would take their families and move to Canada. It occurred to me
that if they could leave the country over an election, perhaps I
could leave over a war.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect, except for the suffering that the collapse of
communication between us caused my family, I am enormously grateful
that I became a Canadian for all sorts of reasons. Some have to do
with the more reserved approach to life here, the less violent
culture. More importantly, if I hadn't come to Winnipeg, I wouldn't
have been able to have my own family of little Canadians: I married
again in 1985, and my wife and I now have three wonderful boys ages
9, 10, and 12.
</P>
<P>
   As many others have discovered, the experience of raising
children is the best way to understand, and appreciate, one's
parents _ and their dreams. If I in any way fulfill some of my
father's dreams, I will be very happy. We may not have taken the
same path, but I think we had the same determination that it be the
right path; and we're both pretty stubborn.

<P>
   The Harvard class of 1969 watched with uncommon interest as the
class of 1968 in campuses across America ran for cover from the war
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Family doctors perjured themselves in letters to draft boards
asserting that asthma had debilitated strapping lacrosse players.
Young men who had never darkened the doorstep of a church
discovered a sudden passion for a life of faith. Students without a
whiff of compassion for the poor sought meaningful experiences in
the Peace Corps and VISTA.
</P>
<P>
   There was no end to the stratagems that led away from the
alluvial rice paddies of the Mekong Delta while skirting Canada or
prison.
</P>
<P>
   I recall little guilt among the young men who avoided military
service. Their opposition to the war was usually grounded in a
combination of cowardice, principled opposition, and conviction
that death in Vietnam was a dumb way to go. So in a tradition
stretching back to the Civil War, when men of means bought their
way out of service for $300, those with options in 1969 exploited
them. At the end of the day, fear trumped conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Another group of able-bodied seniors chose enlistment as the
best of a bad set of options that included jail or flight to Canada
_ but as far from Vietnam as possible. Unlike their civilian
counterparts, they signed away at least three years of their lives.
Yet they were in the same moral limbo as those who avoided service.
I was part of this second cohort.
</P>
<P>
   Someone heard about the Army language school, formally known as
the Defense Language Institute, in Monterey, Calif. It entailed a
three-year tour _ one more than the draft _ but involved no
incoming mortars (provided you didn't study Vietnamese.) The buzz
on this one spread like wildfire among elite colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us who are Bill Clinton's contemporaries find the
sophistry about his experience with the draft so galling precisely
because we were all in on the same plan: avoid death. Like the rest
of us, Clinton didn't want to get shot. He just has never come
clean about his motives. We know better. In maintaining this
fiction, he insults our intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   I was abysmal in math and science but had a fair ear for
languages. My draft board lurked like a great white shark, so I
signed up for Monterey in the spring of my senior year under the
delayed entrance program, which allowed me to graduate in June. I
was the only person I knew in my Harvard class who went directly to
active duty.
</P>
<P>
   Monterey was where soldiers from all branches of the military,
as well as the odd spook and State Department officer, were sent
for language training. It was billed as the best language
instruction in the Free World, a campus where you ate, slept, and
drank a language for up to a year.
</P>
<P>
   When I applied, the Army had openings in Vietnamese and
Hungarian. I hesitated for about a tenth of a second before
choosing Hungarian, a language in which I professed a deep
interest. Love those zany magyars.
</P>
<P>
   My only extended experience with the real Army was an unamusing
eight weeks of basic training at Fort Dix. I recall being ordered
to watch the moon landing on television in what seemed like the
middle of the night, and I mourned my absence at Woodstock. When
the company commander read out our assignments at the end of the
ordeal, I was one of the very few who was not slated for advanced
infantry training and then Vietnam. There was curiosity rather than
anger about my posting. What the hell was the Defense Language
Institute?
</P>
<P>
   As advertised, Monterey was the Gentlemen's Army. Classes ran
from 8 to 12 and 2 to 4, five days a week. We swam at the beach in
Carmel, a rich little community of faux charm, and drank in Clint
Eastwood's bar, The Hog's Breath. To the south lay the majesty of
Big Sur. Less than two hours north were the sweet sins of San
Fransisco and beyond, the sweep of Marin County.
</P>
<P>
   During a four- or five-year window when the draft bit hard,
Monterey teemed with East Coast preppies and Ivy Leaguers who
pursued the same scheme. The place was surreal. Privates drove
Porsches and BMWs. An heir to the W.R. Grace fortune played polo at
Pebble Beach. A few of us ended up one Saturday night in white tie
at the Spinster's Ball, a snooty post-debutante affair closed to
all but San Fransisco's ingrown Social Register crowd. As skinheads
in rented tails, we looked bizarre, and more than a few of the
city's elite were appalled to learn that we were defending them. We
were too.
</P>
<P>
   When we weren't in tails, we were listening on weekends to the
Grateful Dead or the Jefferson Airplane in the Fillmore West or
Winterland, wandering around the Haight, or watching hallucinogenic
sunsets from the summit of Mount Tamalpais.
</P>
<P>
   Our only glimpse of the other Army during this period was the
annual trip to the rifle range at nearby Fort Ord to qualify with
M-16s. The fierce range instructors there would assume the womb
position under the bleachers whenever a contingent from the
language school appeared, because we couldn't remember from basic
training how to shoot the things, and we sprayed lead all over
Monterey Bay with brio.
</P>
<P>
   After finishing my 47-week course, I was sent to a ludicrous
eight-week interrogator's course at Fort Holabird in Baltimore,
where I learned nothing other than the fact that I was among the
most expensively trained soldiers in the Army. I was no more an
interrogator than Gomer Pyle.
</P>
<P>
   After Fort Holabird, now defunct, I was assigned to an
intelligence unit in Munich where I interviewed Hungarian
border-crossers and wrote up reports for the intelligence
community. It was damned interesting work, and I became quite good
at it. I spent weeks with a Jewish chemist and wrote about
anti-Semitism in Hungary. I debriefed an illiterate truck driver
who served at an important missile base. (I later declined a CIA
job interview so I could grow my hair long.)
</P>
<P>
   My Army experience, along with the war, is a distant memory
today. My Hungarian now consists of ``There are no bombs in the
hanger.'' When I run into Vietnam vets, they dismiss me with the
rest of the draft-age men who avoided harm's way in Southeast Asia.
I would too were I in their shoes. Still, they credit me at least
for having put on a uniform for three years.
</P>
<P>
   I'm tempted to say that the moral lines of demarcation have
blurred since Vietnam. But they haven't. They've just been under
the radar screen for most of us.

   WASHINGTON _ Despite a rift within their movement, multitudes of
gay and lesbian activists are gathering in the nation's capital for
a long weekend of crusade and celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say this Millennium March on Washington for Equality
is aimed at ``galvanizing and energizing'' the homosexual community
into an effective voting bloc for the November elections and at
inspiring more people to actively support ``our civil rights
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Parties are planned as well as protests and parades. On
Saturday, there is a mass same-sex wedding at the Lincoln Memorial
and a concert starring Garth Brooks, Melissa Etheridge, k.d. lang,
George Michael, Queen Latifah and the Pet Shop Boys at RFK Stadium.
On Sunday, a morning street march will be followed by a rally on
the National Mall, where Ellen DeGeneres and Anne Heche will be
among the speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Such national assemblies ``strengthen our movement,'' said
Dianne Hardy-Garcia, director of the march and of the Lesbian/Gay
Rights Lobby of Texas. ``If we are to win our fight for full
equality, we must get stronger and involve more people.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers had predicted this fourth national rally for gay and
lesbian rights would be the biggest ever, attracting up to a
million participants. But some homosexual political groups are
disturbed about the timing and leadership of the march and will
boycott the activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been undemocratic from the get-go,'' said Henry Moses, a
spokesman for the boycott coalition and an officer for the
Washington, D.C., local of Pride at Work, a labor organization that
he said ``represents working-class queers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been called things like 'traitor,' but at some point you
have to take a stand and say, 'No one or two organizations can
speak for the community','' said Moses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not supporting the march,'' said Matt Foreman, a
spokesman for the Empire State Pride Agenda in New York. ``We're
focusing our attentions on where we believe the key battleground
for our movement is _ the local, county and state level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Had we been asked, we would have said it doesn't make a lot of
sense to have a national march with a lame-duck Congress and a
lame-duck president six months out from the fall election at a time
when the majority of state legislatures are in session,'' said
Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents have organized an Ad Hoc Committee for an Open Process
to urge people to ``sit this one out.'' Eleven gay and lesbian
groups from Illinois are boycotting. The national leadership of
Pride at Work, which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO, has urged all
unions ``to neither endorse nor fund this event.''
</P>
<P>
   The critics charge that grassroots groups were ignored in
planning the event.
</P>
<P>
   The march was announced by two major groups: The Human Rights
Campaign, the nation's largest gay political organization, and the
Metropolitan Community Church, which welcomes gays and lesbians
into its congregations. Its corporate sponsors include America
Online Inc., the Showtime cable network and United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Defending the planning process as inclusive, Hardy-Garcia said
organizers are not surprised that some comrades oppose the march.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always dissenting voices. People have varying
opinions,'' she said. ``It's the nature of a movement to have
disagreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Many state and local organizations are sending delegations to
the march.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for movements to get together every so often to
celebrate their victories and be emboldened and encouraged for the
future,'' said Harry Knox of the Georgia Equality Project.
</P>
<P>
   National gatherings are especially helpful for young gays and
lesbians who often feel isolated in small Georgia towns, said Knox.
</P>
<P>
   ``The battle for full equality in Atlanta very different than it
is in Cordele and Statesboro and Rome,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The march comes at a time of historic progress and presence for
the gay and lesbian community. This week, Vermont became the first
state to give homosexual couples all the rights and benefits of
marriage. Gay and lesbian characters regularly appear in movies,
network TV programs and other segments of the popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have attained a certain level of visibility,'' said
Hardy-Garcia. ``But visibility isn't civil rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The need for political action was dramatized recently when
voters in ``liberal California'' passed a referendum that bans gay
marriages, she said. Other states may enact legislation to prevent
gay and lesbian couples from adopting children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 'Will &AMP; Grace' on TV, but people are fired every day''
for being gay or lesbian, she said. In the fight for equality,
``we're not nearly there yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The director said the march will be judged to have been
successful if it helps generate the largest-ever gay and lesbian
voter turnout in the fall elections and motivates a new generation
of activists.
</P>
<P>
   ``To build a civil rights movement,'' she explained, people have
to ``be inspired to be involved.''
</P>
<P>
   A national march can turn hundreds of thousands of people into
activists, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The first such march came in 1979 and was ``all about being
visible,'' she recalled. The second march was in 1987 and
articulated the community's legislative aims. The 1993 march, which
brought hundreds of thousands of people to Washington, demonstrated
a potential for political power.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, we have to do more,'' she said. ``We have to
prove that we are a powerful voting bloc.''
</P>
<P>
   In an open letter to the gay and lesbian community, Hardy-Garcia
said that internal debates over the march detract from ``the larger
reasons we must work together as a movement.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The platform for the march calls for:
</P>
<P>
   _ Congress and state legislatures to pass legislation providing
protection against hate crimes based on sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Links between the movements for racial and sexual justice.
</P>
<P>
   _ The right for gays and lesbians to serve openly in the armed
forces and an end to the current ``don't ask, don't tell'' military
policy.
</P>
<P>
   _ Laws protecting against workplace discrimination on the basis
of sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   _ Equal marriage rights.
</P>
<P>
   _ Funding for AIDS research, prevention and treatment.

   LOS ANGELES &UR;  &LR; -- The nightmares came toward the end of 1975. They
appeared stubbornly, rudely, in the middle of the night, robbing me
of rest and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise my days were normal, filled with the extraordinary and
none-too-extraordinary doings of a 17-year-old new to America. I'd
skip breakfast but still manage to be late for first period. I'd
pay attention to Mrs. Wilson, the English teacher, or Ms. Bellonby,
the art teacher _ when no girl occupied my mind. I'd ride home in
John Turner's Mustang at 2, embarrassed when he said that after six
months in the United States, I still put the accent on the wrong
syllable when I said ``uncomfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at home, I'd wolf down a salami sandwich then rush off
to further my Americanization by flipping hamburgers for $2.10 an
hour at the local Roy Rogers. I'd put on my red-checkered shirt, my
plastic white cowboy hat, and greet customers with an accented,
``Hooowdee, paaardner!'' Then I'd smell like a bucket of grease and
oil for the next five hours. Home by 9, I'd shower and tend to my
homework for a couple of hours, then fall asleep, somehow
forgetting that the nightmares would come in a few hours.
</P>
<P>
   The nightmares, as it happened, were about another life, another
place. About my mother and sister left behind in South Vietnam, my
place of birth. About my father, in prison somewhere in North
Vietnam. I was old enough to know how guilt is manifested into bad
dreams, but when I allowed myself to think about it, it was more a
sense of shame that always came over me. And then more terrifying
than the nightmares or the shame was the thought that I was in no
position to do anything about it. So life in America seemed to be a
series of uneventful, bleak days with neither promise nor
fulfillment.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1975, relatives in Saigon had taken me out of Vietnam,
fearing a bloodbath at the hands of the communist North. My mother
was stuck in central Vietnam, where we'd been living in the years
before. My father, a provincial governor in South Vietnam, had been
captured by communist soldiers during the Tet offensive in 1968 and
had disappeared into the jungles. We'd had no news from him.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I arrived in the United States in May 1975, more
than 100,000 people from South Vietnam had joined the exodus. We
became refugees scattered across the States and other nations,
learning a new language and working at odd jobs, surviving as best
we could. I suspect that for many of us, particularly the adults,
the nightmares were frequent features of the night.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years later, the nightmares seem to have given way
to largely fulfilled American dreams. Across the United States,
Vietnamese-Americans are making their mark as doctors, engineers,
and educators. Our young people are emerging from brand-name
universities to turn into savvy entrepreneurs and professionals. In
places like San Jose and Westminster, Calif., Houston and Boston,
Vietnamese shops and restaurants are reviving entire neighborhoods,
improving economic life. Like many immigrants before us, we are
renewing America. What's been more vexing for us is readjusting
attitudes toward both Vietnam and America. The earlier refugees
began life here with the notion that they would one day return to
live in their homeland once it was free. But as time passes, there
has come the recognition that while the regime in Hanoi is
changing, it's not going away.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990's, visits home became possible. For those who
returned, as I did throughout the decade, the trips alleviated
nostalgia. They also curbed fears that Vietnam today is a police
state where a Vietnamese-American might get arrested. The
redisovery of ancient temples, quaint villages, idyllic beaches,
and long hours sharing tropical fruits and gifts with friends and
relatives fueled a new sense of comfort with the country. At the
same time, the trips made us realize we had changed. We wanted
bottled water and street lights that worked. We couldn't sit idle
for hours without bemoaning lost opportunities. We'd become
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Painful memories of the war will always remain in our hearts.
But for many families, such as mine, the separations have ended. My
father was released from prison in 1980, and in 1984 my parents
were able to come to the United States. They've come to accept the
peace and comfort America has offered. The cultural differences and
homesickness they endure seem a fair price to be free.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, events will stir up hurtful emotions. A visit
by a Communist delegation from Vietnam to San Francisco. A friendly
decision by the US government toward Vietnam. An exhibition of
works by Hanoi artists. At such times, many in the community will
be angry again over the issues that used to divide North and South
Vietnam, and demonstrators will appear in the streets. I've even
been subjected to allegations that I'm a communist sympathizer
because I believe we need to build bridges to Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   I think change in Vietnam will happen more quickly with
dialogues, contacts, and trade. As part of a younger generation, I
am less colored by anger than by a desire to turn the page. Now the
challenge is how to guide a new Vietnamese-American generation to
succeed while still being of help to Vietnam despite the lingering
wounds of war.
</P>
<P>
   Fully healing those wounds may take another five, 10 years. But
it's been 25 years already. My nights, and surely those of most
other Vietnamese living in America, are no longer filled with
nightmares from a difficult past. We sleep better now.

<P>
   PARIS -- April 30, 1975, was a great day for my country and for
me. I was in the first tank that broke into the grounds of the
Presidential Palace in Saigon. Though I was a correspondent for the
North Vietnamese Army newspaper, I was the senior officer present
that day, so I accepted the formal surrender from General Duong Van
Minh, known as ``Big Minh,'' the last head of the South Vietnamese
government.
</P>
<P>
   What a day! Like many of my comrades, I had fought for more than
30 years _ first against France, later against the United States.
This was a moment of joy: A country once divided was reunited.
Friends and relatives once separated rediscovered one another.
There were no more foreign troops _ no more Japanese, British,
Hindu, Chinese, French, American, South Korean, Australian, New
Zealander, Thai _ on the soil of the fatherland.
</P>
<P>
   Now there would be reconciliation. That April morning I extended
my hand to Minh, inviting him and his aides to join in healing the
wounds of war.
</P>
<P>
   But party leaders in Hanoi had other plans. Their dogmatic
adherence to Marxism set up a decade of horror, a period in which
no reconciliation was possible.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere prisons were enlarged. Some 200,000 former officers
and civil servants of the puppet regime were incarcerated.
Collectivization, Stalinist style, was quickly imposed on the
South. Throughout the Mekong Delta, private ownership and private
businesses were curbed, eliminated, or confiscated, provoking a
wind of panic and driving the middle class into emigration.
</P>
<P>
   For the people of the South, it was slow death. It was slow
death for me, too. I could see the promises being broken, the slide
into repression and suffering. The economy fell apart. Famine
appeared everywhere. Inflation was rising, peaking at 800 percent
in 1980. The Vietnamese invasion and occupation of Cambodia and a
border war against our former Chinese allies in the north sapped
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Amid poverty and persecution, millions of people braved the high
seas and coastal pirates to leave the country after first paying
the liberators in gold to look the other way.
</P>
<P>
   There was no reconciliation during that terrible decade. But
through it all, I stayed with the party. I was part of the invasion
of Cambodia. I thought I could effect change from within, and from
1975 on I made proposals for change. All were rejected.
</P>
<P>
   By 1986, the Communist Party had allowed some liberalization in
a policy called ``doi moi,'' meaning renewal. The day-to-day life
of the population improved. There was more money circulating;
dollars were present everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   New houses were built. But doi moi was not the cure. Party
leaders had adopted it in desperation, and when the Soviet Union
collapsed in 1991, the party returned to a more conservative
approach.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, before the open door of doi moi slammed shut, I got
out. I was sent on an official mission to Paris and obtained
permission to stay longer for medical treatment. While there, I
published a pamphlet entitled ``Proposal of a Citizen,'' in which I
advocated democracy and integration into the new world environment.
I had no intention of defecting, but friends told me it was now
unsafe for me to return. Soon I was denounced as a traitor in Hanoi
and expelled from the party.
</P>
<P>
   I was now an exile. In my country, meanwhile, a cold climate had
descended. International overtures became more hesitant. Hanoi
today is still most comfortable doing business with Beijing,
Pyongyang, and Havana. The party-controlled media are sympathetic
to Saddam Hussein and Slobodan Milosevic. This is because the
Communist leaders in Vietnam have one fixed idea:
self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   Under doi moi, everything is theoretically possible _ except any
challenge to the one-party political system and the exclusive
leadership role of the Communist Party. The man at the top, General
Le Kha Phieu, the party's general secretary, is absolutely faithful
to the inner core of the party. He follows doctrine to the letter,
relentlessly and shamelessly parrots party mottos and slogans. He
is a party man in a one-party state.
</P>
<P>
   But the outside world is knocking. The World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund are putting pressure on Vietnam to
reform the financial system and thin out state ownership of
business. If the country wants foreign investors, it must make
drastic changes.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter of a century has gone by since the end of the war,
since that glorious morning of victory. Vietnam today is one of the
poorest countries in the world. Per capita income is $320 a year.
That is one-third the level of the Philippines, one-sixth of
Thailand, one-36th of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years of exile have now gone by for me. The BBC and other
foreign media broadcast my voice home on a regular basis. I can
talk to friends and relatives in Vietnam by phone, fax, and e-mail.
But my wife, my daughter, and two granddaughters remain in the
country. I cannot yet go back, and we miss each other dearly.
</P>
<P>
   How long can old-fashioned communists persist in this age of
open markets and free-flowing information? My best bet is that they
will make some reforms _ but very little, just enough to maintain
international aid, to gain time before a new, younger generation,
more active, more efficient, more vigorous, takes over to bring
about decisive changes.
</P>
<P>
   It is too late for my generation, the generation of war, of
victory, and betrayal. We won. We also lost.

VIETNAM IS BOFFO ON CAMPUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 30)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWTON, Mass. _ Anne Paulet, a Boston College visiting assistant
professor, had good cause for the jitters. It was St. Patrick's Day
and she had asked the 88 students in her ``History 111: Vietnam''
class to ``please, please put off drinking green beer'' for the
afternoon, in exchange for two hours sitting, thirsty, in a dark
lecture hall.
</P>
<P>
   On a St. Patrick's Friday in any other class at BC, she might
have been lecturing to the wall. But the room was packed. Students
sporting green sweaters and green hair clips fairly tripped over
each other to find seats. Only one slipped out early.
</P>
<P>
   Paulet introduced the guest speaker, Mark Kannenberg, a Vietnam
veteran and the father of a student in the class. Kannenberg began
by asking students to raise their hands if they had relatives or
family friends who fought in Vietnam. Almost all did. Then he asked
how many of those relatives and friends spoke openly about their
experiences. Not one raised a hand.
</P>
<P>
   That exchange at least begins to explain why Vietnam War classes
are among the most popular on today's campuses, where most of the
Class of 2003 was born while Ronald Reagan was president, long
after the '70s _ and the war _ were over. These classes are a safe
way to probe a topic that is at once family secret, national
tragedy, and romantic myth.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the students I've had, their curiosity is coupled with a
tentativeness about asking fundamental questions, a reverence
toward this awful thing that's happened to this country,'' said
Christian G. Appy, a Vietnam scholar who taught a history course on
the war at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1991 to
1999. ``To many students, it's like a death in the family. They're
afraid if they ask too many questions they might insult someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Some students want to know how America, the world's only
superpower for most of their lives, could lose a war. Some are
seduced by the '60s and early '70s, which they imagine as an almost
idyllic time before cynicism swept the nation. Others look with
fascination at an era in which 2.7 million young men grew up not in
dorm rooms but in rice paddies, helicopters, and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The topic's popularity is undeniable. This year, 480 professors
are teaching the history of the war in American colleges and
universities, compared with 351 in 1997 and 157 in 1986, according
to CMG Direct of Wilmington, Mass., which compiles faculty lists
and sells them to book publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the largest enrollment courses at every place I
know of that offers this course,'' said Robert K. Brigham, a Vassar
College professor and Vietnam scholar. A class on Vietnam at Brown
University, for example, draws more than 300 students every year.
</P>
<P>
   Paradoxically, while the war's scars are still visible on the
culture, a typical 20-year-old knows almost nothing about it. He
may have seen ``Full Metal Jacket,'' ``Platoon'' and a Rambo movie
or two. He has heard uneasy jokes about life ``back in 'Nam.'' But
his high school American history course devoted just one class to
Vietnam before review for the final. And the veteran in his family
only whispers about Vietnam, if that.
</P>
<P>
   Most college students sign up for a Vietnam course with little
more than a sense that the war was one big mess. A decade ago,
James Reckner, a history professor at Texas Tech University, asked
100 students to name the general most closely associated with
Vietnam. Only one could identify General William Westmoreland.
Reckner speculates that today, not one new student would be able to
volunteer Westmoreland's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Students arrive here totally knowledge-less, other than what
they've seen in movies,'' said Reckner, who presides over a mammoth
archive of Vietnam-related materials at Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   American high schools have all but abdicated responsibility for
teaching about the war, Reckner said. And vets are notoriously
reticent. Even after his midterm in Paulet's class, Boston College
senior Joseph Serrano, a marketing major from Connecticut, can only
say that his father served in the Army in Vietnam, ``in charge of a
bunch of people, doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a taboo subject in our family,'' Serrano said.
``He's a very forthright guy, and for him to be so elusive is
strange. That's one of the reasons I took the course.''
</P>
<P>
   Junior Adam Langton, an economics major from St. Louis, said he
finds the subject of Vietnam protests enthralling even though he
considers himself politically conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of energy, and there seemed to be this
optimism,'' Langton said. ``You can feel it, even in the music. You
could attach yourself to a grand cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be interesting to live in a time like that,'' Langton
added. ``There was a sense of romance about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about more than sit-ins and marches. Cradled all their
lives by virtually uninterrupted peace and prosperity, most
students have never had reason to think beyond the pile of dirty
laundry in their closet.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, those who came of age during the Vietnam War were
forced to look outside themselves and outside their national
borders. Many baby boomers developed deep political sensibilities
that still affect them today.
</P>
<P>
   Coddled though they are, many young people sense that they've
missed that transcendent experience.
</P>
<P>
   Brown University senior Neel Parekh has taken three classes on
the Vietnam War. ``I obviously have some sort of obsession,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our generation feels that there's no real bond
between us, that we never went through this experience where we had
to evaluate who we were and what was our role in the nation,'' said
Parekh, a political science major from Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``War is
a great stage for that dialogue. People's parents had Korea or
Vietnam. All we had was the '80s.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to conventional wisdom, campus activism is as
widespread today as it was in the Vietnam era, according to Arthur
Levine, president of Teachers College at Columbia University in New
York, who surveys attitudes among college students. ``This is a
generation that has a higher percentage of people believing an
individual can make a difference than ever reported before,''
Levine said. ``And so the '60s have become, for lots of them, a
golden era.''
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, though, the themes of modern-day activism are
numerous and fragmented, Levine said, touching on minority issues,
financial aid, and administrative policy, to name a few. And the
question of whether sweatshirts with the college's insignia are
made by underpaid laborers hardly feels epic. So young people
continue to idealize the Vietnam era.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a longing among our generation to excel, but we
haven't found a way to have an impact,'' said John Reimers, a Brown
senior from Virginia who took Professor Charles Neu's seminar on
the war. ``I don't know what there is for us to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Students respond not only to the Vietnam War's allure but also
to its destructiveness and danger. ``They haven't looked at war
close up before,'' said Neu. ``The waste, the viciousness of it
comes as a shock to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In her BC class, Paulet has emphasized that many of the soldiers
who did brave, stupid, heroic, or violent things were just 18- and
19-year-old kids trying to figure out how to behave in an unnatural
situation. That sobering thought has given pause to many in the
class, like sophomore Timothy Libutti, 20, a political science
major from Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd be given a backpack and a rifle and dropped into a rice
paddy and told to go fight the enemy,'' Libutti said. ``I can't
imagine me or any of my friends doing something like that. I don't
consider myself mature enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Ignorant as they are when they arrived in the classroom to study
Vietnam, many students end the semester claiming, with some
justification, that they understand the conflict more fully than do
their parents. First, they have access to information not widely
available until recent years, and second, they lack many of the
baby boomers' ideological prejudices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a younger generation so I can be more objective,'' said
Jarret Wright, a sophomore history major from Yonkers, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Although Trinh Bui, a junior at BC from California, was born in
South Vietnam, she is so Americanized that she can't say exactly
where she was born. Bui's father, who fought under the late South
Vietnamese President Ngo Dinh Diem, shocked his daughter one day
recently by calling to admit to her that ``he didn't know much''
about the politics behind the war, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Of older Vietnamese-Americans, Bui said: ``You could say they
lived through it but that doesn't necessarily tell you they know
what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   University of Kentucky Professor George Herring, who has written
on Vietnam, points out that as long as many professors are baby
boomers, Vietnam courses will proliferate. Vassar's Brigham added:
``We've only begun to understand Vietnam in a critical sense, so I
don't think it's going to go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Students hope he's right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I love going to class and learning more about it,''
said Michael Tuohy, a senior at BC. ``I think that's actually a
first.''

<P>
   How great was the cultural impact of America's involvement in
Indochina?
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' says John Newman, curator of Colorado State
University's Vietnam War Literature Collection, ``I've heard it
said that every book published in America between 1965 and 1990 was
in some sense about the Vietnam War.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the war's impact limited to those books and that quarter
century. ``To this day,'' says John Baky, director of libraries at
La Salle University in Philadelphia, whose Connelly Library has
10,000 items in its Imaginative Representations of the Vietnam War
special collection, ``people don't realize what a cultural presence
(the war) is.''
</P>
<P>
   It's estimated that 700-750 novels and at least 100 short-story
collections have been published in English about the war. Some
1,400 personal narratives have reached print: everything from
Robert McNamara's ``In Retrospect'' to paperback originals by
former Navy SEALs and Army Green Berets whose combat memoirs have
become a thriving subgenre. Those narratives are but a fraction of
the approximately 12,000 nonfiction titles the Library of Congress
catalogs under the umbrella heading ``Vietnam Conflict,
1961-1975.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been more than 250 feature films relating to the war.
Many are thoroughly obscure. Baky estimates, for example, that
there are 30 biker movies centering on Harley-riding Vietnam
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   In other films, the war figures peripherally (Travis Bickle, the
main character in Martin Scorsese's 1976 film, ``Taxi Driver,'' is
a Vietnam vet) or is allegorized (as in the 1986 science-fiction
film ``Aliens''). Yet Vietnam is central to some of the most
celebrated, and/or reviled films of the last quarter century: ``The
Deer Hunter'' (1978), ``Apocalypse Now'' (1979), ``Rambo: First
Blood Part II'' (1985), ``Platoon'' (1986).
</P>
<P>
   The war has served as the primary inspiration in the work of the
playwright David Rabe, the authors Tim O'Brien and Robert Olen
Butler, and the filmmaker Oliver Stone. Even leaving aside his
Vietnam trilogy of ``Platoon,'' ``Born on the Fourth of July''
(1989), and ``Heaven and Earth'' (1993), Stone's work, with its
furious distrust of authority and predilection for violence and
lives led in extremis, is unthinkable without his experience as a
combat infantryman during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Most notable of all, the war inspired what has come to be
considered the nation's greatest work of either public or funerary
art: Maya Lin's Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One indication of how great a shock Vietnam posed to the
American imagination is that the predominant cultural response to
the war initially took the form of journalism, rather than
literature or film. Just as the debate over the war did so much to
create a culture of protest in the United States during the second
half of the '60s, so did the reporting from Vietnam during the
first half of the decade by such journalists as Neil Sheehan, David
Halberstam (both of whom later wrote important books about the
war), and Peter Arnett do so much to frame the terms of that
debate.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because they shared its views, writers and filmmakers
initially focused more on the peace movement than the war proper.
Norman Mailer's account of the 1967 March on the Pentagon, ``The
Armies of the Night'' (1968), was an enormous critical and popular
success, for example, and Arlo Guthrie's ``Alice's Restaurant'' was
first an LP recording (1967), then a film (1969).
</P>
<P>
   Opposition to the war in cultural circles was very nearly
unanimous. Those few figures who did support US involvement, such
as the novelists John Steinbeck and Jack Kerouac, found themselves
ostracized. When John Wayne directed and starred in an
unapologetically hawkish adaptation of Robin Moore's best-selling
novel ``The Green Berets'' (1968), the film was ferociously
attacked (which didn't prevent it from pulling in the year's
tenth-best grosses).
</P>
<P>
   Even those books and films that were seen as the most eloquent
statements about the war addressed it indirectly. Such Vietnam-era
touchstones as Joseph Heller's ``Catch-22'' (1961) and Kurt
Vonnegut's ``Slaughterhouse Five'' (1969), or the films ``Bonnie
and Clyde'' (1967), ``MASH'' and ``Little Big Man'' (both 1970)
were all ostensibly about other subjects and other wars.
</P>
<P>
   Seen from a practical standpoint, this made perfect sense. How
could products of the imagination compete with the reality of the
Mekong Delta? More than just a theater of war, Vietnam was itself a
kind of theater _ a point made explicitly and stirringly by the
Wagner-scored helicopter assault in ``Apocalypse Now.'' Vietnam,
Michael Herr writes in ``Dispatches'' (1977), ``was a place where
no drama had to be invented, ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen-thousand miles from home, it provided a stunningly
exotic setting, at once gorgeous and menacing (``The land is your
true enemy,'' a Viet Cong major tells a squad of American soldiers
in Tim O'Brien's novel, ``Going After Cacciato''). This war, more
than any before, turned the surreal into the mundane, and vice
versa, something most memorably depicted in the writing of Herr and
O'Brien.
</P>
<P>
   The war coined its own language _ ``grunt,'' ``frag,'' ``DMZ,''
``fire base'' _ words of shocking force and rude vigor that no
dramatist could have bettered. ``Beware of having too good a
speechwriter,'' Frances FitzGerald once wrote of John F. Kennedy's
role in US involvement, ``_ your phrases may be remembered.'' It
was only fitting that this least heroic of wars should be more
memorable for the language of its participants than the prose of
any of its writers.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, there was the music. The first war to come with its
own soundtrack, Vietnam was rock 'n' roll made flesh _ and blood.
Songs overtly about the war, either pro (like Barry Sadler's
``Ballad of the Green Berets,'' which sold 8 million copies in
1966) or con (Country Joe and the Fish's ``I-Feel-Like-I'm
Fixin'-to-Die Rag,'' released in 1967), were relatively few. It was
the sheer power of rock, the way it could simultaneously provoke
and console, be anthem and escape, that embedded it so deeply in
the experience of the war. Rock and the war ``had run power off the
same circuit for so long they didn't even have to fuse,'' Herr
writes. ``What I'd thought of as two obsessions were really only
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Seen in this light, Vietnam was nothing so much as the '60s'
ground zero (the war, not Altamont, was the other side of
Woodstock). It's no coincidence that the era's songs are integral
to so many Vietnam narratives.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially so for the movies: the Rolling Stones' ``Out
of Time'' in ``Coming Home'' (1978), the Doors' ``The End'' in
``Apocalypse Now,'' the Miracles' ``Tracks of My Tears'' in
``Platoon,'' the Stones' ``Paint It Black'' in ``Full Metal
Jacket'' (1987). Indeed, it's a mark of the anomalousness of ``The
Deer Hunter'' that its signature song should be a throwback like
Frankie Valli's ``Can't Take My Eyes Off You.'' That wasn't a
record likely to get banned from Armed Forces Radio Vietnam
(something that happened to the Animals' ``We Gotta Get Out of This
Place'').
</P>
<P>
   The most famous instance of how volatile could be the mixture of
Vietnam and music came two decades after the Tonkin Gulf
Resolution, when the title and driving beat of Bruce Springsteen's
``Born in the USA'' led Ronald Reagan to try to appropriate it for
his reelection bid in 1984. In fact, the lyrics were not about
morning in America, but mourning:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Had a brother at Khe Sanh
</P>
<P>
   fighting off the Viet Cong
</P>
<P>
   They're still there, he's all gone
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(end poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In meaning, if not mood, Springsteen's song would seem more at
home in the mid-'70s, which saw the cultural peak of disgust with
the war. Representative works include Robert Stone's novel ``Dog
Soldiers'' (1974); Gloria Emerson's book of reportage ``Winners and
Losers'' and Ron Kovic's autobiography, ``Born on the Fourth of
July'' (both 1976); and ``Coming Home,'' which won an Academy Award
for Jane Fonda, whose forceful opposition to the war had earned her
the sobriquet ``Hanoi Jane.''

 UNDATED: ... ``Hanoi Jane.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet that same Oscar ceremony heralded a new era in the cultural
response to the war. That year's Best Picture winner was ``The Deer
Hunter.'' Michael Cimino's movie, with its story of three
steelworkers who fought in Vietnam, the effect the war had on their
lives, and, by extension, all American society, displayed an
unprecedented ambivalence to the war. The war itself was bad, the
film seemed to say, but America was not. In the context of the
times, this was a not-unexceptional point of view. Almost as
controversial as the film's xenophobic portrayal of the Vietnamese
and its use of Russian roulette as a plot device, was its ending
with an unironic rendition of ``God Bless America.''
</P>
<P>
   If for no other reason, ``The Deer Hunter'' has a crucial place
in the war's cultural legacy because it was after seeing Cimino's
film that Vietnam veteran Jan Scruggs was moved to begin a campaign
for a memorial to those who had served in the war. And with the
dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, in 1982, the cultural
climate surrounding the war changed decisively.
</P>
<P>
   ``The minute that wall went up,'' says Sandra M. Wittman, author
of ``Writing About Vietnam: A Bibliography of the Literature of the
Vietnam Conflict,'' ``it was like permission was given. What had
been a trickle (of memoirs) turned into a flood. The men who had
been over there just seemed to have a need to describe their
experiences, and it hasn't stopped.''
</P>
<P>
   Oral histories became the predominant Vietnam genre, letting the
men (and women) who had fought in the war tell their own stories.
Titles include Mark Baker's ``Nam'' (1981), Al Santoli's
``Everything We Had'' (1981), Wallace Terry's ``Bloods'' (1984),
Bernard Edelman's collection ``Dear America: Letters Home from
Vietnam'' (1985), and Kathryn Marshall's ``In the Combat Zone''
(1987).
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood played as great a part, or greater, in the emerging
cult of the Vietnam veteran. For years, the movies had demonized
the vet as, in John Baky's description, ``a drug-crazed,
psychopathic, irreparable shell of a man.'' Where the grunt had
been portrayed as victimized by the war, the vet was seen as
contaminated by it _ and in turn contaminating society back home.
</P>
<P>
   In the early '80s, that changed, with a vengeance. The vet was
now lionized, and none more than those who were, or had been,
prisoners of war or missing in action. The POWs and MIAs were
modern-day martyrs _ better than that, they were martyrs who could
be rescued from their martyrdom. Yes, we had lost the war, such
movies as ``Uncommon Valor'' (1983), ``Missing in Action'' (1984),
and ``Rambo'' seemed to say, but now we could redeem our defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, do we get to win this time?'' Sylvester Stallone's Rambo
asks his former commmanding officer. ``This time it's up to you.''
</P>
<P>
   It was geopolitical wish fulfillment at its most potent,
pernicious, and popular (the consistent success of these films at
the box office suggest just how compelling was the fantasy of
redemption and rematch that underlay them).
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam veterans began to turn up as central characters _
attractive, engaging characters _ on prime-time television: Tom
Selleck in ``Magnum P.I.'' (1980-88), the members of ``The A Team''
(1983-87). By the end of the decade, the war had become a
safe-enough subject for the networks to devote a pair of dramas to
it: ``Tour of Duty'' (1987-90) and ``China Beach'' (1988-91).
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, the war was fodder to be turned into a Broadway musical
spectacular _ complete with its helicopter _ courtesy of ``Miss
Saigon,'' with its Indochinese updating of ``Madame Butterfly.''
Four years later, it provided ``Forrest Gump'' with a plot device
to get Tom Hanks out of the South and into the path of history.
True, his best friend (Mykelti Williamson) dies and his commanding
officer (Gary Sinise) loses both legs, but Forrest wins the Medal
of Honor and a happy ending is guaranteed. It's Classic History
plotting in tandem with the movie's Classic Hits soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, the most shocking thing in ``Pulp Fiction'' was
how it went out of its way to defile the mythic status of the POW,
courtesy of a scatalogical shaggy-dog story delivered by none other
than Christopher Walken, whose harrowing portrayal of an AWOL GI
lost in Saigon in ``The Deer Hunter'' had won him a Best Supporting
Actor Oscar. Ten, or even five years earlier, Walken's monologue
would have elicited outrage. It was at once a sign of how firmly
established the war remained in popular culture _ and how drained
of controversy it had become.
</P>
<P>
   Then the release the next year of ``Operation Dumbo Drop''
(1995) erased any doubts. The war had become a Disney comedy,
literally as well as figuratively, in which a Special Forces team
bends the rules to airlift an elephant to a Vietnamese village.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one can dispute the rightness of what you're doing,'' Gene
Hackman had told his band of fellow veterans about to rescue a
group of MIAs held captive by the Vietnamese in ``Uncommon Valor.''
So, too, with the Green Berets in ``Operation Dumbo Drop.'' The
wheel had completely turned. Not even John Wayne, at his most
patriotically perfervid, could have imagined such a thing.

 HANOI: ... exporter today.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In December of 1986 the government _ prodded by Mikhail
Gorbachev's early reforms in the Soviet Union and believing its
rice success could be applied to other economic problems _
announced a new policy of Doi Moi, or renovation. The reforms,
sometimes called ``Market Leninism,'' were still more Lenin than
market, but for a communist state, still significant.
</P>
<P>
   While Doi Moi has been popular as far as it's gone, the
Communist Party remains in power largely on the strength of its
improbable victories over the French and the Americans, wars always
framed as glorious struggles against invading foreigners. The party
is still linked to nationalism.
</P>
<P>
   But relatively few Vietnamese find it necessary to be
card-carrying party members any more. Most who do live in and
around Hanoi. Nationwide, only about 2 million belong, out of a
population of 77 million, and in Ho Chi Minh City, less than two
percent do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Doi Moi reforms and a more consumer-oriented society have
made people less reliant on the state and made it less relevant.
There's a growing sense of disconnect between the government and
its people _ especially the majority under 25. The generation gap
between the populace and the aging Politburo, most of whom are in
their '60s, is substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-five percent of the population is under 40, and the
other 15 percent, their whole lives were war,'' said Peterson.
``They had no clue that while they were under the rock, the world
redefined independence to interdependence. But that 15 percent
controls the government.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Cold War-era passions have cooled, some in the Politburo
still believe there is a malevolent, Western (read American) plot
afoot called ``peaceful evolution'' bent on using a market
econonmy, and degenerate cultural influences to undermine
Vietnamese society _ to achieve in peace what it could not in war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a highly spirited phrase (that) they've concluded is our
policy,'' said Peterson.``It is not. Our objective is for Vietnam
to be successful economically. We don't care what form of
government they have.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the leading believers in the grand conspiracy of peaceful
evolution is party apparatchik Quat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an attempt to damage socialism without waging war,''
he said. ``Our policy is to protect national independence and to
protect socialism. They are trying to change our political system
without waging the war.''
</P>
<P>
   Quat said the textbook for peaceful evolution is ``1999: Victory
Without War'' _ by Richard Nixon. This book, published in 1988,
before the fall of the Soviet Union, is a treatise on managing
conflict by projecting economic power, military toughness, and
ideological appeal. Pressed on who precisely was waging the
peaceful evolution campaign, Quat said he wasn't specifically
accusing the United States, ``just a scheme of imperialist
elements.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, when the Doi Moi reforms had been implemented and
free-market buds were starting to bloom, foreign investors _ led by
Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Australia, and France _
began flocking to Vietnam with visions of riding the next ``tiger''
economy in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Momentum built through the early '90s, powered by the United
States' lifting of its trade embargo with Vietnam in 1994, and a
subsequent increase in aid from the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund. In 1995, Washington and Hanoi restored
full diplomatic relations, and by 1996, foreign investment had
reached its peak of $8.6 billion, about a third of Vietnam's gross
domestic product. In the mid '90s, Vietnam had the fastest-growing
economy in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Though ostensibly hungry for foreign investment, Hanoi shot
itself in the foot in 1996. Wary of creeping Westernization, the
government ordered billboards advertising such products as Coca
Cola and Heineken beer taken down, and decreed that on all signs,
English words could not be larger than Vietnamese words.
</P>
<P>
   The antibillboard campaign shook the confidence of foreign
investors who were already tiring of corruption, red tape, and the
lack of any coherent legal structure. More recently, the
government's continued refusal to sign a key trade agreement with
the United States, and its announcement of a reduction in the work
week from 48 to 40 hours, have also been deemed bad omens by
investors. So the exodus has continued and by 1999, foreign
investment had plunged to $1.6 billion. Even less is expected this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Looming large, as ever here, is China, though now more as an
economic than a security threat. As Vietnam's attractiveness to
foreign investors diminishes, China's grows, especially with its
likely entry into the World Trade Organization. China is such a
huge market, Vietnam risks becoming less relevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``China is big competition for us and to developing countries,''
said Pham Chi Lan, executive vice president of the Vietnam Chamber
of Commerce and Industry, a quasi government agency which provides
training to the state's embryonic private sector. ``If we are
slower than they are in accessing markets, it will be an
opportunity lost for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's wistful plea that Vietnam no longer be
considered ``just a war, but a country'' seems to have been at
least partially heard. In the '90s, Vietnam became a trendy tourist
destination for backpack pioneers in search of adventure,
twenty-somethings looking for the next Prague, and Americans on
nostalgia trips searching for the real ``Nam.'' In addition, the
movie ``Indochine'' _ with its luminous photography and glamorous
rendering of the French colonial heyday _ is widely credited with
giving tourism here a shot in the arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1990s, Vietnam was attracting a new generation of
fantasists and dreamers,'' wrote Robert Templer in ``Shadows and
Wind,'' a book on contemporary Vietnam published in 1998. ``The new
arrivals were looking to wallow in nostalgia for places and times
that had never been. They were drawn by their visions of
`Indochine' and `Nam,' the mythical landscapes of the West's past
interactions with Vietnam. . .Vietnam in the 1990s is not just
exotic, it is stylish. . . . It is the place to be if you are young
and adventurous and have a trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
   But mixed in with the exotica are the modern realities of
overcrowding, poverty, pollution, and unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   With 77.3 million people, Vietnam is the 14th most populous
country in the world. It is also the most densely populated in
Southeast Asia with 205 people per square kilometer, twice the
region's average. With virtually no more land in the countryside to
farm on, and few non-farming jobs in rural areas, people are
flocking to the major cities for work. The average per capita
annual income nationally is $376, according to the World Bank. In
Hanoi, population 3 million with 10 percent unemployed, the average
annual wage is about $900. In Ho Chi Minh City, with 5 million
people and 7 percent out of work, it is $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   When the communists took over Saigon in 1975, cars and
motorcycles were banned and only bicycles were permitted, Hanoi-
style. Now there are 2million motorcycles and about 50,000 cars
back in the city, the din from motors and horns is constant, the
pollution sometimes overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   For the uninitiated, crossing the street in Ho Chi Minh City
seems like a life-or-death experience. With no stop lights to speak
of and no let-up in the constant stream of traffic, you can wait
all day to cross a major street. So a leap of faith is required:
You plunge in and let them avoid you, rather than vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Other lasting images of Ho Chi Minh City: people exercising at
city parks in the early-morning darkness to beat the 90-degree
heat; cyclists wearing masks to fight back the noxious fumes; the
scores of people who line up every work day for visas in front of
the US Consulate; creeping Westernization at places like ``The
Super Bowl'' a tacky strip mall featuring a 32-lane bowling alley,
a Kentucky Fried Chicken, a supermarket and an arcade; and cranes
suspended over half-completed office towers and hotels abandoned
with the fleeing foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
   Hanoi, long the far quieter refuge of Vietnam's Marxist
mandarins, is becoming more like Ho Chi Minh City every day, with
growing traffic and commerce. What was once one of the most closed
cities on the planet has become an eclectic mix of old-world
communist kitsch, lingering French colonial charm, and jarring
Western openness.
</P>
<P>
   Last July, after three years of negotiations, the United States
and Vietnam agreed in principle on a sweeping trade agreement that
would lower tariffs, and establish trade and investment standards
practiced in most countries. Vietnam is the only country with which
America has diplomatic relations but no normal trade relations. The
agreement would make it easier for American firms to do business
here, and easier for Vietnamese companies to access US markets.
Vietnam's $470 million in exports to the United States would double
under a trade agreement.
</P>

   A signed trade deal would be a milestone in Vietnam's flirtation
withthe free-market, and in its integration into the global
economy. But since reaching agreement in principle, Hanoi has
gotten cold feet and refused to sign the accord, explaining only
that the details need to be further studied.

 HANOI: ... further studies.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most Vietnamese insist they want the agreement, but many
American and Western observers are not so sure. They see Hanoi's
hesitation on the trade deal as a microcosm of the larger debate
the Politburo is having behind closed doors over how quickly to
expose the country to change, lest the fabric of traditional
Vietnamese society unravel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vietnam and the US are not negotiating a trade agreement,''
said Thomas J. Vallely, director of the Vietnam programs at Harvard
University's Institute for International Development. ``Vietnam is
negotiating a trade agreement with itself: One side wonders
(itals)whether(unitals) they should join the world economy, and the
other side wonders (itals)how(unitals) they should join the world
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen Minh Tu, director of the Central Institute for Economic
Management, a government think tank, insists Hanoi does want the
agreement. ``The United States is so important for Vietnam,'' he
said. ``Under the agreement, technology and management skills will
be transferred here, and we'll have access to the largest market in
the world. Relations between us are sensitive because of our common
history of the war. If economic relations are developed, it can
help develop friendship as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Vietnamese officials sound less certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the market economy is one of the big
achievements of human beings,'' said Quat, the central committee
spokesman. ``It creates a dynamism for people to be creative. But
on the other hand, when you don't manage it properly, it will
polarize society, create inequality and conditions for
individualization to develop. People may just rush out for money
without caring about larger moral values.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Bui Minh Phuong, chairman of the People's Committee in
Binh Duong province, near Ho Chi Minh City: ``We have to develop
this country with independence. We want slow but steady steps.
Vietnam won't sacrifice national independence for economic gain. We
have to strike that balance. It's difficult to find.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike Inc., the footwear colossus, serves as a case study of how
a trade deal would help both an American firm and Vietnam. Under a
trade pact, Nike, which produces 20 million pairs of shoes a year
at its five plants in Vietnam, would reduce its export duties from
20 percent to 8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-five thousand people work for Nike in Vietnam, making it
the largest private employer in the country.It exports $450 million
worth of merchandise a year, and pays an average base salary of $55
a month, compared to $18 a month for the employees of state-owned
enterprises. A company spokesman, Chris Helzer, said that if the
US-Vietnam trade agreement is implemented, Nike would hire 55,000
additional people in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential of foreign investment from the likes of
Nike, economists agree that if Vietnam is to make strides in the
free market, it is the domestic private sector which must grow.
</P>
<P>
   According to the World Bank, the country has 2 million
``micro-enterprises'' of one to three employees; 26,000 small
businesses of 5 to 10 employees, and fewer than 600 businesses with
more than 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign direct investment is important, but much more
important is how to increase that 26,000 to 260,000,'' said the
World Bank's director here, Andrew Steer.
</P>
<P>
   Vietnam's 6,000 state-owned enterprises serve as a significant
brake against the development of a market economy. They employ only
1.7 million people out of a workforce of 40 million, but they
control 70 percent of the natural and financial resources of the
country and have access to a disproportionate share of investment
capital. Only a third make a profit, while the rest require
government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the drag they place on the economy, the state-owned
enterprises are seen by officials as a vital tool in their
maintaining power _ and privileges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the Politburo now, the struggle is not so much about
ideology as about vested interests,'' said one prominent Vietnamese
banker, who asked not to be identified. ``The Communist Party is
funded by state-owned companies. The party can't pay its own
members, so if you remove the state-owned companies, the party
would lose its perks and benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Another liability to the economy is official corruption. Prodded
by widespread complaints from foreign investors and Vietnamese
alike, the government has cracked down on corruption, and there is
now a mandatory death sentence for those caught stealing more than
$27,000 from the state. At least 16 people had been sentenced to
death under the law as of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Tales of official corruption can now be found in Vietnam's
press, which has been granted more freedoms under Doi Moi. Official
organs like the Vietnam News remain, of course, with their turgid,
largely unreadable front-page accounts of visiting trade ministers
from Turkey, and the like. But scores of other newspapers have
sprung up in recent years that cover spicier staples like crime and
celebrities. There has been a tabloidization of the Vietnamese
press.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular paper in Vietnam by far, with a circulation of
500,000, is the Police Weekly, a paper published by the police
which takes no ads and writes only about crime. The police control
the release of all crime news, of course, so they make sure that
the Weekly gets a steady stream of scoops. The paper rails against
outbreaks of so-called social evils like prostitution, drugs,
gambling, and pornography, at the same time assuring readers that
police have everything under control.
</P>
<P>
   There is no censorship office, as such, where stories must be
cleared before publication. But editors of all the newspapers are
required to be party members, and there is self-censorship.
</P>
<P>
   Along with some latitude for the press, the communist
government, traditionally hostile to religion, has permitted a
modest revival of spiritual life. Most Vietnamese practice forms of
Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, or ancestor worship, and there are
an estimated 7 million Catholics. Despite allowing some new
freedoms, Hanoi still associates religion with superstition, and
views it as a tool of ``peaceful evolution.'' Officials monitor all
religions carefully, especially Catholicism.
</P>
<P>
   The regime also keeps a watchful eye on Vietnam's exiles. More
than 1 million people fled the country after the fall of Saigon in
1975 and in succeeding years. Now there are about 2.5 million
Vietnamese living overseas, nearly half in the United States, the
rest mostly in France, Canada, and Australia. The overseas
Vietnamese, or Viet Kieu, as they are known here, annoy Hanoi with
their anticommunist fervor. But even in their absence they are an
important economic engine for the country and they are allowed to
return _ provided they don't cause any political problems.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nguyen Viet Thuan, vice chairman of the Ho Chi Minh
City Committee for Overseas Vietnamese, last year alone the Viet
Kieu sent $1.3 billion back through banks, almost all of it
concentrated in and around Ho Chi Minh City. He said 300,000
visiting exiles last year spent an average of $1,000 each, and
often more using their credit cards. The exiles account for about
half of domestic private investment in Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We encourage them to come back and live, as well as do
business here,'' Thuan said. ``We are willing to create favorable
conditions for them to return. They are an integral part of
Vietnam. One of our purposes is to help them understand that
Vietnam has changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such efforts to reach out, Thuan estimates that only
5,000 Viet Kieu have moved back to the country since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Some who are returning are young people like David Thai in
search of their roots. Born in Saigon in 1972, the son of a Frog
Team member of the US Special Forces, Thai left the country with
his family in 1974. He grew up in California and Seattle,
eventually graduating from the University of Washington. Majoring
in Asian-American studies, Thai grew more curious about his native
country and decided to spend part of his senior year in Hanoi on an
exchange program. Soon, he had opened a cafe on a lake in the heart
of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, I'd never talked with my parents about the country
and I spoke only rudimentary Vietnamese,'' Thai said. ``What I
found was that Vietnam had evolved. The Viet Kieus were stuck in a
time warp. . . . Everything I thought I'd learned was 180 degrees
from what I saw and experienced. I was told growing up that Hanoi
was evil, they wore black masks, and carried AK-47s. But they were
people, and they were welcoming. Now my best friend is from Hanoi.
I can't explain it, but I fell in love with Vietnam. Everyone in
the States felt I'd lost it.''
</P>
<P>
   On a visit home, Thai, 27, asked his father to set up a meeting
with a group of exiles. By the end of the meeting, the exiles were
asking him what opportunities there were for them in Vietnam. Thai
now lives in Ho Chi Minh City, where he has launched a successful
coffee export business.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can send a message back home to the Viet Kieus,'' Thai
said, ``it would be, `Don't knock it till you try it. Give it a
chance. It's so much a part of you.' ''

<TEXT>
<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY _ The helicopter that took me away from Saigon
rose from the compound of the American Embassy in a sudden squall.
I could see below me panicked masses in the rain-washed streets
desperate to get away. To the north, ammunition dumps were blowing
up and fires raged in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   We crossed the coast in the gathering dark where an American
fleet lay waiting offshore to receive us. South Vietnamese
helicopters, like butterflies borne on an offshore wind, landed
briefly on the ships before being tossed overboard to make room for
more, or, as if exhausted, fell into the sea themselves. What
happened to their crews I do not know.
</P>
<P>
   All about us in the darkness were the flotillas of overcrowded
boats _ the first hemorrhaging of Vietnamese that would grow to
more than a million in the years to come. It was April, 29, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   America's last day in Vietnam began with the sound of artillery
shells bursting in the city. There had been weeks of rising tension
as the South Vietnamese Army disintegrated before a North
Vietnamese offensive, and this time there were no American troops,
planes, or even advisors to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Unparalleled scenes of panic had unfolded in the northern cities
with hundreds trying to claw their way aboard the last departing
boats and planes, some even hanging onto the wheels of aircraft as
the debacle spread south.
</P>
<P>
   On little transistor radios that reporters had, we could hear
the communication traffic between the American Embassy and the
airport. ``Tan Son Nhut (airport) being heavily shelled,'' said a
voice. ``Four rounds in five seconds on the flight line.'' Two US
Marines from the embassy had been killed: Corporal Darwin Judge and
Corporal Charles McMahon, the last Americans to die in the Vietnam
War. The first had been Lieutenant Colonel Peter Dewey, an officer
in the OSS, who was ambushed trying to reach this same airport in
1945.
</P>
<P>
   In the last weeks of April 1975, Americans and Vietnamese who
worked for them had been flying out of the city to Guam, to the
Philippines. Now those flights would end and the only way out would
be by helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   All Americans had been issued a map with instructions telling
them where to report ``should it be felt necessary for US personnel
to report to their designated assembly areas. . . .'' The word
``evacuation'' was never mentioned in the instructions. We were
told to keep tuned to the radio for a weather report announcing:
``105 degrees and rising,'' which would be followed by 30 seconds
of Bing Crosby singing ``White Christmas.'' This would be the
signal to report to designated areas and await the helicopters. I
never heard the signal nor met anyone who ever did.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to go to the embassy, where, during the day,
surrealistic scenes would unfold, with hundreds, perhaps thousands,
of Vietnamese clamoring at the gates to be let in, and the embassy
staff shredding documents and burning money, lest it fall into
enemy hands.
</P>
<P>
   When the helicopters arrived, the wind from their rotors sent
shredded secrets bursting from their bags and flying over the walls
into the city that was about to be abandoned. It was clear by
afternoon that not all the Vietnamese that had been compromised by
working for the Americans were coming with us. The knowledge of the
coming betrayal kept many eyes averted. Many Vietnamese left behind
would spend up to 20 years in concentration camps being
``reeducated''; many would die of neglect and malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   At first the city seemed not to realize what was going on, but
as afternoon came, word spread and Saigon began to seethe with the
rolling-eyed fear of animals caught in a burning barn. The crowds
outside the embassy increased while American Marine guards beat
back those who tried to climb over the wall, heedless of the barbed
wire. As if from drowning passengers around a sinking ship, a
moaning clamor arose outside the compound as the Vietnamese outside
saw the helicopters come and go without them.
</P>
<P>
   Cobra gunships swooped over the rooftops, ready to fire if the
evacuation was impeded, but except for a few shots fired by angry
South Vietnamese soldiers, the evacuation went on without hindrance
and none of the helicopters was lost.
</P>
<P>
   Later that evening, US Ambassador Graham Martin would arrive
aboard a rescue ship by helicopter with his dog, which he had taken
pains to rescue, and the following morning, North Vietnamese tanks
would crash through the gates of Saigon's presidential palace. The
30-year war was over.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HANOI _ At certain times and in certain places, Vietnam's
capital still feels like a Cold War bunker. Vladimir Ilyich Lenin
himself looms over a small park in the center of Hanoi.
Street-corner loudspeakers play tinny music and blare out official
pronouncements. Posters and banners exhort apple-cheeked workers to
give their all for the national communist good.
</P>
<P>
   But walk a block or two and you will pass such emblems of
capitalism as a branch of the Bank of America, a store selling TV
satellite dishes, and a travel agency advertising a 12-day Las
Vegas getaway for $2,199. There are even Internet Cafes.
</P>
<P>
   Lenin and Las Vegas _ communism and capitalism _ live side by
side in modern Vietnam. It is not always an easy coexistence, but
even diehard Marxists here believe there is no other choice. The
challenge for the regime a quarter century after its army drove out
the most powerful capitalist country on earth is to change, to
embrace market reforms, but in doing so, not to lose control.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to stay in its cocoon in the post-communist, Internet
age, Hanoi has been forced to dip its toe in free-market waters and
is grappling with such heretofore heretical concepts as
competition, private banking, marketing, free trade, and foreign
investment. It's even considering launching a stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But all this change and looking ahead doesn't mean Vietnam won't
look back with pride on a day like today, the 25th anniversary of
the fall of Saigon, now called Ho Chi Minh City.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have won two wars against the foreign aggressors,'' said
Dao Duy Quat, the throwback spokesman for the Central Committee of
the Communist Party. ``It's a big achievement for the nation. The
celebration will be to encourage the people in the transformation
of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   For US officials here, however, today is nothing to dwell on.
``As far as I'm concerned, it's a non-event,'' said Douglas
``Pete'' Peterson, the American ambassador and former Air Force
pilot who was a prisoner of war in Hanoi for six and a half years.
``We're more focused on the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson's vision of Vietnam's future and Quat's notion of his
country's transformation are melding in ways that would have been
unthinkable just a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Hanoi live comfortably with the relics of a war
that touched almost every family in the country. On a lake in the
city is a plaque marking the spot where Senator John McCain was
shot down on Oct. 26, 1967, then captured and made a prisoner of
war for over five years. The plaque reads: ``The Army and the
people of Hanoi captured alive the criminal John Sidney McCain of
the American Air Force, pilot of an A4 plane that was shot down.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the seedy and fraying Army Museum with signs
posted in indifferent English, (``downstairs and right for more
watching'') and the wreckage of a B-52 sticking out of a lake in
the Ngoc Ha section of the city.
</P>
<P>
   A part of the famed Hoa Lo Prison, better known to Americans as
the Hanoi Hilton, still stands next to a new apartment and office
complex. The developers were going to level all of the prison,
until Vietnamese veterans objected because many of them did time
there too under French colonial rule.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, murals depict imprisoned revolutionaries, and a plaque
tells how more than 100 of them pulled off a daring escape through
the city sewers in 1945.
</P>
<P>
   As for Americana, there are selected photos of the US prisoners
with captions again written in slapdash English. One shows McCain,
Peterson, and three others with this comment: ``Though having
committed untold crimes on our people, but American pilots suffered
no revenge once they were captured and detained.'' McCain, now back
in Hanoi to mark the 25th anniversary, would take issue with that,
having recounted the severe beatings he experienced at the hands of
his captors.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it is clear that the war is receding in the minds
of the Vietnamese as much as in the minds of Americans. For half
the country born after 1975, the war is largely an irrelevant
mystery, and most older people seem ready to turn the page. The
government generally is too, but it still takes great pride in
displaying various monuments, museums, and shrines to its glorious
victory over America.
</P>
<P>
   With detente, however, Hanoi is toning down its rhetoric. For
example, it has decided on increasingly benign names for the war
museum in Ho Chi Minh City. Once known as the Museum of American
War Crimes, it evolved into the Museum of War Crimes and is now
merely the Museum of War Remnants.
</P>
<P>
   A mural outside the museum depicts Americans inflicting murder
and mayhem. Inside, there are photographs of US soldiers torturing
Vietnamese during interrogations, holding them down, wrapping
towels around their heads, then pouring water over the towel. Other
photos show a Vietnamese prisoner being pushed to his death from an
airborn American helicopter, and a GI carrying a head and torso. A
US Army recruiter would blanch here. It's not exactly ``Be all that
you can be'' stuff.
</P>
<P>
   In the large courtyard outside the museum, visiting
schoolchildren laugh and climb on captured American tanks as if
they were on a jungle gym. They swing from cannons as if they were
trapezes.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour's drive northwest, there are similar interplays of
mirth and reflection, as visitors explore the famed caves of Cu
Chi. Perhaps the foremost symbol of Vietnamese perseverance and
tenacity, the 150-mile network of tunnels in Cu Chi was used by the
Viet Cong as a base from which to wreak havoc on the US 25th
Infantry Division headquartered there. The tunnels, once top
secret, are now proudly on display as a tourist site.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Vietnamese children are taken to Cu Chi to learn
about the legendary deeds of their forebears. Tourists come too.
Tours begin with a propaganda film in an open-air, thatched hut
featuring guerrilla mnanequins under a flag and picture of Uncle
Ho. The narrator calls Cu Chi ``a place of gentle and simple
peasants'' who were killed by ``ruthless'' American bombs. It shows
girl soldiers honored for being ``American killer heroes,'' and a
sign of the times saying that ``every house is responsible for
killing one American.''
</P>
<P>
   The first tunnel was built in 1948, and the network took 20
years to complete. Built on three levels, the caves are tight and
narrow, made for the slight Vietnamese. But some have been enlarged
for any adventurous American tourist who cares to brave bats and
crawl around in the dirt on all fours. Inside the tunnels are such
attractions as a surgical room, a VC meeting room, and a banquet
room.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, there's an exhibit of various booby traps used against
US soldiers, displayed in front of a 50-foot-long mural showing
hapless Americans getting ensnared. Visitors complete the tour by
going to a firing range where they can pick up a captured M-16 and
squeeze off a few rounds into the bush.
</P>
<P>
   After fighting wars almost nonstop for 45 years, it is really
only in the last decade that Vietnam has come up for air, opened
its doors to the world, and had time to dwell on issues like its
economy. There was the revolution of 1945 and the subsequent
nine-year struggle against the French; the American war lasted
until 1975; then came the invasion and occupation of Cambodia from
1978-1989, sandwiched around a border mini-war with China in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   According to government figures, 1.1 million North Vietnamese or
Viet Cong soldiers died in the French and American wars alone, and
2 million civilians were killed. The United States lost some 58,000
servicemen in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The period between the end of the American war in 1975 and 1985
is known in Vietnam as ``the 10 dark years'' because it was
dominated by continued war, the often harsh melding of North and
South Vietnam _ notably in ``reeducation camps'' _ and widespread
hunger.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the hunger was caused when the state botched the buying
and distribution of rice, the staple of Vietnamese society. Grain
stockpiles were allowed to waste or spoil, and output fell sharply.
There was rationing and hyperinflation.
</P>
<P>
   So in 1986, in a major departure from socialist orthodoxy, Hanoi
acknowledged that running farms as collectives had failed, and for
the first time it allowed farmers to buy or lease the land they
farmed, then keep and sell what they harvested. Production has
risen steadily ever since, and Vietnam has gone from being an
importer of rice 15 years ago to becoming the world's second
largest exporter today.

HARVARD TEACHES CAPITALISM TO THE CADRES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, April 30)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BEN BRADLEE JR.  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY _ As Vietnam tries to stoke its fledgling
private sector while remaining a one-party Communist state, Harvard
University has emerged as an important player in coaxing Hanoi into
the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's Institute for International Development runs the
Fulbright Economics Teaching Program in Ho Chi Minh City, teaching
applied economics to government officials and the leaders of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   It is part of the international exchange program started by the
late Senator J. William Fulbright, an early opponent of US
involvement in Vietnam. Established in 1995, the Fulbright program
here is sponsored by the State Department, and its $1.5 million
annual budget is funded by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   At the Fulbright center, located downtown near the headquarters
of the Communist Party, loyal cadres learn about capitalism. In
another bit of irony, many of the 55 students who pass through the
program each year live in an adjacent dormitory that was
headquarters for American nurses in the war years.
</P>
<P>
   The government donated land for the new center, which consists
of three classrooms, a library, a computer lab, a student study
area, and offices, all encircling a courtyard. The faculty is made
up of 10 foreigners and 14 Vietnamese, plus a group of tutors and
translators. They use a team-teaching approach, in which courses
are taught in English by American and Vietnamese instructors, with
translators on standby. when needed. There are lectures, case
studies, and group discussions. The curriculum is ideologically
neutral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since economic reform is by definition a process of
decentralization, helping people at the local levels develop an
ability to analyze and then create sound policy is critically
important,'' said Lora Sabin, the program's academic director, who
is from Watertown, Mass. ``Also, by bringing Americans and
Vietnamese together in a learning environment, the program helps
heal the wounds of war, and helps Americans to see the Vietnamese
as people, just like us. This might, after all, be the most
important thing we do.''
</P>
<P>
   The government here, still wary of official Washington, is
enthusiastic about its ties with Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program helps fill an important need in Vietnam's
development,'' said Dao Cong Tien, vice president of Vietnam
National University here, which has a cooperation agreement with
Harvard. ``By providing high-quality educational opportunities for
Vietnam's midlevel managers, the Fulbright program helps develop a
core of managers capable of working in a fast-growing market
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Students say they like the hands-on methodology of the program,
the individual attention, and the breadth of the curriculum.
``There are subjects offered in this program, like micro and macro
economics, that I haven't had a chance to study before in any
depth,'' said Kim Phuong, 42, a lecturer at the College of
Economics. ``This is the basis of knowledge I need to develop my
area of study.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fulbright program, besides being funded by Congress, has
also been endowed by the Ford Foundation, Nike, and Arnold Hiatt's
Stride Rite Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most interesting thing about the program is that it has an
enormous amount of political independence inside a country that's
very closed,'' said Thomas J. Vallely, director of Vietnam programs
for HIID. ``It's a school about globalization. Castro wouldn't go
for this in 100 years. We teach open economies and how to manage
them. They're still confused in Hanoi about whether they want to
have an open economy or a closed one, but they allow us to teach
about an open one.''

<P>
   PHNOM PENH _ Cambodia and Laos were the stepchildren of the
Indochina wars, dragged into the all-consuming flame.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the Cambodian capital the schoolhouse called Toul Sleng
is kept as a monument of Man's inhumanity to man.
</P>
<P>
   For Tuol Sleng was a Khmer Rouge torture chamber in which
thousands were killed by a Communist movement more extreme than any
that had gone before. The blood stains on the floors of the
interrogation cells have faded now, but the crude instruments of
torture are still there, as they were when the Vietnamese invaded
in 1979. So are the rows and rows of photographs _ blank staring
faces of those who know they are about to be executed with
expressions of unspeakable sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, on April 17, 1975, the ill-conceived,
US-supported Khmer Republic, which had overthrown Prince Norodom
Sihanouk's neutral kingdom, collapsed after five years of fighting,
and Cambodia descended into a long night of horror.
</P>
<P>
   These once-bustling streets were emptied as the Khmer Rouge _ a
peasants' revolt led by Marxist school teachers _ turned Cambodia
into a vast slave labor camp. Normal family life ceased to exist,
young children were trained to spy and report on their elders, and
even the ability to read and write, if discovered, identified one
as a class enemy and was punishable by death. In Cambodia, Asian
Communism exceeded Mao Zedong's China in cruelty and national
self-destruction.
</P>
<P>
   During those spring days of 25 years ago, Phnom Penh and a few
smaller cities were completely surrounded by the armies of the
Khmer Rouge. It was a no-quarter war with even cases of cannibalism
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The Mekong River, by which little sand-bagged freighters used to
make their way up from the South China Sea, was closed to shipping
by rocket attacks from both banks. Occasionally the Khmer Rouge
would lob rockets into the refugee-swollen city, sometimes hitting
a crowded market or, on one memorable occasion, a schoolyard in
which, after a moment's silence following the initial blast, the
cries of children sounded like screaming birds.
</P>
<P>
   Phnom Penh never imagined what the Khmer Rouge had in store, and
there was little of the panic that Saigon experienced that very
same month of April in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   By 1979, the Vietnamese, who had grown tired of having their
borders attacked by Khmer Rouge, overran the country. But Cambodia
was to become Vietnam's Vietnam, and for 10 years the Vietnamese
were worn down by a guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
   As the Vietnamese withdrew, civil war continued between the
Vietnamese-installed government of Hun Sen and the
Chinese-supported Khmer Rouge allied with rightists and monarchist
elements supported by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   A peace treaty in Paris in 1991 was supposed to end the conflict
in Cambodia, and UN-supervised elections followed in 1993. Sihanouk
was restored as king, but the winners and losers who formed a
coalition government soon fell out and more fighting ensued. It was
not until a second election in 1998 that Cambodia finally settled
into a wary peace and began to recover.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny kingdom of Laos, up the Mekong from Cambodia, was also
supposed to be neutral. President Eisenhower had warned an incoming
John Kennedy that Laos would become a major crisis, but Kennedy
agreed to a neutrality that, in the end, nobody respected. The
Vietnamese communists needed the Ho Chi Minh trail in eastern Laos
for their war in the south, and the Americans responded by having
the CIA organize Hmong hill tribesmen to fight them. A twilight war
ensued in the mist-covered mountains while American planes based in
Thailand dropped thousands of tons of bombs over the trail.
</P>
<P>
   The 1973 peace accords, which were supposed to end the Indochina
war, created a coalition with the Laos Communists, but after Saigon
fell, Laos was taken over by the Communists without resistance. The
monarchy was abolished and those of the bourgeoisie who did not
flee to Thailand were sent to reeducation camps where many died of
disease and neglect. The king was also taken into custody and never
seen again.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Vietnamese political influence vies with Thai commercial
interest for dominance in Laos. It seems odd now that Laos would
ever have loomed as large as it did on the geopolitical stage. The
political rivalries of Laos that should have remained at the comic
opera level became infused with the politics of the East-West
rivalry.

   HUE _ This graceful city astride the Perfume River, just five
miles from the South China Sea, was once the imperial capital of
Vietnam before and during the French colonial period.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the 19th century, the Vietnamese emperors built a
palace here, a miniature copy of Beijing's. Before it stands a
fortress with an enormous flag pole flying the red banner and
yellow star of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two years ago, that banner represented only the Communist
North, and Hue belonged to the Republic of South Vietnam. But for
most of February 1968, the flag of North Vietnam hung limply from
this same pole in the drizzle of a Central Vietnamese winter, a
gesture of defiance against the Saigon government and the might of
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Tet Offensive, when the Communist forces attacked up
and down the country during an agreed-upon lunar new year truce.
</P>
<P>
   The South Vietnamese and the American command branded the attack
cowardly, but they had chosen to forget that one of Vietnam's
legendary heroes, Nguyen Hue, had similarly attacked a Mongol Army
from China during Tet, a route precipitated by the element of
surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere was the fighting more intense than in Hue. The North
Vietnamese contested every street and every block against the US
and South Vietnamese forces, which were supported by artillery, air
power, and even gunfire from ships at sea. All the while the flag
of North Vietnam flew above the city, a taunting symbol that the
American Marines longed to tear down.
</P>
<P>
   Here is how US Marine Corps Captain Myron Harrington recalled
the battle years later to Stanley Karnow for his book, ``Vietnam: A
History'': ``Sometimes (the enemy) were only 20 or 30 yards from
us. . . . After a while, survival was the name of the game as you
sat there in the semidarkness with the firing going on constantly,
like a rifle range. And the horrible smell. You tasted it in your
rations, as if you were eating death. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   I spent several days with Captain Harrington's company as a
reporter during the war. We had not seen urban fighting before.
Military engagements had been in the countryside among thatched-hut
villages and rice paddies, or in the rain forests and rubber
plantations. This was street fighting reminiscent of World War II.
Every advance was made over broken crockery, strewn furniture, and
rain-soaked belongings amid the crumpled masonry of once-solid
houses and the decomposing dead.

<P>
   The North Vietnamese understood the symbolic value of holding
Hue for as long as they could, despite their losses, but eventually
the Marines captured the city, replacing the flag of North Vietnam
with the old imperial yellow flag with the red stripes that
represented the Republic of South Vietnam. That flag would fly over
Hue for seven more years of war until the final collapse of the
South. But after Tet, the US essentially abandoned hope of winning
and began withdrawing its troops.
</P>
<P>
   I was shot before the Marines reached the flag pole, and did not
see the flag that flies there today torn down. I was carried to a
small helicopter pad outside the city and flown away with bullets
hitting the sides to a field hospital nearby. There I was left in
the rain with the other lightly wounded while the overworked
American surgeons practiced triage _ treating those who could be
saved first, making comfortable those who were going to die, and
leaving people like me for last. All about us lay the wounded _
Vietnamese and Americans, civilians and soldiers, some crying out
and others grimly silent. The surgeon who finally operated on me
was in a white-hot fury that the bombardment was causing so many
civilian casualties, and that Americans were being treated better
than the Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Today Hue bears little resemblance to the dust, cordite, and
death-filled city that I knew in those long days and nights. The
imperial palace has largely been restored. The red lacquer pillars
in the throne room, where US Marines hung their hammocks in another
hour of peril for Hue, now look as they must have when the last
emperor reigned. Vietnamese couples stroll hand in hand.
</P>
<P>
   New buildings have sprung up among the cleared rubble, and I
cannot now find the street on which Harrington's company took so
many casualties. I watch instead a Vietnamese film crew shooting a
scene on the palace grounds. An actress, dressed in a traditional
mandarin dress, is lip-synching a sentimental Vietnamese song.

the battle of Hue, and was later awarded a Bronze Star with a

   DANANG _ Few countries peoples have had their national character
formed by resistance to foreigners as have the Vietnamese. A
thousand years of Chinese occupation two millenniums ago, with
subsequent intrusions by Mongols, the Ming, and lastly by Deng
Xiaoping in 1979, provided the necessary fire to forge make an iron
will.
</P>
<P>
   Heroes and heroines who opposed foreign rule are all part of the
historical fabric of this country. Resistance leaders such as the
Trung sisters of AD 40, who committed suicide when their
anti-Chinese rebellion failed; Le Loi, who successfully led a
guerrilla war against the Ming in the 15th century; and Ho Chi
Minh, who first stood up to the French, then the Americans, are
seen by many Vietnamese as belonging to the same unbroken thread of
defiance towards foreign domination.
</P>
<P>
   Today's leaders don't like to admit that their struggle against
the Americans was part of a civil war that pitted north against
south as well as capitalism against communism. They prefer to see
it as having been an antiforeign struggle against the Americans, as
it had been against the French in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   But the north-south division is present even today in the minds
of many Vietnamese. In the 16th century there was a wall across
Vietnam, not far from where the demilitarized zone partitioned the
country at the 17th parallel from 1954-1975, behind which
northerners and southerners rallied against each other.
</P>
<P>
   The French in the 19th century divided the country into three
parts: Cochin China in the south, Annam in the center, and Tonkin
in the north. The first harbingers of European domination came in
the 18th century when Louis the XVI's adventurers planned a raid
here in Danang, which the French called Tourane, when France began
taking an interest in Vietnam as a gateway to China. Missionaries
had already spread the Catholic faith more than in any other Asian
country save the Philippines, providing France with an excuse to
intervene when Vietnamese rulers cracked down on Christians for
promoting foreign ideologies.
</P>
<P>
   Even the USS Constitution got involved when it sailed into this
bay in 1845. The captain took some Vietnamese mandarins prisoners
when he heard that a Catholic churchman was being held prisoner in
the capital, an incident for which Washington later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   In 1847 the French were back aboard the battleships Gloire and
Victorieuse to shoot up Danang and land troops as colonialism first
began in earnest. It was here, too, that the first US combat troops
_ as opposed to advisers _ came ashore in March of 1965 when the
United States decided to throw its full weight against the same
cause that defeated the French.
</P>
<P>
   Danang was the scene of an enormous military base in the '60s
and early '70s and the city groaned under the American presence.
Planes took off day and night for bombing runs, and from here the
Marines and Army fought the bloodiest battles of the war. After
1967, the year I first came to this region, more than half the
Americans who were killed in Vietnam would die in this northern
part of the Republic of South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Danang saw the mass panic of early 1975, when the morale of the
Saigon armies finally cracked and people fought with soldiers to
get onto planes and boats fleeing south.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, I saw mountains of scrap metal, the rusting
detritus of war from the armories of America, piled up on the docks
here, ready to be sold to the Japanese to make automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Today there is very little of the war left to be seen. Danang
has returned to being a pleasant city on the Han River. The bridge
to China Beach, where Marines and GIs spent their idle hours, is
now named for Nguyen Van Troi, the man who tried to assassinate
Robert McNamara on one of his trips to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The sparse, post-1975 Russian bungalow hotel on China Beach,
where Soviet workers who had exceeded their industrial quotas took
the place of American soldiers, has been torn down. It has been
replaced with the glamorous and decidedly unsocialist Furama Hotel
that would not be out of place in Palm Beach, complete with
Filipina waitresses and Belgian managers to cater to the growing
tourist trade of Japanese, Americans, and Europeans _ especially
the French, who are seeking the bygone and largely bogus glamour of
what was once called Indochine.

SHADOWS OF A DISTANT WAR

 (For release Sunday, April 30)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By H.D.S. GREENWAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe

<P>
   HO CHI MINH CITY _ I am a ghost wandering in this city, a shadow
of another time that ceased to exist a quarter century ago when the
last American helicopters rose up over the red roofs of this city
like departing souls in the death throes of the South Vietnamese
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Today Vietnam is a country again, not just a war, as the
government is fond of saying. More than half its population was not
born when the final US evacuation took place in 1975. So fast has
the population grown that no more than 15 percent could have
experienced the 30-year war that ended the French and then the
American effort here. As happens with ghosts, people passing on the
street cannot see my reflection.
</P>
<P>
   The American embassy building from which I hastily departed that
night 25 years ago has been razed. But the walls that surrounded it
are still in place, walls which thousands of terrified Vietnamese
tried to breach on that dreadful last day before the North
Vietnamese tanks entered the city. In 1968 a band of Viet Cong
managed to enter the embassy compound through these walls during
the great upheaval of the Tet Offensive _ the turning point of the
Vietnam war. Today a small US consulate sits on the grounds.
Diplomatic relations between a united Vietnam and the United States
were established in 1995, and these grounds once again belong to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The brown stream of the Saigon River is no longer filled with
vessels bringing war materials into a divided country. Armed
insurrection does not threaten the traveler on lonely roads as it
did during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this the sad town of the late '70s and early '80s when
the northerners imposed their harsh discipline on the people of the
south. North Vietnam was organized for war, like Sparta, but
incompetent and cruel in the first years of peace. Concentration
camps, which the Vietnamese said were for ``reeducation,'' bulged
with southerners who backed the losing side. And southern
revolutionaries would tell you of their bitterness against the
northerners who had shunted them aside in favor of their own in the
new order.
</P>
<P>
   In those postwar years these busy streets were silent as very
few people had either the money or the gasoline to drive a car or a
motor bike. The ``Amerasian'' kids, the product of GI liaisons, who
once hawked cigarettes on the streets _ despised by the Vietnamese
and abandoned by the Americans _ have now either been resettled in
the United States or grown up and disappeared into the population.
</P>
<P>
   The ships in the Saigon River right after the war were from the
Eastern Bloc, and the beefy Caucasians on the streets were
Russians. ``Lien Xo, Lien Xo,'' children would yell at you, meaning
Soviet Union. The Vietnamese called the Russians ``Americans
without money.''
</P>
<P>
   All of that has been swept away as Vietnam has backed away from
socialism, and the largest ship alongside the riverfront quay
recently was the cruise ship ``Astor,'' flying the flag of the
Bahamas and bearing Hawaiian-shirted tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Today Vietnam _ albeit less successfully than China _ is trying
to join the market economy, but cannot compete with its neighbors
because an aging and infinitely corrupt Communist Party is too
afraid of losing control to take the necessary steps.
</P>
<P>
   The streets today are noisy with motorbikes and cars. The old
Peugeots and Citroens of the '60s are gone, replaced by Japanese
cars and the occasional BMW. The two-wheeled Honda, however, is as
ubiquitous as it ever was, and shops bulge with commercial goods as
they once did during the wartime boom. Tall buildings are rapidly
replacing the graceful French villas. Consumerism is king and
people can do more or less what they want as long as they do not
criticize or threaten the party. Superficially, one has to wonder
which economic system won the war. The values of Sparta have
succumbed to those of late Rome. No one can tell me if the new Ngan
Dinh restaurant by the river where I am having lunch is housed in
the old French club, the Cercle Nautique of my memory. Everyone
working here is too young to know or care. My guide from the Saigon
Tourist agency _ few bother to call it Ho Chi Minh _ would rather
be in a Karaoke bar singing ``Yesterday'' or the theme from the
``Titanic,'' a film she has seen four times.
</P>
<P>
   People don't speak French as they did when I first came to live
here more than 30 years ago. Whereas the Vietnamese elite then sent
their children to French schools or to Paris, now the Communist
upper-strata study English and send their kids to the United
States, Canada, or Australia. France spends millions here trying to
promote the French language, but the people aren't buying. English
is the language of modernization, Vietnamese believe, and that's
what they want.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, American and South Vietnamese souvenirs of war
_uniforms, medals, insignias _could still be found in this city's
shops. Today there is much less of that, save for the ubiquitous
Zippo cigarette lighter. Zippos were what many GI's carried during
the war years, and today lighters, supposedly from the war era, are
to be found for sale on every corner with inscriptions such as
``Danang, 67-68'' and slogans: ``Let me in to heaven because I've
done my time in hell,'' and ``My business is killing and business
has been good.'' Almost all of these old-fashioned cigarette
lighters were made yesterday or the day before in a cottage
industry that has sprung up in peacetime Saigon. Wartime nostalgia
has become kitsch, with a restaurant called ``Miss Saigon'' and the
``Apocalypse Now'' bar.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Disney has triumphed here where William Westmoreland, the
American commander, could not. Plywood cutouts of Snow White and
Mickey Mouse are for sale everywhere as the cult spreads.
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of American War Crimes that I visited in 1985 is now
called the Museum of War Remnants, in a gesture of reconciliation,
but the pictures and exhibits are just as arresting: Vietnamese
being tortured and dragged behind armored personnel carriers. New
to the exhibit are expressions of regret from American veterans.
Sergeant William Brown of the 173d Airborne, for example, has
donated his bronze and silver stars, his Purple Heart, as well as
other decorations, to the museum with a note saying: ``I was wrong.
I am sorry. June 1, 1990.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't remember meeting Sergeant Brown, but I met many of his
colleagues and saw some of them die. In 1967 I spent Thanksgiving
with the 173d on a blasted hill known only by its height in meters,
857, near the Central Highland town of Dak To. They had 287
soldiers killed and more than 1,000 wounded trying to evict several
companies of North Vietnamese who had dug into carefully
constructed bunkers with interlocking fields of fire. The battle
was over on Thanksgiving Day, leaving a World War I-type landscape
of shell craters and shattered trees. Not all the wounded had been
evacuated yet, and some of the dead were being put in green rubber
bags. In one of those incongruities of the Vietnam War, the
military transported by helicopter turkey dinners to what remained
of the brigade on the hill with their gaunt faces and thousand-yard
stares. I tried to eat some but my appetite deserted me.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the 173d held services for their dead from Dak To the
boots of the dead men were arranged in formation on the ground,''
wrote Michael Herr in ``Dispatches,'' his classic book about the
war. ``It was an old paratrooper tradition, but knowing that didn't
reduce it or make it any less spooky, a company's worth of jump
boots standing empty in the dust taking benediction, while the real
substance of the ceremony was being bagged and tagged and shipped
back home. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   I have a cup of coffee at the old Majestic Hotel with Pham Xuan
An, my best friend in Vietnam from the days when we both covered
the war for Time magazine. After the war, An revealed that he had
been not only a journalist for the empire of Henry Luce, but a spy
for the Viet Cong with the rank of colonel. He is fond of
Americans, and retains many American friends. He just didn't think
they should be in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He is a gentle person. I used to bring him birds from the
markets of Bangkok. He allowed me to file the story of Saigon's
fall on the Time Inc. telex when I worked for the rival Washington
Post. He is a reminder to me of how much I saw of Vietnam, but how
little I understood.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago he was very bitter _ as so many southerners were _
at the way the northerners had treated him. An, despite being a
patriot who had put his life at risk more than once for the cause,
was sent to a mini reeducation camp to learn about Marxism. Today
he is philosophical, saying that by spending his days as a spy in
the south, he never had time, nor I suspect the interest, to learn
about Marxism. Today he is retired with the rank of brigadier
general.
</P>
<P>
   The fearsome reeducation camps are empty now, and many of the
Saigon soldiers _ for whom the new regime had few jobs _ have left,
either on parlous boats or in what was called the Orderly Departure
Program to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   There are monuments to the fallen Viet Cong and North Vietnamese
in towns up and down this country, and there is the black wall in
Washington to remember Americans who died here. But there is no
monument to the South Vietnamese soldiers who, although badly led,
died by the thousands, many of them bravely. Their war cemetery
outside town is overgrown with weeds and neglected. Their ghosts do
not rest. And neither do the hundreds of thousands on both sides
whose bones have never been found and whose spirits wander.
</P>
<P>
   In the countryside, where most of the war was fought, there is
peace now, and the bomb craters have softened into duck ponds. The
timeless rhythm of rice planting goes on as it always has. And the
farmers? I suspect, as Fowler told the American innocent Pyle in
Graham Greene's classic 1950s tale, ``The Quiet American'': ``They
want enough rice. They don't want to be shot at. They want one day
to be much the same as another. They don't want our white skins
aound telling them what they want.''
</P>

Vietnam regularly from 1967 to 1975 for Time magazine and then The
Washington Post. Since 1975, he has returned to the country six
times for the Globe.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It doesn't seem real that 40 years ago she
starred with Jack Lemmon and Shirley MacLaine in Billy Wilder's
``The Apartment,'' said Edie Adams, who will appear at Friday
night's gala showing of ``The Apartment'' at the Castro Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're very young, you don't think you're ever going to
get old, you think you're going to live forever,'' Adams said in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles. ``And it almost seems like
some of us do.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, whose age has been reported as 73, scoffs at that,
saying, ``I'm older than Madonna, younger than Katharine Hepburn.
At this age I can't jump up and sing those high C's, but there is
really no such thing as age.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only birthday that really bothered me was turning 30. You
get so trapped in this image of perfection. But I'm able to relax
now, don't have to be so perfect. I want to paint next. I want to
be George Burns when I grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   As Adams kicks off the 7 p.m. gala honoring ``The Apartment,''
complete with film clips, an autograph session and a greeting from
Lemmon, Wilder, 93, will remain in Westwood, at the apartment
building he has lived in for decades. Adams will offer a series of
songs, including her renowned Muriel cigar commercials, and footage
of TV shows with her comedian husband, Ernie Kovacs _ but she'll
miss having Wilder there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy can do no wrong as far as I'm concerned,'' Adams said.
``He was way ahead of everyone in his times. Look at `The
Apartment.' Corporate America was running things when he was taking
his shots at them. . . . I pulled down the script the other day and
it's every bit as effective today as it was then.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the movie . . . getting lost in that corporate
set, the size of a football field, shots of all these huge, block
buildings . . . and (Wilder) had this all in mind before putting
one word on paper. It was beautifully done.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was already edited down by the time it got on the page.
From the very first page I was amazed how carefully everything had
been written, the business of buttoning up the vest with one button
off . . . it was shot exactly as described, not like some lovely
accident.''
</P>
<P>
   To Adams, Wilder ``saw life as it was. He saw the humor of
everyday life. He put it into a movie and made everybody laugh and
say, `Yes, this is how it is.'''
</P>
<P>
   Adams talked of regular screenings at the Kovacs house on Broad
Beach, north of Malibu, with production heads like Sam Goldwyn
asking candidly what actors should be recruited for what roles.
``Here I was, getting to see all these first-run movies on our home
projection room, telling these studio heads `That's a terrible
idea' or `He's all wrong for that.' But I was always brought up to
say what I thought. I don't know if that was good or bad, but it's
what I've always done.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the days when Noel Coward would come by for dinner,
said Adams, to mix with a younger generation that ``tried to look
old and sophisticated and Noel Coward-ly. Not one of us wanted to
be a waif. We all wanted to be sophisticated, stylish.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilder's last picture, ``Buddy Buddy,'' was made 19 years ago,
finishing off a career that included four classics listed among the
American Film Institute's best 100 movies of all time _ ``Sunset
Boulevard'' at No. 12, ``Some Like It Hot'' at No. 14, ``Double
Indemnity'' at 38 and ``The Apartment'' at No. 93. But Wilder
acknowledged he never was able to recapture his creative spark
after ``The Apartment,'' saying, ``I tried, but I failed in that.
It is a tremendous drop, because I got a little bit confused.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams wasn't sure why Wilder lost his touch after ``The
Apartment,'' except that it was hard to recapture the camaraderie
of a cast that included Lemmon, Adams and MacLaine, all good
friends. Laughing over the phone, she remembered the scene of
Lemmon straining spaghetti through a tennis racket, the rightness
of it, and said, ``It was a magic time.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (``A Tribute to Billy Wilder'' with Edie Adams, presented by
Marc Huestis, will be held at 7 p.m. Friday at the Castro Theatre,
429 Castro St. in San Francisco. A personal greeting from Lemmon
and clips and songs from Adams will be offered, followed by a
screening of ``The Apartment.'' Tickets are $15 for the gala, $7.50
for the 10:45 p.m. screening. For more information, call

BERKELEY LAW SCHOOL PLANS CLINIC ON TECHNOLOGY ISSUES  
STOCK MARKET TURMOIL HURTS ONLINE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The University of California at Berkeley law school plans Monday
to announce the formation of a high-technology law clinic that will
work on civil liberties and public policy issues involved in areas
like Internet privacy, encryption and free speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Samuelson Law, Technology and Public Policy Clinic will be
the nation's first public interest, high-technology law clinic,
according to its founder, Pamela Samuelson. She is a professor at
Berkeley who has a joint teaching appointment at the law school and
at the university's School of Information Management and Systems.
</P>
<P>
   The program's initial financing will come from two $300,000
grants _ one from Mitchell D. Kapor, founder of Lotus Development,
and one from the Markle Foundation _ as well as a $2 million
endowment from Samuelson and her husband, Robert Glushko. Glushko
is an executive at Commerce One, a Silicon Valley Internet software
company that acquired Glushko's own start-up software company
several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program grew out of a conversation I had with Berkeley law
students,'' Samuelson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have one of the best intellectual property programs in the
country,'' she added. ``This seemed to be a good way to mobilize
students to do things like file public interest lawsuits and amicus
briefs.''
</P>
<P>
   The expanding role of technology in society, she said, is
raising public policy issues that have not previously been faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have inexpensive technologies that are widely available
that allow you to collect and process personal information in ways
that haven't been possible previously,'' Samuelson said.
</P>
<P>
   She pointed to other law clinics already in place at the
Berkeley law school, like one that focuses on human rights issues.
These clinics, she said, offer students opportunities to gain
real-world legal experience before they become professional
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   The program will concentrate on topics like the privacy issues
raised by Internet surveillance conducted by e-commerce companies;
free speech restrictions on the Internet; Internet-related libel
lawsuits; and the restricting of Internet access by public
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which is to begin in the fall or next spring, will
be run by a faculty member to be hired by the law school.

   STOCK MARKET TURMOIL HURTS ONLINE CONSUMER CONFIDENCE
</P>
<P>
   The recent Wall Street sell-off has shaken consumer confidence,
at least among online consumers, according to a survey to be
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   NPD Group, a research firm in Port Washington, N.Y., surveyed
5,000 Internet users nationwide online, and gauged their confidence
in the overall economy and local job markets. It also asked
consumers and assess their own families' financial health and to
forecast their households' online spending for the next three
months.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents said they planned to spend less money on purchases
made over the Internet in the coming months, although NPD said that
at least some of the expected downturn might be attributable to
seasonal swings in online categories like books and music.
</P>
<P>
   The respondents, surveyed on and immediately after April 14, the
day of the stock market's steepest recent drop, reported the lowest
confidence in the economy since the monthly study began in January.
</P>
<P>
   Using January as a benchmark of 100, the confidence index was
95.8, down a half-point from the March poll.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, while respondents indicated that their own families'
financial situations were slightly worse than in March, they tended
to say they were better off than at the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The gap between respondents' assessment of the overall economy
and their own families' situations, may ``confirm the wealth
effect'' that economists like the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan
Greenspan, have cited, in the view of Karl Irons, NPD's president
of online research.
</P>
<P>
   ``People really do think they're wealthier than they are, and
that they're insulated from the economy,'' Irons said.

LOVE ME, LOVE MY DOG GOES ONLY SO FAR, EVEN IN THE DOT-COM WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By TIM RACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You've probably heard it yourself. Somebody mentions the ``new
economy.'' And depending on which way the Nasdaq composite is
blowing that day, somebody else asks, sarcastically, ``Is there
still a new economy?''
</P>
<P>
   Of course there is. The new economy isn't just stock mania. It's
about the new ways of doing business _ often, old business _ using
new information technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But not everything new is wonderful. And if the recent stock
market uproar has any lasting benefit, it may be the destruction of
some new-economy myths _ beliefs whose accuracy went unchallenged
as long as everyone believed without question that they would get
rich. The myths, now debunked, include these:
</P>
<P>
   _ A goatee confers business acumen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vesting is the young man's Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   _ Everybody loves Take Our Dogs to Work days.
</P>
<P>
   For now, let's consider only the last item.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article in The New York Times, Laura M. Holson and
Katie Hafner reported signs of worker disillusionment in dot-com
land. Evidence included the case of Carla De Luca, a former CNN
producer who had gone to work at a Silicon Valley start-up company.
De Luca left after growing disenchanted by what she considered a
forced-fun work style that included a ``dogs welcome'' policy.
</P>
<P>
   A person doesn't have to dislike dogs to understand why some
employees, already doing their best to get along with the other
bipeds, might find it beyond the call of commerce to work alongside
their colleagues' animals. Dog lovers, though, tend to have a blind
spot on these matters, like a friend of mine who fondly recalled
working at a Silicon Valley company with a dog-friendly policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't bring pit bulls,'' she said, as if terror were
the only criterion for objection. ``They're usually big, friendly
dogs, like golden retrievers. The worst that's going to happen is
they wag their tails and knock over your coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, for workers lacking the dog gene, spilled coffee may
be precisely the point. (Or at least part of the point. Allergies,
odors, saliva, fleas, the effect of shedded fur on an all-black
wardrobe _ these also figure in.)
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the issue isn't really career dogs versus stay-at-homes,
though. Instead, the question may be what the panting presence of
man's best friend tells us about a certain school of new-economic
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the new casualness. Given the dog's longstanding role
in popular culture _ Rin Tin Tin, Timmy and Lassie _ it's
understandable how canine companionship came to symbolize the good
feeling that the new workplaces were meant to have. (For the
record: Apple Computer, the archetypal Think Different high-tech
company, banned all pets two years ago, in response to a growing
number of employee complaints.)
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the renegade free-spiritedness implicit in the new,
new ways of doing business. This may trace back to that guy in
college _ since Woodstock, every campus has had at least one _ who
never seems to be in class but can always be found on the central
quad teaching his bandanna-wearing mixed-breed to catch a Frisbee.
We now know that Frisbee Man was a Web entrepreneur in training.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the key to the dog code lies in the mathematics of
Internet time. Dogs pack seven years of their lives into a single
calendar year. Those working at Internet companies like to think
they're packing seven years of their lives into a single day. The
dot-com mantra _ 24/7/365 _ speaks either to a constancy of purpose
or the inability to get one's work done during normal business
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the dog in the manger _ sorry, typo _ in the manager's
office, signifies the mongrelization of work and personal life. A
decade ago, PCs and e-mail let people set up home offices and spend
more time with their families. Today's pervasive Web technologies
seem to encourage some companies to think of the office as home and
the employees as surrogate families.
</P>
<P>
   One executive in New York's Silicon Alley, telling the tale on
the condition of professional anonymity, recalled a recent job
interview that involved a dog.
</P>
<P>
   The prospective employer was Razorfish, a publicly traded Web
development company in Manhattan. Even before the interview, with
Razorfish's chief executive, 33-year-old Jeff Dachis, she had
already decided not to work at the company.
</P>
<P>
   Why? She was put off by Dachis' dog, a large Weimaraner named
Sophie, who sniffed about as the woman sat in the reception area.
</P>
<P>
   Dachis said that without knowing more about the job candidate in
question, he could not comment on the case. But he said Sophie
accompanied him to work every day, and for people who aren't
comfortable with that, ``I'd tell those people to relax.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, he said, it's not as if Razorfish was crawling with
dogs. ``The general rule is, no dogs allowed,'' Dachis said. ``But
Sophie is an exception. She's an amazing dog. She doesn't bark,
she's friendly, she has short hair.''
</P>
<P>
   And employees are happy with the Sophie loophole? ``My dog's
part of the company,'' Dachis said. ``I created it. I run it. For
me to be happy at the company is important. Everyone feels that
having Sophie around is such a soothing component of the work
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Silicon Alley, Jerry Colonna, managing partner at
the venture capital firm Flatiron Partners, which has helped
finance many start-up companies, said he had ``no strong feelings
either way'' on the dog debate.
</P>
<P>
   But then Colonna told a story indicating that, even in the new
economy, Bowser may not be good for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recall an entrepreneur who brought his dog with him when he
and his staff came into our office to pitch for some capital,''
Colonna said. ``The dog kept wandering around the conference room
during the slide presentation _ very odd. One wall of the
conference room is glass, and the dog kept bumping into it,
thinking it was open space. Needless to say, the man didn't get
funding.''

DOT-COM ADVERTISERS WEIGH INFOMERCIALS TO BRING TRAFFIC TO THEIR 
WEB SITES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  (Eds.: Please note that the word AT in parentheses has been used in
the 3rd, 18th and 20th grafs instead of the symbol, which is
non-transmittable to some newspaper systems.) 
 By PATRICIA WINTERS LAURO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The industry that brought you the Ginsu knife and the Ab Buster
_ among other memorable TV products _ is now courting dot-com
advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Infomercial makers have concluded that dot-coms are uniquely
suited to their form of advertising, especially now that plunging
stock prices have put pressure on Internet companies to build
revenue and profits in this unpredictable market. How many online
companies will respond to these suitors, however, remains to be
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Tyee Euro RSCG, an agency in Portland, Ore., that specializes in
infomercials, has developed two 28-minute, program-length
commercials for Internet clients: Excite(AT)Home, a provider of
Internet and broadband services through cable hookups, and
Gazoontite.com, a Web site that offers products and information for
allergy and asthma sufferers.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Tyee, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of
Havas Advertising, contend that the millions spent by dot-coms in
traditional television advertising have not been effective. Some
Internet advertisers were disappointed after their $2 million,
30-second commercials during Super Bowl XXXIV in January failed to
generate more Web traffic, the executives say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Internet companies have complex stories to tell about how
their products and services work, and traditional offline
advertising hasn't proven to be very effective in building brand
awareness or pushing consumers to Web sites,'' said Hugh Allspaugh,
vice president of client services and business development at Tyee.
</P>
<P>
   Infomercials are designed to generate immediate sales results
that can be measured by the volume of traffic to a Web site or
calls to an ``800'' number _ a capability that could prove
attractive to dot-coms in a hurry, said Bill Cella, director for
broadcast and programming at Universal McCann, the media unit of
McCann-Erickson Worldwide in New York, part of the Interpublic
Group of Companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's happening is that corporations buying into the
Internet now have business plans with hard dollars against sales,''
Cella said. ``They have to justify the purchase. And a way to
generate revenue is to deal with direct response advertising. It's
a way to sell the stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   One drawback, of course, is that infomercials do not usually get
prime time network television exposure. Infomercial time is
typically sold during off-peak hours. What is more, 30 minutes is a
long time, Cella said, conjecturing that two-minute direct-response
ads _ similar to those run by music marketers or magazines _ might
prove more popular for dot-coms.
</P>
<P>
   Tyee Euro RSCG is catching the front end of a trend among
dot-coms, said Elissa Myers, president of the Electronic Retailing
Association, a trade group whose members include producers of
infomercials. Her group gets calls almost daily from Internet
retailers seeking information, she said. There is so much interest
that the association plans to include a feature article about the
dot-com trend in the next issue of its publication.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies spent about $2 billion on television
advertising last year, but critics have said that many of the
companies had unrealistic expectations about how quickly they could
build brands. Myers said she was not surprised at some dot-coms'
disappointment, because the advertising had focused on image
building, rather than emphasizing direct-response methods like
conveying a sense of immediacy and using special offers to spur
people to action. ``This is a specialized field that we believe is
perfectly positioned,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   But Joe Mandese, editor of the Myers Report, a media industry
newsletter, said that while infomercials might make sense for
Internet companies whose businesses require special explanation,
the media industry is actually moving to shorter commercials. In
Canada, for example, the government recently allowed five-second
commercials, intended specifically for dot-coms that need only
identify their Web addresses, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If a Web site requires 30 minutes to explain what it does,
Mandese said, then it may have ``some real branding issues on the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dot-coms are one of the most valuable categories of
advertising and the fastest growing, too,'' said Mandese, noting
that advertising outlays by such companies grew 400 percent last
year. `I'd go after it too. But why would dot-coms want long-form
advertising when their long form is their Web site?''
</P>
<P>
   Gazoontite, a privately held company started by a former Clorox
brand manager, Soon-Chart Yu, uses an infomercial because it is
cost effective, provides measurable sales results and offers lots
of time to explain gazoontite.com, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
   The long ad, he said, will run for 8 to 10 weeks beginning in
May, and the total cost of production and media time will still be
less than the cost of a 30-second spot on the Super Bowl. The
company is also running outdoor and radio ads.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Yu acknowledged that he did have to overcome the
infomercial's image problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception of the informercial is yell and sell, but it's
changed,'' said Yu, explaining that he was impressed with Tyee's
infomercials for clients like Apple Computer and Philips Consumer
Electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Tyee actually avoids the term ``infomercial'' because of the
form's low-end reputation for relentless pitching. Rather, Tyee
describes its commercials as formated more like television
programs, like one for Excite(AT)Home that depicts a family trying
the company's high-speed cable-access service, which is contrasted
with traditional dial-up Internet-access service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Infomercials give the impression of Ginsu knives; we're going
after high-end Fortune 1,000 clients with branded messages,'' said
Spencer J. Brown, president and chief executive at Tyee. ``These
are all complex messages.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Doyle, Excite(at)Home's vice president for marketing in
Redwood City, Calif., said the company chose the infomercial format
after witnessing its success with live demonstrations at malls that
enabled people to see the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very challenging for consumers to understand something
they have never experienced,'' Doyle said. ``It's a lot different
than saying a spaghetti sauce is zesty.''
</P>
<P>
   Excite(at)Home provides the infomercial to its cable company
partners, which deliver the service, she added. They run the
infomercial during available time slots and on local channels. It
is part of a larger advertising campaign, Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts said they considered it incongruous that
fast-moving Internet companies would rely on an old-media sales
tactic better known for peddling slice-and-dice appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony here is that the destination _ the Web site _ should
be able to tell you everything,'' Mandese said. ``Web sites are the
ultimate infomercial. It's ironic that they would cultivate that
category.''

&HT;     IBM HOPES NEW COMPUTERS RESTORE LUSTER TO BRAND 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ About one month ago, things were looking up for
IBM Corp.'s personal computing division.
</P>
<P>
   Amid diminishing sales of its Aptiva brand, and increased
competition across the board, Big Blue was gearing up to launch a
new line of machines as part of a larger corporate networking
initiative intended to bolster sales.
</P>
<P>
   The sales spark is now on hold, and recent sales figures show
IBM is more black and blue than Big Blue.
</P>
<P>
   The savior-line-to-be is called NetVista, a family of stylish,
matte-black computers featuring high-resolution, flat-panel screens
and high-bandwidth connectivity. In a release, IBM touted the line
as ``the company's most dramatic and significant roll-out of
desktop technology since its first PC almost 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast. The launch of the NetVista line, which was supposed
to happen Wednesday, has been postponed until ``early May,''
according to company officials, who gave no specific reason for the
delay.
</P>
<P>
   A delayed launch is by no means a disaster in the tech world.
Just ask Microsoft, which has been notoriously late, and
successful, with almost all of its products.
</P>
<P>
   IBM sales figures, on the other hand, have been disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   Adding insult to injury, first-quarter PC sales figures released
by the technology industry research firm International Data Corp.
show IBM has been surpassed by Hewlett-Packard in worldwide sales,
slipping to the No. 4 position overall, trailing No. 1 Compaq and
runner-up Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the picture is even worse. IBM fell out of the top
five in the same IDC poll, dropping to No. 7 in U.S. PC sales for
the first quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have to either mount a direct strategy or do
something very quickly to rebound on consumer numbers,'' said
Gabrielle Griffith, an IDC analyst who tracks the PC world. ``We
just don't see that happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The PC market has been tricky territory for most every retailer
of late, primarily because of softening demand. Corporate markets,
where Big Blue butters its bread, were particularly reticent to
spend big money on new machines.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, overseas markets, many of which are just now recovering
from the Asian economic slump that hit the Far East financial
markets three years ago, were hungry for machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking ahead, IDC believes that commercial market demand has
started to stabilize in most major regions of the world, and
purchase patterns should return to more normal rates during the
second half of the year,'' said IDC analyst Bruce Stephen.
</P>
<P>
   That could be good news for IBM, which is slowly but surely
abandoning the consumer market for computers, focusing instead on
the workplace. According to Griffith, the company pulled most of
its Aptiva line from consumer retail outlets in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't compete, or find a sweet spot to make a profit
and compete on price,'' Griffith said. ``They weren't making money
with their Aptiva line, and they had too much competition. H-P,
Compaq and eMachines are dominating the retail consumer market.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, IBM will have to capitalize on the corporate customer. And
the NetVista is a fine machine to do so.
</P>
<P>
   A recent demonstration of the line revealed IBM has shaken free
from its stodgy, beige-box roots, replaced by sleek, black styling
and top-of-the-line technology.
</P>
<P>
   The line includes a range of network-happy products, including
thin clients, Internet access devices and all-in-one desktop
computers.
</P>
<P>
   While the internal components are not stupendous, the industrial
design is worth a second look.
</P>
<P>
   The all-in-one X40 is probably the coolest of the bunch,
integrating a 15-inch flat panel screen, built-in speakers, a
CD/DVD-ROM and floppy drive and the rest of the usual guts into a
sweet little 16 by 16 by 10-inch package. A unique neck design
allows the keyboard to fit under the monitor to free up space.
</P>
<P>
   The X40 comes with either an Intel Pentium III 667 MHz or Intel
Celeron 566 MHz chip. As for peripherals, the all-in-one comes with
two expandable PCI slots and seven USB ports.
</P>
<P>
   Although the company will not release the NetVista price until
the official launch, company sources say the X40 will cost between
$1,800 and $2,400.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM needed an offering that was in that slick category,''
Griffith said. ``They're following vendors like Gateway, Dell and
H-P, which all already have offerings at that target.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM plans to invest more than $100 million in marketing and
advertising campaigns to support the NetVista line, although it
says the new line will not replace its existing Aptiva, PC 300 and
IntelliStation products.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, IBM recently introduced the fastest Aptiva computer
ever built, sporting a 1 GHz Intel processor.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRENOBLE, France _ Eleven years ago, Peter Denyer, who was then
an Edinburgh University electronic engineering professor,
painstakingly pried the cap off a computer memory chip and, by
exposing it to light, was able to capture a rudimentary monochrome
digital image, displayable on a computer monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not realize it at the time, Denyer was repeating
an experiment others had performed several years earlier at the
California Institute of Technology. But it was he who first
recognized the commercial possibility: A memory chip might serve as
an inexpensive digital imaging system, one that could transform the
worlds of photography and video.
</P>
<P>
   And last year when Vision Group LLG, Denyer's chip design firm,
was purchased for $39 million by STMicroelectronics NV, the world's
seventh-largest chip maker, the stage was set. By combining Vision
Group's technology with the manufacturing and distribution
capabilities of STMicroelectronics, Denyer hopes to create a new
generation of chips that might soon lead to inexpensive,
high-resolution still and video cameras.
</P>
<P>
   STMicroelectronics predicts that within several years the cost
of high-resolution digital cameras, now typically in the hundreds
of dollars, will fall to near that of today's computer memory chips
_ a few dollars apiece.
</P>
<P>
   And once that happens, Denyer and his colleagues promise,
digital photo capabilities will find their way into all sorts of
consumer electronics _ whether cell phones that could take and send
snapshots, hand-held digital assistants that could double as video
camcorders or portable computers that might enable traveling sales
executives to shoot and edit entire multimedia presentations on the
fly.
</P>
<P>
   Between today's reality and tomorrow's vision, though, lies an
international technology battle, one that pits Denyer and others
against the makers of the more costly sensors that now dominate
digital cameras. Called charged coupled devices, or CCDs, these
sensors require a set of several chips and components. They are
made chiefly by the same Japanese companies, like Sony and
Matsushita, that are among the leading makers of digital cameras
and video camcorders.
</P>
<P>
   Competing with these companies are STMicroelectronics, as well
as Motorola and other American companies that have built factories
to produce the kind of less-expensive sensors that Denyer has long
championed: complimentary metal oxide semiconductor, or CMOS,
chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably a little ahead of the market,'' Denyer said,
recalling his experiment of more than a decade ago. He is now
director of technology for STMicroelectronics' imaging division,
dividing his time between his lab in Edinburgh and the division's
operation here in Grenoble. ``It's harder than it looks,'' he said
of the company's CMOS work, ``but we've done a lot of research.''
</P>
<P>
   CMOS (pronounced SEE-moss) imaging chips, which are made with
the same basic techniques as conventional computer chips, are
already widely used in low-cost Web cameras, sold by Logitech
International and others, as attachments for personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   While CCD sensors remain the foundation of both the digital
photography and video markets, CMOS makers plan to mount increasing
competitive pressure through a variety of new digital imaging
products that take advantage of the lower-cost sensor chips.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fundamental advantage of CMOS is you can integrate
computing and sensor functions,'' said Willy Shih, president of
Eastman Kodak's digital applied imaging division. Kodak produces
CCD sensors for its own digital cameras and under contract to
various government agencies. But the company has also introduced
its first CMOS-based camera _ an attachment for Palm hand-held
devices. ``If you want to make a single-chip digital camera,'' Shih
said, ``you will have to use CMOS.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike CCD sensors, with their multiple components and their
vast arrays of light-sensitive electronic capacitors, CMOS sensors
can be made using the same high-volume lithographic process as
other kinds of solid-state semiconductors. Advocates of CMOS say
their single-chip production advantage will enble them to overwhelm
their opponents with price advantages and high-volume
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   But executives in the CCD camp, along with some analysts, point
out that CMOS proponents have long failed to live up to such
forecasts, because of the inferior quality of CMOS-produced images.
</P>
<P>
   ``CMOS hasn't made inroads into the CCD market as much as its
supporters have predicted,'' said Mark Kirstein, vice president for
research at the Cahners In-Stat Group, a semiconductor market
research firm in Scottsdale, Ariz. ``But it has resulted in a
significant reduction in price in CCDs and a huge influx of capital
into CCD development, as the Japanese manufacturers have started
lowering their prices and pouring in R&AMP;D money.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter, say CMOS adherents. They note that a new wave of
investment, driven by new applications like image-capture systems
for cell phones and Web cameras and other imaging devices for
personal computer, has led to an explosion of CMOS development
among big chip makers like ST Microsystems, Motorola and Agilent,
the new Hewlett-Packard spinoff, as well as smaller start-ups like
Photobit, Conexant and Y-Media.
</P>
<P>
   Emboldened by the potential of CMOS, some small start-ups are
even attacking a part of the CCD market that many had considered
unassailable: high-quality digital imaging, like that used for
fashion and advertising photography.
</P>
<P>
   The upstarts include Foveon, in Santa Clara, Calif., a maker of
photo-studio cameras that sell for as much as $50,000 and offer
stunning resolution. The company was founded in 1997 by Carver
Mead, a physicist and semiconductor industry pioneer who did early
work in artificial silicon retinas at the California Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be left out of any market where quality is
an issue,'' Mead said. Foveon's sensors employ a three-chip system
_ for red, green and blue sensitivity _ made through a CMOS process
but incorporating the company's ``own secret sauce on top of
that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While Mead toils in the market's higher reaches, Denyer and the
STMicroelectronics design team are more intent on mass-market
applications. Executives at STMicrosystems and other chip companies
now predict that an imaging chip will become a standard feature of
a digital cellular phone as soon as 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, phones will soon have the capability to send and
receive still images, while in Japan plans are now under way to
make video a standard cellular phone feature,'' said Jean-Pierre
Lusinchi, group vice president of the STMicroelectronics' consumer
and microcontroller products division.
</P>
<P>
   CMOS sensors are also finding their way into a diverse range of
low-cost applications that require digital imaging. An optical
mouse recently introduced by Microsoft, for example, uses a CMOS
sensor made by Agilent. Besides having no moving parts, the mouse
is more precise than conventional roller-ball models, the maker
says, because its motion sensor can capture up to 1,000 images per
second as it is moved across a flat surface; by comparing images,
software in the chip determines the mouse's speed and direction.
</P>
<P>
   The optical mouse has joined the Web camera as an add-on device
that analysts expect to become a standard accessory with many of
the 150 million or more computers sold worldwide each year.
</P>
<P>
   Web cameras, almost all of which use CMOS chips, are based on
sensors that have 100,000 to 300,000 picture elements, or pixels.
That allows a resolution acceptable on the screen of a hand-held
device or in a small window on a computer monitor _ though hardly
comparable with the resolution of 2 million or 3 million pixels
from CCD cameras, which are fast approaching the clarity of
35-millimeter photographic film.
</P>
<P>
   But Web cameras, used for all sorts of video voyeurism, have
caught on with PC users much more quickly than most analysts had
predicted. ``Our plan is to become the eyes of the Internet,'' said
Neal Carney, a marketing manager in Agilent's semiconductor
products group.
</P>
<P>
   Other CMOS sensors are cropping up in intriguing new
applications, like one from Photobit, a CMOS imaging company in
Pasadena, Calif., that was founded by scientists who pioneered the
technology at the California Institute of Technology's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. Photobit has developed a CMOS sensor that
its executives say can be used to reduce the costs and health risks
of dental X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   The system does away with photographic film, displaying the
X-ray instead on a video monitor. And for the patient, it requires
only about one-tenth the exposure to the dangerous rays as a
conventional X-ray, according to Photobit.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such developments, CCD supporters are skeptical that
CMOS will penetrate the heart of the CCD market _ consumer video
and still-picture digital cameras. Besides the big Japanese
manufacturers and Kodak, CCD makers include some small American
companies like Pixel Vision Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every once in a while I go to Kmart to see if CMOS is showing
up in the video camera market,'' said James Janesick, executive
vice president and chief scientific officer for Pixel Vision, which
is based in Huntington Beach, Calif. ``So far, they haven't made
any inroads.'' But Janesick acknowledges that CMOS is appearing in
the market for digital still cameras priced below $500. Polaroid
has begun offering a digital camera that sells for less than $200
and uses a CMOS sensor, and similar consumer-quality products from
other companies are expected to fall below to $100 before
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Janesick expects the CCD makers to defend their territory with a
vengeance, resisting new technologies with fierce price
competition. But Denyer, predicts that CMOS will create vast new
markets beyond the reach of CCD and then eventually pose a head-on
challenge to CCD's higher-resolution applications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been predicting the arrival of CMOS for years, and now
it's coming true,'' Denyer said. ``I feel like saying loudly, `I
told you so.'''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Given the dismal performance of dot-com retailers on Wall Street
and in the offices of venture capitalists lately, investors have
had their fill of e-books, e-pets, e-drugs and other Web retail
operations that burn through cash at Internet speed. What the
market seems to be in the mood for now is some old-fashioned
e-fficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, according to executives and industry analysts, is
that investors had been treating electronic commerce as a
popularity contest, giving the sites with the most visitors the
highest stock valuations. As a result, many Internet merchants have
concentrated more on their Web-traffic figures than on the standard
measures of long-term retail success, like gross margins, customer
acquisition costs and customer retention rates.
</P>
<P>
   But now that investors are seeking evidence that dot-coms can
show profits at some point, many Web retailers are getting down to
the dirty work of squeezing income from their operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, the focus is now on what will drive near-term
revenue,'' said John Hagel, a partner at McKinsey &AMP; Co., the
management consultants. ``There's clearly a sense of urgency around
the efficiency side of the equation, which for a long time was
ignored quite explicitly.''
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, that urgency translates to difficult decisions
about where to devote staff resources _ for example, whether to
shift employees from long-term projects to those with more
short-term relevance to the bottom line. In others, it means
actually using the mountains of data that e-tailers have said all
along will help speed their earnings growth _ by allowing them to
make better decisions about which customers are the most
profitable, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the new tensions can mean even harder work for
employees who may have been hoping by now to ease into a 9-to-5
routine as the value of their stock options appreciated.
</P>
<P>
   Hagel and others said the focus on near-term revenue probably
meant the temporary abandonment of some prominent retail
initiatives, like building sites devoted to wireless Internet users
or new sites designed to take advantage of high-speed Internet
access. ``A lot of e-tailers had aggressive plans to expand into
related categories that they've put off,'' Hagel said, ``because
that would require a big near-term investment with no revenue
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bowman, chief executive of Cyberian Outpost
(www.outpost.com), a Web retailer that sells computers and
electronic goods, said his company was intensifying its efforts
toward making a profit, a goal he predicted the company would
achieve ``by the middle of next year.''
</P>
<P>
   To reach that goal, Bowman said Cyberian Outpost would have to
increase the rate at which buyers returned to the site to an
average of 3.5 times a year, from the current 2.7 times. Twelve
months ago, average visits occurred 1.7 times a year.
</P>
<P>
   The return-rate statistic is particularly important for Internet
retailers because they typically spend substantial amounts to
attract new customers _ $80 to $100 each, on average. So the more
revenue they can glean from their existing customers, the faster
the profits will come.
</P>
<P>
   To retain its existing customer base, Bowman said his company
had increased its focus on e-mail marketing and stayed with a
policy of offering free overnight shipping, while it also tweaked
the Web site's performance.
</P>
<P>
   This month, ``four of our engineers wanted to work on WAP,''
Bowman said, referring to the company's wireless-access initiative.
``I said, fine, but you have to work on the site's search first,
because after the checkout page, it's the No. 1 most abandoned part
of the site.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can move that needle 5 percent,'' he added, ``that's
significant dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other retailers, Cyberian Outpost has shunned
television advertising in favor of print and Internet ads. This
represents a shift for Cyberian, which gained attention last year _
and for some, notoriety _ with a TV ad depicting gerbils being shot
from a cannon. The ads were shown before Bowman became chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of television ad spending last year, Bowman said
that the company had been paying $90 to attract each new customer,
a cost that is now $40 and dropping.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell our people this isn't some online fraternity or
sorority,'' he said. ``It's a business that's publicly traded, and
it has to be profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Morris, executive vice president of Bluefly, an
Internet-only discount apparel retailer, said that because his
company started with $4 million, ``we never really had the luxury
of a war chest, so we were forced to be more disciplined about
costs from early on.'' Bluefly began as a division of Pivot Rules;
that company changed its name to Bluefly when it sold its other
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Morris said, Blue-fly has found new ways to
squeeze dollars from several areas inside the business, including
order fulfillment. For example, the company now calculates the
efficiency of using different carriers to send packages to
different regions, rather than depending on one carrier. ``That can
play a huge role in lowering costs,'' he said, adding that
fulfillment managers _ whether inside the company or outside
contractors _ ``are getting smarter about this, because they're
being forced to.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Profitability is not unheard of in Internet retailing, according
to James Vogtle, director of e-commerce research at the Boston
Consulting Group. Vogtle's firm recently surveyed 412 online
retailers on behalf of Shop.org, an industry trade group, and found
that 24 percent of Web-only retailers were profitable last year.
But according to Shop.org, none of the large, publicly traded
e-tailers were among them. Those companies were still spending
large amounts of money on marketing to reach as wide an audience as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Bucking the trend, a few Internet companies are finding sources
of revenue inside their own marketing departments. David
Friedensohn, chief executive of BigStar Entertainment, an
online-only retailer of videos and DVDs, said that instead of the
``spray-and-pray advertising approach,'' the company's primary
marketing vehicle had been its own database of 1.7 million customer
e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   BigStar built content features into its Web site like interviews
with celebrities _ features that, when monitored, give the company
a better idea of individual customers' movie tastes. In addition to
tracking usage and buying patterns, BigStar designed software that
could sift through customer profiles before sending an e-mail
marketing letter, and could tailor each note to a customer's
entertainment preferences.
</P>
<P>
   That approach has not only stabilized the company's marketing
costs, Friedensohn said, but has also generated revenue, since
BigStar now sells its e-mail personalization service to other
companies. Such efficiency is important, he said, if BigStar is to
survive in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that you anticipate failure,'' Friedensohn said,
``but because things change so quickly on the Web, you want to
build flexibility into the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Hagel, at McKinsey, said that unlike BigStar, most e-tailers had
done nothing with the vast amounts of customer data they had
collected. ``In many cases they don't have the tools in place, or
the skills to use the tools,'' he said. ``But you don't even need
sophisticated systems. A lot of this is back-of-the-envelope
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited the case of one McKinsey client, an online financial
services company that was retaining customers at what was
considered a good rate by industry standards. ``But they never
bothered to look at who was actually leaving and why,'' Hagel said.
</P>
<P>
   After some rudimentary sampling, it turned out that the
company's most profitable customers were leaving. ``Economically,
it was a disaster,'' he said. ``This refocused the company
completely.''
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable why companies have not focused on the
bottom line until now, Hagel added, since ``growth has been the
biggest imperative.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the market's now saying pretty clearly that it's not just
growth anymore,'' he said. ``It's about overall efficiency of
operations. The only problem is, in most cases, the skill sets to
get that done are sadly lacking.''

BREAK THE LOCK ON NET CONTENT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY   
 c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: I am having a major problem with Internet
Explorer's Content Advisor. I cannot access any Web pages due to
the lack of a ``supervisor password,'' which I do not remember
entering. I tried to uninstall Explorer and then reinstall, but I
still receive this message. _ Webless
</P>
<P>
   Dear Webless: Gosh, you wouldn't be just another teen-ager
trying to pull the wool over the ol' doc's eyes, now would you? Mom
caught you spending a little too much recreational time on the
Jennicam site?
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, I wouldn't answer a question like this, but, since
the solution is already well-known, it gives me yet another chance
to wag my finger at parents. Besides, I locked myself out of IE the
same way once, so I know it can happen to nonteen-agers too.
</P>
<P>
   The newest versions of Internet Explorer allow conscientious
parents to deny access to sites that voluntarily rate themselves as
adult-oriented or just plain naughty. The only problem with this
system is that it gives parents the idea that their kids can't
figure a way around the roadblock. Wrong. This particular feature
is easy to defeat, as a quick Yahoo! search can show.
</P>
<P>
   There are actually two solutions. One is to wipe your hard drive
clean and start over with a fresh installation of Windows. The
second is to twiddle with the Registry. That's why uninstalling IE
didn't work. The setting was still in the Registry, waiting to lock
you out again.
</P>
<P>
   You'd think Microsoft would have the answer on their support
site, but the people there aren't real big on helping users poke
holes in their ``security'' features. You can call them at (425)
635-7123 for help, but why? It's a simple hack as long as you don't
mind taking a chance clobbering your system by editing the
Registry.
</P>
<P>
   Go to the Start menu, then select Run. Type Regedit in the blank
and press Enter. Now you're in the Registry Editor. Go to
HKEY(underscore)LOCAL(underscore)MACHINE, then Software, then
Microsoft, then Windows, then Current Version, then Policies, then
Ratings. Delete the key you find there. Now use Windows Explorer to
delete the file Ratings.pol in the System folder (within the
Windows folder). You'll be back watching Jenni in no time.
</P>
<P>
   And, parents, don't trust software to do your job.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Dr. Bombay: Please tell people about the open-source
revolution, which includes Linux. _ Open Sesame
</P>
<P>
   Dear Open: Sigh. I can always tell when I'm about to generate
hate mail. The one thing Linux needs to turn it into a commercially
viable alternative to other operating systems is Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is admirable: a free, stable operating system, with
source code available to all. The reality is dreadful: thousands of
programmers of widely varying skills going in a hundred different
directions. The result: a difficult-to-learn system that works
correctly with only a fraction of the hardware available to users.
</P>
<P>
   It's fun to play with, but until some corporate giant decides to
build the ultimate user-friendly super-compatible Linux
distribution, there's no way it can dislodge Windows or the Mac OS.
Granted, installation has gotten easier in the past few years. Red
Hat, Caldera and Corel have done a great job making Linux more
accessible to us non-Poindexters, but I still can't get Soldier of
Fortune to run on a Linux box. Even with all its goofy ways of
crashing, I'll stick with Windows for a while longer.

<P>
   What's the best-selling game software for the past few months?
Before giving your final answer, do you want to use one of your
three lifelines?
</P>
<P>
   Who Wants To Be A Millionaire CD-ROM (Windows; about $15-$20) is
as big a hit on the computer monitor as it has been on television
screens. It's dominated the top of the software best-seller list
since its debut late last year.
</P>
<P>
   It's such a hit, in fact, that the distributor, Disney
Interactive, has announced that a sequel, WWTBAM 2nd Edition, will
be out sometime next month. For fans of this hot trivia show, the
first version has enough going for it to recommend the second
version sight unseen.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the CD version is hosted by Regis Philbin. Yes, there is
the same ``fastest finger'' round where contestants seek to put
four items in the right sequence in the fastest time in order to
play the game. (Up to 26 players can compete in the round to see
who gets to take the first shot at the prize.) Yes, players can get
lifelines. Yes, it is the same 15-question format leading to a top
prize.
</P>
<P>
   No, you do not get a check for $1 million from Regis if you make
it to the top of the CD's game ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the questions are just as interesting as the ones on
television: What type of animal is a humuhumunukunukuapuaa? A.
turtle; B. bird; C. fish; D. monkey. (Answer at the end of the
column.)
</P>
<P>
   The game moves along quickly. The stage setting and music have
been transported to the computer monitor so that the show becomes
interactive with the home player.
</P>
<P>
   Philbin will provide one-sided chatter during the game
including, of course, his ``Final answer?'' trademark. He'll also
make some deflating comments when players bomb out on low rounds
and ask if players want to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   Each question also must be answered within a set amount of time.
That's mainly to provide equal competition if several people are
playing separate rounds for a high score. If you don't have enough
time and want to cheat, pressing the escape key pauses the program.
</P>
<P>
   Another cheat: Typing in no name when starting a game will
result in the name ``Kathy Lee'' being displayed and easier
questions being used; typing ``John Carpenter'' will trigger a
harder set of questions.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, you may recall, was the first contestant to ever
reach the seven-figure goal, including all contestants on the
original British telecasts. He's also the one who used his lifeline
to call his father, not to ask for help on the final question, but
to say, ``Dad, I'm about to win the million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The three lifelines have been transposed from the television
show to the computer with minimum degradation. The 50/50 is easy
enough to do: The computer simply takes away two wrong answers.
Since the home player doesn't have an audience to ask, game
designers conducted an online poll prior to publishing the CD in
which visitors to a Web site were asked to select their answers to
the questions. The graphs show up on screen when a player uses that
lifeline.
</P>
<P>
   Use the Phone-a-Friend lifeline and Regis will place the call.
Philbin and a prerecorded voice will make small talk, and then the
prerecorded ``friend'' will give the answer to the question.
Sometimes, the friend is dead wrong.
</P>
<P>
   You can also play Millionaire online at the ABC Web site:
www.abc.com. You'll need Flash 4 loaded on your computer and have
to endure some advertising to get to the game site. Once there, you
might find that ``today's featured game'' or previous games may not
be currently available because of heavy traffic on the site.
</P>
<P>
   As for the answer to the question earlier in the column, the
humuhumunukunukuapuaa is a fish _ the state fish of Hawaii, in
fact. It's pronounced WHO-moo-WHO-moo-NEW-coo-NEW-coo-AH-poo-AH-ah.
The first part of the word means ``fit pieces together'' because
the fish is colored in sections that look like puzzle pieces. The
second part of the name means ``snout like a pig.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's my final answer.

BUILDING BOOM: REAL ESTATE SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DOLORES KONG   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Real estate Web sites give a new meaning to the phrase ``home
page.''
</P>
<P>
   You can search the Internet for a home anywhere _ from Maine to
California _ by price range or number of bedrooms or style. You can
view pictures, or even take a virtual tour. And you can find out
what comparable homes in your neighborhood have sold for, or what
your boss paid for his new abode.
</P>
<P>
   One of the newest Web sites, Domania.com, lets you find
comparable sales, estimate the value of the house you already own,
and calculate approximate property taxes on the home you're
interested in purchasing.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly known as HomePriceCheck.com, Boston-based Domania.com
went online this month with financial backing from CMGI Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to consider ourselves a complement to the realtor. All
parties benefit when you have an educated consumer,'' said Owen
Eagan, communications manager for Domania.com.
</P>
<P>
   And for people who already own a home, he said, the Web site
``allows consumers to manage their most prized and valuable asset.
They can keep track of their home's value over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Other sites, such as VirtualRelocation.com and
realestate.Yahoo.com, let you check out schools and compare cities,
based on economic and quality-of-life factors.
</P>
<P>
   Some specialize in houses being sold by owners, while one site
bills itself as the leading online real estate brokerage. All
promise to save you on commissions.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Web addresses reviewed offer links to mortgage
companies, or calculators to figure out how much house you can
afford and whether it makes sense to pay points for a loan with a
slightly lower interest rate.
</P>
<P>
   There are so many real estate sites that a Massachusetts firm
that rates Web sites limits its latest reviews to 22 sites that
offer at least 10,000 home listings nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez Advisors (www.Gomez.com) scores the online home-buying
sites on such factors as ease of use and on-site resources. It also
allows users to compare sites, based on whether they are old hands
at buying homes or new to the real estate market.
</P>
<P>
   But when making any kind of a purchase over the Internet _
especially one as major as a house _ a buyer must beware.
</P>
<P>
   Some real estate sites offer a link to only one or two
affiliated mortgage companies, which may not necessarily offer the
best interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the sites' claims _ that they offer hundreds of
thousands or, in one case, more than a million listings _ may be
inflated, according to a study last year by Clareity Consulting, a
real estate consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a review of some real estate sites on the Internet:
</P>
<P>
   --www.Domania.com _ With what it calls the ``largest free online
bank of home sales comparables,'' this site promises to ``provide
all the tools and information you need to save time and money in
the real estate game.''
</P>
<P>
   You can check sales prices from as recently as two months ago
and estimate the current value of a home you own or project its
future value, based on sales data in your ZIP code.
</P>
<P>
   An outgrowth of INPHO, a company that provided real estate
information over the phone, Domania.com remains an information
service, Eagan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're designed by homeowners for homeowners,'' he said.
``We're not a transaction-related site,'' like those put up by real
estate brokers or mortgage lenders. You'll find no listings of
homes for sale _ just data to make your real estate decision an
informed one.
</P>
<P>
   Domania.com also provides data to Yahoo, America Online,
zipRealty.com, and other Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   --realestate.Yahoo.com _ You can search its ads nationwide for a
home based on location, price, type of residence (single-family or
condo, for example), and number of bedrooms and baths.
</P>
<P>
   You can compare cities, based on cost of living, median family
income, average home purchase price, and crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   And there's a fun tool: You can compare salaries and the cost of
living in different cities. For example, you can learn how much
more you would need to earn in New York to buy what you can buy
with a $50,000 salary in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The site also allows you to find a child-care provider, research
schools, hunt for a mortgage, and calculate whether to rent or buy.
</P>
<P>
   --www.Realtor.com _ Earning the highest overall score from
Gomez.com, this National Association of Realtors site boasts more
than 1.3 million listings. You can look for a mobile home in Maine
or a town house in Florida, by price range, square footage, and
other factors.
</P>
<P>
   One neat feature: Each listing estimates your monthly mortgage
payment, based on 20 percent down and the average 30-year fixed
mortgage rate (7.96 percent during this review).
</P>
<P>
   This site has the most listings by far, according to Gomez.com.
But last year, Clareity Consulting found that Realtor.com's 1.3
million figure overstated the number of listings by nearly 100,000,
according to Realty Times, a trade publication. Realtor.com didn't
dispute that finding, explaining that market conditions and the
winter weather at the time of the consultant's study accounted for
the deviation.
</P>
<P>
   --www.zipRealty.com _ Newly targeting the Boston area, this
Berkeley, Calif.-based company says it's the world's first online
real estate brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Sellers and buyers who register have access to online agents, an
``escrow tracker,'' and loan, insurance, and home-inspection
options. Because of its lower overhead, the company promises cash
back at the close of escrow, up to $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   But because the site was just launched in Boston, on April 2,
its online calculator's finding that an average three-bedroom,
two-bath house in the Boston area is selling for $695,744 may have
been skewed. That result was based on only 45 homes.
</P>
<P>
   --www.owners.com and www.ForSaleByOwner.com _ These nationwide
sites target do-it-yourself sellers and adventurous home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Owners.com offers three marketing deals: a free one-month trial
listing, with one picture; a $99 three-month basic package, with
five pictures and a customized yard sign; and a $289 three-month
deluxe package, with a virtual tour taken by a professional
photographer and an open-house kit.
</P>
<P>
   ForSaleByOwner.com offers two deals: a $39.95 monthly rate with
up to six pictures, or a $99 flat rate for a six-month listing with
up to six pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Both sites also offer calculators, access to mortgage services,
and other features.

c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Bill Muller's capsule reviews of a website and some
current magazines:
</P>
<P>
   The Nine Planets
</P>
<P>
   seds.lpl.arizona.edu/billa/tnp/nineplanets.html
</P>
<P>
   Outer space is cool again. On the heels of box office hits such
as (beginitalic)Armageddon(enditalic), Hollywood is churning out
space adventure films, such as (beginitalic)Mission to
Mars(enditalic) and (beginitalic)Battlefield Earth(enditalic) and
(beginitalic)Red Planet(enditalic), another Mars movie coming out
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better time to bone up on the solar system.
</P>
<P>
   Enter ``The Nine Planets,'' a Web site dedicated to everything
that orbits the Sun, from Earth to the rings of Saturn and beyond.
Although great for those last-minute science papers, the site is
also just plain interesting.
</P>
<P>
   It has extensive information on the planets and their moons,
from mythology to hard science. For example, the site notes that
Mercury was probably named for the messenger of the gods because it
moves quickly across the sky. Also, its eccentric orbit helped
prove Einstein's theory of relativity.
</P>
<P>
   It also notes that Neptune, the eighth planet from the sun, was
discovered after astronomers noticed a peculiarity in the orbit of
Uranus, the seventh planet. Pluto was discovered by accident, for
much the same reason.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of good photos, such as a full color shot of
Io, one of the moons of Jupiter, which has active volcanoes on its
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Bored with all the book learning? You can also vote for your
favorite planet. In an amazing turn of events, Earth seems to be
winning. What a bunch of homers. Mars rules!
</P>
<P>
   George
</P>
<P>
   This magazine just can't win for losing. Much of this month's
issue is devoted to John McCain, whose presidential campaign flamed
about the same time they were dropping this collection of
irrelevancy in the mail. There is an essay by the White Tornado
himself, repeating much of what we heard in stump speeches all
winter. There is also a feature on Cindy McCain, who,
(beginitalic)George (enditalic)has learned, loves her children. In
all fairness, there also are pieces on the wives of George W. Bush,
Al Gore and Bill Bradley, whose campaign fell apart about the same
time as McCain's. Beyond that, there's not much to keep the covers
apart, though the Vietnam retrospective by Pulitzer Prize winner
David Halberstam is worth a look. The main feature is on stars who
give extensively to charity, and it leads with U2's Bono, who has
become involved in Third World debt relief. That, and finding that
elusive word that rhymes with Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   Reason
</P>
<P>
   The lead piece happily notes that the world hasn't come to an
end, as gloomily predicted by experts during the first Earth Day
back in 1970. There hasn't been a global famine, city dwellers
aren't wearing gas masks, and we haven't run out of oil. While the
statistics seem to bear this out, the piece is written in an
off-putting we-told-you-so style that makes it read like an
eighth-grade social studies book. In another piece, a dad defends
the ribald animated TV show (beginitalic)South Park(enditalic),
which has sent the Religious Right into a tizzy with its profane
dialogue and adult themes. Writer Barry S. Fagin taped and
previewed the show and then let his kids watch a few episodes. He
emerged believing that (beginitalic)South Park (enditalic)can
actually teach his kids something, mainly that it's fun to ridicule
celebrities, hypocrites and ``people who believe stupid things.''
Also, cartoons are not real. We had an inkling. That Yosemite Sam
just never seems to run out of bullets.
</P>
<P>
   Utne reader
</P>
<P>
   The main package deals with dwindling privacy in an increasingly
computerized world. The most interesting piece involves a man who
walks 120 miles from his tiny Quaker community in southeastern Ohio
to the state capital, Columbus, to return his driver's license in
an act of defiance. We later learn that he and his wife have no
marriage certificate (no government interference, thank you),
refused immunization for their first child and never filed birth
certificates for the rest. Great idea, except he can't take them as
tax deductions. You walk away admiring the guy but at the same time
glad you're not stuck on a six-hour flight with him. Another
article examines the relative futility of the U.S. Census Bureau's
efforts to count immigrants and minorities. It has become this
silly: Census-takers in Chicago invented an ersatz superhero to
cajole Hispanics to fill out their census forms. His name: Super
Censo. Now we're cooking with gas.
</P>
<P>
   Working mother
</P>
<P>
   The magazine for moms offers advice on how to organize your day
around getting the little tykes fed, off to school and yourself to
work without losing your sanity. The real-mom model who poses for
the article is sporting an ear-to-ear grin, so apparently, it's a
real snap. There is some genuinely good advice, but I'm guessing
most moms won't quite find the time for the ``categorize your
closet'' chapter. Another story profiles the ``Mom of the Year,'' a
28-year-old mother of three who develops school programs by day and
powders bottoms by night. In her spare time, she works on cold
fusion experiments in the family basement. There's also a decent
piece on figuring out if your kids can be left at home alone. To
find out if you're ready to take the plunge, the article provides a
list of probing questions, such as ``Is your child a pyromaniac?''
OK, we made that one up.

BOOK EXAMINES HOW CISCO HAS BECOME ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST VALUABLE
COMPANIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By Teresa McUsic 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cisco Systems probably qualifies as the biggest company you've
never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   Riding the Internet boom, the fast-growing maker of
communications network equipment became the world's most valuable
company this year _ at least on Wall Street. For a time, it was
worth more than General Electric. Its shares tumbled a bit during
the stock market turmoil of the past month, but Cisco remains more
valuable than Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   And yet Cisco remains a mystery even to many who follow
business. Sure, most readers are probably familiar with the
exploits of celebrity CEOs such as GE's Jack Welch or Microsoft's
Bill Gates. But can you name the chief executive of Cisco _ a
company still worth more than $400 billion after the most recent
market shake-up?
</P>
<P>
   He is John Chambers, a former IBM salesman who also worked as a
key executive of Wang Laboratories. A recently published book
provides the best glimpse of the management techniques and
strategies that Chambers used in catapulting Cisco from a niche
maker of networking gear into the dominant player in developing the
systems that push data around the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Making the Cisco Connection: The Story Behind the Real
Internet Superpower,'' (John Wiley &AMP; Sons, 218 pages, $24.95),
David Bunnell reviews Cisco's history and shows how the company has
integrated an enviable corporate culture with an aggressive
acquisition strategy to lead in Internet development.
</P>
<P>
   For Cisco managers, no price is too high for the right
acquisition. It acquires companies _ and their employees _ to grab
a head start in key technology sectors that could position Cisco as
a single source for heavy-duty computer networking equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, for example, Cisco spent $6.9 billion to acquire
Cerent, a fiber-optic technology developer that employed 275 people
and generated just $15 million in annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Bunnell writes, is not to acquire companies just for
the sake of deals. Cisco's goal is to establish itself as a leading
player in every market sector it touches, no matter the cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The core philosophy was to aim at the future,'' Bunnell
writes. ``The price tag of the acquisition was a secondary
condition to Chambers, who would pay whatever it took to get the
right company.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell also describes Cisco's work environment through several
lower-level employees, detailing how each interacts with their
managers.
</P>
<P>
   Bunnell gets bogged down trying to explain the technical details
of Cisco's strategy, but the technology lessons help in explaining
Chambers' long-term vision of developing Internet-style systems.
</P>
<P>
   If Chambers succeeds, the Internet will be the primary network
for carrying all types of communications, including long-distance
telephone calls and video chats. It may be a long shot to believe
that the telephone companies will change the century of work they
have put into building their networks to embrace the Cisco vision.
But if Chambers is right, Cisco would reap a windfall as the
leading developer of equipment used in Internet networks.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Bunnell cautions readers not to get too carried away
in believing the Cisco vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small innovative company,'' Bunnell writes, ``could come
along _ unburdened by hype, huge product lines and an organization
of thousands _ to become the next company of the future.''

   ``J.K. Lasser's How to Protect Your Retirement Savings from the
IRS''
</P>
<P>
   By Seymour Goldberg
</P>
<P>
   IDG Books, $24.95
</P>
<P>
   Many IRS rules deal with retirement plan accounts either while
you are alive or after your death, warns author, attorney and CPA
Seymour Goldberg. This book covers most of those rules, including
tax law changes that apply to retirement, including a chapter on
the new Roth IRA. The book is totally in a question and answer
format, which may make studying it less taxing. In addition to IRS
rules, tax-planning strategies and income tax-deferral techniques
are discussed. A valuable resource when considering retirement
savings.

   In 1997, more than 70 percent of all new U.S. businesses were

HARVARD WEIGHS TIGHTER RULES ON FACULTY'S INTERNET VENTURES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID ABEL   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ In Harvard's first university-wide effort to
revise its conflict of interest policy since 1948, a high-level
committee has released a set of new, Internet-minded guidelines
that, if adopted, would subtly tighten rules regulating the
faculty's outside teaching, research, and consulting.
</P>
<P>
   While some professors view the proposed rules as a necessary
step to define the boundaries broadened by cyberspace, others see
them as a potential violation of their academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Once unimaginable educational opportunities, such as professors
distributing lectures over the Internet or setting up Web-based
firms dispensing advice, are not covered under the existing rules.
The current policy allows professors to consult, teach or research
outside Harvard so long as the work doesn't consume more than 20
percent of their time, compromise the university, or conflict with
their obligations to students, colleagues or Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   But time is not the overriding factor under the proposed new
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Under them, faculty members would probably be prohibited from
teaching courses over the Internet for other institutions and doing
certain other forms of freelance work, even if it is done on their
own time _ after hours, during vacation, or over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   That's because the ease of dissemination makes it possible to
teach vast numbers of students around the world, often without
leaving campus and with only a modest investment of time. That,
according to a draft of the proposed guidelines obtained by the
Globe, opens up new forms of competition and potential conflict for
Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal follows the administration's decision in the fall
to force Harvard law professor Arthur Miller to give up an online
course he produced last summer for Concord University School of
Law.
</P>
<P>
   These new recommended guidelines issued by the provost's faculty
advisory group, Miller said, would only serve to further limit
academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before this proposal, I would say Harvard owned a part of my
body; now they have my heart and soul,'' said Miller, a voluble
professor once known for his TV show ``Miller's Court,'' which
helped explain the law to nonlawyers. ``I think it's very graphic
in demonstrating the expanded control Harvard is trying to exert
over the faculty.''
</P>
<P>
   While Harvard Law School Dean Robert Clark put an end to
Miller's fling with Concord, an online degree-granter founded by
Washington Post Co.'s Kaplan Educational Centers for which last
summer he taped 11 lectures, the new rules wouldn't categorically
bar professors from such ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, professors would have the opportunity to seek
permission from the dean of their respective school and the
corporation, Harvard's top administrative body. Yet, the parameters
deans would have to use in arriving at such a decision make
approval unlikely in most cases, the proposal's authors acknowledge
in their report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a flat prohibition,'' said Bob Mnookin, a law school
professor who helped draft the recommendations. ``Whether or not
someone is hemmed in depends on the reaction of their dean to what
is being proposed, and we can't really know that yet. My own hunch
is that deans are certainly sensitive to issues of academic
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the proposal differs in several ways from the 52-year-old
policy, a document amended last in 1997 when the administration
allowed professors a slight increase in the amount of summertime
money they could earn.
</P>
<P>
   Without approval, it bars professors from teaching, consulting,
or doing research at or for another educational institution or
for-profit organization at any time, not just during the academic
year. Those words were chosen to cover virtual teaching over the
Internet as well as work done during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also specifically states that professors, associate
professors or assistant professors may not hold academic
appointments at other institutions, except approved joint programs.
Though this has been tacitly understood, the existing guidelines do
not address the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The recommendations make it clear professors must be careful in
using the university's name and insignia in their outside work. In
such cases, the proposal explains, professors should limit
identification with Harvard to listing their formal titles, and
only when it's relevant.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, they must ensure the organization doesn't
misrepresent Harvard, suggesting sponsorship when no formal
association exists.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Thompson, Harvard's assistant provost and chairman of the
committee that wrote the proposal, insisted Miller's case did not
prompt the review of the current policy. Instead, he said, the
administration has recognized over the past few years that the new
information technologies have made it necessary to revise the
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can say, though, it was often used as an example of what any
adequate policy should be able to answer,'' Thompson said. ``What
Arthur Miller's case shows is that deans have to interpret the
extent to which a professor's relationship with another university
qualifies as a course.''
</P>
<P>
   Other professors, however, viewed Miller's venture as adding
urgency to why new rules are necessary sooner rather than later.
Sidney Verba, a professor of government also on the provost's
committee, said even after the rules are agreed on, ambiguity would
continue. Precedents such as Miller's case will establish case law,
he said, and that will continue to refine the lines.
</P>
<P>
   As for Miller preparing online lectures, Verba says prohibiting
them was justified because Concord had advertised that its course
starred a Harvard professor and because it fell under current rules
barring activities competitive to Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the ambiguity comes from the fuzzy relationship
people have with the new medium,'' he said. ``I think a lot of this
will be shaken out over time.''
</P>
<P>
   While clarifying vagaries clouding online education is a good
thing, according to law school professor Charles Nesson, the
university has to tread a fine line, being careful not to blunt new
forms of expression as Harvard protects its name.
</P>
<P>
   And for Nesson, who runs the law school's Berkman Center for
Internet and Society and has been approached to teach online
courses or sit on dot-com advisory boards, the issues are not
merely hypothetical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposal does crimp freedom, but I respect it,'' he said.
``But if the administration confines faculty, and doesn't give them
any meaningful outlet, then it's got really negative connotations.
That remains to be seen.''
</P>
<P>
   But Miller is already convinced that the new proposal denotes
more than connotes a negative turn for academic freedom.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this month, the committee expects to hear back on
the proposed guidelines from Harvard deans. Members of the Harvard
corporation are expected to take a final vote on the
recommendations by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who has become familiar to millions of Americans through
his high-profile forays into TV including a stint as legal editor
of ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' says the Internet is the next
frontier for teaching law to the masses. And he doesn't want to be
shut out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that is so bothersome about this is that I've been
here about 30 years and there has never been this kind of
restriction on my behavior,'' Miller said. ``I've been loyal to
Harvard, but there are skills I have that I like to share outside
of Harvard. ''

WHEN VILLAGES GO GLOBAL: HOW A BYTE OF KNOWLEDGE CAN BE DANGEROUS, 
TOO
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMON ROMERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ The prospects seemed bright when the
Internet was recently introduced in a remote part of the
mountainous Cotopoxi region in Ecuador. Under the guidance of aid
workers, Quichua-speaking peasants planned to gather crop
information and sell their crafts over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, though, it was discovered that some of the men were using
the computer to visit pornographic sites.
</P>
<P>
   Dismayed, the women began to question how the men were treating
them, and a debate ensued over the common practice of beating
women. Although use of the Internet was later curtailed, its
introduction unexpectedly generated discussion on a once taboo
topic.
</P>
<P>
   The changes created by the Internet in rich industrialized
nations are well known, affecting everything from how people date
to how they work. But less is known about the impact on societies
with limited contact with the rest of the world. As such
experiments multiply, at least one outcome seems certain: The way
people in these communities relate to each other and with the world
is likely to be altered forever.
</P>
<P>
   The Ecuadorean peasants were a case in point. ``The impact was
huge, but as it almost always is when the Internet makes it to such
a community, quite surprising,'' said Amalia Souza, a Brazilian
technology expert familiar with the project who has been an adviser
on programs that bring the Internet to poor communities in more
than 40 countries.
</P>
<P>
   A year and a half ago the women of the impoverished Wapishana
and Macushi tribes of Guyana were introduced to the Internet in a
project sponsored by Bill Humphries, who headed Guyana Telephone &AMP;
Telegragh at the time and was optimistic about technology's
money-making potential. The tribal power structures were shaken.
</P>
<P>
   The women began making money by marketing their intricate
hand-woven hammocks over the Web at $1,000 each. Feeling
threatened, the traditional regional leadership took control of the
organization, alienating and finally driving out the young woman
who ran the Web site. The weaving group fell into disarray.
</P>
<P>
   ``The events should be a case study for students of economics
and social work,'' wrote Indera Ramlall, who is Guyanese, in a
letter to a newspaper in the capital city of Georgetown. ``Economic
advancement is not just about technology and markets; more
fundamentally, it is about human relationships.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance for Progress was the great hope of the Kennedy
administration in the early 1960s. Its aim was to thwart communism
with U.S. aid to Central America, bridging the gap between poor and
rich societies by building roads, factories and bridges. But aid to
El Salvador tore the social fabric, contributed to the oppression
of the poor, increased the holdings of the land-owning classes and
helped fuel civil war.
</P>
<P>
   For many people in developing countries these days, inspiration
is increasingly drawn from Bill Gates. Some of the outwardly
successful development projects, like the Grameen Bank in
Bangladesh, are trying to deal with the unforeseen impact on the
people they are trying to help. The Grameen Bank provides small
amounts of credit to more than two million poor people, mainly
women, enabling them to invest in raising livestock or
entrepreneurial ventures like buying rickshaws. But critics say the
focus on women, who are considered more reliable borrowers than
men, has caused considerable tension between the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Redistributing income from men to women, sharing out the
misery of a shrinking cake, is not going to solve the people's
problems,'' said Para Teare, a London-based social scientist who
has studied such micro-lending programs, in a critique of the
Grameen Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as technology starts to blur the distinction between
industrialized countries and developing ones, social transition, if
not transformation, has become an issue in some of the world's most
remote regions. A recent issue of Cultural Survival, a magazine
that covers indigenous people and ethnic minorities, described
projects to bring the Web to communities as varied as the
reindeer-herding Sami of Scandinavia and northern Russian, the
aboriginal peoples of the Northwest Territories in Canada, the
ethnic minorities of Burma and native Hawaiians.
</P>
<P>
   These efforts represent a departure from the idea that
introducing new technologies to indigenous peoples will bring about
negative results. Such thinking, which dates back to Jean-Jacques
Rousseau, the 18th-century philosopher who lured Europe into
idealizing the simple lifestyle of the noble savage, appears to be
coming undone in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not realistic to think that as the world gets smaller
there should be enclaves untouched by Western technology,'' said
Robert Whelan, a writer on indigenous affairs at the Institute of
Economic Affairs in London. ``But it is realistic to realize that
traditional cultures can be very oppressive, especially for women
and wildlife, and that technology can help change this.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people think the double-edged nature of technology's impact
is beneficial. For the Grameen Bank, credit is considered a weapon
for alleviating poverty and oppressive policies affecting women.
Yet some societies are better equipped than others to deal with an
onslaught of technological change. The American Amish, who are
known for their rigid views about technology, have banned the car
and computer but not the pocket calculator. A few Amish also use
the Internet, albeit quietly.
</P>
<P>
   Others, though, are not so sure about placing too much value on
technology's liberating potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you introduce the Internet to people whose most urgent
need is to get enough food to eat each day,'' said Karin
Delgadillo, a coordinator at ChasquiNet, which provides technology
assistance to remote communities in Quito, Ecuador, ``you see there
are other priorities that need to be taken care of first.''

THE CONTINUING ADVENTURES OF THE CISCO KID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ALEX PHAM   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ After a speech to 600 children several years
ago, John T. Chambers found himself facing a young girl with a
stutter so severe she couldn't articulate her question. Mute and
frustrated, she cried before the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers then made a rare, uncharacteristic move. He showed his
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   The chief executive of Cisco Systems Inc., one of Silicon
Valley's most visible success stories of the 1990s, told a stunned
audience of his employees and their children that he had a learning
disability. It is a form of dyslexia that continues to plague him
in adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was dumb,'' Chambers reflected in an interview
with the Globe. ``But my parents were physicians, and they knew
better. So with their encouragement, I was able to work around it.
Education was the equalizer.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, 50, a former Wang Laboratories Inc. executive who
still has difficulty reading, is evangelizing about what he thinks
is the next big trend on the Internet: e-learning.
</P>
<P>
   When Chambers talks, Wall Street listens _ especially because
he's head of a company that makes the physical nuts and bolts of
the Internet, a company that's now worth more than Microsoft Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley also pays attention, because his prophecies tend
to come true. In the early 1990s, Chambers talked about the e-mail
revolution. In the mid-1990s, he championed e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Today it's e-learning, the notion that people can use the
Internet to master almost any subject, from algebra and physics to
management theory and corporate finance. Chambers believes
e-learning is far more efficient than traditional classroom
techniques because students can learn anytime, at their own pace,
with lower cost and more accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the next big killer application on the Internet,''
Chambers said. ``It's so big, it's going to make e-mail look like a
rounding error.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco is moving to make Chambers's e-learning vision a reality.
The company has spent more than $18 million in the last three years
developing what Chambers calls ``the largest e-learning laboratory
in the world,'' one that currently counts 60,000 students in 51
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which sets up ``networking academies,'' teaches
pupils how to become network technicians _ people who physically
wire computers together and link them to the Internet. The
Cisco-developed curriculum is distributed via the Internet to 3,108
high schools and community colleges.
</P>
<P>
   So fanatical is Chambers about e-learning that his speeches
sound like the sermons of a Southern minister, peppered with
rousing rhetoric and catchy phrases. He proselytizes about the
virtues of e-learning as a tool to help poor or disadvantaged
students throughout the world get the educations they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Networking academies create a level playing field,'' Chambers
said. ``It's turning a digital divide into an Internet bridge.
Education and the Internet are going to be the great global
equalizers.''
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Both elements worked for Chambers, who plowed
through law school and business school _ in spite of his reading
disability _ and whose fortunes rose with the explosion of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco's academies train legions of young people who can help
build the world's Internet highways, using Cisco products. They
promote a particularly intense use of the Internet, one that calls
for video streaming, teleconferencing, and online testing, as well
as text, music, and animated graphics.
</P>
<P>
   The benefit to Cisco is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more Internet traffic there is, the better it is for
Cisco,'' which sells routers and switches used to build the
information superhighway, said Michael Neiberg, managing director
of Chase Hambrect &AMP; Quist in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Which begs the question: Is Chambers a zealous philanthropist or
a cunning businessman?
</P>
<P>
   There is evidence, scattered throughout his career, that
Chambers is both.
</P>
<P>
   After overcompensating for an early distaste for academics with
a law degree from West Virginia University and an master's in
business administration from Indiana University in Bloomington,
Chambers went to work for IBM Corp., where he developed and honed
his sales skills. He learned that selling technology wasn't about
moving machines; it was about ``selling a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Chambers joined Wang, when the minicomputer
firm looked invincible. He became its top sales executive, a
position that in its final days came with a heavy price. When the
Massachusetts computer company began its downward spiral in the
late 1980s, it was Chambers's job to lay off thousands of workers.
Rather than finish his grim task, he quit in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the second or third round of layoffs, he began to feel
personally responsible,'' said Gary Daichendt, a Cisco executive
vice president who worked at Wang with Chambers. ``It tore him
apart. It's one of the only times I've seen him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Chambers landed at Cisco in 1991. At the time, the company had
just $70 million in annual sales and was often confused with Sysco,
the Houston food-distribution company. Chambers became president
and CEO in January 1995, after careful grooming by John P.
Morgridge, the company's leader prior to Chambers.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers and Morgridge proceeded to make Cisco employees and
shareholders wealthy through a bold bet on the Internet, a
relentless sales culture, and an aggressive acquisition strategy.
</P>
<P>
   A $1,000 investment in Cisco stock on Jan. 24, 1991, the day
Chambers arrived, would yield nearly $370,000 today. The average
nonmanagement Cisco employee has Cisco stock options worth almost
$300,000, thanks to a company policy that distributes 42 percent of
employee stock options to the rank-and-file.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Cisco is on track to becoming a $17 billion company,
measured in revenue. Its high-flying stock gives Cisco a market
capitalization of $451.8 billion, the second-highest value for a
public company in the world, after General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   But Chambers is trying not to rest on his laurels. Having
emerged from the ashes of Wang and other troubled technology
companies, Chambers and many on his executive team say they operate
under what they call ``healthy paranoia,'' the assumption that
things could come crashing down at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I worry about not moving fast enough,'' said Chambers. ``I
worry about getting away from our customers, like we did at Wang.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, friends and associates are quick to note his intense
drive. ``John has two moods: up and slightly up,'' said Daichendt.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Redfield, who worked at Digital Equipment Corp. for 18
years before joining Cisco in 1993, summed it up this way:
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of us here have come from places that have experienced
failure that we all have a paranoia. But we've also developed a
sense for things that you shouldn't do, and John developed that at
Wang.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Anderson, managing director of Yankee Group in Boston,
also noted that Chambers's drive is rooted in adversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Behind that very proper, Southern-gentleman attitude is one of
the most competitive people in the communications industry,''
Anderson said. ``He's got an iron will that is unbelievable. The
defining moment for John was when he had to participate in
dismantling Wang. In his mind, he decided he never wanted to do
that again.''
</P>
<P>
   That's partly why Chambers works hard to promote e-learning as
the next big trend on the Internet, positioning Cisco as a company
that is ahead of the curve, or at least appears to be. He envisions
a day when not only schools but companies and all sorts of
institutions will use the Internet to teach and train individuals.
</P>
<P>
   To show that it walks the talk, Cisco trains the majority of its
sales staff on the Internet. As a result, the company says it saves
more than $50 million a year on travel expenses associated with
bringing far-flung sales staff to company headquarters in San Jose
for classroom instruction, said Thomas M. Kelly, Cisco's director
of worldwide training.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly insisted, however, that cost savings is the least
important of the reasons for using online training. Employees
retain more because they're engaging the curriculum at their own
pace, Kelly said, and Cisco can more easily maintain and instantly
update the curriculum without the logistical hassles of reprinting
handouts and retraining instructors. It's also easier for Cisco
supervisors to check on the progress of individual employees, since
tests are taken online and scores are instantly tabulated.
</P>
<P>
   The same is true for networking academies, which Chambers touts
every chance he gets, from meetings with Wall Street analysts and
shareholders to geeks at the Comdex technology convention last
November in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   One of the stars of this program is Jacob Picart, an 18-year-old
senior at Wilcox High School in Santa Clara, Calif. Picart was
invited last year to a Cisco shareholders' meeting to help Chambers
show off the networking academies curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's taught me a lot,'' Picart said. ``When I'm done, it will
open doors for me. I'll be able to build your network for you.
That's what it amounts to.''
</P>
<P>
   It could also amount to a job paying a starting salary of more
than $30,000 a year, even if Picart chooses not to continue in
college. At the end of the two-year curriculum, students have the
option of taking an exam to become a Cisco Certified Networking
Associate, a distinction companies frequently look for when hiring
technicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certification is a nice supplement,'' said Leo Carey, a
networking academies instructor at Charlestown High School, which
enrolls about 120 students this year. ``But what's important is the
fact that these students, many of whom have never had computer
experience before, are now selecting career pathways. They're all
motivated to go to two- and four-year colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgridge, the chairman of Cisco's board and its former CEO,
calls the three-year-old program, which is on the verge of
graduating close to 60,000 students worldwide this year,
``enlightened self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We never thought it would grow to this scale,'' Morgridge
said. ``But now that it has, it has the potential to address the
manpower shortage in this industry, not only for Cisco but for our
customers as well. It's also enabled schools to buy and use our
equipment. So it's really been a win-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Commenting on Cisco's focus on training, Anderson noted: ``John
says the biggest impediment to Cisco's growth is that there aren't
enough people out there to install their equipment. There is an
enormous need for network people throughout the entire industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisco doesn't make money selling switches and routers to
schools. In fact, it gives much of its equipment away to schools.
What Cisco gets in return is a chance to impress thousands of
future engineers who are likely to develop a connection with the
company's products.
</P>
<P>
   It's a formula pioneered by Apple Computer Inc., which for
decades has given deep discounts to universities and their students
in the hopes that the students will develop a lifelong preference
for its Macintosh products. Intel Corp. and Sun Microsystems Inc.
are among other computer companies pursuing the same route.
</P>
<P>
   So Chambers, the sensitive philanthropist, is spending millions
of dollars promoting a socially conscious agenda that may turn out
to reward the company better than any stock return it has seen to
date.
</P>
<P>
   What will drive the world towards e-learning? The same thing
that drove Chambers to spend two years in elementary school with
tutors to deal with his dyslexia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survival,'' Chambers said.

SHOPPING MALLS DEVELOP INTERNET STRATEGIES

<P>
   &UR; By BOB TEDESCHI &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, amid the hype of dot-com retailing and the
run-up in e-commerce stocks, Web merchants had a lot of fun at the
expense of shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   When they were not explicitly stating that mall shopping was a
complete waste of time and money, they implied it. Analysts piled
on as well, some predicting that e-tailers would bring about the
demise of the mall altogether. Mall developers could do little but
watch their stock prices sink, and hope people came to their
senses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the airwaves less crowded by consumer e-commerce
advertisements and with investors fleeing Web merchants en masse,
Internet retailers suddenly seem a lot more vulnerable _ and malls
are poised for a counteroffensive.
</P>
<P>
   The United States' biggest mall developers, like General Growth
Properties and Simon Property Group, have ratcheted up their own
e-commerce strategies in recent months. Putting a new spin on
so-called clicks-and-mortar strategies, they are vying to fill the
gaps left by both traditional and Internet retailers, in areas like
electronic ordering and customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts may not slow the Internet shopping trend, but they
will at least ensure that the malls get a piece of the e-commerce
pie, and perhaps guarantee malls' continued relevance in the retail
environment.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that among all mall owners, Simon Property Group
has been the most aggressive in pushing its e-commerce strategies.
The Indianapolis-based company is the nation's largest mall
developer, with more than 200 shopping malls, including the
behemoth Mall of America near Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Simon created two separate business units,
Clixnmortar and TenantConnect.net, to enable shoppers to integrate
e-commerce into their trips to the mall. Through TenantConnect,
Simon is installing broadband Internet connections inside its own
malls and those of other developers, so that store merchants can
have high-speed access to the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, retailers may take part in two Clixnmortar
initiatives now under development: FastFrog.com, which is designed
for teen-agers, and YourSherpa.com, which is intended for adult
users.
</P>
<P>
   In both programs, shoppers carry hand-held scanners through the
mall, zapping items they are interested in buying. When shoppers
are finished, the items appear on a wish list in a mall Internet
kiosk for FastFrog, or on a shopper's check-out page at a different
Internet kiosk for YourSherpa.
</P>
<P>
   From the FastFrog kiosks, teen-agers can forward their wish
lists to friends and relatives. At the YourSherpa kiosks, users can
type in their credit-card numbers and check out immediately, or
delay the final purchase until they go home and log onto a
YourSherpa Web site. Either way, YourSherpa shoppers are given the
option of picking up the items at the mall or having them wrapped
and delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, mall owners get no cut of the sale, as the proceeds
go entirely to the merchant whose store sells the product.
According to Shannon Haslund, vice president of operations for
Clixnmortar, the compensation details could change later. But for
now, mall owners are operating the kiosks primarily to generate
foot traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Haslund said FastFrog had been in tests at two Atlanta malls
since November, while a test run of YourSherpa.com began in
December in Atlanta's Lenox Square Mall, with one retailer, FAO
Schwarz. Based on the success of both programs, the company hopes
to roll them out nationally by the end of the year, she said.
</P>
<P>
   John Condon, manager of the FAO Schwarz in the Lenox Square
Mall, said YourSherpa had been ``tremendously valuable'' to the
store. Nearly all of the 700 shoppers who picked up a scanning
device from the YourSherpa kiosk have made purchases. The average
YourSherpa order, Condon said, was between $180 and $200, compared
with about $60 for an average store order.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, he said, no merchandise had been returned from
YourSherpa purchases, compared with an average return rate of about
8 percent for store purchases. ``People don't have to finalize the
purchase right then,'' Condon said. ``It gives you a little more
time to decide. And you're not constrained by how much you can
carry.''
</P>
<P>
   General Growth Properties, the nation's second-largest mall
developer, is also moving quickly to capitalize on the Internet,
according to John Bucksbaum, the company's chief executive. ``We
were fairly certain that the Internet wouldn't result in our
demise, since we didn't think people would quit going out to do
their shopping,'' he said. ``So we asked, 'How can we turn this
into an opportunity?'''
</P>
<P>
   The answer was Mallibu.com. The Web site will eventually link to
retailers in each of the company's 136 malls, allowing shoppers to
buy goods online directly from those retailers and have them
dropped off by a delivery service. Mallibu, which will begin
offering transactions online in June, also enables General Growth
to capitalize on one of the Internet's strengths: data tracking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon knows more about one customer after one trip than we do
about a person who comes in year after year,'' Bucksbaum said. By
tracking purchases online and obtaining e-mail addresses through
registrations, he said, ``we'll be able to e-mail a person about
new items coming into the store, or sales.''
</P>
<P>
   General Growth will charge retailers an amount not yet
determined for plugging into the malls' Mallibu.com Internet
systems, which are being installed, but it will not take a
commission from each sale. Still, the company could benefit from
any incremental Web sales, Bucksbaum said, since General Growth,
like other mall developers, takes between 4 percent and 8 percent
of a retailer's total sales beyond a certain level.
</P>
<P>
   According to Elaine Rubin, chairwoman of Shop.org, an Internet
retailing trade group, the efforts of Simon and General Growth
Properties ``are enlightening many other folks in the real estate
business.''
</P>
<P>
   That includes nonmall shopping centers. According to Charlotte
Ellis, senior vice president of Konover Property Trust, one of the
nation's largest developers of shopping centers that are not
enclosed malls, the company has begun to install high-speed
Internet lines in its 152 retail centers across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Konover plans to offer free Internet service
by year-end to users who agree to have their local shopping center
serve as their home page. Ellis said the border of the user's
screen would probably include advertisements and links to those
local retailers, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers might eventually order goods from the local retailers,
she said, and then pick them up or have them delivered. And while
Konover is passing along some of the costs of the program to its
retailers, the company is making a ``large'' undisclosed investment
upfront to start things off. ``In the meantime, it immediately sets
us apart from our competition,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   The effort also continues to stretch the notion of Internet
shopping into something that few thought it would be even six
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shopping really hasn't changed much in 5,000 years,'' Ellis
said. ``We know there are going to be some big changes because of
the Internet, but ultimately it'll all be about saving time.''

MONOPOLY HELPS SEND YOUR E-MAIL, FOR FREE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ALEX PHAM   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EMERYVILLE, Calif. _ One of the Internet's biggest monopolies is
a little outfit called Sendmail. Its software powers more than 75
percent of all e-mail servers on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And there's nothing the Justice Department can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   That's because Sendmail's core software is free. It always has
been, from the day in 1979 that graduate student Eric Allman wrote
the program in the computer science department at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Hard to imagine today, but before Sendmail came around, there
were islands of separate computer systems that had no way of
``talking'' to each other.
</P>
<P>
   To send a message to someone on a different system, a person had
to get up and move to a computer that was hooked into the other
system. Sendmail became the glue that pieced all these networks
together.
</P>
<P>
   The program became so popular that Allman found himself spending
all of his time answering questions from Sendmail users.
Eventually, he became so swamped with queries that in the late
1980s he set up an organization of volunteers, Sendmail.org, to
help out.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, Allman never made a dime from Sendmail, apart
from the occassional speaking engagement. But after years of giving
free support on his own time to Sendmail users, many of whom were
Fortune 500 companies, Allman decided to try to scrape enough money
together to give himself a salary and hire a couple of engineers to
improve the software. Hat in hand, Allman asked half a dozen large
companies that used Sendmail to donate $50,000 each to the project.
Nearly all refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies all said, `Why should we pay for something
that's free?' It was the tragedy of the commons,'' Allman recalled
with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Allman then ran into a former colleague, Greg Olsen. A
gregarious graduate of Cornell University and a former Boston taxi
driver, Olsen listened to Allman's story and concluded that there
was a business opportunity in Sendmail. But Allman insisted that
the core Sendmail software remain a free product and that its
source code continue to be available to everyone, very much like
way the Linux operating system is distributed.
</P>
<P>
   So in March 1998, the two came up with Sendmail Inc., a
``hybrid'' company.
</P>
<P>
   Plain vanilla versions of Sendmail remain free of charge and are
supported by Sendmail.org, a band of seven core volunteers
connected via a server in Allman's Berkeley home.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Sendmail Inc. sells customized, souped-up,
easy-to-use versions of Sendmail software. It also sells support
and technical services, such as software installation and
trouble-shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Olsen and Allman predicted the company would employ a maximum of
50 people. But Sendmail has more than 160 employees and is still
growing. Olsen is chief executive, still using the people skills he
developed as a Beantown taxi driver. Allman spends his days as
chief technical officer, happily tinkering with the Sendmail
program.
</P>
<P>
   One factor in Sendmail's seemingly unfettered growth: the
explosion of e-mail. About 3.4 trillion e-mails were sent in 1998,
according to rough estimates by eMarketer, a technology research
firm in New York City. That's about 9.4 billion messages a day, the
vast majority of which go through servers running Sendmail.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers could only have grown last year, because the number
of e-mailboxes spiked 73 percent, to 569.2 million, from 333.5
million in 1998, according to Messaging Online, an industry
publication.
</P>
<P>
   Though not yet profitable, Sendmail has attracted $53 million in
funding from the likes of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Private
Equity; Bill Joy and Andy Bechtolsheim, cofounders of Sun
Microsystems Inc.; and Eric Schmidt, chief executive of Novell.
</P>
<P>
   All of this amuses Allman, who sports a ``rat tail,'' over a
foot of neatly braided hair that hangs from the nape of his neck.
Allman said he never expected to be one of the many dot-coms of
Silicon Valley. He had even decided to locate his company in
Emeryville, nestled just south of Berkeley, because he ``wanted to
talk about things other than our stock options.''
</P>
<P>
   Confesses Allman, ``I haven't really structured my life to get
rich.''

FIRM'S LOSING NO SLEEP OVER DOT-COMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BETH HEALY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until recently, bragging rights went to the venture capitalists
with the longest lists of dot-coms waiting to go public. Now, the
bragging about IPO potential has quieted significantly.
</P>
<P>
   William Thorndike Jr. is one VC who hasn't had to change his
tune over the past few weeks. He and his colleagues at Boston's
Housatonic Partners _ ``value'' guys of the venture arena _ are
singing the same tune they have had since starting out in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find no flashy consumer Web sites in Housatonic's
portfolio. No online peddlers of pet food or lipstick. No petroleum
exchanges or auction sites. And the firm is rarely dependent on
IPOs to cash out of its investments.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Thorndike wasn't gnashing his teeth, as some rivals
were, during the Nasdaq's vicious plunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're reasonably well insulated from those moves,'' he says.
It's welcome payback for resisting the dot-com bandwagon, he adds.
``The pendulum swung hard in the other direction for quite some
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Housatonic's main fare might be called humdrum in technology
circles. There's roadside rescue for cell-phone customers, cable
TV, and nonhazardous liquid waste management. One of its greatest
successes was a file storage company. That's right, storage of good
old paper files.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' Thorndike says, ``at some point, you exceed your
filing cabinet's capacity. So you put it in a box and send it
away.''
</P>
<P>
   These businesses have one thing in common that Housatonic looks
for in all its investments: a regular fee stream, or ``recurring
revenues,'' as Thorndike says. Whether it's TV watchers paying
cable bills or restaurant owners paying waste haulers to clean
their grease traps each week, it's money in the door on a
dependable basis. The firm likes real revenues and customer lists,
not wish lists on how sales and profits might materialize.
</P>
<P>
   As you might imagine, this rules out fresh-faced start-ups.
Housatonic tends to back later-stage companies. And it often
finances buyouts, where it takes investment control of a company
and gets directly involved with management, with an eye to growing
the business and reselling it, Tom Lee-style.
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely does Housatonic consider an IPO as an exit from an
investment; the norm is a sale. Last year, for example, it sold the
paper storage company First American Records Management of San
Jose, Calif., for nearly $41.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some recent investments show that Housatonic is willing to
invest in newer technology, if the revenue stream is clear.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the firm put $3 million into USData Centers.com, a
Web-hosting company, in a deal led by BancBoston Capital. The
investment was somewhat smaller than Housatonic's usual range of $5
million to $10 million. But Housatonic liked the monthly fees that
go with hosting Web sites. The deal came through an angel investor
and cable entrepreneur, Bob Fanch. And Housatonic had done deals
with BancBoston before.
</P>
<P>
   Two other recent deals include a niche publisher in Washington,
the Governance Institute, and a second-tier player in the DSL
market, bringing high-speed Internet access to suburban areas in
central California.
</P>
<P>
   The latter company, Arrival Communications, is a start-up, a
company that's just acquired a license to switch existing Internet
clients to DSL. Says Thorndike, ``Telecom is an area where we're
willing to go in slightly earlier than usual.''
</P>
<P>
   If Housatonic's portfolio doesn't seem to have a lot of zing,
its returns sure do. The firm is on track to hand its investors a
return exceeding 60 percent for the sixth straight year.
</P>
<P>
   Housatonic oversees a modest $200 million in two funds. A third
is being mulled for later this year. But that doesn't mean the five
partners are setting out to raise a billion-dollar portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   When you raise big piles of money, you've got to put them to
work. The venture firms that have amassed mammoth funds of late
will be facing significant pressure to invest that money both fast
and wisely. And their investors may have to get used to less lavish
returns.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, in the riskier sectors of the venture market,
Thorndike says financing deals were falling apart. ``There were
term sheets all over America being revisited,'' he says.

MORE TRAFFIC FOR STUDENT.COM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROSS KERBER   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Student.com Inc. says it is seeing success with a recent
redesign: Traffic to the Boston company's Web site is up about 75
percent since a new layout was introduced April 3, CEO Rick
Berenson says.
</P>
<P>
   The new look includes more reviews of movies and music, but
continues the closely held company's strategy of commissioning
articles on news and culture from writers at student newspapers
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Student.com pays its authors, but the content is both cheaper
and of better quality than material used by competing sites,
executives say.
</P>
<P>
   Audiences ``really want good information,'' says Berenson, 41,
who was recently brought in to oversee the company. Founded by six
students at Yale and Columbia universities in 1995, Student.com now
counts MediaOne among its investors.
</P>
<P>
   The site eschews fancy graphics, which Berenson says helps it
download quickly _ even onto computers with slower Internet
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Changing demographics
</P>
<P>
   Young adults are moving online more quickly than expected,
according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by Chicago-based Round Table Group Inc., found that
67 percent of Americans ages 18 to 24 use the Internet ``to gather
key information,'' compared to an average of 46 percent nationally.
Among those who live in households with Internet access, 73 percent
of young adults have used the Internet for work.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not distinguish between the types of sources that
young people are using, meaning some may only be reading
traditional news sources online. Still, the study's authors say the
data show an opportunity for new-media enterprises to capture young
users.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditional media has a right to feel fearful of these rapidly
changing demographics,'' said Round Table Group's chief executive,
Russ Rosenzweig.
</P>
<P>
   The poll sampled 1,014 US households.
</P>
<P>
   More news from Europe
</P>
<P>
   NewsEdge Corp. has boosted its European news sources.
</P>
<P>
   NewsEdge makes filtering software that scans news and
press-release wires. Users can set the company's programs to seek
out and list articles that include certain terms or company stock
ticker symbols, sparing editors and traders the burden of scanning
massive amounts of wire copy.
</P>
<P>
   To date, most of NewsEdge's content has been from US sources,
such as the Associated Press and major newspapers. But its European
customer count tripled last year as the Burlington, Mass. company
signed up partners such as Agence France Presse, Bridge News,
Deutsche Press Agnetur, and Reuters to supply material. Last week,
NewsEdge announced that more European providers, including the BBC,
the Daily Telegraph, ATS Swiss National News, and PR Line France
had been added.

EARN A COMPUTER DEGREE _ FOR FREE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.2000 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can't afford a computer science degree from MIT? Well, Philip
Greenspun can offer you the next best thing: a one-year crash
course in computing taught by top-notch instructors, many with
advanced MIT degrees. And you won't have to pay a penny.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, you will have to already have a college degree, and
an enviably high score of 1400 on the Scholastic Aptitude Test. And
you'll have to be prepared to work 12-hour days, six days a week
for an entire academic year. But is that really too much to ask?
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 people don't think so. They're scheduled to arrive
in Cambridge, Mass. in September as part of the first entering
class of ArsDigita University (www.arsdigita.org/university).
</P>
<P>
   ``We want this to be the greatest experience of any of their
lives,'' says Greenspun, who felt the same way when he entered MIT
as a computer science student. After earning a bachelor's degree in
1982, he stayed on for a master's and doctorate.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspun was into ``open source'' software before it was cool.
He wanted to build a software company that would publish the
underlying source code for every program it produced, even letting
noncustomers download the source code and use it free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   This hardly sounds like a way to get rich, yet Greenspun and a
group of like-minded programmers have managed it. Their ArsDigita
Corp. takes in about $20 million a year, selling open source code
to major corporations. Part of their profits are now being pumped
into the ArsDigita Foundation, created to provide Internet training
to young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company made us all fairly wealthy, wealthy enough to put
a million bucks a year into this,'' says Greenspun.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation established a $10,000 prize for the best
noncommercial Web site developed by young people. But Greenspun
wanted to do more. He thinks there are plenty of educated, capable
people who could do great things on the Internet if they just had
the technical training. He's especially keen on the computer
science curriculum at MIT, where Greenspun teaches a course on
software engineering for Web applications.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, MIT won't accept undergraduate applicants who
already have a bachelor's degree from some other institution. So
mid-career types with a sudden yen for top-notch computer training
are frozen out. That's what Greenspun hopes to change.
</P>
<P>
   His company is building its first classroom in its Cambridge
corporate headquarters. Already 30 students have been accepted to
the program _ people with proven intellectual ability in the form
of college transcripts and high SAT scores.
</P>
<P>
   The tough entry requirement ensures that only students with a
chance of surviving the tough curriculum will be accepted. Even so,
Greenspun expects a fairly high dropout rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a reason why not everybody goes through the MIT CS
(computer science) curriculum. It's really pretty hard.''
</P>
<P>
   So the student body mainly consists of overachievers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the applicants are college professors . . . some of
them are medical doctors,'' says Greenspun. ``They're not looking
for a job with some sort of big organization. They have some sort
of mission that they're on.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, some of them may want to use their training to
create an excellent Web site related to the industry in which they
already work. That fits in with the university's goal: ``to
encourage the development of Web services that work better for
users and society.''
</P>
<P>
   But why give away such training to people who often could afford
to pay for it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything ArsDigita does is free,'' replies Greenspun. The
company's software is purchased by the original customer, but then
given away free to anyone else who wants it. In the same way, all
classroom lectures and exercises at ArsDigita University will be
published on the Internet for free use by anyone who wants them.
Indeed, Greenspun already publishes the materials for his MIT
class.
</P>
<P>
   ArsDigita courses will be taught by Greenspun and a number of
his colleagues at ArsDigita Corp., at least 15 of whom have MIT
doctorates in computer science. He's also signed up a number of
other instructors. One is Edward Tufte, professor emeritus of
political science, statistics, and computer science at Yale, and
author of several famous books on the visual representation of
data.
</P>
<P>
   The school isn't accredited. Greenspun says that because it's
not a traditional four-year institution, the usual accreditation
bodies haven't created any applicable standards. But he believes
that graduates will have no trouble getting jobs, or being accepted
into top graduate schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``A personal recommendation from an ArsDigita U instructor will
carry a lot of weight,'' Greenspun says.
</P>
<P>
   As for finding employment at an Internet company, he figures
that should be a snap for his students, who should be better
trained than many people with more traditional computer science
degrees. Besides, notes Greenspun: ``The average Web site these
days . . . can't afford to be that picky.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ They see you long before you see them,
darting out from the shadows beneath the ``Buy Here, Pay Here''
sign.
</P>
<P>
   Are those really Ray-Bans, or do car salesmen get some kind of
deal on sucker-seeking lenses?
</P>
<P>
   In their quest for a detour around this daunting dash to the
showroom door, millions of car buyers are turning to the Internet.
The numbers are growing by the month, with nearly 60 percent of all
buyers doing at least some Web research before taking the plunge,
according to one survey. That's up from 25 percent just two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the auto industry agrees that the Internet will
revolutionize car sales and that the number of Web-surfing buyers
will continue to rise. But the number of people who actually buy
cars directly through the Internet is still tiny, less than 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   That's because, for all the hoopla about cybersales, automobiles
are not like books or compact discs or holiday fruit baskets.
There's more paperwork, for one thing. Plus, people still want to
drive before they buy. Even if you're comfortable with the idea of
pointing, clicking and waiting for UPS to drop an Oldsmobile on
your stoop, it's not quite that simple _ particularly if you have a
trade-in, if you're financing the car or if you're not absolutely
certain which car you want.
</P>
<P>
   But what Internet auto-buying services advertise is still
impressive: Find a car, negotiate a price and get a head start on
figuring out how to pay for it. It was enough to entice me, and I'm
one of those odd people who once enjoyed the joust.
</P>
<P>
   I sold cars briefly during my wayward youth and for years
afterward fancied myself something of an expert. I had fun turning
the car seller's script around whenever I went car shopping. I'd
rush up, shake a salesman's hand and say, ``What do I have to do to
make you sell me a car today?''
</P>
<P>
   My expertise let me make some great deals. Unfortunately, they
were almost always on awful cars. (My wife once asked on the way
home: ``Why does this car already sound like it's falling apart?''
The answer was soon obvious: It was falling apart.)
</P>
<P>
   I finally started buying Hondas, which so far have lived up to
their fail-safe reputation. This introduced me to a new negotiating
technique. I learned to pay whatever the dealer wanted, even if it
was more than the sticker price. Even if it was more than Donald
Trump's annual hairstyling bill.
</P>
<P>
   This time, I decided to try keeping an open mind and a closed
wallet. I started with a stroll through the Web's virtual showroom
for reliable but possibly less-dear Honda alternatives. Economic
reality helped. I just got a new sport utility a few months ago,
but my daughter snatched it up and took it off to college. She did
not take the payment book.
</P>
<P>
   So there'd be no need for my PC to swap cookies with some
hoity-toity microchip at Lexus or BMW. I set my Web browser on
``cheap'' and began the hunt. I started at a site called
CarPrices.com. It was a good start.
</P>
<P>
   Like many sites, CarPrices offers lots of info-choices. Click a
make and model, and you can get prices (what the dealer supposedly
pays, as well as the sticker price), including a breakdown of
options. You can also get a list of standard equipment for each
sub-model and find out what comes in option packages.
</P>
<P>
   There are reviews of most models, plus a list of rebates and
factory-subsidized lease deals. There's also a search form for used
cars. There's even a form that CarPrices promises to forward to
dealers who want to bid for your business.
</P>
<P>
   For that, you have to put down a $50 deposit by typing in a
credit card number. I wasn't ready to think about deposits just
yet. I checked a few more sites, including manufacturers and online
magazines. The volume of information was staggering, and a good
deal of it even appeared useful. Many of the reviews were more
critical and detailed than those found in traditional ``car buff'
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   With a few clicks on ``print,'' I soon had a neat pile of specs,
pictures and stories. I was able to compare features, crash-test
results and, at least to some extent, reputations for reliability.
A list of prime candidates emerged swiftly.
</P>
<P>
   By lucky coincidence, it was time for the annual Fort Lauderdale
International Auto Show, which gave me a chance for some
seat-of-the-pants impressions. The limitations of shop-at-home auto
comparison became obvious the moment I banged my head getting into
one of the cars on my list. That was no digital headache.
</P>
<P>
   Some cars were easier to get into but made me eager to get out.
My computer-room chair turned out to be a lot more comfortable (and
wider) than several driver's seats. A number of price-leading
models that looked sharp in Web scans looked shabby in the metal.
Some appeared to have been painted with a roller and upholstered in
material that resembled a pair of velour pants I threw away in
1977. One car had a trunk opening the size of a mail slot.
</P>
<P>
   So although I hadn't so much as turned a key, my choices were
going down. And the prices were going up. I focused on two cars
that I felt most comfortable squeezing into, physically as well as
financially: the Volkswagen Golf and the Mazda Protege.
</P>
<P>
   My research made me lean toward the Golf for a couple of
reasons: It's a hatchback, which adds utility to a small car, and
it has standard anti-lock brakes. I like the idea of being able to
stop on rain-slick Interstate 95 before I slide under the
tractor-trailer up ahead. I decided to e-mail for a price on the
Golf and then drive one.
</P>
<P>
   For the price, I tried a service called Autobytel.com, which
claims to be No. 1 in online auto sales. In the first quarter of
this year, it claims $3.4 billion in sales through dealers, which
pay the service for sending customers their way. I found Autobytel
at a catch-all car site called Edmunds.com, which offers a range of
information and services similar to CarPrices.
</P>
<P>
   I filled out a detailed form, providing my e-mail address, my
phone number and information about the make and model I wanted.
Autobytel promised a call-back and price quote within 48 hours.
Meanwhile, I went to a dealership for a test drive and some
old-fashioned haggling.
</P>
<P>
   My daughter was home for a visit, so I took her along. I wanted
her opinion, and I was hoping she'd like the Golf enough to swap my
sport utility back. The Golf seemed well-made and nicely finished,
but we felt a little cramped, and I wanted more power. My daughter
still wanted my car. The salesman was professional and polite but
sensed our lack of commitment. He let us out the door without
offering any inducement other than the sticker price: $17,925.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, I got a phone message from a salesman at another
dealership, referred by Autobytel. He said he wanted to talk about
what I wanted in a car. He did not leave a price. I called back and
told him I'd given all the information requested. He suggested I
drop by and see if I liked one of the cars in his stock. He clearly
didn't want to give me a price unless I pressed for it. I told him
I'd look around and let him know.
</P>
<P>
   That left my other choice, the Mazda. My wife and I went to a
dealer, drove two of them (a standard model and an upscale version)
and were pretty much bowled over. The car easily passed the head,
trunk and butt tests. This time, it was easier getting a price than
a car.
</P>
<P>
   The salesman couldn't find one in stock with anti-lock brakes,
and I wouldn't consider a car without them. And even with all my
computer-aided research, I'd missed an important detail: The
upgraded brakes were available only as part of a $1,580 option
package on the most expensive model. I'd have to buy the moon roof
to get better brakes. (What sense does that make? None, of course,
unless you're selling cars rather than buying them.)
</P>
<P>
   The salesman did make an offer: $17,150 (reduced from $17,870),
assuming a car with the right options could be found. I'd also get
a $1,000 factory rebate, bringing my price down to $16,150 _ below
the dealer's cost, which Web sites agreed was $16,471.
</P>
<P>
   (No need to cry for the dealer. Since my rebate was coming from
the factory, he would make nearly $700 off me immediately. He'd
also get the ``holdback'' _ a percentage of the cost that car
manufacturers refund to dealers after a car is sold. That's one way
dealers can sell a car ``at invoice'' but still make a profit. Most
Web sites note the holdback. In the Protege's case, it's 2 percent.
Manufacturers occasionally offer additional dealer incentives on
some models, usually slow sellers. Some Web sites note these, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Since the first dealer didn't have an actual car to sell me yet,
and I was pretty sure I wanted a Protege, I decided to see if the
Internet would help me find one. It did, and at a better price.
</P>
<P>
   This time, I tried a site called CarPoint.com, which offers its
own quotes-by-e-mail service. The service, free to consumers,
offered a choice of two dealers in my ZIP code. The not-so-small
print warned that really good deals might not be available on the
most in-demand models. Luckily, I couldn't afford any of those.
</P>
<P>
   I filled out a form and clicked the send button. I got a call in
under an hour from Richie, another dealer's ``Internet sales
manager.'' He told me he'd search his inventory for the car I
wanted and get back to me with a price at 10 a.m. the next day. I
told him I'd already started looking and pricing similar cars. He
said he was sure he'd satisfy me.
</P>
<P>
   He called back right at the appointed time to tell me he had a
car. It was white (which I liked), and it had an additional option
(a $250 cassette tape player, which I didn't need). He gave me a
price right off the bat: $16,788. With rebate, it came to $15,788.
That's against a sticker price of $18,120. I drove over to take a
look.
</P>
<P>
   (If I'd had a trade-in, I'd have lingered on the Web to find out
the wholesale value of my car to help prepare for negotiations. If
I wanted to finance the car, I'd also have been able to compare
finance rates from the manufacturer, banks and other lenders. Plus
use an on-line calculator to figure my loan payments.)
</P>
<P>
   When I got to the dealer's lot, the Ray-Ban brigade was waiting.
But they cleared a path when I mentioned Richie's name. He handed
me the key and let me drive off to make certain the car was what I
wanted. It was. I didn't see any point in further browsing. I
signed the papers and came back later that afternoon to pick up my
new car.
</P>
<P>
   So I did it: I bought a car online. Sort of. What I really did
is save some time and, maybe, some money. Has anyone come up with a
better use for the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   (BOX) CAR-SHOPPING WEB SITES
</P>
<P>
   _ Big catch-all sites: It's impossible to catalog them, because
they're growing and changing by the week. They include
Kelleybluebook.com, Edmunds.com, Carprices.com, CarPoint.com,
Cars.com and many more. Most include information about used as well
as new cars. Most let you research nearly all makes and models for
features, crash ratings, driving impressions and price. There are
also optional for-fee services, such as a title search, that may
show whether a specific car has been returned as a lemon.
</P>
<P>
   _ Potential drawbacks: A recent survey found that some dealer
prices listed on these sites were inaccurate, possibly leading
buyers to overpay. Other information can also be wrong or
misleading, so it's useful to compare several sites for
discrepancies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Manufacturer sites: Like nearly all businesses, car companies
have their own Web sites. Most are easy to find (Chevrolet.com,
Honda.com). All include up-to-date information about rebates, lease
deals and special finance rates. Many offer quotes-by-e-mail. Among
the most sophisticated, GMBuyPower allows consumers to check dealer
inventory anywhere in the country, then e-mail for prices.
</P>
<P>
   _ Dealer sites: You can link to them from manufacturer sites or
look for the Web addresses in local car ads. An increasing number
of dealer sites allow you to search their inventory for a car with
the options and colors you want. Some even include prices _ but
they're almost always sticker. E-mail to find out if the dealer's
interested in making an offer.
</P>
<P>
   _ Online buying services: Many, like Autobytel.com, are
essentially dealer-referral services. When you e-mail for a quote,
you're giving your name, phone number and e-mail address to a car
salesman, who will call you. Then you handle any negotiations.
Other services, such as CarsDirect.com and DriveOff.com, are
brokers that promise a more hands-on role in finding a car and
negotiating a firm price on your behalf. For that, you'll probably
have to put down a deposit. At least one on-line service,
Priceline.com, lets you submit an offer to a number of dealers
anonymously. If a dealer accepts your price and you buy the car,
you pay Priceline $50.
</P>
<P>
   _ Advantages: A J.D. Power survey of dealers released this month
found that consumers who used an on-line buying service saved an
average of $490 on new cars.
</P>
<P>
   _ Potential drawbacks: While most services are ``free'' to the
buyer, the dealer usually pays the service a fee when a sale is
made. The services also pay Web site operators a bounty for each
sale. Somebody has to pay for all this.
</P>
<P>
   DOS AND DON'TS FOR ONLINE CAR SHOPPERS
</P>
<P>
   Do:
</P>
<P>
   _ Take plenty of time to browse the Web; it's faster than
driving to dealerships.
</P>
<P>
   _ Check several catch-all sites and consider using more than one
quote service.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look at the manufacturer's Web site for up-to-date information
on rebates or discounted financing.
</P>
<P>
   _ Expect calls from salespeople if you use a referral service.
</P>
<P>
   Don't:
</P>
<P>
   _ Expect to buy a car without leaving home. You may find a
dealer willing to deliver, but you'll probably want to see and
drive several models before buying.
</P>
<P>
   _ Believe everything you read. Prices can be wrong, rebates
lapsed, models mixed up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Assume that because you got the price over the Internet that
it's the lowest possible.

&HT;     BUTCH CARTER, QUICK WITH A LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Butch Carter is definitely a wimp, certifiably a pest, probably
a fool and quite possibly a liar and a phony. Other than that, his
prospects for a long and fruitful coaching career are excellent.
</P>
<P>
   So sue me.
</P>
<P>
   Carter certainly has been known to sue for less. Just before the
NBA playoffs began, Carter hit New York Knicks forward Marcus Camby
with a $5 million defamation lawsuit. Carter claimed that was the
damage done his reputation because Camby uttered the words ``he's a
liar'' last week.
</P>
<P>
   Which immediately raises the question: What reputation? Carter
coaches the Toronto Raptors, and he's not even the most prominent
Carter on the team. As near as anybody can tell, Butch Carter's job
amounts to keeping a seat warm on the bench while Vince Carter does
all the Raptors' heavy lifting.
</P>
<P>
   North America wouldn't know or care that Butch Carter exists if
not for a lawsuit that gives frivolous a bad name. It seems Camby
told a New York newspaper last week that just before a trade to the
Knicks two seasons ago, he and John Wallace had received assurances
they would be the cornerstone of the Toronto franchise. The
assurances, Camby said, came from one Butch Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Camby did call Butch Carter a liar. He added, ``No one likes
him, and no one wants to play for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, sticks and stones. Any self-respecting man would respond
in one of two ways. He either ignores the words, or he offers his
side of the story. He doesn't run to the courthouse like a little
boy tattling to mommy because the kid next door gave him a boo-boo.
Butch Carter dropped the suit on Tuesday, which obligates no one to
forget his foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   `I'm not going to allow my three sons to wake up and see in the
national media that I'm a liar,'' Butch Carter said the other day,
insisting he would drop the matter in return for an apology.
</P>
<P>
   Please.
</P>
<P>
   First, Butch Carter's relationship with his sons is doomed if
their opinion of him can be undermined by the bitter words of a
scorned player.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Butch Carter later gave the ``my three sons''
explanation the reek of insincerity by crowing that he managed to
take the heat off his players entering the first playoff series in
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Butch Carter is hardly above reproach when it comes to
slinging mud at convenient targets. When Carter isn't making
allegations _ so far unsubstantiated, two decades after the fact or
fiction _ that Indiana coach Bob Knight is a racist, he is
threatening to smear Camby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We drafted Marcus; we know a lot about Marcus that's bad,''
Butch Carter said, the slime dripping from his words. ``If I wanted
to open that file up...''
</P>
<P>
   While Butch Carter was peddling nonsense, Jeff Van Gundy went
about his job of coaching the Knicks. Van Gundy put in a
double-teaming defense in a victory that rendered the only relevant
Carter on the Raptors, Vince, as useless as a thong bikini on the
North Pole.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto players would have to be blind, deaf and too dumb to
spell IQ if they didn't pick up on the panic their coach is trying
to pass off as either gamesmanship or righteous indignation. How is
a visiting team supposed to withstand an environment as hostile as
Madison Square Garden when the coach comes down with a case of
rabbit ears?
</P>
<P>
   Players aren't about to follow a coach like that into battle.
They'll shoot him in the back when he's not looking just to give
themselves a fighting chance. NBA players and coaches alike spot
and exploit weakness the way a shark senses blood in the water.
Push back or be pushed around forever. Put up or shut up.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, Karl Malone characterized the new generation of
NBA players as ``knuckleheads.'' Imagine the mocking laughter that
would have ensued if Malone had been slapped with a class-action
defamation suit.
</P>
<P>
   That's the sort of buffoon territory that Butch Carter has
staked out for himself. P.J. Carlesimo didn't do this kind of
caterwauling after he got choked by Latrell Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Carter should have thought through the strategy of filing
frivolous defamation suits a little more carefully. He may find
himself on the receiving end of a legitimate defamation suit soon
enough. He recently finished a book alleging that while he was
playing at Indiana, he heard Knight direct racial slurs at a
teammate. The implication was that the teammate was Isiah Thomas,
who vehemently denies the charge.
</P>
<P>
   Knight subsequently offered an explanation of why Butch Carter
may not be the most reliable of witnesses. It seems that Butch
Carter fell out of favor after scamming the Indiana athletic
department out of more than $1,000 in long-distance calls. When
Knight heard about it, he told Butch Carter to never, ever ask for
help in landing a job.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Carter is going to need help landing a job soon enough. He
is finished as a viable NBA coach before he established any
credentials worth mentioning. The day he commands respect is the
day players take to a coach who is definitely a wimp, certifiably a
pest, probably a fool and quite possibly a liar and a phony.

 &HT;    PROTECTIONS FOR U.S. TECH WORKERS LAG, CONGRESSMAN SAYS
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Protections for American tech workers are in play
as the House and Senate near a decision on whether to boost the
number of visas granted to highly skilled foreigners, such as
computer programmers and electrical engineers.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech companies say they desperately need the foreign
employees to continue expanding rapidly in this time of low
unemployment. But the three main bills now moving through Congress
have significant differences, and it is not clear which will emerge
as the final legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Technology Worker Temporary Relief Act appears to give
high-tech businesses exactly what they want _ an unlimited supply
of H-1B visas for foreign workers over the next three years. Yet
industry has responded coolly to the bill, written by Rep. Lamar
Smith, R-Texas, and approved this month by the House immigration
subcommittee he chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry spokesmen say it is filled with anti-business
provisions, such as language requiring companies seeking H-1B visas
to prove they have increased their U.S. work force and raised
salaries for American workers.
</P>
<P>
   They also object to a requirement that companies seeking the
visas file public reports on their foreign workers, including their
salaries. They also oppose a provision that would give the visas
only to full-time workers earning at least $40,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the bill would expand visas only if the Labor
Department issues long-delayed regulations for the H-1B program.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech companies generally are backing a bipartisan bill
introduced by Reps. David Dreier, R-Calif., and Zoe Lofgren,
D-Calif. Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, is another co-sponsor of that
measure, which would boost the number of H-1B visas to 200,000
annually over three years. Companies would have to pay a $1,000 fee
per visa, with those funds going towards scholarships for
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Tech companies also like a Senate bill that already has cleared
the Judiciary Committee. That one would boost the H-1B visas to
195,000 annually over three years. This bill would have an
education fee of $500 per visa.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Congress temporarily hiked the number of H-1B
visas from an annual limit of 65,000. This fiscal year's cap stands
at 115,000. If Congress does not act, the cap will drop to 107,500
next fiscal year, and revert to 65,000 in fiscal 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Here are excerpts from an interview with Smith:
</P>
<P>
   Q. Last month, you introduced a bill to give the H-1B program a
one-time annual boost of 45,000 visas. But this month, you
introduced a much broader bill granting unlimited visas. Why the
switch?
</P>
<P>
   A. The primary reason was because of recent figures we got from
the (Immigration and Naturalization Service). The demand for H-1B
visas is running about 50,000 ahead of last year, which was more
than we expected.
</P>
<P>
   We also didn't know until after that first bill that the INS had
miscounted ... and in fact had handed out 21,000 more visas than
they should have last year.
</P>
<P>
   So you had the combination of 71,000 visas projected greater
demand this year over last, so we just decided to allow for those
numbers. ... We thought that by also having a balanced bill that
benefitted workers, it would be acceptable to not have a cap.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why do you think high-tech businesses object to your latest
bill?
</P>
<P>
   A. Actually, we've gotten a lot of support, but (some people)
seem to oppose it. I'm disappointed that they don't support a
balanced bill. It seems like they care more about the industry than
American workers. And I think that is regrettable.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In your bill, you require the Labor Department to issue and
implement regulations for the H-1B program that has been in effect
for two years. Why has the Clinton administration has been slow to
develop these regulations?
</P>
<P>
   A. The 1998 bill had a balance, where we made an effort to meet
the needs of the high-tech industry, but also protect the interests
of the American worker. But half of that legislation has never been
implemented and there is absolutely no good excuse for the White
House not to have issued regulations yet. I don't know what excuse
there could possibly be.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Is the Dreier-Lofgren bill more likely to make it through the
full House than your bill?
</P>
<P>
   A. I've talked to David Dreier and ... he supports (my bill) and
hopes it gets out of subcommittee, which it did.
</P>
<P>
   I believe (my) bill probably will be the vehicle until we get to
the House floor. The reason is, it's a more narrow bill. We crafted
it so that the Judiciary Committee would have jurisdiction over the
bill and we wouldn't need to have it referred to several other
committees, as the Dreier bill has been. We're really trying to
streamline the process.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Will the final version incorporate some of Dreier's
provisions?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's certainly possible. We have two options: something could
be added to this underlying bill on the House floor, or we can move
a separate piece of legislation that, perhaps, adds some of the
educational provisions (that the Dreier-Lofgren bill includes).
</P>
<P>
   Q. Can your bill and Hatch's Senate bill be reconciled by a
House-Senate conference committee?
</P>
<P>
   A. Quite frankly, by our having no limits and letting the free
market determine the number of these high-tech visas, that
eliminates a lot of the details of the Senate bill. (Hatch) still
has some education provisions in there, but like I say, either in
conference or on the House floor may be where to address some of
those provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why not hold off legislation until October when the National
Science Foundation is scheduled to release its study of high-tech
job needs?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, we've already reached the cap this year on the
high-tech visas and quite frankly, my perception was that there was
a sense of urgency in the industry itself. As a practical matter,
it was going to be difficult to wait until after next October.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you expect some form of H-1B visa legislation to pass this
year?
</P>
<P>
   A. Oh yes, very easily. ... The question is what will be the
final shape of the bill.

 &HT;    E-mail forwarding - a great way to go
 &HT;    By Sue Cleere and Jacki Rudd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a recent column we discussed whether your e-mail
address had to change when you switch ISPs. The answer was
something like, ``well, it depends.'' Some readers asked us to clue
y'all in on e-mail forwarding, another great way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: With e-mail forwarding, you can have one e-mail address
for life. You can change ISPs umpteen times and your e-mail address
will stay the same.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: There are several e-mail forwarding services. Many are
free. Their gig is to route e-mail to your ISP account(s). Here are
a few some of our readers suggested: Bigfoot (www.bigfoot.com),
iName (www.iname.com) and akaMail (www.akamail.com).
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: Interested? Go to an e-mail forwarding site. Pick your
new permanent e-mail address. Give the forwarding service your
current ISP e-mail address so they can forward mail to it. Then
give your permanent address to all your contacts. Any e-mail sent
to that address is automatically forwarded to your ISP e-mail
account, regardless of how many times you switch ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: Basically, if I give Mom my Bigfoot e-mail address and
switch from AOL to EarthLink, she'll keep sending to Bigfoot.
Bigfoot kicks it along to my new ISP account.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If you switch ISPs, go back to the forwarding service and
update your information. It's like filling out a change-of-address
form for the post office.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: You can get more than just e-mail forwarding. Some features
are rolled into your package, and others can be obtained for a fee.
In addition to basic forwarding, options include: autoresponders
that respond to e-mail while you're away; filtering, which allows
you to reject unwanted e-mail or forward it elsewhere; and
anti-spamming, which allows you to block nasty spammers.
</P>
<P>
   Jacki: If you're one of those folks with your own Web site, one
of the coolest features is URL forwarding. It allows you to move
your Web site as often as you need to without having to inform
everyone of your new Web address. So, if I'm selling thingamajigs
on my Web page, my clients will never have to be inconvenienced
because I've switched Web-hosting services.
</P>
<P>
   Sue: For those who need to be reminded, your e-mail forwarding
service can help you remember holidays, birthdays and
anniversaries, too.
</P>

Journal-Constitution. E-mail questions to techsavvy(at)ajc.com.

 &HT;    The DOS world is hanging tough
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The truth is still out there.
</P>
<P>
   For the gentleman who is miffed because Windows no longer comes
with QBasic, two readers, Larry Logue and Jane Halstead, have good
news: You're wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The executable file and the help file are both in the Windows
98 delivery CD.''
</P>
<P>
   Find it by looking at this address on the CD (fill in the CD
drive letter for your own
computer):(backslash)tools(backslash)oldmsdos on the Windows 98
delivery CD. Simply copy both files to your hard drive, and you are
in business. It will run either in a DOS window or full screen.
</P>
<P>
   I also heard from readers with DOS printing problems, and one of
them is using one of the great old DOS programs, PFS: Professional
File. The PFS series was one of the high points of DOS software, as
far as I'm concerned.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, he finds that he can't print to modern printers,
and the ``current date'' function always produces the year
``1900.'' Well, the latter is what the Y2K thing was all about,
isn't it? Software Publishing Co., makers of the PFS series, was
sold and the series discontinued before the problem ever occurred
to anyone.
</P>
<P>
   As for printing, a reader reported he solved his DOS-to-modern
printer problem with a shareware program called Duplex. A cursory
search of a couple of shareware sites didn't turn it up, but it
shouldn't be too hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of printers, another reader kicked sand in my face for
``belittling'' people with dot-matrix printers. I don't belittle
people. I do assume they have a sense of humor, and tease them a
bit. After a couple of personal insults, he goes on to berate
inkjet printers because if not used regularly, the jets will clog.
</P>
<P>
   I found that out, too, and now I make sure to run a test page
through the printer every week if I'm not using it regularly. Seems
a lot easier than listening to a dot-matrix clacking away.
</P>
<P>
   Another fellow, however, writes to point out that impact
printers are still the only thing that will print multipage forms.
He's got me there.
</P>
<P>
   A reader in Denver says he used to run a huge spreadsheet under
DOS on a 386SX machine. Now he's got a new computer running
Windows, with four times the memory of his old one, and it can't
run the spreadsheet the 386 did. ``It is good for wasting time on
the Net, and fooling with pictures. Other than that, near as I can
tell, it's useless.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no arguing the fact that Windows itself eats up a huge
amount of resources. But there are at least two good reasons,
beyond Microsoft's machinations, that Windows has overshadowed DOS.
One of them matters to me, one doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The one that matters to me is the ability to multitask. Running
several programs at once is a very valuable feature for me. More
important to the world in general, however, is the standardization
that Windows imposes.
</P>
<P>
   Business users, not personal users, are the folks who drive the
market, and for them Windows makes training employees far, far
easier.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, neither of those things matters to all the folks who've
been writing to me lately. I admire you, and I love hearing how
you're making things work out there in The Lost World.

New Netscape 6 has many features average surfers could find
difficult to use. &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Netscape 6 is not fun.
</P>
<P>
   It's big, busy, flashy and can be just plain annoying. Netscape
took two years to dream up this mishmash of features, pull-down
menus, wacky toolbars and icons.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, Netscape was the market leader in Web browsers _
the Internet software that enables computer users to surf the Web.
Microsoft also makes Web surfing software called Internet Explorer
that comes on every computer that runs the Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling browsers _ so named because people can use them to
``browse'' the World Wide Web _ led to the antitrust suit against
Microsoft. The Justice Department and 19 states claimed Microsoft
used unfair business practices to edge Netscape out of the market,
which it nearly did. Microsoft currently has around 65 percent of
the market to Netscape's 35 percent. Netscape is hoping its latest
browser will help it regain lost ground.
</P>
<P>
   But the way it looks right now, it's just going to drive users
away.
</P>
<P>
   If you want or expect all the features Netscape 6 offers, forget
the browser and just log on to America Online. The menu bars across
the top and the bottom bear a striking resemblance to AOL's version
5.0.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, America Online owns Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Chronicle said the browser looks more like a
souped-up version of the America Online software than a Web
browser, and that's right on the money. But other aspects of the
service like the pull-down menus look a lot like the Microsoft
Network, so there is something for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   So just when you got to thinking you were a Web surfing
superstar ordering everything from books to antique pottery on the
Web, Netscape 6 swoops in and changes everything.
</P>
<P>
   What you'll get out of Netscape 6 is exactly what you put into
it. Using Netscape 6 on a daily basis requires a lot of time, a lot
of effort and a lot of waiting, no matter how much broadband you
may have streaming into your home.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you have a lot of time and a lot of energy and don't
mind filling out forms, you'll love Netscape 6. If you don't mind
sitting at your computer playing games and reading magazines while
it tries to process the information you've just entered, this also
is a great program for you.
</P>
<P>
   However, if your Web browser needs are pretty much confined to
visiting a few favorite sites, and maybe engaging in a little bit
of electronic commerce along the way, stay far, far away from
Netscape 6 until the company _ or CNet or someone else you rely
upon for your software decisions _ says it's ready for prime time.
It's in a preview release now, which means it is still a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   It takes a hearty soul to install and then try to navigate
through Netscape 6, now available to download at
home.netscape.com/download/previewrelease.html.
</P>
<P>
   The installation process is pretty easy, and users can decide
what applications they want and don't want from the new browser.
Netscape 6 also takes up less space than current and previous
versions of Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   But after a week of fussing and struggling with Netscape 6, it's
safe to say more work needs to be done before ordinary non-geek
consumers can or even should be using it.
</P>
<P>
   This new browser bears no resemblance to any browser you've seen
before. (Rumors are rampant that Microsoft is working on a
similarly feature-filled browser that will be just as flashy and
just as hard to use. Memo to Microsoft: If you want to hang on to
your market lead, leave your Internet Explorer browser alone.)
</P>
<P>
   In its evaluation of the product, CNet said, ``Netscape 6 ain't
soup yet, but it's off to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a pretty charitable comment for a product that takes
hours to load and takes up one-quarter of the browser space with a
new feature called Sidebar. If you have the time and endurance, you
can customize Sidebar, a pane taking up about a quarter of the
browser window. Sidebar has special folders users can fill with
anything they'd like, including stock portfolios, weather reports,
movie listings or news updates from CNN and others. There are also
integrated versions of AOL's Instant Messenger and a built-in
version of Net2Phone, which lets you make phone calls over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Web veterans who bravely decide to download Netscape 6 will
notice that Sidebar is very similar to the ill-fated PointCast
service from the mid-'90s.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, PointCast and its ``push technology'' were
hailed by Internet soothsayers as the next big thing. The idea of
requesting information and having it ``pushed'' to your desktop
practically bordered on the revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   However, PointCast had many of the same problems Sidebar has.
For example, when Sidebar is updating information, the browser
grinds to a mind-numbing halt. Many companies eventually officially
prohibited employees from downloading PointCast onto their desktop
PCs because when PointCast was updating information on just one
computer, it could freeze up an entire office network.
</P>
<P>
   Even as I'm writing this, I can hear my poor little Pentium II
groaning under the strain of Sidebar as it struggles to update all
the information I've put into it. You know you've hit an all-time
low when you start feeling sorry for a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Sidebar also makes Netscape 6 one of the busiest pieces of
software available today. There's so much going on, so many menu
bars and pull-down menus, the actual Web browser seems like an
afterthought. Netscape 6 has a menu bar at the top of the screen
and a menu bar at the bottom of the screen. The familiar
``backward,'' ``forward'' and ``reload'' keys have been replaced
with a series of arrows that look more like international highway
signs than browser buttons. The ``stop'' button is just an ``X,''
which makes me lonesome for the cute little red stoplight that's
been calling a halt to loading pages all these years. I also miss
the little house icon Netscape used to send users back to their
chosen home page.
</P>
<P>
   AOL has stated that it wants Netscape 6 to be a browser that
will work on any platform: the PC, the cellular phone, the personal
digital assistant and even America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The new browser is part of the company's ``AOL Anywhere''
philosophy of providing AOL service regardless what appliance is
used to access the service. But with so many agendas and the sheer
volume of information, toolbars and links all crowded onto the
browser, it looks like a combination of the Microsoft Network,
America Online and even software from Internet service provider
EarthLink, which also offers a detachable ``sidecar'' service that
works with EarthLink's high-profile personal start page.
</P>
<P>
   Netscape 6 looks like a browser built by committee that wants to
be all things to all people and a product for all platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts adore Netscape 6 and have high hopes for the
product in the long run. They may prove right, but from this user's
point of view, there's still a lot of work to be done.

 &HT;    Delete key probably the best defense against junk e-mail
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ There are times _ lots of them, really _ when I'm over
my head talking about some facet of technology. Things change so
fast and get so complicated that I end up spending a lot of my time
being mystified. But when it comes to junk e-mail, I'm on solid
ground.
</P>
<P>
   I once was a junk-mail king. I spent seven years writing for
mail-order catalogs and putting mailings together. So next time you
open your real-world mailbox and find envelopes telling you that
the ``Smith Family Is Already a Winner'' or that the secret to
consolidating all your credit card bills is inside, curse me.
</P>
<P>
   Junk e-mail is just the modern equivalent of all those mailings
that I worked on so diligently. Both are a major irritant for a lot
of people, and both are almost impossible to stop. I know that junk
e-mail _ spam as it's called _ is becoming an increasingly annoying
problem because I get so many e-mails asking how to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   There are all sorts of methods, and we'll sure touch on them
because sometimes it helps to at least try to stop an annoyance
rather than just feel helpless. But the bottom line is that, if you
have an e-mail account, you're going to get junk mail addressed to
you. And a high proportion of this mail will be offensive in some
way. They'll either insult your intelligence with stupid get-rich
offers, or they'll offend your sensibilities with X-rated offers
that are blatant, even in the e-mail itself.
</P>
<P>
   First, let's talk about what not to do. Most junk mail includes
instructions for being removed from future mailing lists. Don't
comply. While some legitimate mailers really will remove you, it's
impossible to know who is legitimate and who isn't. By replying,
you are actually making your e-mail address more valuable to the
e-mailer. It can then be sold as an address that has proven valid
and active. The exception to this rule is if you get an e-mail from
a brand-name company. Then you are probably safe in asking that
your name be removed.
</P>
<P>
   Next, don't give in to the temptation to write back and chew out
the mailer _ for the same reason you shouldn't ask to be removed
from the list. You'll just increase the chances of even more
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what can you do? Keep in mind my opinion that none of these
techniques will noticeably decrease the amount of junk mail you
get. That's a fact of life. But you can try to discourage specific
mailers. One good way to do that is to write and complain to the
folks at the Internet provider used by the mailer. There are Web
sites such as www.bankes.com/nslookup.htm that will let you look up
the administrators at a site. Just go to the site and follow the
directions to find the names, addresses and even telephone numbers
of the administrators. All that said, be warned that many junk mail
abusers use free and low-rent sites that frankly don't care whether
you're angry or not. But you can try.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet providers also offer software filters that help
remove junk mail. For instance, if you have an EarthLink account,
you can use what that service calls the Spaminator. Other providers
also have similar features, designed to filter out junk mail. So,
write an e-mail to your provider and ask them.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail programs themselves _ Microsoft's Outlook and Eudora's
professional version, or its new free version _ sometimes offer
ways for you to filter the mail.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, you can do what I do. Just read the headers and press
the delete key and forget it. The best way to eliminate junk e-mail
is to avoid responding, avoid buying. That's a slower filter but
one that _ if enough people do it _ is guaranteed to solve the
problem.

 &HT;    Language translation sites inexact but helpful
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Medan europeer ofta kan tala flera sprak flytande, de
flesta amerikaner ar okunniga i andra sprak.
</P>
<P>
   If that Swedish doesn't make sense to you, you're not alone. The
translation is: ``While Europeans often are fluent in several
languages, most Americans are ignorant of other languages.''
</P>
<P>
   It may be the World Wide Web, but when it comes to reading
information in other languages, most of us are at a loss. Even if
you took Spanish or French in school, most of us are awkward at
best when it comes to following the conversational language you are
likely to find on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   There is help for that, right on the Web. If you're an
experienced user, you probably know that there are free online
translation services available. One of the best known is called
BabelFish, a service provided by the AltaVista Web site
(www.altavista.com). You can either click on the link called
``translation'' on that page, or go directly to
babelfish.altavista.digital.com/cgi-bin/translate?.
</P>
<P>
   Just as is true with some of the other, less well known sites
that we'll visit in this column, you need to manage expectations
when you use the service. Don't expect the sort of letter-perfect
translation you'd get from a professional translator. This
translation is done by software, and the results can vary between
pretty good and really funny. But the text, in most cases, will be
understandable.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of BabelFish, you'll have a choice of French,
German, Italian, Portuguese and Spanish. You can translate from
English into one of those languages, or from any of those languages
into English.
</P>
<P>
   Some other sites offer a broader selection of languages. One is
Inter-Tran, located at www.tranexp.com:2000/InterTran. There are
too many languages available here to list them all but _ besides
those found at AltaVista _ you can add Swedish, Dutch, Finnish,
Japanese, Russian, Icelandic and Croatian, among many others.
</P>
<P>
   At both sites, you can either type or paste in the text you want
to translate or list the URL for the Web page that needs
translating.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a quick laugh _ and also a demonstration of the
relative lack of sophistication of the software _ translate an easy
sentence from English to another language and then use the
translator to return that translation to English. You'll see why
these services would not be good enough for a final translation of
an important business letter or a marriage proposal.
</P>
<P>
   One solution is to learn a little bit about the language and to
try it yourself if you already have some skill in that particular
language. The Web also offers online dictionaries in other
languages that can help you over the rough spots. One to check out
is the Logos dictionary at www.logos.it/dictionary/owa/sp?lg &QC; EN.
You'll find a wide selection of languages and can use the
dictionary to translate both words and brief phrases.
</P>
<P>
   Also at that site you'll find games such as crossword puzzles
and anagrams that can help make learning or practicing another
language fun.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, instead of a translation, you are preparing for a trip
to another country and would like to be able to speak and
understand a few basic phrases in the language. Knowing even a
little of the host country's language can open up people's hearts
and make for a more enjoyable trip.
</P>
<P>
   An excellent site for this type of work is called Foreign
Languages for Travelers and can be found at
www.travlang.com/languages/.
</P>
<P>
   There's a broad selection of languages to choose from here, more
than can be listed. Once you settle on a language, you can take
easy online lessons that teach you the basics: how to say hello and
goodbye, ask for directions (understanding them when spoken fast in
an unfamiliar language is another matter), book a room in a hotel
or order a simple meal.
</P>
<P>
   One feature that is especially helpful _ since words in another

 &HT;    Star Trek game makes no gains on TV series
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service

   AUSTIN, Texas _ FOR THE DESKTOP
</P>
<P>
   The problem with episodic action/adventure television is that,
more often than not, it's so, well, formulaic. Likewise is this
digital incarnation of the Roddenberry world, Star Trek: Hidden
Evil ($30; www.acti-vision.com; PC). Taking up where the Next
Generation ``Insurrection'' movie left off, the Enterprise crew
continues to interact with the enigmatic Ba'ku people as they
uncover still more ``advanced technology'' from a long-dead
civilization. Gamers mainly control a Star Fleet ensign, an apt
adventurer who's a little slow on the uptake when it comes to
action. Genre-typical tasks and objectives _ explore, find, unlock,
clash with the enemy every now and again _ mire what is otherwise a
graphically splendid and technically efficient game. Voiceover work
from the likes of Patrick Stewart (Picard) and Brent Spiner (Data)
do well to offer an immersive Star Trekian interactive adventure.
Yet, all said and done, it's an episodic TV-caliber adventure, not
a virtual extravaganza on par with the blockbuster movies.
</P>
<P>
   This is not Wrebbit's first digital incarnation of perplexing
3-D jigsaw puzzles, but the QuickTime dependant Puzz3D CD The
Orient Express from the Twenties ($20; www.wrebbit.com; for the PC
or Mac) is its first blend of genuine jigsaw challenge with more
conventional computer based mind-benders. In and of itself, the
virtual 3-D build-a-train puzzle promises/threatens hours of
well-interfaced point and click, and drag and drop, puzzle play
with difficulty ranging from easy (150 simplistic pieces, a help
menu, some task automated) to ``Super Challenging'' (707 tiny
pieces, no help, no hints). Once completed, Orient Express becomes
an Agatha Christie-inspired virtual mystery, a graphic-intensive
point and click adventure in the tradition of ``Myst'' or
``Riven,'' replete with mini-games involving clue-riddled Mah Jong
tiles/ciphers, code conundrums, music sheet mysteries and more.
Innumerable FMV featurettes present characters and plot lines and
move the mystery along. A well-executed, long-term
mind-messer-upper for a paltry $20.
</P>
<P>
   FOR THE CONSOLE
</P>
<P>
   For fans of fighting games, the Sega Dreamcast's lineup since
its launch has been an cornucopia of riches. First came the
exquisite ``Soul Calibur,'' and now Tecmo's Dead or Alive 2 ($45,
www.tecmoinc.com), which is, in a word, gorgeous. The game is a
standard fighting game the way the Sistine Chapel has bunch of
squiggles on its ceiling. With great graphics, ultra smooth
game-play and some stellar modes like Tag Team fighting, Dead or
Alive 2 is stunning. The levels are interactive, so throwing an
opponent off a ledge can lead you to another, lower level to
continue a fight. Snow-covered vistas, beautiful gardens and ornate
arenas are just eye candy to the very fun game-play. If we have one
complaint, it's that the game doesn't have as many modes of play as
``Soul Calibur.'' But once you're swapping out players in Tag Team
mode, you won't care.

 &HT;    IRS WORKERS CLEARED OF CRIMINAL WRONGDOING
 &HT;    390&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than two years after a Senate hearing aired
sensational charges of abuses by the Internal Revenue Service,
congressional investigators have been unable to corroborate
allegations of criminal wrongdoing by federal tax collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. General Accounting Office, in a report written a year
ago and made partially public this week, said it could not back up
accusations that IRS officials canceled tax debts for corporations
in return for jobs or that they initiated criminal probes against
taxpayers based solely on personal vendettas.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited numerous shortcomings in IRS operations, but it
blamed the ``complexity and vagueness'' of the tax code, not
illegal actions by officials.
</P>
<P>
   The findings by the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, have
been a source of some embarrassment for Republicans, who sponsored
IRS hearings in 1997 to spark a major overhaul of the IRS that was
enacted the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The reform was based on two sets of hearings that outlined
problems at the agency, stressed Ginny Flynn, spokesperson for
Senate Finance Committee chairman William V. Roth Jr., R-Del. The
aide noted that the GAO investigation, which had been ordered by
Roth, covered only one of those forums.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn added that the IRS itself had issued reports conceding
that many liens, levies and seizures had been carried out
inappropriately.
</P>
<P>
   Since passage of the 1998 IRS reform to strengthen taxpayer
protections, tax audits have been cut back, property seizures have
been reduced by 98 percent, and some observers have even suggested
that the IRS has now become too lenient toward recalcitrant
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard back from constituents that they have noticed a
difference at the IRS,'' Flynn said. ``I think between this law and
(IRS) Commissioner (Charles O.) Rossotti, the agency is beginning
to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers of the tax collecting agency argue that the GAO
report has been misread as a complete clean bill of health for the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criminal behavior has always been rare in government
agencies,'' said Pete Sepp, spokesman for the National Taxpayers
Union, a private non-partisan watchdog group. ``It's one thing to
say 'great, we don't have employees involved in extortion.' But
what about hounding small business that they think are
disrespectful?''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The IRS ``whistle-blowers'' who spoke against their agency at
the Senate hearings have stood by their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wouldn't have made such allegations if I weren't
prepared to prove them,'' Michael Ayala, an IRS worker at the
Atlanta regional office, said in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He had detailed allegations of cases that were closed
improperly, favoritism by a supervisor toward an employee because
of a personal liaison, as well as improper use of a chart that
rated IRS agents by the number of property seizures they made
through the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   In these and several cases, the GAO did not dispute the facts,
but also found no criminal wrongdoing. The allegations were based
``on an incomplete awareness of the total circumstances surrounding
the matters,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala said he has been the target for retaliation since the GAO
findings were made public. ``It certainly leaves us out hanging in
the wind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That view was also expressed by Ginny Jarvis, a New York worker
for the IRS, who had alleged that the agency overlooked millions of
dollars in ``laundered'' funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I provided in excess of 100 pages of documentations to the
investigative reporters for GAO,'' she said. She said she now fears
retribution at her agency.

 &HT;    HOLOCAUST MUSEUM EXHIBIT HONORS JAPANESE 'SCHINDLER'
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories for
release Sunday, April 30.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Nazis began a campaign of genocide that
would claim the lives of 6 million Jews, a few thousand refugees
from Poland found temporary shelter in Japan, a nation then allied
with Germany. I was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   My parents and I survived the Holocaust because two diplomats _
one Dutch and the other Japanese _ issued life-saving visas that
let us dodge Nazi death camps and the Soviet Gulag.
</P>
<P>
   We were among a band of refugees who journeyed from Poland,
which was overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in September
1939, to Lithuania, occupied by Soviet troops in June 1940.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it took nearly two weeks on the Trans-Siberian
railway to reach the Far East port of Vladivostok. After a
storm-tossed voyage across the Sea of Japan, the escapees arrived
in Kobe a few months before the attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Those who found immigration visas and could afford to travel
dispersed around the globe. A few, including our family, came
directly to the United States. After World War II broke out, the
Japanese interned about half the escapees in Shanghai, China.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years later, the story of the refugees' escape from
Europe, called ``Flight and Rescue,'' is being told in an exhibit
opening May 4 at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. It runs
through Oct. 21, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit documents the 6,000-mile odyssey of about 2,000
Polish Jews with artifacts, films, photos and testaments, said
David Marwell, the Holocaust Museum's associate director for
special projects.
</P>
<P>
   The key figure who made the journey possible was Chiune
Sugihara, the first Japanese diplomat to be posted to Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   For 29 days _ from July 31 to Aug. 28, 1940 _ Sugihara and his
wife, Yukiko, wrote visas by hand for many hours, charging no fees.
When refugees who had been standing in line in front of his
consulate in Kaunas for days began climbing the compound wall in
despair, he came out to calm them and assure them that he would do
his best to help. In all, he issued 2,139 visas.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat in Hungary whose
chief purpose in 1944 was to save Jews, Sugihara had no apparent
reason to rescue Jews. By doing so, he openly violated repeated
written orders from Tokyo, which was aligned with Berlin and Rome
in the Axis pact.
</P>
<P>
   Said Masha Leon, a fellow survivor: ``Even when he was at the
train station (on his way to Berlin) after the consulate had been
closed down, he was writing these hand-written visas and throwing
them out of the train window. It was an extraordinary act, it was
extraordinary heroism, but he was an extraordinary man.''
</P>
<P>
   About 3.1 million Jews lived in Poland before the 1939
blitzkrieg. About 100,000 survived the war.
</P>
<P>
   As the Nazis and the Communists carved up a vanquished Poland,
some 15,000 Jews bolted the Soviet-controlled area into neighboring
Lithuania in the vain hope that the small Baltic nation could
remain neutral.
</P>
<P>
   My family headed east from Warsaw with a Catholic taxi driver
whom my late father, then 28, befriended as the two cleared
bombed-out rubble. We left only hours before German troops ringed
the Polish capital and made escape all but impossible.
</P>
<P>
   In Lithuania, during a month-long window in 1940, there opened a
four-step chance to attain asylum.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, the Polish government-in-exile took our word for it
that we were Polish citizens. Moscow classified Lithuanian Jews as
Soviet citizens, barring them from leaving. Some 225,000 of them
later perished.
</P>
<P>
   _ Then, Jan Zwartendijk, an electronics importer and a part-time
acting Dutch counsel, issued a unique document. It stated that
visas weren't needed to enter Curacao, a Dutch possession in the
Caribbean. Zwartendijk ignored the fact that it was up to the
colonial governor to approve each entrant, which he rarely did.
</P>
<P>
   Between July 26 and Aug. 2, 1940, Zwartendijk gave out 2,400
``Curacao visas.'' His rescue operation was shut down when the
Soviet government nationalized his company and sent back to Holland
the man known to Polish Jews as ``Mr. Philips Radio.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Next, with the key Dutch document in hand, we applied for
transit visas from Sugihara. Fluent in Russian, he was sent there
in 1939 to spy on German and Russian troop movements. Although
Sugihara never met Zwartendijk, his entry papers gave Sugihara the
cover to act.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Kremlin posed the last hurdle. Wanda Glass, my 87-year-old
mother, recalls that the new Soviet masters of Lithuania allowed
some Polish Jews to depart while barring the way to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly everyone who had travel papers from Zwartendijk and
Sugihara was interrogated by the (Soviet) authorities and asked
whether we would work for them if we left,'' she said. ``They
wanted us to be spies.''
</P>
<P>
   Would-be emigrants also faced a Catch-22: The Soviets would
accept only U.S. dollars in payment for travel charges. But any
Pole caught with dollars was subject to arrest and exile in
Siberia. My father took the risk by handing a Soviet official a
sealed envelope on which he had written: ``Dollars to be Used Only
for Travel in the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Sugihara's records, preserved in Tokyo, show that my father,
Marian, was issued visa No. 160 while my mother received No. 165.
As a boy of 4, I traveled on my mother's visa.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes that other family members could flee across German
lines and join us, my father asked Sugihara for 10 more visas,
including ones for my parental grandparents and for each of his
siblings. But none was used. All my relatives perished.
</P>
<P>
   As the war ended, Sugihara, by then posted in Romania, was
seized by the Russians and sent for 18 months to a concentration
camp with his wife and young son. On arriving in American-occupied
Japan in 1947, the foreign ministry ousted him for his wartime
``insubordination,'' offering him a small pension.
</P>
<P>
   Fordecades, Sugihara lived in obscurity, selling light bulbs.
Then, in 1969, Yehoshua Nishri, an Israeli diplomat based in Tokyo
and one of the refugees he had rescued, found him and aired his
deeds.
</P>
<P>
   Praised by the Israeli government as one of ``the righteous
among nations'' _ the phrase used for non-Jews who helped save Jews
in the Holocaust _ Sugihara won the same honors that had been
bestowed upon Wallenberg and German businessman Oskar Schindler.
</P>
<P>
   Born Jan. 1, 1900, Sugihara died in 1986, still all but unknown
in his native land. In the year before his death, 45 years after
his visas had saved our lives, Sugihara was asked why he did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were human beings and they needed help,'' he replied.

arts and renowned art collector, died Wednesday at North East
Baptist Hospital of complications of cancer and respiratory
failure. He was 66.
</P>
<P>
   A multimillionaire who had been battling cancer for a decade,
Tobin was a tall man with a long, silver mane of hair. He was as
Texan as his Lucchese alligator boots. He prided himself in being a
yellow-dog Democrat and a inveterate Dallas Cowboys fan.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin was equally at home working on behalf of indigent children
as he was dealing with the staff of the Spoleto Festival of Two
Worlds in Italy.
</P>
<P>
   An inveterate collector, his collections reflected his main
interests: stage design, opera, theater, art, architecture and
books.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was a generous benefactor of the Metropolitan Opera
and Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Santa Fe Opera, Tobin
was more closely linked to San Antonio's McNay Art Museum. The
museum's world-class Collection of Theater Arts, was donated by
Tobin, who had been chairman of the board of trustees since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 20, Tobin became president of the Children's
Service Bureau. A few years later, the staunch supporter of serving
the health needs of San Antonio's poor became the youngest chairman
of the board of managers of the Bexar County Hospital District.
</P>
<P>
   A pitched battle over the location of a new medical school
soured his involvement in San Antonio public life more than 30
years ago. He wanted it closer to downtown, where the needy people
were.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues said Tobin's dedication to the issue was
so fierce that he felt scorned and dejected when the University of
Texas Board of Regents, after intense political wrangling, decided
to locate the school and a subsequent teaching hospital at its
current location in Northwest San Antonio. Shortly after the
decision, Tobin began to recede from San Antonio and turn instead
to New York and Santa Fe, N.M., where he also had homes.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse H. Oppenheimer, a lawyer and friend, said the medical
school experience changed Tobin's perception of his beloved
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was extremely generous and civic-minded,'' he said. ``But
he became a little soured over the ordeal and of doing things in
San Antonio.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his ties to the McNay remained strong. Included in his
donated Collection of Theatre Arts are original Broadway production
designs from ``My Fair Lady,'' ``South Pacific'' and ``West Side
Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin also gave the McNay more than 8,000 books, many of them
quite rare, to establish the Tobin Library.
</P>
<P>
   The McNay's $1.5 million, two-story Tobin Wing, opened in 1984,
was a gift from Tobin's mother in honor of her late parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The books and items are dead objects. They will be awakened by
use,'' Tobin said shortly before the Tobin Wing opened.
</P>
<P>
   McNay director William J. Chiego said Wednesday: ``Robert Tobin
was an extraordinary friend of the museum, and many of us here feel
like we've lost our best friend. He was a rare individual who
wanted to share what he loved the most.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Tobin combined his epic collection of
20th-century American theater designs with his major collection of
30 American paintings in a gift to the McNay. Last year, he donated
his $3 million Russian theater design collection to the San Antonio
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin's connection to the New York City cultural scene stemmed
mostly from his longtime involvement with the Metropolitan Opera.
His mother had served on the board of the opera and was a key
financier of seasonal productions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Tobin donated $1 million to the capital campaign to
renovate the Santa Fe Opera's amphitheater and grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``More important was the courage he showed,'' said John Crosby,
general director of the Santa Fe Opera. ``If we wanted to undertake
some experimental opera, he was the first to get behind the opera
and give it a push.''
</P>
<P>
   McNay trustee E.H. Corrigan of Laredo, Texas, a friend of
Tobin's for more than 40 years, said many of his closest friends
last saw him on his birthday, March 12.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1934, Robert Lynn Batts Tobin was the son of Edgar
Gardner Tobin, a World War I flying ace, and Margaret Batts,
daughter of Robert Lynn Batts, chief judge of the 5th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1920s, Edgar Tobin began taking aerial photographs of
potential oil fields in West Texas for the Humble Oil Co. That work
led to his founding the Tobin Aerial Mapping Co., which later
evolved into Tobin Aerial Surveys. Because it was the only company
of its kind, it made Tobin immensely wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Tobin was 19 and a sophomore at the University of Texas
at Austin when his father and aviation pioneer Tom Braniff were
killed in an airplane crash in Louisiana. Robert Tobin took over
the business and led it through unprecedented growth.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin, a lifelong bachelor, is survived by his dog, Samantha,
and cousins.

 &HT;    IRS WORKERS CLEARED OF CRIMINAL WRONGDOING
 &HT;    390&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than two years after a Senate hearing aired
sensational charges of abuses by the Internal Revenue Service,
congressional investigators have been unable to corroborate
allegations of criminal wrongdoing by federal tax collectors.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. General Accounting Office, in a report written a year
ago and made partially public this week, said it could not back up
accusations that IRS officials canceled tax debts for corporations
in return for jobs or that they initiated criminal probes against
taxpayers based solely on personal vendettas.
</P>
<P>
   The report cited numerous shortcomings in IRS operations, but it
blamed the ``complexity and vagueness'' of the tax code, not
illegal actions by officials.
</P>
<P>
   The findings by the GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, have
been a source of some embarrassment for Republicans, who sponsored
IRS hearings in 1997 to spark a major overhaul of the IRS that was
enacted the next year.
</P>
<P>
   The reform was based on two sets of hearings that outlined
problems at the agency, stressed Ginny Flynn, spokesperson for
Senate Finance Committee chairman William V. Roth Jr., R-Del. The
aide noted that the GAO investigation, which had been ordered by
Roth, covered only one of those forums.
</P>
<P>
   Flynn added that the IRS itself had issued reports conceding
that many liens, levies and seizures had been carried out
inappropriately.
</P>
<P>
   Since passage of the 1998 IRS reform to strengthen taxpayer
protections, tax audits have been cut back, property seizures have
been reduced by 98 percent, and some observers have even suggested
that the IRS has now become too lenient toward recalcitrant
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard back from constituents that they have noticed a
difference at the IRS,'' Flynn said. ``I think between this law and
(IRS) Commissioner (Charles O.) Rossotti, the agency is beginning
to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers of the tax collecting agency argue that the GAO
report has been misread as a complete clean bill of health for the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``Criminal behavior has always been rare in government
agencies,'' said Pete Sepp, spokesman for the National Taxpayers
Union, a private non-partisan watchdog group. ``It's one thing to
say 'great, we don't have employees involved in extortion.' But
what about hounding small business that they think are
disrespectful?''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The IRS ``whistle-blowers'' who spoke against their agency at
the Senate hearings have stood by their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I certainly wouldn't have made such allegations if I weren't
prepared to prove them,'' Michael Ayala, an IRS worker at the
Atlanta regional office, said in an interview Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He had detailed allegations of cases that were closed
improperly, favoritism by a supervisor toward an employee because
of a personal liaison, as well as improper use of a chart that
rated IRS agents by the number of property seizures they made
through the Southeast.
</P>
<P>
   In these and several cases, the GAO did not dispute the facts,
but also found no criminal wrongdoing. The allegations were based
``on an incomplete awareness of the total circumstances surrounding
the matters,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Ayala said he has been the target for retaliation since the GAO
findings were made public. ``It certainly leaves us out hanging in
the wind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That view was also expressed by Ginny Jarvis, a New York worker
for the IRS, who had alleged that the agency overlooked millions of
dollars in ``laundered'' funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I provided in excess of 100 pages of documentations to the
investigative reporters for GAO,'' she said. She said she now fears
retribution at her agency.

<P>
   If you thought Elian Gonzalez belonged with his father last
week, don't allow yourself to be swayed by that admittedly
heart-stopping picture of the armed federal agent confronting the
frightened little boy and the fisherman who had plucked him from
the water five months ago and who was still clinging to the kid,
literally and figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   Finger not on the trigger. Weapon pointing down. Arm reaching
out in a non-hostile manner. That's all worth noting.
</P>
<P>
   What were these eight agents supposed to do, tap on the door and
say, ``Can Elian come out to play?'' They had to be ready for
confrontation, given the hostile mood permeating Little Havana for
the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``ELIAN SEIZED!'' read the headlines in newspapers across the
country. ``ELIAN SAVED!'' might have been more appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Remember what brought us to that moment. Remember what led to
the shocking but violence-free, three-minute operation that finally
extracted Elian from the home where he was essentially being held
hostage by his well-intentioned but misguided distant relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Not every episode in this made-for-television drama has been
captured on film, but remember that Elian has endured much more
traumatic experiences than even the Holy Saturday seizure. What's a
``soldier man'' with a gun when you've already seen your mother
drown?
</P>
<P>
   Sad as the death of Elizabeth Brotons was, let us not forget
that she came close to signing a death warrant for her son when
(without his father's knowledge) she took him along as she and more
than a dozen others boarded a rusty, battered, patched-up, 16-foot
aluminum boat on the shoreline of Cardenas, Cuba, and set off for
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   She was not on a valiant quest for freedom and a better way of
life for her little boy. She was escaping with her young boyfriend,
who had fled to Florida several months earlier but had returned to
Cuba because he missed his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   As I said in November, had Elian's mother made it to American
soil with her son, a case could have been made against her as an
unfit mother who had recklessly endangered her child's life.
</P>
<P>
   But she didn't make it. The boat capsized and fell apart, and 11
of the 15 passengers eventually were swallowed by the sea. There
weren't any cameras around to capture that lengthy medley of
horrors, but rest assured those days of death at sea will bruise
Elian's psyche more deeply than the scary few minutes when he was
grabbed by U.S. agents and whisked away in a mini-van.
</P>
<P>
   That Elian survived was a miracle. What happened to him in the
months to follow was a debacle.
</P>
<P>
   Let's remember too that the family members who took Elian in
were relatives in the same way that your second cousins and
granduncles in Italy or Mexico or Poland or Ireland are relatives.
They didn't know this boy. They didn't even know his mom. I'm not
saying they didn't come to love him, but they had no claim to him
that legally superseded the rights of his father.
</P>
<P>
   They defied the law and wouldn't let him go. They cradled him
like a political football and they basked in the glow of the
media's overblown attention, and they encouraged the emotional
displays outside their house, and the spoiling of Elian with
presents and parades and clowns in favor of helping the boy grieve
and deal with the death of his mom.
</P>
<P>
   As for the protesters who were waving blown-up versions of that
seizure photo, along with signs that said, ``Child Abuse!'' and
``F--- Clinton!,'' I'm wondering why so many of them also were
hoisting Cuban flags. Isn't that the wrong country?
</P>
<P>
   By midday Saturday, we were seeing another set of photos: Elian,
his father, his stepmother, his half-brother.
</P>
<P>
   Reunited with his real family.

SITE OF THE WEEK

  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gold Violin: A shopping site for older Web-savvy citizens or, as
the site puts it, ``shopping for heroes.'' It goes on to describe
them at ``people who live rich, long lives and inspire us with
their experience and insights. They braved the Depression in the
'30s...defended the world's freedom in the '40s ... and claim that
we are their greatest accomplishment.'' &QL; 
Where: www.goldviolin.com &QL; 
What's cool: The shopping selections, pitched toward gift-giving
for a faraway family member, include nifty products like a leather
``brag book'' for all those photos of grandchildren, an
``aristocratic'' walking stick, a ``big keys'' computer keyboard,
and ergonomic tools that just might be of use to more than your
arthritic elder. Decent prices, though it's hard to judge product
quality without actually using the stuff. &QL; 
Features: This site breaks down the offerings in a number of ways,
such as by lifestyle, room of use, and basics, along with a
gift-suggestion area that includes price ranges. I'd prefer to see
the site come with a button to automatically enlarge the type for
easier reading, but you can adjust that yourself in your Web
browser (though it'll probably mess up the layouts; a good reason
for the site to provide a well-designed alternative). I'd also like
to see more product choices, though that may come with time. What's
here will appeal to many folks, either elderly, ailing or
handicapped, who need tools for living that fit their particular
lives' demands. These kinds of goodies aren't always sitting in
Aisle 14 at Wal-Mart. &QL; 
You'll like this if: You're feeling like an everyday hero, or want
to be treated like one. &QL; 
 &QL;

 &HT;    Tricks to kick-start your creativity
 &HT;    By Carolyn Susman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Remember the tale of how Isaac Newton
discovered gravity?
</P>
<P>
   He was sitting under a tree when an apple fell on his head and
everything became clear.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be great if we could find something like that to
loosen our thoughts?
</P>
<P>
   It's not such a nutty concept.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes our best ideas come when we are relaxed or distracted.
</P>
<P>
   So, while we're sitting here daydreaming, we've come up with
five ways to get your brain out of neutral and encourage your
creativity.
</P>
<P>
   _ 1) Eat more protein and complex carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have cobwebs? Stay away from simple sugars and fats.
They'll gobble you up,'' says Dr. Pierce J. Howard, author of ``The
Owner's Manual for The Brain,'' ($24.95, Bard Press) an 800-page
tome. Your brain activity will be stimulated just by thumbing
through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And drink plenty of water. That's very trendy these days, both
caffeine and alcohol dehydrate. So cut back. I recommend 1
milligram of caffeine per pound of body weight per dose once every
seven hours if needed. That's just under two mugs of coffee for me.
You just don't need it, you get the jitters, you still can't focus
on what you're trying to do. Lethargy and hyperactivity, both of
them prevent focus. Your mind starts wandering or is unable to
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Only two cups of caffeine a day, and he's got a BIG brain.
</P>
<P>
   _ 2) Relax, don't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't force it. You won't ever get a block if you don't
force yourself to come up with something when it's not naturally
coming out,'' says Nina L. Diamond, a Miami musician and author of
``Voices of Truth, Conversations with Scientists, Thinkers and
Healers'' ($24.95, Lotus Press.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd never dream of going into the bathroom when you didn't
have to go. When something wants to come out of you, you will know
it. If you sit down before anything's ready to come out, nothing's
going to happen. Stop sitting down when you don't have something to
say.''
</P>
<P>
   _ 3) Try something different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do something utterly different from your normal routine,''
writes Martha Beck in the March issue of Mademoiselle. ``Children
are more creative than adults because their knowledge base is so
limited that they can't help running into brand new experiences ...
the result is extraordinarily heightened creativity.''
</P>
<P>
   _ 4) Create a mind map.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mind map is a real good way to get started,'' Howard says.
``It's a real free-flowing way to get going on a project. It's an
alternative to the traditional linear outline. The object is to get
ideas on paper without worrying how they're organized. It's like
personal brainstorming.''
</P>
<P>
   Basically, you write down a problem in the middle of a page,
circle it, and just jot down ideas all around it that could be
useful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's modeled on the image we have of neural networks in the
brain.''
</P>
<P>
   _ 5) Stare blankly into the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Focus on an object. Right now, I see a tree with kudzu at some
distance,'' Howard said. ``Focus for about 30 seconds, then I'll
close my eyes and try to reconstruct in my mind's eye what I see.
You're refreshed. It kind of relaxes your eye muscles. They get you
a fresh perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is: Try anything that gets you out of your mental box.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to develop something that transports you from the
ordinary,'' adds Howard. ``I have an ugly pink cap that says, `The
50-year-old Boy.' When I put that on, I am a writer.''
</P>
<P>
   Says Diamond: ``Get yourself absorbed completely in something
else. I rent two or three movies and watch them back to back.
You're transported visually, emotionally, all the way around. It
really breaks the trance.''

RENO SAYS RAID ON HOME OF ELIAN'S RELATIVES WAS NECESSARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed) 
 By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Elian Gonzalez began settling into a life surrounded by
familiar faces from his homeland, Attorney General Janet Reno on
Thursday again offered justification for the tactics used to seize
the boy from his Miami relatives, saying that a ``show of force''
had been necessary after negotiations for a peaceful transfer began
to falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't going to get any better,'' Reno said Thursday
morning at a news conference in Washington. ``Clearly, the agents
had to be in force. Elian was being held by this person, and there
had to be a show of force, not a use of force, to show that we were
in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the federal agents stormed the Miami home in a
three-minute, pre-dawn raid on Saturday because most of the
protesters outside the house had dispersed, and that it ``seemed to
be the safest time possible to effect the transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   The agents, some armed with automatic rifles, stormed into the
home where Elian had been staying since late November with his
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, and other relatives. The family had
defied government orders to turn the 6-year-old boy over to federal
officials and his father because, like thousands of Cuban-American
exiles, they did not want to see Elian returned to a Cuba ruled by
President Fidel Castro. After federal agents seized him, the boy
was flown to Washington, where he was reunited with his father,
Juan Miguel Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton has supported Reno's actions, the
attorney general has received a barrage of criticism, mostly from
Republican lawmakers, over her handling of the raid. Several
senators have called for congressional hearings into the incident.
And Vice-President Al Gore said he would have handled things
``differently.''
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday, Reno vigorously continued to defend her decisions,
saying that the Miami relatives had appeared to be waffling during
last-minute negotiations. She said that Aaron Podhurst, a
negotiator for the Miami family, told told her at 4 a.m. on April
22 that the family refused to let Elian reunite with his father
anywhere outside of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had the feeling that we were in the same position that we
had been in, with the goalposts changing,'' Reno said. ``At this
point, if it were a deal-breaker, we should bring the negotiations
to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the controversy over the raid has centered on
contradictory accounts of the negotiations. While Reno has
maintained that the Miami relatives were refusing to budge,
Podhurst has said that he felt the parties were within ``minutes''
or ``an hour'' of reaching an agreement.

<P>
   As the raid began, Reno said, people outside the home tried to
throw ropes around the agents. The family inside the house pushed a
couch against the door, she said, forcing the agents to batter
through the entryway. When Betty Mills, an agent from the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, carried Elian out the door,
people grabbed at her, and she almost fell before being helped by
another agent, Reno said.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The attorney general also addressed criticism of the manner in
which agents had brandished automatic rifles in front of Elian as
the terrified boy hid inside a closet, a scene that was captured in
a widely circulated photograph taken by a photographer for The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at everything that we could do to make sure that it
was done safely and yet with the least impact on Elian,'' Reno
said. She added that she has been told that the agent confronting
the boy had the safety catch on his rifle. The agents did not yell
and curse at the family, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno acknowledged that Elian had grown close to his cousin and
caretaker, Marisleysis Gonzalez, and that perhaps the two could
visit each other after the government consulted psychiatrists. One
child psychiatrist retained by the government filed an evaluation
on Wednesday that said that Elian did not view Marisleysis Gonzalez
as a mother figure, but had more of a ``romantic'' attachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that Marisleysis will be out of his life,''
Reno said. ``I mean, you could look at them and see a connection.''
</P>
<P>
   But the government has moved quickly to surround Elian with
people who were close to him in Cuba. On Wednesday night, one of
the boy's teachers and a favorite cousin, a 10-year-old, flew to
Washington to keep the boy company through what is expected to be a
prolonged legal battle over Elian's asylum application. Thursday
morning, the State Department approved entry visas for four of
Elian's schoolmates and four adult chaperones. They were expected
to fly to the United States Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On arriving in this country three weeks ago, Elian's father
asked the State Department to grant visas to an entourage of 25
Cubans who would stay in the United States with him through the
appeals process. That proposed entourage, assembled by Castro,
included Elian's classmates, teachers and close relatives, as well
as doctors and a high-ranking government official.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Elian is staying with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez's wife
and their 6-month-old son, on a farmhouse on the 1,100-acre Wye
River estate that has been used for Middle East peace talks. Juan
Miguel Gonzalez flew from Cuba on April 6 to claim his son, but
Elian cannot leave the country before the 11th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals in Atlanta decides whether to make the INS grant the boy
an asylum hearing. On Tuesday, the court also said Elian cannot
visit any place that has diplomatic immunity, effectively barring
him from spending time at the home of a Cuban diplomat in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   The court is scheduled to hear oral arguments beginning May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Elian's great-uncle recently asked the court to place the boy
under the care of an independent party while the appeals process
plays out. But on Wednesday, both the boy's father and the Justice
Department made separate filings with the court, asking it to keep
Elian in John Miguel Gonzalez's custody.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The emergency motion filed by the father asked the court to let
him intervene in his son's asylum case and asserted that the
great-uncle no longer had any legal basis to speak for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The legal maneuverings are only the latest in an international
custody battle that has reached operatic proportions for many of
the people involved. The saga that has embroiled two governments, a
sprawling family and thousands of political exiles began last
November, when Elian and his mother attempted to reach the United
States on a smuggling boat. When the vessel capsized, the mother
and 10 other Cubans drowned. But two fishermen discovered Elian
clinging to an inner-tube on Nov. 25 off the Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
   The boy was given ``parole'' status by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service and placed in the custody of his great-uncle
in Miami. At the time, no one could predict the fury of the
oncoming storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will have peace in my heart and peace in my mind when
everybody is home,'' Reno said Thursday, ``wherever home will be.''

&HT;     CALIFORNIA WEIGHS HOME LOANS FOR TEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Gov. Gray Davis and state lawmakers are
moving to provide teachers with cash to buy homes in San Francisco,
the Silicon Valley and other areas with high housing costs.
</P>
<P>
   An Assembly committee on Wednesday approved a measure that would
grant teachers up to $20,000 to buy a home within the school
district. The teacher would have to stay on the job for at least
five years, after which the loan would vanish. If the teacher left
the job early, loan payments would begin.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, a Democrat, is working on a variety of incentives for
teachers who are finding it nearly impossible to buy homes in the
San Francisco Bay Area and other markets, where the median housing
prices are close to $400,000.
</P>
<P>
   Davis proposes to offer a maximum of $10,000 in forgivable loans
for teachers to buy a house. Teachers would be required to work in
public schools that are having the hardest time attracting
teachers, typically those with low-income students and low test
scores. The most recent figures show California's 268,000 teachers
make an average of $44,500 per year, far below the amount needed to
finance a large home loan.
</P>
<P>
   The omnibus teacher-recruitment bill Davis supports would also
grant teachers in low performing schools $2,000 to buy school
supplies, since many teachers have to take money out of their own
pockets. Lawmakers are looking at giving teachers help with student
loans and granted tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   A bill sponsored by Assemblyman Kevin Shelley, a Democrat from
San Francisco, is offering up to $20,000 in forgivable loans in his
measure. Shelley said there may be room for compromise with the
governor before the Legislature finishes its work this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't educate our kids if the teachers aren't around to
provide the education,'' Shelley said.
</P>
<P>
   State Treasurer Philip Angelides also is proposing a $150
million program to offer teachers tax credits equal to 15 percent
of their annual mortgage interest payments, if they teach for five
years in schools with the lowest scores on state achievement tests.
Angelides hopes to start it by September, and he is asking the
Legislature for a five-year commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Davis' proposal is a laundry list that includes the housing loan
and money for supplies. It would also give up to $30,000 in grants
to teachers who are certified by the National Board for
Professional Teaching Standards and agree to teach for at least
four years in a low performing school.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, written by state Sen. Richard Alarcon, a Democrat from
Van Nuys, would also eliminate a law that retired teachers who
return to work cannot make more than $19,600 per year and retain
their retirement benefits.

   ``Anticommunism would be a useless tool unless the problem of
nationalism is resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   _ General Jacques Philippe Leclerc, Hanoi, 1947 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HANOI _ In the midst of this capital city sits a squat,
Soviet-style Mausoleum. It houses the body of Ho Chi Minh who, like
Lenin and Mao, lies forever in an embalmed state. It is said that a
team of Russian experts keeps him presentable.
</P>
<P>
   Ho did not ask for this. He asked that his ashes be divided into
three parts and scattered over the three regions of Vietnam, which
he spent his life trying to unite. He died in 1969, six years
before his dream came true, and the Party overruled him regarding
his resting place.
</P>
<P>
   Ho came from a family that, although poor, had been mandarins in
the court in Hue. As a young man, he traveled the world, shipping
out from Saigon on a French freighter. He spent time in Brooklyn,
Boston, and San Francisco, as well as London and Paris, where he
tried to hand President Wilson an anticolonial petition in 1919.
But anticolonialism was not part of Wilson's concept of self
determination.
</P>
<P>
   When the French Communist party was formed, Ho joined it, seeing
in the writings of Lenin the means to end his country's colonial
bondage. He learned political organization in Russia and visited
Mao in China before he slipped back into Vietnam in 1941 after an
absence of 30 years. He organized resistance to both the Japanese
occupiers and their temporary allies, the Vichy French.
</P>
<P>
   When World War II ended, Ho seized upon the political vacuum to
declare independence here in Hanoi. He had made contact with the
American OSS _ the predecessor to the CIA _ in the jungle during
the war. He hoped that President Roosevelt would support him as
Wilson had not. But Roosevelt vacillated, and the Truman
administration didn't want to undermine the French with the cold
war beginning. The US backed the return of the French.
</P>
<P>
   A brief accommodation with the French fell apart, and Ho
retreated to the forests to start a guerrilla war that ended nine
years later with the French defeat at Dien Bien Phu in 1954. The US
ended up spending more money supporting the French war effort than
it had on the Marshall Plan to help rebuild France after World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   The country was partitioned between north and south, communist
and noncommunist, with the United States supporting the south. Ho
set about defeating the United States as he had the French, by
accepting losses that would be unimaginable in the West in order to
wear his enemy down until it tired of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Without foreign help, the anticommunist Vietnamese weren't equal
to the task for the very reason Leclerc had warned in 1947: They
never captured the nationalist cause, which Ho had made his own,
because they were too obviously dependent on foreigners, because
they stood for the status quo, which was both corrupt and venal,
and they were never able to reform themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Militarily, the Americans engaged in a war of attrition in which
they sought to grind down the enemy until he gave up. But, given
the losses Ho was willing to take, and given that the Communists
could always retreat into Laos, Cambodia, or North Vietnam, the war
of attrition worked against the United States. Bombing the North
couldn't tip the balance because most of the war materiel was made
in China or Russia, and the United States did not want to invade
the North, fearing the Chinese would enter the war as had happened
in Korea.
</P>
<P>
   So it was that the Americans tired of the war, as had the
French, and in 1973 allowed the North Vietnamese to keep their
armies in the South while agreeing to remove their own troops. The
South Vietnamese had come to depend on the Americans, and now that
they were on their own, their days were numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Hanoi today, although still second in size, energy, and
commercial importance to Saigon, now called Ho Chi Minh City, is
the undisputed capital of a united country. It is no longer the
grim, low-watt-bulb town of the early '80s with barren shops, dark
streets, and nothing but the hiss of bicycle tires in the mornings.
Today it bustles with traffic. There is a new Hanoi Hilton that is
actually a hotel, and the old prison that bore that ironic name for
a generation of Americans is gone except for a wing maintained as a
museum. It has been replaced by an office and apartment tower.

 c.2000 The Chicago Sun-Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's the dumbest thing I've ever covered.'' _ Rick Bragg,
Miami bureau chief of the New York Times, on the Elian Gonzalez
saga.
</P>
<P>
   Was that like a bad episode of ``Cops'' or what?
</P>
<P>
   The only thing missing from that grainy, jiggly video of the
Holy Saturday seizure of Elian Gonzalez was the sound of ``Bad
Boys'' on the soundtrack as agents grabbed the boy and whisked him
away in a mini-van, while hysterical friends and family members
screamed and cried and lunged for the kid.
</P>
<P>
   Not that I'm joining the knee-jerk chorus of naive protesters
who are invoking the ``jack-booted thugs'' cliche and bellowing
about the ham-handed management tactics of Janet Reno and Billy
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't Ruby Ridge. This wasn't Waco. This was a
justifiable, well-executed tactical operation, carried out with
efficiency by federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, they came in with pepper gas and guns and riot gear,
shouting threats and issuing commands. Guess what? That's how these
things work. Intimidation is a key element in any raid, whether
we're talking about an INS seizure or a bunch of cops bursting into
a murder suspect's house or a crack den in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   You don't tiptoe in and shake hands and ask everyone if they're
in a good mood. You take control.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget, that kid was essentially being held hostage by
those glory-hound distant relatives, who were defying American law
and refusing to let the boy even see his father. What were the feds
supposed to do, say ``Pretty please can we have the kid?''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone claiming there had to be another way to expedite the
transfer of Elian to his nuclear family hasn't been paying
attention these last several months. That circus in Little Havana
was growing increasingly hostile, and Elian's caretakers weren't
helping matters by defiantly clinging to their pre-school-age
political football instead of considering what was best for the boy
_ i.e., reuniting him with his dad.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Elian is now where he should be, he continues to
be exploited. Hours after ``The Taking Of Elian,'' as Fox News
titled it in their instant graphics, a seller on eBay was offering
$3 buttons featuring the infamous photo of the armed agent
confronting Elian and his fisherman-rescuer.
</P>
<P>
   ``THE CLINTON-GORE LEGACY,'' reads the message above the
picture. Below it: ``Send a Message in November Never Again!''
</P>
<P>
   I love this notion that under a Republican administration, we'll
have kinder, less-intrusive federal agencies. How funny.
</P>
<P>
   Other Elian-related items, available on the Internet or from
enterprising vendors in Little Havana:
</P>
<P>
   Bumper stickers. Posters. Comic books. A coffee mug with a
picture of Fidel Castro and the sarcastic inscription, ``World's
Greatest Dad!'' T-shirts. Rubber stamps with Elian's photo. Gag
license plates, with a cartoon Elian, um, squirting in Castro's
face.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet pranksters have periodically put Elian himself on
the auction block: ``Cuban boy for sale,'' stuff like that. But try
to bid and you'll be told the auction is ``invalid.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad. I picture Hugh Hefner making a $1 million bid and
turning Elian into his own version of Mini-Me.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe Hillary Clinton can make a claim for the poor kid.
Wasn't there some noise about her adopting a child a few years
back? Accessorizing with an Elian might be enough to swing New York
in her direction.
</P>
<P>
   As for the media, shame on us. We've started the 21st century by
turning an admittedly compelling but relatively small
human-interest drama into a typically overblown spectacle.
Conducting exploitative interviews with the child, endless playing
of that disturbing ``Papa'' video, sending news choppers into the
sky to hover above the scene, establishing a ``Camp Elian'' outside
his temporary home, treating Saturday's handover as if it were the
most momentous development this side of global nuclear war.
</P>
<P>
   We didn't just report on this story, we fueled its momentum with
rocket-jets of hype. According to the Center for Media and Public
Affairs, as of last week there had been more Elian stories on the
network newscasts (261) than there were about the deaths of
Princess Diana (200) and JFK Jr. (161), over a similar chunk of
time. Elian's even closing in on O.J., who warranted 431 stories
from the networks in the last six months of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   And that was before the events of Easter weekend.
</P>
<P>
   A mom died. Her son miraculously survived. His dad got him back.
</P>
<P>
   End of story.

 &HT;    Helping mothers with a challenging pregnancy
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVERCREEK, Ohio _ The routine ultrasound was taking awfully
long, Laurie Hamlin thought. She knew the technician couldn't tell
her why, but she didn't like the way the tech kept saying things
like, ``Gosh, this baby's not doing much.'' Eventually, the
obstetrician came into the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, 'Well this is really bad,''' said Hamlin. ``'Your
placenta is just in the wrong place. There's nothing we can do
about this.'''
</P>
<P>
   The placenta's location was not the problem, Hamlin learned
later. But the 18-week fetuses' blood vessels were intertwined in
their shared placenta, sending too much blood to one and not enough
to the other.
</P>
<P>
   The condition, twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS), usually
causes miscarriage or brain damage unless treated. The doctor sent
Laurie and her husband, Jeff, to their family doctor that night,
but only to recommend a counselor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were given zero hope,'' Laurie said of that night in early
1996, raising her voice slightly to be heard over the noise of her
twin daughters dashing through the house.
</P>
<P>
   Julianne and Leah Hamlin will turn 4 next week, named for the
doctor who gave them life with a rare surgical procedure inside the
womb 16 weeks before they were born. Dr. Julian De Lia of Milwaukee
separated their blood supplies by killing the connected blood
vessels. He cooked that part of the placenta with a laser light, a
procedure he has done 110 times.
</P>
<P>
   The Hamlins, with their 5-year-old son, Alex, are the March of
Dimes' ambassador family for a WalkAmerica event. Laurie wants to
raise awareness ``with wonderful information and help whether you
have a challenging pregnancy or a healthy one,'' and also to call
attention to De Lia and TTTS.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought Julian would be here by now,'' she said of De
Lia's 18-month effort to establish an international treatment and
research center for birth defects in Dayton. But after being turned
away by Miami Valley Hospital, he is awaiting a decision from
Kettering Medical Center while being courted in Milwaukee and other
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Hamlin wants more people to know about the 3,000 TTTS
pregnancies a year in this country because she feels fortunate to
have found Dr. Jiri Sonek, a fetal specialist who knew how it
should be treated. Her obstetrician's plan was to keep draining
excess amniotic fluid from the sac of the recipient fetus, which
often leads to miscarriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have kept me pregnant but it wasn't going to fix
the problem,'' she said. She learned of De Lia's better alternative
because her mother worked at The Children's Medical Center's unit
for newborns, where Dr. Jeffrey Pietz referred her to Sonek, then
at Franciscan Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   Sonek, now De Lia's prospective associate, appreciated the value
of De Lia's procedure because his own research had shown how badly
things turned out for babies treated only with amniotic draining.
Twenty years ago, De Lia said the death rate for TTTS was at least
95 percent, and half of the survivors had brain damage.
</P>
<P>
   The condition begins with ``random events'' between the fourth
and eighth days of pregnancy, De Lia explained on one of his many
visits to Dayton in recent months. ``The babies are normal. It's
the placentas that are abnormal.''
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of identical twins share a placenta, which connects a
pregnant woman with the umbilical cord through which a fetus is
nourished. But for some reason 15 percent of them develop TTTS.
</P>
<P>
   De Lia began exploring ways to separate the circulatory systems
in 1983, began operating on humans in 1988 and said ``really hit
the end of the learning curve'' in April 1995. An abdominal
incision allows him to guide the laser through a scope to the
placenta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always go in with the intention of saving both babies,'' he
said. ``But you can't see until you're in there the type and number
of vessels involved, or how the placenta is shared.'' The
operation, now done in several countries, normally occurs at 21
weeks, although Hamlin's was at 20.
</P>
<P>
   TTTS babies treated with amniotic draining have a 50 percent
survival rate, but De Lia's survival rate for both twins is 65
percent to 75 percent, said Ann Klonicki of the TTTS Foundation.
The rate for a single survival is 10 percent higher, and the
disability rate for survivors is below 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he doesn't just do the surgery and send you home,'' Hamlin
said. He called her at least once a week for the remaining 16 weeks
of her pregnancy. ``When everybody else was calling the girls
fetuses, they were kids to him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The drama involved in these cases is exhausting,'' De Lia
said. ``I went into this business initially because obstetrics is a
happy specialty. This has a lot more ups and downs, but I also know
I'm saving lives.''

TIME TO END MILITARY'S ``DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL'' POLICY

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Last December, Defense Secretary William Cohen directed the
Office of the Inspector General to survey military personnel
regarding the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy concerning
homosexuals. The policy requires that gay men, lesbians and
bisexuals in the Armed Forces keep silent about their sexual
orientation. They are also not permitted to engage in homosexual
acts.
 &HT;    Cohen requested an ``assessment in order to evaluate the climate
at representative military installations in each service with
regard to our policy on homosexual conduct.''
 &HT;    Cohen's directive came in the wake of the last July's murder of
21-year-old Pvt. Barry Winchell, who was bludgeoned to death at
Fort Campbell, Ky. by fellow service members.
 &HT;    Recently, Cohen released the results of that survey, conducted
at 38 bases and on 11 ships and submarines, from Jan. 24 through
Feb. 11, 2000. The results indicate serious problems in a
pervasively hostile, antigay climate in all four branches of the
Armed Forces.
 &HT;    A whopping 80 percent of the 71,500 service members questioned
reported hearing antigay remarks during 1999. Moreover, 33 percent
said they heard such remarks often or very often. The types of
antigay behavior reported by service members included the
following.
 &HT;    _ Offensive speech: 89 percent
 &HT;    _ Hostile gestures: 35 percent
 &HT;    _ Threats of intimidation: 20 percent
 &HT;    _ Graffiti: 15 percent
 &HT;    _ Physical assault: 9 percent
 &HT;    _ Vandalism of personal property: 8 percent.
 &HT;    The survey also found that junior personnel most frequently
perpetuated the harassment against other junior enlisted service
members. Regardless, 73 percent said that even when senior
personnel witnessed such harassment, they did nothing to stop it.
 &HT;    What is even more alarming is the fact that 37 percent of those
who participated in the survey said they had either witnessed or
seen harassment based on sexual orientation.
 &HT;    Cohen said he was ``surprised at the numbers'' of service
members who had witnessed some form of antigay harassment. ``The
incidents and use of abusive language are more widespread than I
had anticipated,'' he reported to the Houston Chronicle.
 &HT;    The only positive outcome of these disturbing findings is that
after years of denial, Pentagon officials are finally acknowledging
that they have a serious, long-standing problem on their hands.
 &HT;    Why has it taken the military top brass so long to believe that
antigay remarks and harassment abound in the Armed Forces?
 &HT;    For more than six years, the Servicemembers Legal Defense
Network, or SLDN, has been documenting violations in connection
with the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy. Earlier this month, the
network published its sixth annual report, citing 968 incidents of
antigay harassment during the past year, including assaults, death
threats and verbal gay-bashing. They report an increase in
harassment of nearly 150 percent from the previous year's 400
reported incidents.
 &HT;    The Pentagon survey ``simply corroborates what we've been
telling them for the last six years,'' said SLDN co-executive
director Dixon Osborn to the New York Times.
 &HT;    SLDN co-executive director Michelle Benecke told the Houston
Chronicle why harassment has become such a serious problem.
 &HT;    ``Ultimately, the key to stopping harassment and other
violations of 'don't ask, don't tell' violence against gays in the
military is leadership and accountability.'' Benecke said. ``Unless
they take immediate steps, someone else is going to get hurt.''
 &HT;    The policy, which was intended to help gays serve in the Armed
Forces, has proven to be detrimental and demeaning. Thousands of
gay service members have been discharged in recent years.
 &HT;    Prior to and during the implementation of ``don't ask, don't
tell,'' military officials have asserted that the presence of
openly gay service members would undermine morale and unit
cohesion.
 &HT;    Now, with the undeniable results of this survey, Cohen is in the
embarrassing position of having to admit that antigay harassment
itself is what undermines the good order and discipline that is
critical to an effective fighting force.
 &HT;    ``When you have a policy that treats an entire class of people
as second-class citizens, it suggests that you can treat them that
way,'' Osborn told The New York Times.
 &HT;    It is time for the policy to change. The country needs the kind
of policy shift that President Harry Truman initiated when he fully
integrated the military after World War II.
 &HT;    Cohen must advocate for the abolishment of the ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy. He must act now, before another private loses
his or her life to violence at the hands of fellow country men. &HT;

ARE ATHLETES OF AFRICAN DESCENT SUPERIOR?

 By AKILAH MONIFA  
 &HT;    March Madness is over, and the process of deciding which college
athletes will be drafted by the NBA has begun. In the NBA
approximately 80 percent of the players are of African descent. In
the WNBA, 70 percent of the female team members are black. Given
these statistics, the NBA and WNBA pose questions about race and
sport.
 &HT;    Jon Entine, a white journalist, addresses the subject of the
alleged predominance of black athletes, ``Taboo: Why Black Athletes
Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid to Talk About It''
(PublicAffairs, LLC 1999). The book jacket reads, in part:
``Drawing on the latest scientific research, Entine persuasively
shows why biology and ancestry are significant components of the
stunning ascension of black athletes ...''
 &HT;    Entine hopes his book will produce a dialogue. He wants us to
examine why black athletes dominate sports and why we are afraid to
talk about it.
 &HT;    Fine, let's have a dialogue, but let's begin with some facts.
The reality, according to sociologist and professor Harry Edwards,
is that white athletes dominate 95 percent of all sports.
 &HT;    White athletes dominate archery, auto racing, badminton,
bicycling, discus, diving, extreme sports, fencing, golf,
gymnastics, hockey, horse racing, javelin, pole vault, rowing,
shot-put, skiing, soccer, swimming, tennis, walking, water polo,
yachting, and all of the winter sports.
 &HT;    Entine's thinks we are afraid to discuss the possibility that
people of African descent have some genetic predisposition to
athleticism. The subject is hardly new. Decades ago, scientists
examined black athletes to determine if there were any anatomical
reasons for their athletic success. They found none.
 &HT;    In 1936, Jesse Owens was poked and prodded for evidence of
racial superiority. At that time, researchers were unconvinced that
``Negroid physical characters are anatomically concerned with the
present dominance of Negro athletes.''
 &HT;    Is it nearly impossible to determine the genetic factors that
may or may not be involved in a black athlete's performance. How
can you prove how much of a trait is shaped by genes or the
environment? What other variables that contribute to an athlete's
success should we consider as well?
 &HT;    John Phillips, who is quoted in Entine's book, offers a counter
view to the notion of black athletic predominance, which raises
different and, perhaps, more relevant questions.
 &HT;    ``Black athletes are concentrated in those sports in which
blacks in general have access _ in terms of coaching, facilities
and competitions. For sports in which blacks are rare, the best
facilities, coaching and competition are found in private clubs. If
blacks were dispersed across all sports, their apparent superiority
would largely disappear,'' Phillips said.
 &HT;    Instead of asking if athletes of African descent are superior,
perhaps we should ask simpler questions. For instance, why aren't
more people of color involved in sports like swimming? And why
aren't blacks more involved in coaching, management and ownership
of sports teams at all levels?
 &HT;    These are questions that speak not only to race and sports, but
to class and opportunity.

 By AMY WU 
 &HT;    The uncertainty of Elian Gonzalez's fate has spurred massive
protests in Little Havana. The raucous scene, described by some as
``an out-of-control banana republic,'' has also caused many
Cuban-Americans to question their national allegiance and identity.
 &HT;    Recent press reports reveal that Cuban-American police officers
at the scene are confused about their cultural identity. They feel
pressured by the crowds, who want the officers to sympathize with
their pleas to let Elian remain in America because they share
similar roots. On the other hand, some officers want to distance
themselves from this battle. One cop, quoted in The Wall Street
Journal, said, ``I'm first and foremost an American.''
 &HT;    The custody battle that has divided the Cuban-American community
has reminded me of my own mixed feelings about my Chinese ancestry
and American identity.
 &HT;    Recently, I found myself walking along crowded Canal Street in
New York City's Chinatown. It was familiar territory, since I had
walked the same path as a teen _ only then I did it unwillingly.
 &HT;    As a teen-ager, my family's weekly ritual was to take an
hour-long drive to Chinatown. Back then, I protested the ritual
because I was ashamed of being surrounded by people who clearly
looked very similar to me but, to my mind, were in another world.
 &HT;    The Chinese who occupied the open markets, mom-and-pop stores
and laundromats of Chinatown were new immigrants. Their clothes
were worn, and they spoke in a foul-sounding dialect called
Cantonese.
 &HT;    I distanced myself from them by refusing to speak Chinese and
reveal the existence of my Chinese name. In short, I distanced
myself from anything ``Asian.''
 &HT;    My father had a cousin from China who became a waiter at one of
Chinatown's restaurants. I remember ignoring him and feeling
ashamed whenever we all stopped to chat.
 &HT;    Much like today's Cuban-American police officers, I thought to
myself, ``I am an American first and foremost.''
 &HT;    But my strong feelings about, and memories of, New York City's
Chinatown began to change when, at 21, I sought a promising
journalism career in Hong Kong and had to stroll through that
city's streets, which eerily mirrored those of New York's Asian
district.
 &HT;    In Hong Kong, I was thrown into a world where everyone looked
like me, and I held the false belief that I would fit in simply
because all of us shared similar features and names.
 &HT;    The sales ladies spoke to me in Cantonese, as did the bus
drivers and bank tellers, and they all froze in disbelief when I
answered them in English.
 &HT;    In contrast to my childhood thoughts, I now felt a strong desire
to belong. I wanted to soak in their dialect, eat their foods,
understand the humor in their jokes, watch their TV sitcoms.
 &HT;    In short, I wanted to binge on the culture and ``become
Chinese.''
 &HT;    Unfortunately, I found myself caught between cultures and
confused about wanting to assimilate and disassimilate.
 &HT;    A Chinese-American friend who had lived in Hong Kong for four
years told me there are no in-betweens. I had to choose to either
be a local or a foreigner.
 &HT;    During my time in Hong Kong, I learned that gaining an identity
was not as simple as slipping a new outfit over an old one.
Relearning the language and eating the native foods wasn't enough.
Like any foreign culture, the Chinese people have a unique state of
mind and follow a different set of principles.
 &HT;    For example, as a woman born and raised in the United States, I
believe in being independent and in the importance of my career.
Going dutch on dates is the norm in America (at least in the
beginning). In Hong Kong _ and, frankly, in most of Asia _ that is
simply foolish. In Hong Kong, well-educated women dream of
secretarial positions at big companies, where they will hopefully
marry the boss. During my stay, I neither shared their beliefs nor
understood the intricacies of their jokes.
 &HT;    Over time, I found comfort in accepting the fact that complete
assimilation is a myth, and it was something I no longer desired. I
also learned that distancing oneself from one's roots is tragic.
 &HT;    I recently returned to New York City's Chinatown and walked the
same streets I despised as a teen. I saw those same people who once
repulsed me. This time around, however, I felt at ease. The street
peddlers and new immigrants were still working, but I no longer
felt the need to completely associate with, or disassociate from,
them. I realized I could maintain my sense of self _ be a proud
Chinese-American _ and still learn about my culture from them.
 &HT;    I decided I would speak the language and eat the food safely,
and that I would not look down or reject these people with whom I
shared similar roots _ but little else. I did not have to hate them
for who they are or hate myself for who I am.
 &HT;    It is OK to be confused about your identity, but you should
never amputate yourself from your roots.
 &HT;    If anything positive is to come from little Elian's fate, it may
be that first-generation and second-generation hyphenated-Americans
will re-examine who they are and how they see themselves living in
hyphenated-America.

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    Nearly 150 years after the Confederate battle flag last flew
above a rebel army, the meaning of that bit of cloth is still
controversial.
 &HT;    Is it an innocent, harmless symbol of a region's cultural
heritage, without political or racial implications?
 &HT;    Or is it the most sacred symbol of slavery, the
institutionalized essence of racism?
 &HT;    Suspend the debate. Go to the archives and read, and let the
Confederates themselves supply the answer.
 &HT;    First let's consult one of the Confederacy's most articulate
founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton Stephens of Georgia, who
served under Jefferson Davis as vice president of the Confederate
States of America.
 &HT;    Addressing his fellow Georgians in Savannah on March 21, 1861 _
less than a month before Confederates gathered in South Carolina at
Charleston Bay and fired on Fort Sumter _ Stephens began by
disclosing that the Union's founding fathers were privately
convinced that slavery was ``wrong in principal, socially, morally
and politically,'' and that ``the institution would be evanescent
and pass away.''
 &HT;    Speaking on behalf of the Confederacy, Stephens begged to
differ.
 &HT;    ``Our government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea,'' he
declared. ``Its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests upon
the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man. That
slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and
normal condition.''
 &HT;    Describing the embryonic Confederate States of America, Stephens
made clear that racism was part and parcel of its conception.
 &HT;    ``This, our new government, is the first in the history of the
world based upon this great physical and moral truth'' that the
``negro, by nature or by the curse of Canaan, is fitted for the
condition which he occupies in our system.''
 &HT;    He went on to explain that blacks were held in slavery in a
fulfilment of nothing less than the will of God.
 &HT;    ``The substratum of our society is made of the material fitted
by nature for it,'' Stephens said, ``and by experience we know that
it is best, not only for the superior but for the inferior race,
that it should be so. It is indeed in conformity with the ordinance
of the Creator.''
 &HT;    Stephens also criticized the United States Constitution, under
which we live today, holding that it was not racist enough to
guarantee the durability of slavery.
 &HT;    While the old Constitution embraced a fugitive-slave clause and
specified that blacks should count as three-fifths of a white man
for tax purposes, the leaders of the new Confederate government
felt that it did not spell out white superiority boldly and
directly enough.
 &HT;    The rebellion leaders were for real. Driven by a racist
philosophy not widely at odds with the anti-Semitism preached by
Hitler. rebel leaders wanted to make their racial views universal,
endowing themselves with a messianic racial mission.
 &HT;    ``The progress of disintegration in the old Union may be
expected to go on with almost absolute certainty,'' Stephens
announced. ``We are now the nucleus of a growing power, which, if
we are true to ourselves, our destiny and high mission, will become
the controlling power on this continent.''
 &HT;    But the Confederates did not limit their racial goals to this
continent alone. Like Hitler's dream of Aryan superiority, theirs
was a ``tomorrow the world'' ideology.
 &HT;    ``It is upon this (that) our actual fabric is firmly planted,''
Stephens proclaimed, ``and I cannot permit myself to doubt the
ultimate success of a full recognition of this principle throughout
the civilized and enlightened world.''
 &HT;    Yes, the man said ``enlightened world.''
 &HT;    But please don't write off Stephens as an oddball. His racial
views were typically Confederate.
 &HT;    When Texas leaders, meeting at a Secession Convention on
February 1, 1861, voted to became the seventh state to join the
rebellion, for example, they accused the North of ``hostility to
these Southern states and their beneficent and patriarchal system
of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality
of all men, irrespective of race or color.''
 &HT;    To Texas secessionists, racial equality was ``a doctrine at war
with nature,'' and they insisted that ``the servitude of the
African race ... is abundantly authorized and justified by the
experience of mankind and the revealed will of the Almighty
Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations.''
 &HT;    The banner under which that ideology marched off to war, fired
its guns, drew swords and filled hundreds of thousands of graves
was the Confederate battle flag. It is that flag which today
insults all blacks citizens in South Carolina and Georgia,
declaring the survival of a doctrine still at war with human
decency.
 &HT;    When will enough Americans summon the guts to state, with firm
resolution, the simple truth that the Confederates themselves had
no difficulty enunciating: The Confederate battle flag is no simple
emblem of an ``honorable regional cultural heritage,'' but the
embodiment of a sentiment and mission only marginally better than
that expressed, not so long ago, by the swastika.
 &HT;    That flag has no place waving above or on the grounds of any
city, county, state or federal building in the United States.

TIME TO END MILITARY'S ``DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL'' POLICY

 By CHUCK COLBERT  
 &HT;    Last December, Defense Secretary William Cohen directed the
Office of the Inspector General to survey military personnel
regarding the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy concerning
homosexuals. The policy requires that gay men, lesbians and
bisexuals in the Armed Forces keep silent about their sexual
orientation. They are also not permitted to engage in homosexual
acts.
 &HT;    Cohen requested an ``assessment in order to evaluate the climate
at representative military installations in each service with
regard to our policy on homosexual conduct.''
 &HT;    Cohen's directive came in the wake of the last July's murder of
21-year-old Pvt. Barry Winchell, who was bludgeoned to death at
Fort Campbell, Ky. by fellow service members.
 &HT;    Recently, Cohen released the results of that survey, conducted
at 38 bases and on 11 ships and submarines, from Jan. 24 through
Feb. 11, 2000. The results indicate serious problems in a
pervasively hostile, antigay climate in all four branches of the
Armed Forces.
 &HT;    A whopping 80 percent of the 71,500 service members questioned
reported hearing antigay remarks during 1999. Moreover, 33 percent
said they heard such remarks often or very often. The types of
antigay behavior reported by service members included the
following.
 &HT;    _ Offensive speech: 89 percent
 &HT;    _ Hostile gestures: 35 percent
 &HT;    _ Threats of intimidation: 20 percent
 &HT;    _ Graffiti: 15 percent
 &HT;    _ Physical assault: 9 percent
 &HT;    _ Vandalism of personal property: 8 percent.
 &HT;    The survey also found that junior personnel most frequently
perpetuated the harassment against other junior enlisted service
members. Regardless, 73 percent said that even when senior
personnel witnessed such harassment, they did nothing to stop it.
 &HT;    What is even more alarming is the fact that 37 percent of those
who participated in the survey said they had either witnessed or
seen harassment based on sexual orientation.
 &HT;    Cohen said he was ``surprised at the numbers'' of service
members who had witnessed some form of antigay harassment. ``The
incidents and use of abusive language are more widespread than I
had anticipated,'' he reported to the Houston Chronicle.
 &HT;    The only positive outcome of these disturbing findings is that
after years of denial, Pentagon officials are finally acknowledging
that they have a serious, long-standing problem on their hands.
 &HT;    Why has it taken the military top brass so long to believe that
antigay remarks and harassment abound in the Armed Forces?
 &HT;    For more than six years, the Servicemembers Legal Defense
Network, or SLDN, has been documenting violations in connection
with the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy. Earlier this month, the
network published its sixth annual report, citing 968 incidents of
antigay harassment during the past year, including assaults, death
threats and verbal gay-bashing. They report an increase in
harassment of nearly 150 percent from the previous year's 400
reported incidents.
 &HT;    The Pentagon survey ``simply corroborates what we've been
telling them for the last six years,'' said SLDN co-executive
director Dixon Osborn to the New York Times.
 &HT;    SLDN co-executive director Michelle Benecke told the Houston
Chronicle why harassment has become such a serious problem.
 &HT;    ``Ultimately, the key to stopping harassment and other
violations of 'don't ask, don't tell' violence against gays in the
military is leadership and accountability.'' Benecke said. ``Unless
they take immediate steps, someone else is going to get hurt.''
 &HT;    The policy, which was intended to help gays serve in the Armed
Forces, has proven to be detrimental and demeaning. Thousands of
gay service members have been discharged in recent years.
 &HT;    Prior to and during the implementation of ``don't ask, don't
tell,'' military officials have asserted that the presence of
openly gay service members would undermine morale and unit
cohesion.
 &HT;    Now, with the undeniable results of this survey, Cohen is in the
embarrassing position of having to admit that antigay harassment
itself is what undermines the good order and discipline that is
critical to an effective fighting force.
 &HT;    ``When you have a policy that treats an entire class of people
as second-class citizens, it suggests that you can treat them that
way,'' Osborn told The New York Times.
 &HT;    It is time for the policy to change. The country needs the kind
of policy shift that President Harry Truman initiated when he fully
integrated the military after World War II.
 &HT;    Cohen must advocate for the abolishment of the ``don't ask,
don't tell'' policy. He must act now, before another private loses
his or her life to violence at the hands of fellow country men.

ARE ATHLETES OF AFRICAN DESCENT SUPERIOR?

 By AKILAH MONIFA  
 &HT;    March Madness is over, and the process of deciding which college
athletes will be drafted by the NBA has begun. In the NBA
approximately 80 percent of the players are of African descent. In
the WNBA, 70 percent of the female team members are black. Given
these statistics, the NBA and WNBA pose questions about race and
sport.
 &HT;    Jon Entine, a white journalist, addresses the subject of the
alleged predominance of black athletes, ``Taboo: Why Black Athletes
Dominate Sports and Why We're Afraid to Talk About It''
(PublicAffairs, LLC 1999). The book jacket reads, in part:
``Drawing on the latest scientific research, Entine persuasively
shows why biology and ancestry are significant components of the
stunning ascension of black athletes ...''
 &HT;    Entine hopes his book will produce a dialogue. He wants us to
examine why black athletes dominate sports and why we are afraid to
talk about it.
 &HT;    Fine, let's have a dialogue, but let's begin with some facts.
The reality, according to sociologist and professor Harry Edwards,
is that white athletes dominate 95 percent of all sports.
 &HT;    White athletes dominate archery, auto racing, badminton,
bicycling, discus, diving, extreme sports, fencing, golf,
gymnastics, hockey, horse racing, javelin, pole vault, rowing,
shot-put, skiing, soccer, swimming, tennis, walking, water polo,
yachting, and all of the winter sports.
 &HT;    Entine's thinks we are afraid to discuss the possibility that
people of African descent have some genetic predisposition to
athleticism. The subject is hardly new. Decades ago, scientists
examined black athletes to determine if there were any anatomical
reasons for their athletic success. They found none.
 &HT;    In 1936, Jesse Owens was poked and prodded for evidence of
racial superiority. At that time, researchers were unconvinced that
``Negroid physical characters are anatomically concerned with the
present dominance of Negro athletes.''
 &HT;    Is it nearly impossible to determine the genetic factors that
may or may not be involved in a black athlete's performance. How
can you prove how much of a trait is shaped by genes or the
environment? What other variables that contribute to an athlete's
success should we consider as well?
 &HT;    John Phillips, who is quoted in Entine's book, offers a counter
view to the notion of black athletic predominance, which raises
different and, perhaps, more relevant questions.
 &HT;    ``Black athletes are concentrated in those sports in which
blacks in general have access _ in terms of coaching, facilities
and competitions. For sports in which blacks are rare, the best
facilities, coaching and competition are found in private clubs. If
blacks were dispersed across all sports, their apparent superiority
would largely disappear,'' Phillips said.
 &HT;    Instead of asking if athletes of African descent are superior,
perhaps we should ask simpler questions. For instance, why aren't
more people of color involved in sports like swimming? And why
aren't blacks more involved in coaching, management and ownership
of sports teams at all levels?
 &HT;    These are questions that speak not only to race and sports, but
to class and opportunity.

ELIAN GONZALEZ'S FATE SPURS SELF-EXAMINATION

 By AMY WU 
 &HT;    The uncertainty of Elian Gonzalez's fate has spurred massive
protests in Little Havana. The raucous scene, described by some as
``an out-of-control banana republic,'' has also caused many
Cuban-Americans to question their national allegiance and identity.
 &HT;    Recent press reports reveal that Cuban-American police officers
at the scene are confused about their cultural identity. They feel
pressured by the crowds, who want the officers to sympathize with
their pleas to let Elian remain in America because they share
similar roots. On the other hand, some officers want to distance
themselves from this battle. One cop, quoted in The Wall Street
Journal, said, ``I'm first and foremost an American.''
 &HT;    The custody battle that has divided the Cuban-American community
has reminded me of my own mixed feelings about my Chinese ancestry
and American identity.
 &HT;    Recently, I found myself walking along crowded Canal Street in
New York City's Chinatown. It was familiar territory, since I had
walked the same path as a teen _ only then I did it unwillingly.
 &HT;    As a teen-ager, my family's weekly ritual was to take an
hour-long drive to Chinatown. Back then, I protested the ritual
because I was ashamed of being surrounded by people who clearly
looked very similar to me but, to my mind, were in another world.
 &HT;    The Chinese who occupied the open markets, mom-and-pop stores
and laundromats of Chinatown were new immigrants. Their clothes
were worn, and they spoke in a foul-sounding dialect called
Cantonese.
 &HT;    I distanced myself from them by refusing to speak Chinese and
reveal the existence of my Chinese name. In short, I distanced
myself from anything ``Asian.''
 &HT;    My father had a cousin from China who became a waiter at one of
Chinatown's restaurants. I remember ignoring him and feeling
ashamed whenever we all stopped to chat.
 &HT;    Much like today's Cuban-American police officers, I thought to
myself, ``I am an American first and foremost.''
 &HT;    But my strong feelings about, and memories of, New York City's
Chinatown began to change when, at 21, I sought a promising
journalism career in Hong Kong and had to stroll through that
city's streets, which eerily mirrored those of New York's Asian
district.
 &HT;    In Hong Kong, I was thrown into a world where everyone looked
like me, and I held the false belief that I would fit in simply
because all of us shared similar features and names.
 &HT;    The sales ladies spoke to me in Cantonese, as did the bus
drivers and bank tellers, and they all froze in disbelief when I
answered them in English.
 &HT;    In contrast to my childhood thoughts, I now felt a strong desire
to belong. I wanted to soak in their dialect, eat their foods,
understand the humor in their jokes, watch their TV sitcoms.
 &HT;    In short, I wanted to binge on the culture and ``become
Chinese.''
 &HT;    Unfortunately, I found myself caught between cultures and
confused about wanting to assimilate and disassimilate.
 &HT;    A Chinese-American friend who had lived in Hong Kong for four
years told me there are no in-betweens. I had to choose to either
be a local or a foreigner.
 &HT;    During my time in Hong Kong, I learned that gaining an identity
was not as simple as slipping a new outfit over an old one.
Relearning the language and eating the native foods wasn't enough.
Like any foreign culture, the Chinese people have a unique state of
mind and follow a different set of principles.
 &HT;    For example, as a woman born and raised in the United States, I
believe in being independent and in the importance of my career.
Going dutch on dates is the norm in America (at least in the
beginning). In Hong Kong _ and, frankly, in most of Asia _ that is
simply foolish. In Hong Kong, well-educated women dream of
secretarial positions at big companies, where they will hopefully
marry the boss. During my stay, I neither shared their beliefs nor
understood the intricacies of their jokes.
 &HT;    Over time, I found comfort in accepting the fact that complete
assimilation is a myth, and it was something I no longer desired. I
also learned that distancing oneself from one's roots is tragic.
 &HT;    I recently returned to New York City's Chinatown and walked the
same streets I despised as a teen. I saw those same people who once
repulsed me. This time around, however, I felt at ease. The street
peddlers and new immigrants were still working, but I no longer
felt the need to completely associate with, or disassociate from,
them. I realized I could maintain my sense of self _ be a proud
Chinese-American _ and still learn about my culture from them.
 &HT;    I decided I would speak the language and eat the food safely,
and that I would not look down or reject these people with whom I
shared similar roots _ but little else. I did not have to hate them
for who they are or hate myself for who I am.
 &HT;    It is OK to be confused about your identity, but you should
never amputate yourself from your roots.
 &HT;    If anything positive is to come from little Elian's fate, it may
be that first-generation and second-generation hyphenated-Americans
will re-examine who they are and how they see themselves living in
hyphenated-America.

IS THE REBEL FLAG A RACIST EMBLEM? JUST ASK THE CONFEDERATES

 By VERNON JARRETT  
 &HT;    Nearly 150 years after the Confederate battle flag last flew
above a rebel army, the meaning of that bit of cloth is still
controversial.
 &HT;    Is it an innocent, harmless symbol of a region's cultural
heritage, without political or racial implications?
 &HT;    Or is it the most sacred symbol of slavery, the
institutionalized essence of racism?
 &HT;    Suspend the debate. Go to the archives and read, and let the
Confederates themselves supply the answer.
 &HT;    First let's consult one of the Confederacy's most articulate
founding fathers, Alexander Hamilton Stephens of Georgia, who
served under Jefferson Davis as vice president of the Confederate
States of America.
 &HT;    Addressing his fellow Georgians in Savannah on March 21, 1861 _
less than a month before Confederates gathered in South Carolina at
Charleston Bay and fired on Fort Sumter _ Stephens began by
disclosing that the Union's founding fathers were privately
convinced that slavery was ``wrong in principal, socially, morally
and politically,'' and that ``the institution would be evanescent
and pass away.''
 &HT;    Speaking on behalf of the Confederacy, Stephens begged to
differ.
 &HT;    ``Our government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea,'' he
declared. ``Its foundations are laid, its cornerstone rests upon
the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man. That
slavery, subordination to the superior race, is his natural and
normal condition.''
 &HT;    Describing the embryonic Confederate States of America, Stephens
made clear that racism was part and parcel of its conception.
 &HT;    ``This, our new government, is the first in the history of the
world based upon this great physical and moral truth'' that the
``negro, by nature or by the curse of Canaan, is fitted for the
condition which he occupies in our system.''
 &HT;    He went on to explain that blacks were held in slavery in a
fulfilment of nothing less than the will of God.
 &HT;    ``The substratum of our society is made of the material fitted
by nature for it,'' Stephens said, ``and by experience we know that
it is best, not only for the superior but for the inferior race,
that it should be so. It is indeed in conformity with the ordinance
of the Creator.''
 &HT;    Stephens also criticized the United States Constitution, under
which we live today, holding that it was not racist enough to
guarantee the durability of slavery.
 &HT;    While the old Constitution embraced a fugitive-slave clause and
specified that blacks should count as three-fifths of a white man
for tax purposes, the leaders of the new Confederate government
felt that it did not spell out white superiority boldly and
directly enough.
 &HT;    The rebellion leaders were for real. Driven by a racist
philosophy not widely at odds with the anti-Semitism preached by
Hitler. rebel leaders wanted to make their racial views universal,
endowing themselves with a messianic racial mission.
 &HT;    ``The progress of disintegration in the old Union may be
expected to go on with almost absolute certainty,'' Stephens
announced. ``We are now the nucleus of a growing power, which, if
we are true to ourselves, our destiny and high mission, will become
the controlling power on this continent.''
 &HT;    But the Confederates did not limit their racial goals to this
continent alone. Like Hitler's dream of Aryan superiority, theirs
was a ``tomorrow the world'' ideology.
 &HT;    ``It is upon this (that) our actual fabric is firmly planted,''
Stephens proclaimed, ``and I cannot permit myself to doubt the
ultimate success of a full recognition of this principle throughout
the civilized and enlightened world.''
 &HT;    Yes, the man said ``enlightened world.''
 &HT;    But please don't write off Stephens as an oddball. His racial
views were typically Confederate.
 &HT;    When Texas leaders, meeting at a Secession Convention on
February 1, 1861, voted to became the seventh state to join the
rebellion, for example, they accused the North of ``hostility to
these Southern states and their beneficent and patriarchal system
of African slavery, proclaiming the debasing doctrine of equality
of all men, irrespective of race or color.''
 &HT;    To Texas secessionists, racial equality was ``a doctrine at war
with nature,'' and they insisted that ``the servitude of the
African race ... is abundantly authorized and justified by the
experience of mankind and the revealed will of the Almighty
Creator, as recognized by all Christian nations.''
 &HT;    The banner under which that ideology marched off to war, fired
its guns, drew swords and filled hundreds of thousands of graves
was the Confederate battle flag. It is that flag which today
insults all blacks citizens in South Carolina and Georgia,
declaring the survival of a doctrine still at war with human
decency.
 &HT;    When will enough Americans summon the guts to state, with firm
resolution, the simple truth that the Confederates themselves had
no difficulty enunciating: The Confederate battle flag is no simple
emblem of an ``honorable regional cultural heritage,'' but the
embodiment of a sentiment and mission only marginally better than
that expressed, not so long ago, by the swastika.
 &HT;    That flag has no place waving above or on the grounds of any
city, county, state or federal building in the United States.

PROPERTY SEIZURE LAWS OVERHAULED

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Jim Spurlock is an unlikely activist.
</P>
<P>
   The prosperous airplane broker is a private pilot and a lifelong
Republican. Since 1976, he has spent much of his time in an office
at Fort Worth Meacham Airport putting airplane buyers in touch with
owners, sometimes spending months arranging a single purchase.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1991 and 1992, the U.S. Customs Service seized two of his
customers' jets because of a paperwork error. Spurlock said he
spent nine months and thousands of dollars getting them returned.
He said he learned that basic legal principles, such as presumption
of innocence, could be upended by federal asset forfeiture laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule of law is disappearing. Something needs to be done to
change it back,'' said Spurlock, 57, of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years later, Congress has acted on his concerns and those
of hundreds more people who contend that they are innocent victims
of the forfeiture laws. President Clinton signed the overhaul bill
on Tuesday. A Clinton spokeswoman said the bill will protect the
rights of the accused while helping law enforcement fight drug
trafficking and white-collar crime.
</P>
<P>
   Will Ferrell, executive director of the American Civil Liberties
Union of Texas, calls the bill a ``moral victory'' following the
``hysteria of the war on drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is an example of how when elected officials really sit
down and think about the ramifications of their actions they will
come into standing with the Constitution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government began confiscating money from drug
dealers in the 1970s, and the practice took off in the 1980s when
President Reagan declared a war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Northern District of Texas, which covers Tarrant, Dallas
and several other counties, it happens about 130 times a year,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As Spurlock learned, money is not the only asset seized.
Officials can take anything of value, including houses, vehicles
and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest change in the law is in burden of proof. According
to the original law, prosecutors only had to show probable cause
that property was involved in a crime or bought with ill-gotten
money, and owners had to prove that they were innocent to get back
their property. That is the same level of proof needed to get a
search warrant.
</P>
<P>
   The new law will require more. It calls for the same amount of
proof needed to win most civil cases.
</P>
<P>
   The law also will allow some defendants to have court-appointed
lawyers, and it holds federal agents responsible for damage to
seized property. Also, defendants no longer have to put up a bond
before they contest a seizure in court.
</P>
<P>
   Brock Stevenson, who handles property seizures for the U.S.
attorney's office in Dallas, said the changes would have a
negligible effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll just put a higher burden on government,'' he said.
``Most prosecutors, when they take an asset forfeiture case,
realize they have to have more than just bare probable cause.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department asset seizure fund increased from $27
million in 1985 to a peak of $556 million in 1993, according to the
House Judiciary Committee. The fund had $449 million in cash and
property as of 1998, according to the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Seized cash and property usually are liquidated, then returned
to the Justice Department or to the agencies that seized them. The
agencies have broad discretion about how to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   During the past two years, police agencies in Texas shared $22.6
million in cash forfeited through state court proceedings and about
$3 million in liquidated properties, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Police departments in Arlington, Fort Worth and Northeast
Tarrant County have funneled that money into anti-drug operations
and community awareness programs such as Drug Abuse Resistance
Education, into purchases of guns and body armor, and to open and
furnish storefront offices.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 years, the North Richland Hills Police Department has
received about $448,000 in federal forfeiture funds and about
$155,000 from state funds, Police Chief Tom Shockley said.
</P>
<P>
   The money was used to purchase vehicles, computers and furniture
and also as ``buy money'' for drug stings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's helped our community,'' Shockley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret that there have been abuses across the country
with some of the seizures,'' he said. ``But the tack we take is,
let's not seize what we can seize but see if we can impact the drug
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurlock said he got involved after Customs Service agents
seized a $450,000 Learjet and a $550,000 Beechcraft he had sold to
two Brazilian businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Customs agents seized the jets because the businessmen
mistakenly indicated that they were owned by a U.S. corporation,
Spurlock said.
</P>
<P>
   When U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas looked into the case at
Spurlock's request, customs officials wrote that they suspected the
businessmen and the pilot of drug smuggling and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Spurlock said he was floored.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the sinister parts was they never arrested the people,
investigated them or charged them with the crime,'' he said. ``All
they wanted was the property.''
</P>
<P>
   When the House Judiciary Committee had hearings on asset
forfeiture, people from across the country shared their stories.
</P>
<P>
   The practice always has been unpopular with civil libertarians,
who say that returning the proceeds to the police gives them an
incentive to seize property.
</P>
<P>
   Some, including the ACLU and U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of
Houston, have contended that minorities are disproportionate
targets of civil forfeitures.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson Lee testified that racial profiling by police has
increased the number of minorities involved in traffic stops,
airport searches and drug arrests, which often lead to property
seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The overhaul bill was tied up in a conference committee in
December when Customs Service agents evicted Keller resident Misty
Burton from a small farm she shared with her husband. Police and
customs agents contended that her husband had bought the farm using
drug money. Her husband was in prison and she did not find a lawyer
early enough to contest the seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Burton's attorney, Brantley Pringle, made a last-ditch appeal.
He argued that the case violated the constitutional guarantee
against unreasonable seizure, and that Burton became part-owner of
the farm long after her husband was accused of being involved with
illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The government won the case. ``Their contention is the only way
we can make this evil property wholesome ... essentially is to take
it ourselves,'' Pringle said.
</P>
<P>
   Spurlock said his experience with forfeiture laws continues to
trouble him.
</P>
<P>
   His customers ``only lost an airplane,'' he said. ``I lost my
Constitution.''

BRITAIN EARNS MORE THAN $35 BILLION FROM AUCTION OF WIRELESS
LICENSES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ After 150 rounds of frenzied bidding that pushed prices
seven times beyond expectations, an auction for licenses to operate
new generation wireless devices linked to the Internet came to a
close Thursday, reaping the British government a huge $35.5 billion
windfall.
</P>
<P>
   The auction, which began nearly eight weeks ago with 13 bidders
in the field, ended when a British subsidiary of NTL Inc., backed
by France Telecom, withdrew. That left the winners as Britain's
four existing mobile telephone operators and one newcomer _ TIW
UMTS, backed by fast-growing Telesystem International Wireless of
Canada and Hutchison Whampoa of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest single bid of $9.42 billion came from Vodafone
AirTouch PLC, the global wireless giant, which dueled with British
Telecommunications PLC for license B _ a license with the broadest
capacity available to existing wireless operators.
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected scale of the bidding has raised worries among
analysts and consumers that the prices for the 20-year licenses,
which come into use in 2002, are too high, adding to corporate debt
and risking an increase in consumer prices that will ultimately
restrict the market for mobile e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone's chief executive, Chris Gent, said that by winning the
new license, his company would be able to offer its services to
``more customers than any other operator.'' But British
Telecommunications said the premium paid for the broadest license
was too high and that it would be able to offer cheaper services.
The technology for the new generation of devices is supposed to
increase Internet access speed for mobile gadgets by between 40 and
200 times, opening up what operators insist will be a bonanza in
the rapidly expanding wireless market, where Europe has established
an early lead over the United States. Operators argue that the
technology will yield new vistas of Internet access and e-commerce
from mobile phones and hand-held devices.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Peter Bonfield, the chief executive of British
Telecommunications, said, for instance, that wireless services
would produce ``explosive growth.'' Stephen Byers, the trade and
industry minister, said the early licensing of new generation
operators was a vital step toward making Britain ``the best place
in the world for e-commerce.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain has said it will use the proceeds from the auction to
reduce the national debt.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   With the auction over, the spotlight in telecommunications now
swings to Orange, Britain's third mobile operator, which Vodafone
acquired with its acquisition of Mannesmann A.G. earlier this year.
British and European regulators have insisted that Vodafone shed
the smaller company to avoid unfair dominance of Britain's mobile
phone market.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Trade and Industry, a British regulator, said
Vodafone's new license would not be granted irrevocably until it
had disposed of Orange. With predators circling the smaller British
mobile company, France Telecom said again Thursday that it had a
``strong interest'' in buying Orange. ``We're just waiting to know
how, when _ and whether _Orange will be sold,'' a spokeswoman for
France Telecom said.
</P>
<P>
   Vodafone has spoken in the past of floating Orange as a separate
company, but is known to be concerned about the tax implications of
such a spinoff.

ANTIQUES: LUCITE FORMS TURNING UP ALL OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   By WENDY MOONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hollywood and Lucite was a marriage made in heaven.
In the 1930s, when polyacrylics, a group of transparent
thermoplastics, came into wide use, designers chose Lucite as a way
to add panache to the homes of glamorous clients. You see it in old
photographs of the houses of movie stars like Claudette Colbert,
who carefully displayed her Oscar for ``It Happened One Night'' on
a Lucite table in her living room.
</P>
<P>
   Lucite was trademarked by DuPont in the 1930s (it is also called
Plexiglas and Perspex) and was first used as a glass substitute for
industrial purposes like boat windshields and aircraft windows.
Cast in a mold while hot, it can be formed into clear sheets, rods,
tubes or blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Plexicraft still make Lucite furniture, but
collectors prefer the vintage designs. Several pieces showed up at
the Kips Bay Boys and Girls Club Decorator Show House, which opened
this week at 1 E. 94th St. and runs through May 21. David Barrett,
for example, included Lucite in his decor there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the see-through look the first time I saw it in the
1950s,'' said Barrett, who is celebrating his 50th year as a
decorator, ``and I think it's still very young today.'' He has a
Lucite desk with a leather top and transparent legs that was
inspired by an antique French bureau plat, which he said was made
by the fashionable Paris decorating firm Jansen in about 1940.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lucite furniture doesn't seem to take up space,'' he said. He
also has a vintage chandelier that looks a bit like an Indian
headdress except that the ``feathers'' are Lucite; two vintage
Lucite armchairs, and a pair of Art Deco-style candelabra with
three intertwined Lucite arms from the 1950s. Barrett borrowed them
all from Newel Art Galleries in Manhattan, which has a large stock
of Lucite.
</P>
<P>
   DeBare Saunders and Ronald Mayne, designers in Watertown, Conn.,
whose firm is called Stingray Hornsby (after Saunders' uncle, a
Corvette Stingray racer), created a man's dressing room at Kips Bay
with a pair of 1930s brass-and-Lucite fluorescent 5-foot-tall ocean
liner sconces, also from Newel. ``They are out of scale and larger
than life,'' Saunders said. ``They were made at a time when
fluorescent light was new.''
</P>
<P>
   Vintage Lucite is also showing up in shops specializing in
midcentury modern design. Form and Function, at 95 Vandam St. in
SoHo, is selling a rare 1957 Lucite Daffodil chair, designed by
Estelle and Erwine Laverne, for $3,800. (The chair is shown on an
antiques Web site, www.Circline.com.) Mike Cannamela of Form and
Function said that vintage Laverne pieces were classics. ``Lucite
used to be seen as 1960s kitsch,'' he said, ``but now the
well-designed pieces are becoming more popular.'' The Lavernes,
proponents of the modern look, opened their New York company in
1938.
</P>
<P>
   The most famous Laverne design is a 1957 Lucite dining room seat
called the Champagne chair. On May 21, Los Angeles Modern Auctions,
or LAMA, is selling a similar Laverne Buttercup chair, also from
1957. (The auction house's Web site is www.lamodern.com.) ``The
Lavernes named most of their chairs after flowers,'' said Peter
Loughery, who owns the auction house. ``The lines are very
progressive-looking, as opposed to Lucite furniture made in the
1980s, which doesn't have much design merit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles sale also includes a 1960s Lucite table lamp in
the shape of a bird's wing designed by Joe Colombo, a Milanese
architect born in 1930, and a 1954 vanity stool with Lucite legs
designed by Paul Laszlo, a Viennese architect who settled in
Beverly Hills in the 1930s. ``Laszlo's furniture was custom made,''
Loughery said. ``He was a modernist but not a minimalist. This
stool has a flowery cushion.''
</P>
<P>
   Laszlo Lucite can also be found at Becker Arts, a gallery on
White Street in TriBeCa. ``If a Lazslo piece is outstanding, we buy
it,'' said the owner, Paul Donzella.
</P>
<P>
   Icon20, an auction Web site that specializes in 20th-century
works (www.Icon20.com), is selling a 1987 Max sideboard with Lucite
designed by Ettore Sottsass, the founder of the Milanese design
cooperative Memphis. Sottsass is one of the few avant-garde
designers attracted to the material. The architect Frank O. Gehry
said in an interview last week that he had experimented with Lucite
many years ago but ``found it too difficult a material to work
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Some old Lucite designs are so popular that they are being
reproduced. Peter Vaughn, a New York designer, has brought back a
line of Lucite furniture and objects created in the 1960s by Baron
Alessandro Albrizzi, a Venetian architect. ``Albrizzi collaborated
a lot with David Hicks in the 1960s,'' Vaughn said, referring to
the British designer. ``They invented the swinging London style.
Albrizzi made Lucite chic.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark McDonald, the owner of Gansevoort Gallery at 72 Gansevoort
St. in the West Village, is selling a Lucite chair that was
designed as a prototype for the furniture company Herman Miller by
Gilbert Rohde in 1939. ``It was never put into production,''
McDonald said, ``probably because of the advent of World War II and
the ensuing scarcity of Plexiglas, which was reserved for military
use.'' The price is $45,000; he said the chair is one of two in
existence that once belonged to Rohde's widow.
</P>
<P>
   Rohde made his mark in the 1934 ``Machine Art'' exhibition at
the Museum of Modern Art in New York. His Lucite creations are
featured in a new book, ``American Modern, 1925-1940: Design for a
New Age'' by J. Stewart Johnson (Harry N. Abrams).
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is a curator of an exhibition of the same name that
opens at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   A Botanical Benefit
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four dealers, including an antiquarian bookseller, are
showing their wares at the eighth Antique Garden Furniture Show at
the New York Botanical Garden. The show opens with a benefit party
on Thursday and continues through May 7. Tickets to the benefit,
with an auction of rare plants supplied by private growers, are
$150. ``Every penny from the auction goes to buy plants for the
botanical garden's curatorial people,'' said Susan Burke, one of
the organizers. Information: (718) 817-8773.
</P>
<P>
   The party will have a sneak preview of a show of 100 Chinese
tree peony specimens.
</P>
<P>
   The garden has acres of tulips, daffodils, crab apple and cherry
trees in bloom. Gregory Long, its president, said, ``The fair is
another way to enjoy a garden without having to be great at
horticulture.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ MCI WorldCom (WCOM:Nasdaq) and Finnish cell phone
maker Nokia (NOK:NYSE), two leaders in wireless communications,
reported strong quarterly earnings Thursday and forecast a robust
year ahead.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom said net income jumped 80 percent to $1.3 billion, or
44 cents a diluted share, from $720 million, or 24 cents a share,
from the first quarter in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The results beat First Call/Thomson Financial's consensus
expectation of 43 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The stock rose 3 1/4, or 8 percent, to 44 1/8 in midday trading
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Clinton, Miss., said profits were
propelled by strong Internet and data services, international
revenues, and declining access and technology costs.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 14 percent to $10 billion from $8.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``On an annualized basis, data, Internet and international
services represent more than $18 billion of annualized revenue
growing at 32 percent,'' Bernard Ebbers, president and chief
executive of WorldCom, said in a statement. ``We are clearly
leading the communications industry into a new era dominated by
data- and Internet-based services.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nokia said operating profit rose 71 percent to $1.27
billion, while sales rose 69 percent to $6.31 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange-listed shares of the Helsinki,
Finland-based company rose 2 9/16, or 5 percent, to 54 7/16 by
midday.
</P>
<P>
   Jorma Ollila, Nokia chairman and chief executive, said in a
statement that he was confident the company would increase revenue
by at least the previously forecast range of 30 percent to 40
percent, based on current market conditions.

   HO CHI MINH CITY _ Saigon was in chaos. The Americans were
finally ending their disastrous military adventure in Vietnam.
Thousands of Americans and South Vietnamese alike were scrambling
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most celebrated photographs of a war which gave the
world so many haunting images was taken during the last few hours
of April 29, 1975, regarded as capturing the final chaotic moments
before the American evacuation was complete.
</P>
<P>
   It is a photograph that has been published countless thousands
of times, with a caption describing a desperate crowd of Americans
on the roof of the United States Embassy to board a waiting
helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   But as with so many things about the Vietnam war, even this
cannot be taken for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Although the main thrust of the evacuation was indeed from the
U.S. Embassy, there were other assembly points for evacuation.
</P>
<P>
   Now, 25 years after the photograph was taken, it has emerged
that the building in the picture is actually an apartment block,
some distance away from the embassy compound. Most of the people in
the photograph were Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Van Es, the United Press International photographer in
Vietnam who took the picture, said Thursday: ``As much of the
evacuation was from the U.S. Embassy my picture editors assumed the
picture was of the embassy, even though it was actually from a
downtown building about a mile way from the embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I sent the picture to the agency in the last few hours
before the American withdrawal, it was with the correct caption. I
said it was the evacuation from an apartment building, 22 Gia Long
Street in Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously editors do not read picture captions; this is par
for the course.''
</P>
<P>
   The building pictured by Van Es, a Dutchman who has been based
in Hong Kong since the war, was largely reserved for the employees
of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
But the top floor was set aside for the top brass of the CIA in
Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   The night before the evacuation, the station chief, Thomas
Polgar, had phoned a group of those South Vietnamese who had been
friends of the CIA and told them they should gather at the building
with their families so that they could be evacuated. These people
included generals, police officers and politicians who had been
helpful during the years of the war.
</P>
<P>
   But it was soon clear that the area was at risk from the
approaching North Vietnamese army and Polger would have to come up
with an idea to get his South Vietnamese friends out of the
building as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   His inspired plan was to land a helicopter on top of the
building's elevator shaft. He ordered in a Huey helicopter operated
by Air America, the CIA's airline for its operation in Southeast
Asia, to collect the Vietnamese officials and their families, and
he asked a CIA employee, O. B. Harnage, to direct the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Harnage stood by the ladder to the roof and directed the
families to the Huey. He says he is the man at the top of the
ladder in the photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Van Es was well aware of who the people in the photograph
were at the time it was taken. ``The people in the picture are
mostly South Vietnamese government workers, people working for
USAID, some CIA, but mostly officials and politicians from South
Vietnam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told many people over the years since the war about the
mistake but it has never changed the way the picture is presented.
I have no control over that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time I am not even credited by name as having
taken it. It just runs with the agency caption made at the time and
the UPI tag. Since the war it has been published in a number of
U.S. history books and always with the wrong caption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time/Life are the only ones who have ever captioned the
picture correctly. When they use the picture they do not describe
it as the embassy evacuation and they always credit me by name.''
</P>
<P>
   And so this picture has become a metaphor for many of the
misunderstandings that afflicted Vietnam, of how America imposed
its own ideas depending on its view of the war. &QL;

CATALINA AFTER-HOURS IS AN ISLAND OF TRANQUILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AVALON, Calif. _ As we left San Pedro harbor, we were surrounded
by the odd combination of gritty industrial warehouses on one side
and Carnival cruise ships on the other.
</P>
<P>
   It was the perfect symbol of what we were leaving behind _
overcrowded Los Angeles _ and where we were headed _ a quick
getaway to Catalina Island.
</P>
<P>
   A little over an hour later, as the town of Avalon began to
appear like a mirage through the gray skies, the change was a bit
unreal.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Avalon did look like a Mediterranean coastal town from a
distance _ some California-ized hybrid of Capri and Portofino. Its
landmark Casino building that flanks one end of the harbor was as
eye-catching as the brochures proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   The town, with homes climbing the hillsides, is where almost all
of Catalina Island's population of 3,500 reside. But if you just
spent a few hours strolling along its waterfront _ as many do
before catching a return ferry _ you might think there was little
the island had to offer.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Avalon, for example, doesn't quite hold up to its
jaw-dropping entrance upon closer inspection. It takes a little
more digging _ and the departure of the day-trippers _ for its
charms to sink in.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the shops along the waterfront were of the T-shirt and
tacky souvenir variety. Our meal at a waterfront restaurant proved
to be hit-and-miss. (The seared tuna was fresh and flavorful; the
leathery, tasteless calamari produced indigestion.)
</P>
<P>
   Our accommodations and the island's natural beauty were our
saving grace.
</P>
<P>
   While many of the inns close to the water appeared devoid of
charm, the Zane Grey Hotel, on a cliff above The Casino, rewarded
our impulse to stay the night.
</P>
<P>
   The Pueblo-style hotel was built in 1926 and was once the home
of Grey, the famed western writer. The million-dollar view outside
our room overlooked the Casino below and the lights of the
California coastline 22 miles away glowed on the horizon.
</P>
<P>
   Our sparsely decorated room, Wandering Star, was named after one
of Grey's novels, as were all of the rooms. Dusty old paperbacks of
his novels can be borrowed from the front desk. An open-air balcony
on one end of the hotel provides a view of Avalon's harbor.
</P>
<P>
   The inn also provides free taxis into town several times a day _
the ride from the ferry dock when you arrive to the hotel is free _
but the 10-minute walk into town was worthwhile to get a sense of
the homes and guest houses lining the town's cliffside streets.
</P>
<P>
   The inn evokes an earlier era on Catalina when movie stars were
commonplace. The islands' boosters like to recall that John Wayne,
Cecil B. DeMille and Winston Churchill came for the sport fishing.
Laurel and Hardy and Big Band artists like Woody Herman and Jimmy
Dorsey also made the trek.
</P>
<P>
   In the heart of town, the Casino Building, where those Big Band
artists performed, is worth checking out for its architecture and
entertainment. The 12-story Art Deco structure, which was completed
in 1929, includes a ballroom with a massive dance floor and a movie
theater designed to look like an underwater scene.
</P>
<P>
   On the night we stopped by, organ music could be heard from the
theater before the night's showing of ``The Talented Mr. Ripley''
and a Valentine's Day dance was under way upstairs in the ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   But while many day-trippers see only Avalon, there is far more
to the island. It would be possible, in fact, to spend days
exploring Catalina's rugged interior.
</P>
<P>
   The island, purchased by William Wrigley Jr. in 1919, was
largely left undeveloped under his control. The undeveloped portion
still resembles the island Portuguese navigator Don Juan Rodriquez
Cabrillo stumbled upon in 1542.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   It didn't become known as Catalina until 60 years later when a
Spanish expedition arrived on Nov. 24, 1602. It was the eve of the
feast of St. Catherine of Alexandria, so they named the island
Santa Catalina.
</P>
<P>
   North American sailors showed up in the early 1800s. At the end
of the Mexican War in 1848, the island was bought by Californian
Thomas Robbins of Santa Barbara, purportedly in exchange for a
silver saddle. A few years later, a brief mining boom came to the
island that ended with the occupation by Union troops in 1863.
</P>
<P>
   Although visitors made it to the island in the late 1800s,
Wrigley's purchase led the island on its path to a tourist
destination and a preserve.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the island's interior and 48 miles of coastline were
placed in the control of Catalina Island Conservancy in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   The conservancy controls about 42,000 acres _ roughly 86 percent
of the island. Bison, which were originally brought to the island
in 1924 for the filming of Grey's novel ``The Vanishing American,''
can be seen, as well as wild goats, wild pigs and deer.
</P>
<P>
   Jeep eco-tours, horseback riding and hiking allow both high-end
and economical ways to explore the interior, which features
valleys, remote bays and 2,000-foot peaks
</P>
<P>
   Snorkeling is also a popular activity. The island has been
touted as one of the top destinations in North America and Casino
Point Marine Park, just offshore from the Casino, is an underwater
city park. For those who don't dive, glass-bottom boat and
submarine tours are available.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, there has been an effort to replant native
grasses and trees and to reintroduce the bald eagle.
</P>
<P>
   If we make a return trip, we would be tempted to stay at Two
Harbors, an isthmus 14 miles from Avalon. The rustic village has an
inn, a general store and a restaurant, and is popular with hikers
and mountain bikers. Ferries run from San Pedro and Long Beach to
Two Harbors. Shuttle buses also run between Avalon and San Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   Many Californians prefer this low-key alternative to Avalon,
which is also popular with yachters because it is the only natural,
all-weather harbor between San Francisco and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Some campers also camp between the two towns at one of three
seaside coastal campgrounds or one mountaintop campsite.
</P>
<P>
   The weather is generally temperate on Catalina throughout the
year, though rain hampered some activities during our February
visit. Many of the tours run only from spring to fall.
</P>
<P>
   One plus of our off-season visit was the tranquility. Once the
ferry boats left Avalon for the night, we had sections of the
harbor to ourselves.
</P>
<P>
   What could be a better respite from a visit to car-mad LA?
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   Catalina Island isn't LA, but it still has Southern California
prices. Many of the tours and hotels are not bargains.
</P>
<P>
   Two-hour Jeep tours run $65.
</P>
<P>
   A four-hour sundown cruise between Avalon and Two Harbors
(between April and October) is $30. Dinner is extra.
</P>
<P>
   Our room at the Zane Grey was $103, including taxes and a
poolside continental breakfast. Prices are higher on weekends and
during the summer but can drop dramatically for midweek visits
during the winter. The Zane Grey has dramatic views of the island
and a laid-back atmosphere, but can be too austere for some. Some
guests complained about the lack of televisions or phones in the
spartan rooms. Dinner for two, including two beers, cost $40.
</P>
<P>
   To reach Catalina, we took the Catalina Express for $38 per
person roundtrip out of San Pedro. The island can also be reached
from Long Beach, Newport Beach and Dana Point. Helicopter service
is also available. There are also combination packages that combine
hotel and transportation that may save money, depending on the time
of the visit.
</P>
<P>
   Cars are not available for rent on the island. Golf carts can be
rented in Avalon for $40 to $60 an hour. This works in town _ the
golf carts are everywhere _ but it's not a way to see the island.
Plenty of tour packages are also available to see Catalina.
Although Catalina has been a favorite haunt of Hollywood stars, it
is also known for the death of actress Natalie Wood. She drowned
just off the coast of the island in 1981. The mystery surrounding
her death was the subject of a recent Vanity Fair magazine article.

said it was the evacuation from an apartment building, 22 Gia Long
Street in Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously editors do not read picture captions; this is par
for the course.''
</P>
<P>
   The building pictured by Van Es, a Dutchman who has been based
in Hong Kong since the war, was largely reserved for the employees
of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID).
But the top floor was set aside for the top brass of the CIA in
Saigon.
</P>
<P>
   The night before the evacuation, the station chief, Thomas
Polgar, had phoned a group of those South Vietnamese who had been
friends of the CIA and told them they should gather at the building
with their families so that they could be evacuated. These people
included generals, police officers and politicians who had been
helpful during the years of the war.
</P>
<P>
   But it was soon clear that the area was at risk from the
approaching North Vietnamese army and Polger would have to come up
with an idea to get his South Vietnamese friends out of the
building as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   His inspired plan was to land a helicopter on top of the
building's elevator shaft. He ordered in a Huey helicopter operated
by Air America, the CIA's airline for its operation in Southeast
Asia, to collect the Vietnamese officials and their families, and
he asked a CIA employee, O. B. Harnage, to direct the operation.
</P>
<P>
   Harnage stood by the ladder to the roof and directed the
families to the Huey. He says he is the man at the top of the
ladder in the photograph.
</P>
<P>
   Hubert Van Es was well aware of who the people in the photograph
were at the time it was taken. ``The people in the picture are
mostly South Vietnamese government workers, people working for
USAID, some CIA, but mostly officials and politicians from South
Vietnam,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have told many people over the years since the war about the
mistake but it has never changed the way the picture is presented.
I have no control over that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time I am not even credited by name as having
taken it. It just runs with the agency caption made at the time and
the UPI tag. Since the war it has been published in a number of
U.S. history books and always with the wrong caption.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time/Life are the only ones who have ever captioned the
picture correctly. When they use the picture they do not describe
it as the embassy evacuation and they always credit me by name.''
</P>
<P>
   And so this picture has become a metaphor for many of the
misunderstandings that afflicted Vietnam, of how America imposed
its own ideas depending on its view of the war. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The saga of Elian Gonzalez, the six-year-old at the
center of a row between the U.S. and Cuba, has divided the boy's
family and reopened Miami's painful ethnic and political divisions.
</P>
<P>
   But it has also divided the two cousins who rescued the boy,
leaving one as a temporary media star while the other retreats
bitterly back into the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Cianco and Donato Dalrymple were out fishing on Thanksgiving
Day when they saw the boy floating on an inner tube. The boat
taking him and his mother along with 11 other refugees from Cuba to
America had sunk, and the others were dead. Elian survived, to
become a cause celebre.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me and Donato didn't do nothing at all, except for be at the
right place at the right time,'' Ciancio said. But Dalrymple has
seized the issue and ridden it to media fame.
</P>
<P>
   He figured prominently in the now-famous photograph of an armed
policeman trying to seize Elian as he held the boy; he is
interviewed constantly, and has become a hero to the American
conservative right as ``the fisherman,'' although he is actually a
house cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   His cousin is bitter. ``I will never break bread with my cousin
again,'' said Ciancio. ``I will never talk to my cousin again. I
will never help him out again _ because he used a child to get fame
and glory and I just don't believe in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Dalrymple is talking about running for office in Miami (he lives
in Fort Lauderdale). ``As far as I'm concerned, I understand the
Cuban plight,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Both met Juan Miguel Gonzalez, the boy's father who has come to
America to claim him.
</P>
<P>
   Ciancio felt that the father was genuine and deserved to have
his child back; Dalrymple didn't. In a bizarre interview with the
Washington Post, he spoke of his role in the affair, clearly
overawed by the experience and out of touch with reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanksgiving Day was the first time The Cleaner had ever gone
fishing,'' the Post reported. ``He didn't even want to fish, he
admits, but agreed to drive the boat for his cousin, content just
to be out on the water, listening to oldies on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I've never felt important in my life,'' Dalrymple
told the paper, his eyes dampening at the memory. ``But I felt like
the most important man in the world that night. You know, life can
be hard. But what the kid went through, and the lives he changed
being with him, well, it's hard to explain. He makes people feel
important and loved and powerful.''
</P>
<P>
   But for his cousin, the affair is a personal tragedy. ``The boy
belongs with the father, which _ I don't care what Donato says now
_ is what Donato originally believed,'' Ciancio told the Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said it to me. He'll flip positions as many times as
necessary to get on television and stay in good with the relatives.
Dontcha see? This is his big chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never dreamed that this miracle would be this much of a
disaster and hurt in my life,'' said Ciancio. &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ There may be outrage in Washington, threats of
Congressional hearings and television talk-show jibes about police
states that sanction the snatching of children at gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
   But in the country at large, the forcible transfer of
six-year-old Elian Gonzalez from his Miami relatives to his father
has been widely applauded, and Attorney General Janet Reno is being
hailed as a hero.
</P>
<P>
   Since the start of the working week, the Justice Department has
been deluged with bouquets sent by admirers from all over the
United States. The switchboard has fielded thousands of calls _
running nine to one in Reno's favor.
</P>
<P>
   The scale of the approbation became apparent on Tuesday, when
Reno returned from a grilling by senators on Capitol Hill to find
that her office was awash in flowers. ``Oh my God, I can't believe
this,'' she said to her staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless you,'' said one of the cards attached to flowers,
``You did the right thing, both morally and psychologically for
this child.'' ``To thank you and congratulate you for your
courage,'' said another.
</P>
<P>
   Reno had to acknowledge a standing ovation from the platform of
a White House conference later that day after President Bill
Clinton deviated from his speech to renew his endorsement of
Saturday's pre-dawn operation.
</P>
<P>
   Both Reno and Doris Meissner, the head of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service who helped plan the raid, encounter applause
wherever they go _ not from the political establishment, but from
``regular folks.''
</P>
<P>
   The mismatch between the political establishment, where even
some Democrats voiced misgivings about the use of heavily armed
officers to grab the child from a private house, turns up in
opinion polls time and again.
</P>
<P>
   Voter.com, a Web site founded by Clinton's former adviser, Dick
Morris, and frequented by the political cognoscenti, said that 59
percent of the almost 200,000 people who had responded to its poll
had expressed disapproval of the forcible seizure of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Polls taken by conventional methods show the figures reversed.
Morris explained the discrepancy by saying that the voters in his
poll were ``mainly from very politically active people,'' which
only reinforced the point.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Washington, Elian's fate was seen throughout as a matter
of parental rights and family values, while the political
establishment tended to see it in terms of U.S.-Cuba relations and
the emigre Cuban vote.
</P>
<P>
   There are reports _ not denied _ that the White House
commissioned several polls in advance of Saturday's raid to monitor
the state of public opinion.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of public approval, however, came as a surprise,
particularly to Reno. She had been vilified both by Miami Cubans
for insisting that Elian belonged with his father and inside
Washington for hesitating to act.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is Elian's Miami relatives who find themselves vilified,
Miami's Cuban emigres who are isolated, and the political elite who
seem out of step. &QL;

PAX TURNS TO THE POWER OF SOLOMON FOR RATINGS MUSCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   On the second night of ``Solomon,'' the first miniseries
presented by Pax TV, a trusted friend says to King Solomon: ``The
ship of state needs someone at the steering oar. There are matters
which demand your attention other than the queen of Sheba's
thighs.''
</P>
<P>
   Whoa! Knock me over with a palm frond. What kind of language is
this from the family entertainment network?
</P>
<P>
   Call it the lingua franca of May sweeps. Even Pax TV, the
network most people don't know exists, craves more viewers during a
ratings-sweep period, which networks and affiliates use to help set
advertising rates. If a network can attract more eyeballs with
compelling (read: sexy) entertainment, it can charge higher ad
rates, and that ultimately means more shekels for the network.
</P>
<P>
   In the words of Bill Scott, president of programming,
``Solomon'' possesses ``all the ingredients of great entertainment:
passion, rivalry, pride, envy, failure and triumph.'' Not to
mention the queen of Sheba skinny-dipping with the king of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   OK, aside from a glimpse of Ben Cross' bare bottom and a
brief-but-steamy bedroom scene involving Cross and Vivica A. Fox,
Pax TV's ``Solomon,'' airing Sunday and Monday, is a fairly chaste
affair, considering that the man reportedly had 700 wives, 300
concubines and a hedonist's appetite for the finer things in life,
such as they were 3,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though scholars doubt that Solomon actually wrote the
biblical erotica variously known as Song of Solomon, Song of Songs
and Canticle of Canticles, the film has Solomon using some of its
language, ostensibly to convey the overt sensuality of his 40-year
reign over the tribes of Israel that were united by his revered
father, David.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Solomon was a good and popular king, the wise and
fair monarch of legend, and the film has no trouble imparting as
much. But his strategic marriage to a pharaoh's daughter, solely to
avoid war with Egypt, sets Solomon on the slippery slope to loose
living and the worship _ or at least the accommodation _ of deities
other than the one God of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   This slippage from monotheistic piety to flesh-indulging vanity
is explained in a long-winded exchange between Solomon and Jereboam
(Richard Dinnane), the same confidant who has the gall to suggest
his highness should be paying more attention to statesmanship and
less to swordsmanship. But director Roger Young, who also did the
miniseries ``Jesus,'' airing on CBS in two weeks, is hamstrung by a
script that never lets us see the depravity of Solomon's latter
reign. It is glimpsed, it is suggested, but never convincingly
displayed in all its debauched excess.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, such graphic extravagance would make it hard to
peddle ``Solomon'' to mainstream television. (Filmed in 1997,
``Solomon'' is from the same Italian-German combine that has been
producing biblical stories since 1993 for a pool of worldwide TV
networks, including TNT cable, which ran several a few years back.)
Absent an R-rated Hollywood version, Pax TV presents Solomon-lite:
not as sinfully rich as it might have been, not as filling, either,
but reasonably satisfying in that low-calorie,
this-isn't-going-to-kill-me sort of way.
</P>
<P>
   As King Solomon, Cross is suitably regal. He looks august and
virile _ a real catch, if you will _ and his
emotional-but-not-overwrought performance sustains the film across
the two-night arc that dooms most miniseries. Cross gets splendid
support from Annouk Aimee, who plays Bathsheba, Solomon's mother
and the power behind the throne in the early years of his reign.
Max von Sydow, as Solomon's aged father, King David, lends some of
that old blockbuster bluster the film could use even more of. And
as Makeda, the queen of Sheba, Fox has no trouble conveying the
woman's stunning physical beauty. But she doesn't quite achieve the
passion, the gravitas, the intellectual maturity that one suspects
made her Solomon's favorite.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, ``Solomon'' manages to tell one of the Bible's
more fascinating stories stylishly and intelligently. And
considering that the sins of Solomon resulted in the political
re-fracturing of Israel's tribes, demanding that it be randier for
the sake of accuracy probably isn't a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon. Four-hour miniseries about the legendary king of
Israel. Starring Ben Cross, Vivica A. Fox, Annouk Aimee, Max von
Sydow, David Suchet, Ivan Kaye and Richard Dillane. Sunday and
Monday on Pax TV. Parental guideline rating: TV-PG.

BEYOND A WACKY PREMISE, `FREQUENCY' SIGNALS DANDY TIME-TRAVEL
MOVIE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B+  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Frequency'' has an outlandish premise and a script that
depends on a few too many amazing coincidences. But if you can
swallow them, it's dandy little time-travel movie that has a lot of
the audience appeal of ``The Sixth Sense.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the story of a Queens firefighter (Dennis Quaid) who, as
sun spots are doing funny things to the atmosphere in the fall of
1969, turns on his ham radio and contacts his son (Jim Caviezel) _
talking on the same ham radio exactly 30 years in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, but the voice of his now-grown son warns him that
he is about to die in a blazing warehouse fire the very next day!
And if he avoids a certain tactical mistake, he can save his life
and spare his wife and son three decades of misery.
</P>
<P>
   He does it, but there's a catch: Monkeying with fate initiates a
chain reaction of changes down through the years that ultimately
makes their family's life even more miserable, and puts them on a
collision course with a brutal serial murderer.
</P>
<P>
   From here on, the movie crosscuts between the two eras as father
and son get to know each other, struggle to comprehend what's
happening and what they've done to their personal destinies, and
work together to stop this murderer who is a threat to them in both
1969 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it's a big gulp. But, except for one obvious flaw in its
ending, writer Toby Emmerich and director Gregory Hoblit (``Primal
Fear'') do an extraordinarily good job of staying within their
film's own peculiar logic and of gradually breaking down our
resistance to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequency'' is never particularly original; it incorporates
familiar plot elements of ``Time After Time,'' ``Somewhere in
Time'' and even ``It's a Wonderful Life.'' But it's also a
suspenseful and fascinating movie that milks the premise for all
it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   In a wonderfully oblique way, it also works as a heart-warming
relationship drama. Quaid and Caviezel are both excellent, building
a father-son chemistry that's touching and rather profound.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Sixth Sense'' (an obvious inspiration), ``Frequency''
avoids gimmicky visual effects, builds an irresistibly eerie mood,
constantly challenges us to stay with it intellectually, and relies
on a clever premise and character relationships to carry its load.
It's an equally refreshing movie, and could well become a
word-of-mouth hit.
</P>
<P>
   Frequency. Directed by Gregory Hoblit. Written by Toby Emmerich.
Cast: Dennis Quaid, Jim Caviezel, Andre Braugher, Elizabeth
Mitchell. New Line Cinema. 120 minutes. Rated PG-13 for violence.

`FLINTSTONES' SPOOF BETTER LEFT UNDER A ROCK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: D  
 By SEAN AXMAKER  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost an hour into the movie Ann-Margret sings the theme song,
a souped-up, ragged out version of ``Viva Las Vegas.'' It's a funky
tribute to her own appearance on the original cartoon (as
Ann-Margrock, natch), and though her voice is thin and scratchy,
she growls it out with pure sass and showgirl style.
</P>
<P>
   If only the rest of the picture had her attitude. Or any
attitude for that matter. ``The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas,'' a
prequel to the 1994 blockbuster (itself a live action remake of the
1960s animated sitcom), is constructed almost solely on pop culture
spoofs in stone and animal skins and ponderous sight gags more
impressive than funny.
</P>
<P>
   The original cast members are jettisoned for younger faces and
smaller marquee names. Mark Addy (``The Full Monty'') finds his
inner Fred Flintstone with a gentle rumble in his voice and a
confident swagger in his walk: a Stone Age proto-Jackie Gleason.
Stephen Baldwin mugs mercilessly when he's not perfecting his
blank, slack-jawed look of bewilderment as Fred's bubble-headed pal
Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The two working-class buddies meet flirty Betty (Jane Krakowski
from ``Ally McBeal'') and her pal Wilma (Kristen Johnston, ``3rd
Rock From the Sun''), a poor little rich girl running from a
manipulative mother (Joan Collins).
</P>
<P>
   It's your basic ``boys meet girls, boys lose girls, boys get
girls'' story with a touch of class conflict and a little help from
a sarcastic green cupid named The Great Gazoo (played with snotty
superiority by Alan Cummings' head on a computer-generated,
doll-size body).
</P>
<P>
   The script, full of leaden one-liners and dull puns, feels more
designed than written, better able to show off the details of a
cartoon come to life. The humor is aimed squarely at an adolescent
audience and director Brian Levant turns up the slapstick, double
takes, and epic fart jokes to a tortured extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Addy captures the bluster and the hearty sincerity of his
cartoon counterpart, and Krakowski is a perky, sexy Betty. But
Johnston and Baldwin overplay their parts. They should have taken a
lesson from the cast's master class: A doddering Harvey Korman (who
voiced Gazoo in the original series) hilariously barks nonsense
orders as Wilma's shell-shocked Dad, Cummings preens and poses as
peacock rock star Mick Jagged, and Collins delivers a perfect
spit-take like a comic pro.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's Levant who should have taken notes: It's all in the
delivery. These Flintstones may have left two-dimensional cartoons
for the 3-D world, but his direction is strictly flat.
</P>
<P>
   Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas. Directed by Brian Levant.
Written by Deborah Kaplan, Harry Elfont, Jim Cash, and Jack Epps
Jr. Cast: Mark Addy, Stephen Baldwin, Kristen Johnston, Jane
Krakowski, Thomas Gibson, Alan Cumming. Universal Pictures. 100
minutes. Rated PG for mild sexual humor.

   LOS ANGELES _ With the Justice Department looking at a breakup
of its operations, its share price taking a battering and senior
company executives running for the exit, Microsoft has launched a
last-ditch campaign to keep itself intact.
</P>
<P>
   It is showering its employees with financial incentives,
lobbying local politicians and issuing defiant statements insisting
it has done nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The company's president and chief executive, Steve Ballmer, sent
an e-mail to Microsoft's 34,000 employees announcing a doubling of
their stock options, offered at Monday's all-time low closing price
of $66.63 per share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's important for all of us to recognize that
ultimately, taking the long-term view is the path to future success
and prosperity _ for Microsoft and for each of you,'' Ballmer
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The internal memo, entitled ``Bullish About The Future,'' stated
bluntly that the company ``will not be broken up.'' Ballmer said
Microsoft had done ``great things for consumers and for the
American economy'' and had every reason to be left intact.
</P>
<P>
   His pitch won the support of two prominent politicians in
Washington state, Governor Gary Locke, a Democrat, and Senator
Slade Gorton, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't support what the Justice Department is doing. I
believe what Microsoft is doing is good for the economy, good for
people,'' Locke said.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Gorton suggested that a Republican in the White House
might slow down or halt the antitrust suit brought by the Justice
Department and 19 U.S. states.
</P>
<P>
   Whether such support can help Microsoft at this late hour _ a
breakup proposal is expected to be made by the end of the week _ is
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   A stream of senior executives has left the company in recent
months, including Dan Rosen, general manager of new technology, who
announced his departure on Monday. That was the day Microsoft's
stock plunged 16 percent to barely more than half the $120 value
held last December.
</P>
<P>
   Several reports suggest the Justice Department wants to split
Microsoft in two, separating its Windows operating system from
software applications like Word and Excel.
</P>
<P>
   Although both units would remain monopolies in the first
instance, the theory is that the split would provide the incentive
for the mini-companies to make their products compatible with other
systems and software and so open up the market. &QL;

 &HT;    Museums, lush green spaces and a breakfast of biscuits and

city that offers large dishes of Southern charm
 &HT;    By Paula Crouch Thrasher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   RALEIGH _ Sir Walter would be proud. The North Carolina capital
city that bears his surname is positioning itself as a major
Southeastern cultural mecca this spring.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the stunning $71 million North Carolina
Museum of Natural Sciences _ the largest natural history museum in
the Southeast _ opened downtown with a 24-hour bash that drew
45,000 mostly local visitors. Bicentennial Plaza links the new
building to the North Carolina Museum of History, where a new
exhibit, ``North Carolina Legends,'' delves into the colorful lives
of characters such as the pirate Blackbeard and
patriot-in-petticoats Mary Slocumb.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a major exhibition of more than 110 Rodin sculptures
moved into _ and outside _ the suburban North Carolina Museum of
the Arts, launching a four-month citywide Festival Rodin that's
sure to bring a French accent to the Triangle area that includes
Durham and Chapel Hill.
</P>
<P>
   And just six months ago, the $40.2 million Exploris _ an
interactive museum that celebrates cultural diversity _ brought the
world to Raleigh's doorstep. Families and school groups have been
beating a path to the 84,000-square-foot learning center ever since
to connect with people and places around the globe using advanced
technology.
</P>
<P>
   But just when you think Raleigh has gone uppity on us, take a
stroll across oak-shaded Moore Square to Big Ed's City Market
Restaurant, where the overalls-clad good ol' boy owner will quickly
bring you back down to the rich soil of the Piedmont.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere in town does down-home meet uptown with such agreeable
results. Big Ed's serves up country-cured ham, chicken and
dumplings and collards in the same block that encompasses not only
the City Market, which has been selling the land's bounty since
1914, but the trendy Moore Square Art District and restaurants
including the Greenshields Brewery and Pub.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent whirlwind 48 hours in the city of nearly
600,000, I was struck by its vitality and eager-to-impress attitude
as well as its abundant green space and immaculate appearance _
thanks in great part to the ubiquitous Clean and Safe Bicycle
Patrol, neatly attired in uniforms of yellow shirts and black
slacks.
</P>
<P>
   With all that's happening here, there's never been a better time
to lace up your sneakers and experience this wonderfully walkable
city _ whether for a weekend getaway or a couple of hooky-playing
weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday afternoon:
</P>
<P>
   Dig those dinos
</P>
<P>
   After jetting into Raleigh-Durham International Airport and
making a beeline along I-40 east into the city, I checked into the
Sheraton Capital Center, which is within walking distance of all
the downtown sites.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, I was whisked away to the Irish countryside for
lunch at Tir na Nog, a traditional pub named for the fabled
``County of Youth,'' where corned beef and cabbage, shepherd's pie
and Irish bread pudding share the menu with all-American fare. The
interior evokes the Old Sod with a stacked-stone wall, a
thatched-roof crofter's cottage and a wooden bar from Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Once we were stoked for the afternoon, it was a six-block walk
to the 200,000-square-foot North Carolina Museum of Natural
Sciences for an encounter with a snarly character called the
Acrocanthosaurus _ Acro for short. Not to fear. It's just this bad
boy's 110-year-old fossilized bones. The only giant North American
carnivore of its time is the star of the new museum's piece de
resistance: ``Terror of the South,'' a dino battle scene complete
with sounds and special effects. Acro is attacking a massive
plant-eating sauropod _ eek! see the nasty gash on the flank of the
fleshed-out model _ as swooping pterosaurs soar overhead in the
three-story glass dome. The attack was re-created with the help of
actual track patterns that are displayed on the floor under glass.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Terror'' is the most dramatic exhibit in the seven-story
building, the museum's four exhibit floors are filled with wondrous
sights _ from the tiny ruby-throated hummingbird in the Natural
Treasures of North Carolina exhibit to the 65-foot-long blue whale
skeleton that hangs over the coastal exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Six days after opening, the place was crawling with
schoolchildren who learned about the biodiversity of their state as
they explored realistic dioramas that take visitors through five
habitats: hardwood swamps, coastal plain, Piedmont, mountains and
Alpine forest. The museum's ``Prehistoric North Carolina'' gallery
is home to the world's first dinosaur specimen with a heart. The
recent and much-ballyhooed discovery by museum scientists of a
66-million-year-old Thescelasaurus with a fossilized heart has shed
light on the hypothesis that dinosaurs were warm-blooded.
</P>
<P>
   Don't miss the 17-minute high-definition film ``Wilderness,'' an
amazing eye-to-eye encounter with the plants and animals of the
region with ambient sound that is perfectly in sync with the
images. The footage includes intimate views of a sea turtle laying
her eggs in a sand nest and a butterfly emerging from its cocoon.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night:
</P>
<P>
   Beefing up at the barn
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on the Acro, but the meat-eater in me was in full
throttle as we pulled into the parking lot of the Angus Barn. There
was a filet mignon with my name on it in that big red barn on U.S.
70 west of downtown. The 40-year-old institution seats 650 and
fills up night after night. Don't let the rustic woods, blue and
white checked tablecloths, vintage quilts, straw-filled mangers on
the walls and barrels of red apples by the door fool you _ this is
an upscale steakhouse that boasts an 82-page wine list and holds
Wine Spectator magazine's Grand Award.
</P>
<P>
   Homemade crackers, pots of spreadable cheeses and a plate of
pickles, celery and olives arrive at the table to tide you over
until the meal arrives. Besides the de rigueur beef
($21.95-$34.95), there's barbecued little pig spare ribs, smoked
pork tenderloin and seafood.
</P>
<P>
   When the dessert tray arrived, it was hard to resist. We shared
chocolate chess pie and hot blackberry cobbler topped with ice
cream.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving, we toured the 55,000-bottle wine cellar and
popped into the Wild Turkey Lounge, where hundreds of turkey
whiskey decanters collected by late owner Thad Eure Jr. are
displayed.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning:
</P>
<P>
   Of mansions and men
</P>
<P>
   Docent Genelle Dail, a gracious Southern lady, was about to lead
us through the Executive Mansion, a grand Queen Anne Victorian
house built in 1891 and currently the home of Gov. Jim Hunt. But
first she just had to ask: ``Have you seen the new science museum?
Wow!''
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's talking about the new kid in town, but even on a
rainy morning, a dozen or so were visiting the historic
34,806-square-foot mansion on five acres downtown. Entering the
home, we first noted the grand staircase of native heart pine and
16-foot ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Dail told us that the crimson and gold carpet in the Grand
Hallway was custom-made in Georgia. Names of North Carolina
governors are woven into the borders. Although upstairs is off
limits, we saw the elegant dining room with huge crystal
chandelier, the pink-toned ladies parlor and green gentlemen's
parlor across the hall, and the ballroom with ornate French
mirrors, gilded walls and a pair of Sheffield chandeliers.
</P>
<P>
   While on tour I met Connie Winstead and her children Anna, 13,
and Daniel, 11, of nearby Greensboro, who were spending the week
exploring their capital. They had already hit the big museums.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to hear about Blackbeard,'' said Daniel
enthusiastically of his visit to the North Carolina Museum of
History.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anna and I love history,'' said Connie, ``so this has been
really neat to see. We've really enjoyed it.'' Added Anna: ``I like
all the old, fancy buildings.''
</P>
<P>
   She had certainly come to the right place _ this one's as fancy
as they come.
</P>
<P>
   Later Thursday morning:
</P>
<P>
   Rendezvous with Rodin
</P>
<P>
   Approaching the North Carolina Museum of Art on the curving
driveway that leads to the parking lot, we caught the first glimpse
of ``The Thinker'' on the front lawn. It was an exciting moment,
fueling my anticipation for the show inside: ``Rodin: Sculpture
From the Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Collection and Additional
Works.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in front of a 2,500-pound bronze cast of ``The Monument
to Victor Hugo'' _ one of only two in the world _ museum director
Lawrence J. Wheeler couldn't help but indulge in a bit of
boosterism during a preview showing. ``The most extraordinary
exhibition this museum has ever presented,'' he called it.
</P>
<P>
   He has a right to boast. More than 250,000 are expected to view
the most comprehensive selection of the French sculptor's work ever
seen in the Southeast _ and largest in the United States in two
decades _ during its four-month run.
</P>
<P>
   From my perspective _ as one who appreciates fine art but is no
art scholar _ the exhibition's power lies in the context its
organizers have provided.
</P>
<P>
   Selected Rodin works are juxtaposed with other sculptures from
the museum's permanent collection to illustrate how much the French
master was in tune with classicism.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the main Rodin exhibition gallery, several pieces are
shown alongside classical counterparts. For example, Rodin's
headless, handless ``Walking Man'' stands beside an eerily similar
Egyptian striding figure that was created 4,300 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first piece inside the exhibition is ``The Age of Bronze,''
which is so naturalistic that Rodin was accused of making the mold
from a human body.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the curators have provided context with an enlarged
photograph of Rodin's ``Gates of Hell,'' inspired by Dante's
``Divine Comedy.'' The gates incorporate the well-known images of
``The Thinker,'' ``The Three Shades,'' frustrated lovers ``Paolo
and Francesca'' and ``The Creator,'' a self-portrait _ all
displayed in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   And just in case you can't bear to leave the Rodins behind, you
can take home a 12-inch ``Thinker'' bronze replica for $95. (A
``Get Bronzed'' beach towel will run you $32.)
</P>
<P>
   Playing the French theme to the hilt, Blue Ridge, The Museum
Restaurant, is featuring a special French menu with entrees ranging
from Poulet en Croute (chicken salad in a puff pastry) to Hoppin'
Jacques (a vegetarian black-eyed pea and rice burger).
</P>
<P>
   Too soon, it was time to go. C'est la vie.

   Thursday afternoon:
</P>
<P>
   To market and beyond
</P>
<P>
   The 75-acre North Carolina State Farmer's Market is a rich
palette of red strawberries, yellow apples, orange Beauregard sweet
potatoes and green spears of fresh asparagus. We dropped in on our
way back to town and sampled slices of Pink Lady and Fuji apples.
</P>
<P>
   We were sorry that we had so little time to wander through the
North Carolina Museum of History _ I could have spent hours
exploring the folk life, the Civil War and ``Health and Healing''
exhibits. The new exhibit ``North Carolina Legends'' will appeal to
children who can turn oversize storybook pages to learn about the
first English child born in the New World (Virginia Dare), a
Cherokee fugitive who refused to walk the Trail of Tears (Tsali),
and a frontiersman you probably thought was a Kentucky native
(Daniel Boone).
</P>
<P>
   Tearing ourselves from the fabulous gift shop that features art
and crafts by North Carolina artists, we crossed the street to
visit the 1840 Greek Revival state Capitol, where a copy of Antonio
Canova's seated sculpture of George Washington wears a Roman
general's tunic, tightly fitted body armor and sandals. The General
Assembly has convened at the nearby State Legislature Building
since 1963, but the governor, his lieutenant governor and their
staffs still occupy the fortress-like Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The afternoon ended with a spin through the historic Oakwood
neighborhood, which reminded me of Atlanta's Grant Park and Inman
Park. Dozens of homes have been _ and are being _ renovated in this
National Historic District.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night:
</P>
<P>
   Anchors aweigh
</P>
<P>
   The 42nd Street Oyster Bar &AMP; Seafood Grill is another cavernous
eatery with something like 400 seats. It started humbly enough in
1931 as a grocery store that served oysters and beer on the side.
It's known as the place politicians chow down. The warehouse-like
setting features high ceilings, steel rafters and dark wood
furnishings and paneling. And the seafood couldn't be fresher. My
shrimp and scallop combo _ ``Norfolk style,'' sauteed in white
wine, butter and lemon juice _ was simple and simply delightful. Go
for a 42nd Street Cheese Potato as a side. And don't spoil your
appetite by popping too many of those hot hush puppies.
</P>
<P>
   The 42nd Street is located in the Powerhouse Square
entertainment district, home of an old power plant whose
out-of-service transformers are bathed in a purple glow. The area
has evolved into a yuppie dining mecca with popular spots such as
Ri-Ra Irish Pub, 518 West (Italian) and the Southend Brewery.
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning:
</P>
<P>
   Breakfast at Big Ed's
</P>
<P>
   Big Ed's City Market Restaurant is the heart, if not the soul,
of the downtown entertainment district. The area is known not only
for its farmer's market (much smaller than the state market) but
for an eclectic mix of restaurants, a brew pub, gift and specialty
shops, galleries and Artspace, which holds artist studios and three
exhibition galleries in a former car dealership.
</P>
<P>
   Big Ed's is something of a museum itself, with farm implements,
gourds, baskets, tin signs and other bits of rural Americana
decking the walls and hanging from the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   But the real attraction is Big Ed himself _ Ed Watkins _ who
informed a diner, ``See all those plows out front? I've used every
one of them with a mule pulling them.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Ed concocts his own vinegar and pepper sauce and ``bottles''
it in rinsed-out plastic dishwashing detergent bottles. And if you
don't care for the blackstrap molasses he serves, he'll mix some up
with grape jelly and butter and insist that you dip a biscuit in
the concoction.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about something that's gonna be good,'' he said as he
stirred his sticky creation. Before a breakfast of eggs and country
ham, biscuits and red-eye gravy was done, he was ordering up
samples of chicken and dumplings and collards being prepared for
lunch. When I mentioned I've never liked collards, he made me
squirt some of his pepper-vinegar on the greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``When somebody from out of town comes in here,'' he says, ``I
bust their belly open.''
</P>
<P>
   Still don't like collards, but the country ham's a winner _ and
I told him so. ``I have it cured to my great-granddaddy's recipe.
And I use his sausage recipe, too. He was a mess sergeant in the
Rebel Army. Name was Ransom Gully.''
</P>
<P>
   No big surprise that Big Ed has had his arteries unclogged
several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``My cardiologist says, `You stop 'em up, I clean 'em out,''' he
said, before hollering for the waitress to bring over more
biscuits.
</P>
<P>
   Later Friday morning:
</P>
<P>
   We are the world
</P>
<P>
   After feasting at Big Ed's trough, we lumbered across Moore
Square to Exploris and in minutes we were transported from the farm
to the far-flung corners of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The hands-on science center with a cultural focus opened in
October, with the mission to help young people respect differences,
appreciate similarities and make connections.
</P>
<P>
   Kids (and adults, too) can poke through Culture Boxes, giant
drawers filled with objects from the daily lives of people around
the world _ a pair of rubber thongs, school supplies, a piece of
clothing, a toy. The idea is to guess where the person lives whose
belongings are in the drawer. They can weave a pattern on a loom,
write poetry and create a Web site. In the environmental area, they
can see how Exploris' Living Machine cleans water using plants and
fish. And they can stop by vending machines that feature
international snacks and beverages.
</P>
<P>
   In Many Voices, kids learn how to make their voice heard and
make a difference in the world. Interactive stations provide them
with the resources to get involved with issues in the news and vote
on matters of global importance. Live news broadcasts from 42
countries can be viewed. Here, too, visitors can look at a 4-ton
section of the Berlin Wall and ponder whether they've ever ``broken
through a wall'' of any kind. In June, a special exhibition, ``From
the Pen of Anne Frank,'' will open in the One Voice Gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Early Friday afternoon:
</P>
<P>
   The finish line
</P>
<P>
   Time to leave Raleigh was nearing, but we had two more
restaurants we wanted to check out. Still bustin' at the seams from
Big Ed's, three of us decided to sample a pork and chicken platter
at Clyde Cooper's Barbecue, which has been serving up the vinegary
North Carolina-style 'cue since 1938. We bellied up to the Formica
counter, had two bites each and were on our way.
</P>
<P>
   At Caffe Luna, a little corner of Tuscany with sun-splash yellow
and terra-cotta walls, we tried an Insalata del Pastore (warm goat
cheese with walnuts over mesclun greens) and a serving of tiramisu.
</P>
<P>
   By then, we were waving our white napkins in surrender to
cultural overload and excessive cuisine. Raleigh, we decided,
really is a city of plenty.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   GETTING THERE
</P>
<P>
   The 14-day advance purchase fare is $112 round trip on AirTran,
Delta and Midway.
</P>
<P>
   ACCOMMODATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Sheraton Capital Center is a good choice if you want to stay
downtown (421 S. Salisbury St., 919-834-9900); Crabtree Summit
Hotel, a small boutique hotel near Crabtree Village shopping area,
is a suburban jewel (3908 Arrow Drive, 1-800-521-7521). Most
national chains are represented in the area.

 &HT;    `September' has a fleeting charm
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like the genteel Anglo-Irish country folk it chronicles, ``The
Last September'' is something of a charming mess. Oh, it's
well-crafted and elegantly acted, but a mess nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Set in rural Ireland in 1920, four years after the Easter
Uprising, the movie comes off as a kind of minor-league
``Heartbreak House'' in which the fates of assorted characters
gathered in and around a once-grand manor mirror the political
tensions between the Irish rebels and their English rulers.
</P>
<P>
   The Anglo-Irish aristocracy, who make up the country's
increasingly irrelevant ruling class, sound British but feel Irish.
Or at least Irish enough to be embraced by the little people who
run their houses and tend their grounds. But the reality is that
they are caught in the middle as the clashes between the Irish
Republican Army and the Black and Tans grow bloodier and more
frequent.
</P>
<P>
   Sir Richard (Michael Gambon doing Rex Harrison as Captain
Shotover) and Lady Myra (Maggie Smith doing Maggie Smith in
anything) seem to know they're an endangered species, but they
can't quite decide what, if anything, to do about it. So they keep
giving tennis parties and having tea and welcoming guests like the
knowing Marda (Fiona Shaw), a woman with a history, and a
wandering, well-bred couple (Lambert Wilson and Jane Birkin) whose
general unhappiness is compounded by the fact that the husband was
once part of Marda's history.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's true center, however, is Sir Richard's lively and
flirtatious niece, Lois (Keeley Hawes), who manages to become
involved with both an upright British soldier (David Tenant) and a
sexy Irish rebel (Gary Lydon). Symbolic perhaps? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   The autumnal title is meant to suggest a Chekhovian tone, but
the film is simultaneously too meandering and too obvious to pull
it off. Well-known theatrical director Deborah Warner, here making
her feature film debut, seems uncertain of how to pull all the
elements together. The movie looks wonderful, and she wisely stays
out of her blue-ribbon cast's way. But the film moves in fits and
starts, so that we're often amused by the characters but never
emotionally connected to them. And that would seem to be crucial to
a picture about an entire world disappearing with neither a bang
nor a whimper, but a kind of well-mannered resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last September'' certainly isn't a chore to sit through.
Some of the dialogue is archly memorable (Lady Myra on a guest:
``He's very intellectual, but he does play tennis''). Plus, there's
an inherent interest in the material itself. But afterward you feel
as if you've been to a pleasant but entirely forgettable lawn
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last September''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C-
</P>
<P>
   Starring Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon and Keeley Hawes. Directed
by Deborah Warner. Rated R for brief sexuality and violence.
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 44 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Try not to remember this kind of ``September.''

   Rodin festivities accent celebration of arts
</P>
<P>
   Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 30.
</P>
<P>
   By Paula Crouch Thrasher
</P>
<P>
   The slogan for Festival Rodin is ``Come for the exhibition _
stay for the celebration.'' And with just about every cultural
institution in the Triangle area involved, it has shaped up to be
quite a party.
</P>
<P>
   The 17-week Festival Rodin _ including opera, symphony, theater,
film, dance, lectures and even a French circus _ began April 15
with the opening of ``Rodin: Sculpture From the Iris and B. Gerald
Cantor Collection and Other Works'' at the North Carolina Museum of
Art. The festivities continue until the exhibition closes Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Highlights include:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Second Annual Louisiana Dance Party: Singer-songwriter Marcia
Ball leads the festivities, which also feature the Zydeco rhythms
of Geno Delafose and French Rockin' Boogie. 7:30 p.m. May 19.
Joseph M. Bryan Jr. Theater in Museum Park. $15. At Ticketmaster or
by calling 919-834-4000.
</P>

 &HT;    The great `Run' of Joe Cassidy, cold warrior
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, April 30.
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One day in February of 1959 an Army sergeant named Joe Cassidy
crushed an orange crayon beneath his heel on the sidewalk in front
of a photography store in Washington. The next day he walked along
a residential street in suburban Maryland, a pipe in his mouth, a
book in his hand. A passer-by was to ask him if there was a theater
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Once he did, contact would be made.
</P>
<P>
   Before any dead drops are made, the dance of espionage proceeds
by what looks like chance encounter and signals as inconspicuous as
a smashed crayon. As it happened, Cassidy had to crush rather a lot
of crayons and stroll along that street in Maryland with his pipe
and his book for many days running, with no one asking directions
to the movie. A mole gets used to being stood up. Traffic might be
heavy. The telephone can't be trusted. Precaution, sometimes,
forces cancellation of plans without notice.
</P>
<P>
   Delicately, other means are pursued, but in Cassidy's case it
was as direct as a note dropped off at the Soviet embassy in
Washington. ``There were some kids, maybe 10 or 12 years old,'' he
told David Wise, ``playing on the street.'' Don Gruentzel, an FBI
agent, called one of them to the car, gave him the note and asked
him to take it to the embassy door. ``Don gave him 50 cents,''
Cassidy told Wise. ``I said, `Maybe you should have given him the
50 cents when he came back.'''
</P>
<P>
   The note said, ``I'm back from Korea. I'm the person you were
involved with at (Fort) Belvoir.'' And there was a telephone
number. A few days later, Cassidy's phone rang at Edgewood Arsenal.
Contact was re-established.
</P>
<P>
   Cassidy, a man who was never trained as a spy, who in 1959
earned a high school equivalency degree 24 years after dropping out
of the ninth grade, was back in business, a double agent spying on
the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The strain of living a double life
</P>
<P>
   ``Cassidy's Run: The Secret Spy War Over Nerve Gas'' is less a
story about biological warfare than the improbable tale of a man
who had the Soviet Union's confidence for more than 20 years.
During that time, the FBI _ through Cassidy _ piece by piece gave
the Soviets nerve gas information, some of it real, some of it
fake. The aim was to learn who the Soviet Union's spies in the
United States were and to throw its intelligence operations off
track. Cassidy was the dangled bait, working in a U.S. defense
plant, steadily promoted to more responsible jobs, living a double
life. When he left it, 10 Soviet spies had been flushed out and two
FBI agents had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   Espionage has been called the world's second oldest profession,
and the end of cold war did not put spies all out of work. But Cold
War espionage had a dramatic quality hard to duplicate. In the
seamless, morally ambiguous worlds of John le Carre and Len
Deighton, mole and handler understood that betrayal was relative
and trust contingent.
</P>
<P>
   It did not always work that way in real life. Ordinary people
like Joe Cassidy went through divorces, worried about appearing
nervous and never, for one moment, doubted the rightness of what
they were doing. Wives, like Julie Kirkland and Letitia Basford,
grieved for 20 years after the small plane in which their husbands
were monitoring the movements of a University of Minnesota
professor spying for the Soviet Union crashed into a lake, killing
Mark Kirkland and another FBI agent, Tren Basford.
</P>
<P>
   Recounting this tangled tale, Wise goes forward and backward and
then forward again, the seams of his narrative as jarring as speed
bumps. But between one bump and the next, it's taut with
straightforward reportage about code encryption, ``hollow rocks''
hiding classified material and Cassidy's relationship with a
succession of Mikes _ Soviets who trusted him so completely that
one of them, on leaving for reassignment back to the Soviet Union,
kissed him on the cheek with tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Recognition after 15 years
</P>
<P>
   If Cassidy's double life had its harrowing side, it had its
bizarre moments as well. Outside the government, no one besides
Cassidy's second wife knew. But those few in the government who
knew decided, after 15 years, that Cassidy's service merited
recognition. The problem was that recognition would have to be
secret, like everything else in Cassidy's life. Nonetheless,
arrangements were made for Cassidy to be quietly presented a medal
in the White House by President Nixon. But Nixon resigned and
Cassidy had to settle for Gen. Creighton Abrams, chief of staff of
the U.S. Army. ``I didn't care it wasn't the president,'' Cassidy,
79, and living in Florida, told Wise. ``I was surprised I was going
to get anything.''
</P>
<P>
   But he would, briefly. Abrams pinned the medal on Cassidy and
congratulated him. With five FBI agents who had been his handlers
for 15 years, Cassidy and his wife stood for a photograph.
``Everyone was smiling,'' Wise writes.
</P>
<P>
   And then Abrams took the medal back. The spy was returned to the
cold, where he remained, unsuspected, another six years.

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``28 Days'' PG-13 (profanity, substance
</P>
<P>
   abuse and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock
</P>
<P>
   and Viggo Mortensen.
</P>
<P>
   The cinema's chipper girl next door (Sandra Bullock) goes clean
and sober in an addiction and rehab movie that, thankfully, isn't
an appalling clinical ``comedy'' like ``Patch Adams.'' It's a
professional, appealing comedy-drama, but in trying to be all
things to all viewers (to beer-loving Bullock fans as well as
devoted 12-steppers), it never really comes into focus. (SM)1 hour,
43 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``All About My Mother'' R (profanity, sexuality, drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Cecilia Roth,
</P>
<P>
   Marisa Paredes,
</P>
<P>
   and Penelope Cruz.
</P>
<P>
   Oscar: foreign film. Spain's bad-boy filmmaker Pedro Almodovar
grows up with this humane celebration of nurturing women. A tribute
to actresses (of all kinds), ``All About My Mother'' is a virtually
male-free fable with a title inspired by that backstage classic,
``All About Eve.'' Dark and tender in equal measures, the movie
beautifully balances humor and heartache. In Spanish with
subtitles. (SM)1 hour, 41 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty'' R (strong sexuality, profanity,
</P>
<P>
   violence and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey
</P>
<P>
   and Annette Bening.
</P>
<P>
   5 Oscars: picture, actor (Kevin Spacey), director, original
screenplay, cinematography. The ever-more-remarkable Spacey plays a
man caught in a midlife limbo in this scarily disturbing, daringly
hilarious, well-written and well-acted comedy-drama. It's a
hauntingly optimistic elegy for America the Beautifully Screwed Up.
(ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. A
</P>
<P>
   ``American Psycho'' R (profanity, violence, sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Christian Bale
</P>
<P>
   and Chloe Sevigny.
</P>
<P>
   Director Mary Harron (``I Shot Andy Warhol'') has taken Bret
Easton Ellis' controversial book about a Wall Street serial killer
and created a visually chilly but often very funny satire of
American greed. It's a critique of '80s me-first narcissism,
embodied by an antihero (a well-chiseled Christian Bale) whose
refined taste in clothing and health-care products is matched by
his extensive repertoire as a killer. (SM) 1 hour, 40 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Black and White'' R (violence, sexuality and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Bijou Phillips,
</P>
<P>
   Robert Downey Jr., Brooke Shields
</P>
<P>
   and Ben Stiller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Black and White'' is the latest from writer-director James
Toback, a hit-or-miss auteur. Hit: the screenplay for ``Bugsy.''
Miss: his last movie, ``Two Guys and a Girl.'' He gives you energy,
attitude and a big sloppy mess of a movie in ``Black.'' It's not a
very good or intelligent movie, but it's a topical powder keg
likely to launch arguments and discussions more complex and
sophisticated than the film. (SM) 1 hour 40 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cider House Rules'' PG-13 (nudity,
</P>
<P>
   substance abuse, violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Michael Caine
</P>
<P>
   and Tobey Maguire.
</P>
<P>
   2 Oscars: adapted screenplay, supporting actor (Michael Caine).
John Irving adapted his own novel. In the first half, Dr. Larch
(Caine) delivers babies and performs illegal abortions in his Maine
orphanage. In the second, less-engaging half, Larch's protege,
Homer Wells (Tobey Maguire), runs off to learn about the world.
(ERG)2 hours, 5 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``East Is East'' R (profanity
</P>
<P>
   and domestic violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Om Puri
</P>
<P>
   and Linda Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   Set in working-class Britain in 1971, this uneven but energetic
film focuses on a boisterous Anglo-Pakistani family. The father is
a tyrannical type, while the mother is a grounded fish-and-chips
Englishwoman. And the kids are totally caught up in the exploding
England Swings pop-culture surrounding them. The very good cast,
headed by Om Puri and Linda Bassett, is a huge asset. (ERG)1 hour,
36 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin Brockovich'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Albert Finney.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts delivers in a funny, down-to-earth film about an
everyday mom with business spunk who, without a law degree but with
a lot of pluck, helps crash a big-time company responsible for
devastating health problems in a small, dirt-poor town. Call it
``Working-Class Girl.'' (Bob Longino)2 hours, 11 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequency'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dennis Quaid
</P>
<P>
   and Jim Caviezel.
</P>
<P>
   John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) hears dead people. Specifically, he
hooks up to his dad's old ham radio set in 1999 and finds himself
talking to his dad (Dennis Quaid) in 1969. More crucially, John
knows his dad, a fireman, will be killed in a failed heroic rescue
the next day. Although over-plotted, the sentimental film has that
``what if?'' fascination. It's also a mind-bender and especially
savvy about emotional button-pushing. (ERG)2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gendernauts'' Unrated (contains frank sexual
</P>
<P>
   talk, nudity and sexual footage)
</P>
<P>
   A documentary
</P>
<P>
   by Monika Treut.
</P>
<P>
   A sweet but shallow look at the Bay Area's transgendered
community, preaching entirely to the converted. (SM) Noon, 2, 4, 6,
8 and 10 p.m.; $3, $5 after 6 p.m. Cinefest (Georgia State
University). 404-651-2463. 1 hour, 27 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gossip'' R (sexual content,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Lena Headey
</P>
<P>
   and James Marsden.
</P>
<P>
   Don't waste your breath or your time. The latest cynical bid for
</P>
<P>
   teenagers' pocket change, this film features the requisite hot
WB star (Joshua Jackson) backed by hunky/pretty co-stars as college
students whose class project on slander snowballs into a rape
charge. It wants to be a mix of ``Dangerous Liaisons,'' ``Shallow
Grave'' and ``Disclosure,'' but it's tin-eared and shallow. (SM)1
hour, 30 minutes. D-
</P>
<P>
   ``Here on Earth'' PG-13 (sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and thematic elements)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Chris Klein,
</P>
<P>
   Leelee Sobieski and Josh Hartnett.
</P>
<P>
   A limp and clueless variation on ``Love Story.'' Leelee
Sobieski, Chris Klein and Josh Hartnett star as kids in a love
triangle. Trapped in this hermetically sealed setting, with a
script that would run 10 minutes if the cliches were yanked out of
it, they can't win. (SM)1 hour, 37 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack,
</P>
<P>
   Iben Hjejle and Jack Black.
</P>
<P>
   Freshly dumped by his longtime girlfriend, record-store owner
Rob (John Cusack) rhetorically asks himself, ``What came first _
music or the misery?'' In other words, does he listen to songs
about heartbreak because he's miserable, or is he miserable because
he's listening to these songs? ``High Fidelity'' is as smart as it
is enjoyable. It's a great date movie about dating. (SM)1 hour, 54
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Gould's Secret'' R ( language and brief nudity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ian Holm
</P>
<P>
   and Stanley Tucci.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Gould was a colorful eccentric, who roamed the streets in
the '40s, dividing his time between flophouses and an in-circuit of
celebrity parties, all the while going on about his great work.
Gould became ``famous'' when he was profiled by genteel New Yorker
essayist Joe Mitchell. The overall impression is a kind of New
Yorker sketch of a movie. Spare, mystifying, yet with a lingering
impact. (ERG) 1 hour, 48 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping the Faith'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Stiller,
</P>
<P>
   Edward Norton and Jenna Elfman.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, it's a sweet-natured hymn to love and longtime
friendship. Edward Norton (as a priest) and Ben Stiller (as a
rabbi) are pals whose childhood friend (Jenna Elfman) returns to
catch both their eyes in more than a friendly way. The first 90
minutes have charm, a sophisticated sexiness and some nice, offbeat
bits. Then things start to crash. (SM) 2 hours, 9 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Last September'' R (brief sexuality and violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Maggie Smith,
</P>
<P>
   Michael Gambon and Keeley Hawes.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the 1920s, this movie is a charming, well-dressed mess.
As the clashes between the Irish rebels and the British soldiers
grow worse, Sir Richard and Lady Myra (Michael Gambon and Maggie
Smith) and their assorted house guests keep holding their tennis
parties. Meanwhile their niece (Keeley Hawes) becomes romantically
involved with both sides of the conflict. (ERG)1 hour, 44 minutes.
C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Love and Basketball'' PG-13 (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps
</P>
<P>
   and Sanaa Lathan.
</P>
<P>
   All's not fair in love or basketball is one of several themes in
this flawed but appealing romance. Q (Omar Epps) and Monica (Sanaa
Lathan) meet as kids and rival basketball players. They realize
throughout the film that they love each other as much as the game.
Director Gina Price-Bythewood (her producer is Spike Lee) may not
have scored a slam dunk, but she comes close thanks to her engaging
stars. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Me Myself I'' R (sexuality and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Rachel Griffiths
</P>
<P>
   and David Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   An engaging ``what-if?'' fantasy about the life not lived.
Rachel Griffiths (an Oscar nominee for ``Hilary and Jackie'') makes
an art of benumbed comic reaction as she finds herself trapped in a
nightmare of domesticity, trapped in one of two parallel lives.
``Me'' could be called a chick flick. But it gives its heroine
intelligence, self analysis and a healthy sex drive that leads to
some of the movie's funnier scenes. (SM)1 hour, 44 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mifune'' R (profanity, violence, and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Iben Hjejle
</P>
<P>
   and Anders W. Berthelsen.
</P>
<P>
   In Danish with subtitles.
</P>
<P>
   An engaging Danish comedy/drama about an unusual household.
Think of mixing ``Pretty Woman'' and ``Snow White and the Seven
Dwarfs,'' and you've get an idea of the quirky tone. Shot only with
available light and natural sound _ with no special effects or
extreme action _ it's a solid reminder that good movies don't need
gimmicks, just an interesting story and appealing actors. (SM) 1
hour, 39 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission to Mars'' PG ( sci-fi violence and mild language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Gary Sinise,
</P>
<P>
   Tim Robbins and Don Cheadle.
</P>
<P>
   Brian De Palma's Red Planet opus is too much like other films
(``Contact,'' ``The Abyss'' and, especially, ``2001: A Space
Odyssey''), but it's still a decent popcorn movie packed with
thrills and sharp special effects. Gary Sinise, Tim Robbins, Connie
Nielsen and Jerry O'Connell are part of an astronaut team trying to
rescue others lost on Mars. (SM) 1 hour, 53 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``My Dog Skip'' PG (violent content and mild profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Frankie Muniz,
</P>
<P>
   Diane Lane and Kevin Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the late Willie Morris' memoir about growing up in
small-town 1940s Mississippi, this family film is aremembrance of
how things can pass from our lives but never really leave us.
Nine-year-old Willie (``Malcolm in the Middle's'' Frankie Muniz) is
a shy only child whose life changes when his mom (Diane Lane) gives
him a Jack Russell terrier puppy, despite dad's (Kevin Bacon)
objection. (ERG)1 hour, 35 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitch Black'' R (profanity and sci-fi violence and gore)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Vin Diesel
</P>
<P>
   and Radha Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Hungry aliens, stupid humans: the usual. ``Pitch Black'' is just
the latest sci-fi rip-off of ``Aliens,'' packed with caricatures.
In the movie's last hour, writer-director David Twohy pretends to
explore his stick figures' moral choices, and he forgets to deliver
the thrills. (SM)1 hour, 47 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Return to Me'' PG (mild violence and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Duchovny
</P>
<P>
   and Minnie Driver.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be Hollywood's first organ-transplant romance,
bereaved widower David Duchovny falls for shy heart-transplant
recipient Minnie Driver, unaware that his beloved first wife's
ticker is beating inside her chest. Duchovny is actually rather
wonderful here, with a sweet pensive romanticism. But Driver
herself just doesn't seem worthy of Duchovny. (ERG)1 hour, 56
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road to El Dorado'' PG (mild thematic material
</P>
<P>
   and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Animated film featuring the voices
</P>
<P>
   of Kevin Kline and Kenneth Branagh.
</P>
<P>
   Not cute enough for kids, not clever enough for adults,
DreamWorks' latest animated feature is gorgeous but curiously dull.
Kenneth Branagh and Kevin Kline are the voices of a couple of
16th-century scam artists looking for the Lost City of Gold in the
New World. The movie fuses visual splendor with unsteady
storytelling and tone. The waterfalls are beautiful, but the movie
is a washout. (SM)1 hour, 23 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules of Engagement'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tommy Lee Jones
</P>
<P>
   and Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules of Engagement'' is another military flick that climaxes
in a courtroom, where soldiers shout out conflicting reports of
what really happened in the heat of battle. ``Rules'' is laughable,
but it's watchable thanks to the leads. Tommy Lee Jones is the
flick's anchor. And Samuel L. Jackson delivers an on-the-stand
blow-up like Jack Nicholson's ``You-can't-handle-the-truth''
bluster from ``A Few Good Men.'' (SM)2 hours, 7 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Scream 3'' R (profanity and strong horror violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette and Neve
Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a scream anymore, but it's a decent wrap-up of the
series. Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette and David Arquette
are all back and on the Hollywood set of ``Stab 3,'' ducking the
knife-swings of a killer clad in the familiar Halloween get-up. The
new movie isn't as clever with its clues as the others, but it
manages to wheeze its way across the finish line, wrapping up the
trilogy in satisfying fashion. (SM) 1 hour, 56 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Skulls'' PG-13 (violence and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joshua Jackson
</P>
<P>
   and Paul Walker.

<P>
   In this conspiracy thriller for the Clearasil set, the WB's
Joshua Jackson plays an average Joe sucked into an elite, monied
club. It comes with a price, though. Like he can't ever get out.
(SM)1 hour, 47 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tigger Movie'' G
</P>
<P>
   Animated feature with
</P>
<P>
   Tigger, Pooh, Baby Roo, Piglet, etc.
</P>
<P>
   This charming animated feature clearly knows its intended tot
audience and takes care of them. The irrepressible, ever-bouncing
Tigger goes searching for his family and discovers his real family
isn't necessarily other Tiggers. Pooh, Piglet, Baby Roo and the
whole A.A. Milne gang are back, as are the Sherman brothers (``Mary
Poppins''), who wrote the sprightly songs. As Tigger himself would
say, it's tiggerific. (ERG)1 hour, 16 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``U-571'' PG-13 (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew McConaughey,
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton
</P>
<P>
   and Jon Bon Jovi.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey leads a reconnaissance mission to take over
a damaged German sub and capture the secret Nazi coding device
that's confounding U.S. efforts to win the war. Despite a
predictable script, blatant cliches and a penchant for
chest-beating fanfare music, ``U-571'' has plenty of furious
action, occasional suspense and lots of super-loud booms. It's no
``Das Boot,'' but it can suck you in. (Bob Longino) 1 hour, 56
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the Heart Is'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Natalie Portman
</P>
<P>
   and Ashley Judd.
</P>
<P>
   A cornpone comedy-drama about a single mom, made with enough
polish to be a guilty pleasure. Natalie Portman plays the pregnant
teen who heads for California and winds up becoming the Wal-Mart
Mom in Oklahoma. She gets good support from Stockard Channing,
Ashley Judd and Sally Field. (SM) 2 hours. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the Money Is'' PG-13 (sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Paul Newman,
</P>
<P>
   Linda Fiorentino
</P>
<P>
   and Dermot Mulroney.
</P>
<P>
   This clever caper comedy is a wry, laid-back throwaway that's
surprisingly engaging. It probably helps that the leads are Paul
Newman and Linda Fiorentino, who have a delicious chemistry. He's a
convicted bank robber rendered catatonic by a stroke and
temporarily sent to a nursing home. She's the nurse assigned to him
who suspects he's pulling a fast one. On the whole the film is just
darn pleasant. (ERG) 1 hour, 30 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The World Is not Enough'' PG-13 (violence, sexuality
</P>
<P>
   and innuendo)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Pierces Brosnan, Sophie Marceau and Robert Carlyle.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, even a game Pierce Brosnan and a classy director (Michael
Apted) aren't enough to save the 19th 007 movie from being more of
the same old same old. Bond is assigned by M (Judi Dench) to
protect an heiress (Sophie Marceau) and her oil pipeline from a
terrorist (Robert Carlyle). There's the usual eye-popping opening
stunt sequence. (ERG)2 hours, 8 minutes. C-

 &HT;    Schmaltz aside, `Frequency' makes effective connection
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) hears dead people.
</P>
<P>
   One night in October 1999, he hooks up his long-gone father's
old ham radio. And guess who's on the other end? Dad (Dennis
Quaid), talking to him from October 1969.
</P>
<P>
   How, precisely, this works is the kind of thing best understood
by people who write scripts for movies like ``Frequency'' (or maybe
you could ask Stephen Hawking). Anyway, the two Sullivans connect.
More amazingly, they connect the day before Frank Sullivan _ that's
Dad _ will be killed in a fire, heroically trying to rescue a
drugged-out teenage runaway.
</P>
<P>
   Run the other way, pleads his son, who has spent three decades
poring over a scrapbook of dead-hero newspaper clips. And Frank
does. And he survives. And suddenly, thanks to that one small
change, everything past and present is oh-so-slightly different.
</P>
<P>
   On the good side, John has lots of photographs with himself, his
mother and his father. On the not-so-good side, a serial killer
from the 1960s has somehow been allowed to extend his murderous
spree. So father and son _ one a fireman, the other a cop _ team up
as time-warp detectives to track down the murderer and, yet again,
change fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequency,'' which has the strong bones of a fine Harlan
Ellison or Ray Bradbury short story, also has the burden of making
itself viable for the length of a feature movie. Thus, not only
does it get too convoluted for its own good, but it leaves a lot of
unanswered questions about that whole space-time continuum thing.
Further, the father-son bonding is laid on so thick that you almost
want to rent ``Affliction'' to watch James Coburn's Oscar-winning
performance and remind yourself what a bad dad can be like.
</P>
<P>
   Still, director Gregory Hoblit, who suckered us so magnificently
with ``Primal Fear,'' knows a mind-twisting script when he sees
one. Not only does the film benefit from that ``what if?''
fascination of being able to change fate, but it allows Quaid and
Caviezel to do some effective emotional button-pushing without
pushing their luck.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is that this movie works best for anyone who's
ever wondered whether he/she could change something _ be it the
death of a loved one or betting on an obscure stock _ simply by
being in the know and willing to risk the consequences. It's a
fantasy about control wrapped inside an unabashedly sentimental
plot. But if you can get on its wavelength, it works.

 &HT;    `Heart' brings Cracker Chic to Wal-Mart
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You won't find a David or a Susan in ``Where the Heart Is.'' No,
this is one of those country-cute movies where folks are full of
gumption and have names like Moses, Lexie, Sister Husband, Forney
and Novalee Nation.
</P>
<P>
   The latter, a pregnant 17-year-old played by Natalie Portman, is
the latest addition to a popular Hollywood stereotype: the low-rent
single mother having to make it on her own (think of
``Tumbleweeds,'' ``Erin Brockovich,'' ``Anywhere But Here'' and
``Crazy in Alabama''). You could call ``Heart'' the latest in a new
genre: cracker chic.
</P>
<P>
   But dagnabbit if the ding-dang thing doesn't work half the
gosh-darn time.
</P>
<P>
   En route to California, the destination of choice for these
movie moms, Novalee gets dumped by her no-'count boyfriend, Willy
Jack (Dylan Bruno), at an Oklahoma Wal-Mart, where she secretly
lives until the baby's birth turns her into a local star: the
Wal-Mart Mom. (For the record, she decides to call her daughter
Americus instead of her first choice, Windy.)
</P>
<P>
   Embraced by the townsfolk, Novalee bonds with recovering
alcoholic Sister Husband (the wry Stockard Channing, batting most
of her comic lines out of the ballpark) and Lexie (Ashley Judd),
another single mother whose many children are named Brownie, Baby
Ruth and _ oh, never mind, you get the drift.
</P>
<P>
   In episodic fashion, Novalee deals with religious fanatics, a
kidnapping, a friend's assault, a killer tornado and the attentions
of one of those smart, shy, sexy guys who exist only in chick
flicks like this. Here, he's Forney (James Frain), a librarian.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the Billie Letts novel, ``Heart'' keeps its menfolk
stuck in two dimensions. I guess that's only fair turnaround, since
most actresses in studio films get stuck playing the Wife or
Girlfriend. In case we miss the movie's girl-power message,
``Heart'' includes a needless plot line that follows Willy Jack's
attempts at a singing career and goes to gruesome lengths to show
us his comeuppance.
</P>
<P>
   Portman can't make you believe that she ``never lived anyplace
that didn't have wheels under it,'' but she's always fresh and
intelligent. She brings a graceful stillness to many of her scenes,
making us believe in Novalee's transformation from baby-voiced teen
to self-assured woman.
</P>
<P>
   In a supporting role, Judd doesn't have to carry a movie for the
first time in a while. She's the better for it, relaxed, funny and
free of the grim calculation she brought to ``Kiss the Girls'' and
``Double Jeopardy.''
</P>
<P>
   And you have to appreciate a movie that at least gives work to
pros like Channing and Sally Field, in a cameo as Novalee's
peroxide-headed, aging party-hearty mother.
</P>
<P>
   Peppered with zinger lines by screenwriting team Lowell Ganz and
Babaloo Mandel (``City Slickers''), ``Where the Heart Is'' has
enough humor and polish to gull you into enjoying it's jest-folks
fakery. But you may hate yourself in the morning.

 &HT;    `Me': Be careful what you wish for
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You sort of want to smack Pamela (Rachel Griffiths) when you
meet her at the start of ``Me Myself I.''
</P>
<P>
   She's a mope. Sure, she has a job she loves, winning awards for
her incisive journalism. But she's entered her 30s and hit an
emotional oil patch. ``I'm supposed to be happily maried with two
kids by now,'' she whines to one married, mothered pal. And she
regrets having turned down old boyfriend Robert (David Roberts)
when he proposed to her years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   For the first few minutes of ``Me Myself I,'' the movie seems to
have a terminal case of the blues, literally: Pamela's messy
apartment is painted in gloomy shades of the color. But the
Australian comedy and Pamela both get a good shake-up when she
steps into a city street and gets bumped by a minivan being driven
by . . . herself.
</P>
<P>
   For clarity, let's call her Pamela 2 (also played by Griffiths),
a concerned soccer mom who whisks the first Pamela home to make
sure she's OK. And then Pamela 2 disappears, leaving the first
version trapped in this parallel life, which includes three
children, a houseful of chores and her workaholic husband _ yes,
Robert.
</P>
<P>
   Griffiths (``Hilary and Jackie'') makes an art of benumbed comic
reaction as she finds herself trapped in a nightmare of
domesticity. She sits at the kitchen table sedated by the constant
chatter of her instant children and stares in disbelief as the
youngest asks for her help in the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Gwyneth Paltrow piffle ``Sliding Doors,'' ``Me Myself
I'' wants to examine the road not traveled. But whereas ``Doors''
was one-sided, giving initiative and chutzpah to only one of
Paltrow's personas, ``Me'' is remarkably evenhanded in its
treatment of both Pamelas' lives. One of the movie's neat gimmicks
is the way all the people in her old world turn up in new, altered
guises, including a cute but unavailable crisis counselor (Sandy
Winton), who resurfaces as a single fellow writer who starts to
flirt with her.
</P>
<P>
   Like the current ``Where the Heart Is,'' ``Me'' could be called
a chick flick. But it gives its heroine intelligence, self-analysis
and a healthy sex drive that leads to some of the movie's funnier
scenes, as she puts the make on an exhausted hubby. Best of all,
Pamela is far from faultless in either of her parallel lives; in
fact, one of the nice plot-bombs in the movie is the gradual
discovery of Pamela 2's not-so-noble activities.
</P>
<P>
   Writer-director Pip Karmel energizes her film with charming
comic bits, but she never loses sight of her bigger message _ that
regret for the road you didn't take is fruitless and that every
choice in life contains compromise. ``Me Myself I'' makes a
generous but clear-eyed case for both ways of life chosen by the
two Pamelas. It gently assures us that the grass is always green _
at least sometimes _ on both sides.

ACROSS THE LONE STAR STATE, OLD HOTELS SHINE WITH A NEWLY POLISHED
PATINA
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by OLD HOTELS-OTHERS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During the past two years, as new owners completed a $12 million
renovation of Houston's The Warwick hotel, they made room for many
of the accouterments acquired over the hotel's 75 years. In the
lobby, pieces of the heavy wood paneling _ actually, 1700s-era
carved woodwork brought over piece by piece from French chateaux _
were polished and restored and hung separately, like museum pieces,
with little lights framing each one just so.
</P>
<P>
   Antique settees and massive oak tables were restored to glory
and placed back in the lobby; ornate candelabras and an original
Remington sculpture were polished and displayed anew. The exterior
was returned from bland white to the original rich terra-cotta
color. And designers found a special place to hang an 18th-century
French tapestry, a museum-quality treasure that the wife of
one-time owner John Mecom had bought on a European shopping
expedition to upgrade the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But if you know where to look, you'll notice that the precious
artwork looks just a bit unbalanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they got it over here, it just didn't fit the space they
intended it for,'' explains general manager Mark Peterson, with a
rueful chuckle. ``So they just cut a piece off.''
</P>
<P>
   Probably every hotel of a certain age has a few little quirks
like this _ a reason many travelers find historic hotels more
interesting than the cookie-cutter chain operations that dot every
interstate highway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a resurgent interest in our older hotels, and
I think that's because of the great increase in heritage tourism,''
says Carter Schildknecht, president of Historic and Hospitality
Accommodations of Texas, which counts as members many of Texas'
smaller historic inns.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk into one of these historic hotels, you get a
feel for where you are. It's just the fact that you can see what it
looked like back then, and you get a sense of how people lived.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas has supported and preserved a number of its older hotels,
many surviving from the days before about 1930 when nearly all
towns had at least one hotel, Schildknecht says. Just in the last
two years, Austin's Driskill Hotel, Houston's The Warwick and
Galveston's Galvez have all undergone multimillion-dollar
face-lifts. Smaller hotels are part of the boom, too. In
Waxahachie, for instance, the once-grand Rogers Hotel, closed since
the '60s, is due to reopen this summer, with 27 upscale renovated
rooms.
</P>
<P>
   From San Antonio's Menger Hotel (where Teddy Roosevelt recruited
his Rough Riders in the bar) to Marfa's Paisano Hotel (where James
Dean and the rest of the cast stayed while filming ``Giant''),
these historic hotels are full of stories. Here's a look at our
favorite 10.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Hotel: The Warwick
</P>
<P>
   City: Houston
</P>
<P>
   Then: In continuous operation longer than any other hotel in
Houston (which loves to tear things down almost as much as Dallas
does), The Warwick was built in 1925. (Some accounts place it in
1926.) Its location, adjacent to leafy Hermann Park and the Museum
of Fine Arts, Houston, helped it attract an upscale following. But
it really bloomed in the late '50s when the John Mecom family
bought it, renovated it and fashioned it into a luxury property,
complete with French antiques and five-star service.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel fell on hard times in the '80s; it was foreclosed on
by its bank, sold to a foreign company and essentially ignored. By
the mid-'90s, it was tired and threadbare, and rooms were going for
the same rate as at a discount motel.
</P>
<P>
   Now: The hotel, purchased by a Dallas company in 1998 and now a
part of the Park Plaza International chain, emerged from a
two-year, $12 million renovation in the fall of 1999 with
completely overhauled guest rooms (including baths with the best
hotel showers we've found), a luxe new bar and an elegantly
refurbished pool on the second-floor deck.
</P>
<P>
   They slept here: Presidents Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford and Lyndon
B. Johnson; the Duke and Duchess of Windsor; Princess Grace; Bill
Cosby; Bob Hope; Andy Warhol; Sonny and Cher; Ella Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Details: 308 guest rooms, restaurant, bar. Rooms from $189,
double. (800) 670-7275 or (713) 526-1991; www.parkhtls.com
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Hotel: Driskill Hotel
</P>
<P>
   City: Austin
</P>
<P>
   Then: The pre-eminent hotel in Austin, this 1886 structure has,
as you'd expect, many political ties. Lyndon Johnson took Lady Bird
here for their first date, a breakfast in the dining room; LBJ
later made a tradition of waiting out election results here.
Governors from Ma Ferguson to Ann Richards staged their inaugural
balls in the hotel's lavish ballrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel was originally built as the ``frontier palace'' of
cattle baron Jesse Driskill, who owned the hotel for only a year
before selling it due to bankruptcy. A series of owners added
eccentric and/or elegant touches to the hotel, including a women's
spa and Turkish bath (1909) and the Maximilian Room (1930), named
for its crowning feature, eight gold-leaf framed mirrors that were
wedding gifts from the emperor of Mexico to his wife. But the
hotel's fortunes rose and fell; in 1969, it was literally saved
from the wrecking ball by a last-minute grassroots effort by Austin
residents. Through the '70s and '80s, it underwent a series of
small-scale renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Now: A sweeping $35 million restoration, begun three years ago,
has resulted in a stunning hotel, combining turn-of-the century
decor with new features. The lobby's new, intricate marble floor
contrasts with antique oil paintings, the original 3-story columns
and a stained-glass domed ceiling. Public spaces are filled with
new overstuffed leather sofas and Texas-themed lamps and tables but
retain the pressed-tin ceilings. The final touches, a fitness
center and a rooftop pool, are due to open in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Details: 205 rooms, restaurant, bar. Rooms from $205, double;

REPORT SHOWS CONTINUED STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH, WORRYING INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds, we expect a writethru lede later in the evening)  
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The American economy grew at a 5.4 percent annual
rate in the first three months of the year, federal officials said
Thursday in an announcement that produced some jitters.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, the Commerce Department's latest data was yet
another indication of what most people already knew: The economy is
vibrant, and people have money to spend.
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts worry that the economy needs to be reined in
to prevent a sharp rise in inflation. Their fears were heightened
by another government report, from the Labor Department, which
showed that wages and benefits for American workers went up 4.3
percent between March 1999 and last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department report said the 5.4 percent rise in the
gross domestic product, or the total output of goods and services,
was fueled in part by an increase in consumer spending and by sharp
increases in energy prices.
</P>
<P>
   At the Labor Department, the increase in the Employment Cost
Index, which measures employers' costs for benefits to their
employees as well as wages and salaries, was the largest in eight
years _ good news for workers in general, perhaps, but perhaps not
for those who worry about the economy from a broader perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that runaway growth could worsen inflation, the Federal
Reserve has raised interest rates a quarter-point several times in
recent months, and few economists would be surprised if it raised
them again when it meets on May 16, and perhaps again in June.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's economic news may have contributed to pessimism on
Wall Street, where both the Dow Jones industrial average and the
Nasdaq index were off sharply by midday, though Nasdaq closed the
day with a good gain.
</P>
<P>
   As for the prediction that Thursday's indicators would cause
indigestion at the Fed, that was not immediately apparent. The Fed
chairman, Alan Greenspan, whose every utterance is weighed for
possible hints about interest rates, offered no clues Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan was in Kansas City speaking at a conference on the
future of rural America. His remarks did not seem tailored to raise
fear, or any other emotion, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite apart from the effects of a changing farm economy, rural
towns and villages are likely to experience, within their local
jurisdictions, a good bit of change in economic structure'' because

&HT;     DISNEY LOOKS FOR OLD MAGIC OF `LION KING,' BUT COMES UP SHORT 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Walt Disney and Julie Taymor are back on Broadway
again,
</P>
<P>
   but not together this time. Not, of course, unless you count the
continued presence of their joint blockbuster ``The Lion King,''
which will still be prowling the Pridelands long after their
current projects have revolved out of sight in the Circle of Life.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's disappointing ``Aida,'' which opened in March at the
Palace Theatre (where Walt Disney Productions broke into Broadway
in '94 with ``Beauty and the Beast''), is actually the newer of the
two ventures. And it could more accurately be labeled a cub of the
``Lion,'' given the repeat participation of composer Elton John,
lyricist Tim Rice, co-author Linda Woolverton, producers Peter
Schneider and Thomas Schumacher and the show's dynamic star,
Heather Headley.
</P>
<P>
   Taymor's ``The Green Bird,'' which opened last week at the Cort,
is a remounting of a show she's staged before with most of the same
collaborators _ in '96 at the New Victory Theater, just across the
street from the New Amsterdam where ``Lion`` reigns. It isn't a
great ``Bird,`` but it flies a lot higher than it did before.
</P>
<P>
   A Broadway debut for original producer Theatre for a New
Audience (co-presenting with Ostar Enterprises), it's very much the
same show with some script tweaking by Eric Overmyer, new
choreography by Daniel Ezralow and some heightened production
values. It's still pretty thin, but it contains more of Taymor's
trademark stage magic. And it's highly entertaining for most of its
two hours and 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Much of its problems are inherent in the script, a late 18th
century Venetian fable by Carlo Gozzi in a colloquial translation
by Albert Bermel and Ted Emery. A wildly fanciful sequel to his
``The Love of Three Oranges,' it was written to satirize the French
philosophers of the Enlightenment and promote faith in the Church
and aristocracy. Much of that material, and some of Gozzi's comedy,
doesn't translate very well from his time to ours.
</P>
<P>
   What does work very well in Taymor's hands, is Gozzi's penchant
for imaginative fantasy. The story is impossibly complicated,
involving lost twins, mistaken identities, statues that come to
life, singing apples, an almost incestuous marriage and many
magical transformations. But the more outlandish Gozzi gets, the
more scope Taymor has to create wondrous effects.
</P>
<P>
   A broad wall of mystic graffiti turns into a digestive system in
compartments that open like an Advent calendar. Large red apples
(three now, instead of one) float high above the stage on long
green dress-stalks and cut themselves open to reveal Harlow-blond
lookalikes singing opera and torch songs as smaller apples dance
along ropes like bouncing musical notes. A massive granite head
speaks and blinks, and a naked marble woman comes to life. A
traffic jam of souped-up sedans on dancers heads (one of the new
effects) bustles about the stage.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fabulous assortment of eye-dazzling and rib-tickling
images derived from simple imaginative stagecraft: Christine Jones'
transformative sets, Constance Hoffman's brightly colorful and
burlesque-patterned black-and-white costumes, Donald Holder's
magical lights and Taymor's wondrous small and enormous puppets and
comically expressive masks. It's infused with energy and comic
mystery by Elliot Goldenthal's eclectic score and enlivened by
Ezralow's bright rag- and Charleston-based choreography, especially
in the new closing production number.
</P>
<P>
   And it's beautifully performed by Taymor's now larger cast.
Derek Smith is a particular standout, repeating and refining his
role as the self-conscious melancholy king with a knack for
sarcastic asides. But the entire cast is superb, from original
members Didi Conn's busybody Smeraldina, Andrew Weems' softhearted
Pantalone, Ned Eisenberg's hustler Truffaldino, Sophia Salguero's
seductive apple and Bruce Turk's protective Green Bird to Reg
Cathey's mercurial soothsayer, Katie MacNichol's plaintive-selfish
heroine and Edward Hibbert's voraciously evil queen in a black
bustle like an elongated carapace.
</P>
<P>
   As inventive as the packaging is, however, and as much fun is
its execution, the contents of ``Bird'' remain pretty ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   For Disney, ``Aida'' is a departure from a winning formula, the
company's first Broadway venture not adapted from one of its
popular animated features. It's the first show under the banner of
Hyperion Theatricals, to distinguish Disney's more high-brow
entertainments from those produced by Schneider and Schumacher
under Disney Theatricals. And it's certainly the first Disney
production to risk serious comparison with the opera it was, as the
program has it, ``suggested by.''
</P>
<P>
   It's also, though visually spectacular aplenty, the first
Broadway show from the company in which the magic of stagecraft
takes a backseat to such basics as story and the performances of
its primary roles. Which is its principal problem. Though the leads
are exceptionally strong, except for a badly miscast Adam Pascal,
the material with which they have to work is not. The famously
expensive _ and even more famously malfunctioning _ massive
levitating pyramid was scrapped following the show's $10 million
1998 trial run in Atlanta. So, too, were its designer, director and
some of Linda Woolverton's book (she'd previously written the
screenplay and book for ``Beauty,'' and co-written the screenplay
for ``Lion''). New director Robert Falls, the artistic director of
Chicago's Goodman Theatre who staged last season's Broadway smash
``Death of a Salesman,'' reshaped the text with the help of
playwright David Henry Hwang (``M. Butterfly'').
</P>
<P>
   Bob Crowley's set and costume redesign is stunning, from the
grand Eye of Horus emblazoned on the curtain (which dilates open
like a camera lens) to the playfully outrageous fashion show of the
princess Amneris' high-tech-chic wardrobe. Vast red sails,
parchment maps and temple facades cover the stage _ even, in a bit
of overkill, a shimmering pool, as seen from above, with airborne
handmaidens ``swimming'' within. A chorus of soldiers and slaves
erupts in Wayne Cilento's magnetic jazz-hieroglyphic-bellydance
choreography.
</P>
<P>
   But Falls and Crowley keep a tight focus on the principals,
isolated by Natasha Katz's sculptural lights in fields of black or
red. (The only pyramid in sight is built of shafts of light.) And
whenever that focus is on Heather Headley's Aida, the Nubian
princess enslaved in Egypt, or on Sherie Ren Scott's Amneris, the
pharaoh's daughter, the show takes flight.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the third leg of the fatal love pyramid doesn't
measure up. Pascal, dynamic in ``Rent,'' plays Radames _ the
Egyptian general, betrothed to Amneris and in love with Aida _ with
all the authority of an East Village trust-fund garage-band wannabe
with a pleasant and forceful country-rocker voice. But then,
Radames' problems are not central to this ``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   Elton John and Tim Rice's take on Verdi, perhaps not
surprisingly, is that this is a story about the tragic fate and
true nobility of princesses. The banal songs, which take up most of
the almost 2 1/2-hour show, set its tenor and proclaim its theme
with an opening ``Every Story is a Love Story,'' powerfully
rendered by Scott. And the songs determine the story's course, from
an astonishingly superficial take on Aida and Radames' dilemma
(``We All Lead Such Elaborate Lives'') to its wistful appreciation
of royalty.
</P>
<P>
   Aida is _ guess what _ the people's princess, reminded of her
true calling by the chorus of devoted slaves singing ``And all we
ask of you is a lifetime of service.'' So, oddly enough, is Amneris
(hey, she's a princess too), who evolves from a self-centered
fashion ditz to understand how unattractive exploitation is and, in
the end, ascends the throne to usher in ``a reign of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   This is pretty mawkish stuff, not helped by the generic nature
of John's score and Rice's uninspired lyrics. Fortunately, Scott
can invest just about any song with real Broadway pizzazz. And
Headley absolutely transcends the material.
</P>
<P>
   Tall, slender and regal in bearing, Headley is the true find of
``Aida.'' Her still, thoughtful or anguished silences alone are
compelling. Her lithe hands are powerfully expressive. And she
sings with enormous, expertly controlled forcefulness, styling each
note to make it her own, infusing John's most banal melodies with
the seductive longing of the blues or the soul-stirring rapture of
a spiritual. With any luck, her next show will be something more
substantial than an inflated ``Candle in the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   Elton John and Tim Rice's ``Aida'' is at the Palace Theatre,

`THE FLINTSTONES IN VIVA ROCK VEGAS': CAVEMAN COURTSHIP, WITHOUT
CLUBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Primitive humor coupled with high-tech moviemaking turn ``The
Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas'' into a sputtering vehicle for the
return of the popular Stone Age characters who first emerged from
their cave as Hanna-Barbera cartoon figures on television 40 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   This sequel to the 1994 live-action ``Flintstones'' is actually
a prequel to the saga of Fred Flintstone, his pal Barney Rubble and
their respective wives, the former Wilma Slag and Betty O'Shale.
</P>
<P>
   But as directed by Brian Levant in an encore from 1994 and
written by the teams of Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont and Jim
Cash and Jack Epps Jr., ``The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas''
stumbles at its outset by setting up an adult premise inevitably
undone by the film's aspirations to family entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   What results is a candy-colored broad comedy with noteworthy
performances by Mark Addy (of ``The Full Monty,'' no less) as a
Jackie Gleason-like Fred; Jane Krakowski (of ``Ally McBeal'') as
Betty; and Alan Cumming (of ``Cabaret'' et al.) as the preening
British rock star Mick Jagged. The young Dino, the purple
Flintstone pet hatched from an egg won at a carnival, proves a
lovable, slobbering bundle of saurian energy.
</P>
<P>
   But the film's framing device, with Cumming (again) as the Great
Gazoo, an extraterrestrial from a species that reproduces by
division who is sent to Earth to study the mating habits of humans,
fails to capitalize on its comic potential.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, thanks to the effects of Jim Henson's Creature
Shop and the animation and visual effects of Rhythm and Hues
Studios, there is plenty to fill the eye and poke the ribs, if
little to tickle a well-evolved funny bone.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, wordplay abounds, in prehistoric automobiles like the
Maserocki and in garish resort hotels like the Tardust, the Saharoc
and the Molten Nugget. Modern means find their counterparts in a
gigantic bridge and a roller coaster along the backs and tails of
brontosauruses, clamshell gambling chips and an octopus that can
massage two clients at once.
</P>
<P>
   As for plot, it goes something like this: Around the time that
Fred and his dimwitted pal Barney (Stephen Baldwin) graduate from
the Bronto Crane Academy, qualifying them for work in the Bedrock
quarry, Gazoo arrives to study mating habits. But Fred and Barney,
the first earthlings whom Gazoo encounters, have no mates.
</P>
<P>
   On an outing to the local Bronto Burger, they encounter Betty,
one of the roller-skating waitresses, and Wilma (Kristen Johnston),
who has run away from the snooty castle and empty-headed social
circle she was reared in. The softhearted Betty has fixed up the
klutzy Wilma with a job, believing her to be penniless and
homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Betty is unaware of Wilma's high-fashion mother, the
overweening, over-the-top Pearl Slaghoople (Joan Collins), ``a
regular Joan Crawfish''; her father, the dotty Colonel Slaghoople
(Harvey Korman); and the handsome, hissable Chip Rockefeller
(Thomas Gibson), a supposedly wealthy Rock Vegas resort owner.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Slaghoople is pushing Wilma to marry Chip, and while he
seems determined to win her heart, his emotions are actually fixed
on her money because criminal creditors are after his life.
</P>
<P>
   On a double date at an amusement park (Fred to Barney, in
preparation: ``Barney, tonight we shower''), the pals realize they
are with the wrong partners, and after a switch, Fred pairs off
with Wilma and Barney with Betty.
</P>
<P>
   But when Fred is humiliated at a lavish party at Slaghoople
Manor, Chip pretends to make amends by inviting the four friends to
the opening of his casino in Rock Vegas, where trouble and
misunderstandings await.
</P>
<P>
   In the guise of hospitality, the rotten Chip intends to extend
credit and then bankrupt Fred at the gaming tables, frame him as
the thief who stole Wilma's famous pearls and have Wilma for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   And Betty, who has seen Barney with Chip's voluptuous playmate,
Roxie (Alex Meneses), will assuage her grief with Mick Jagged.
</P>
<P>
   But the Great Gazoo, who has been absent for large stretches of
this adventure, is about to intervene.
</P>
<P>
   So after a turn with Barney dressed as a showgirl, Fred will be
able to yell ``Yabba-dabba-doo,'' and if enough people pay enough
money, another ``Flintstones'' will be chiseled out of Bedrock in a
few more years.
</P>
<P>
   Rating: ``The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas'' is rated PG
(Parental guidance suggested). It includes some comic sexual
suggestiveness and comic violence.

<P>
   Hotel: Stockyards Hotel
</P>
<P>
   City: Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   Then: In 1907, the hotel was created to give cattle barons a
respectable place to stay when doing business in the Stockyards.
The original wood structure was replaced in two stages by the
current brick building, beginning in 1913; you can still see some
of the original window frames. But as business moved away from the
Stockyards, the hotel suffered. By the '60s, it had turned into a
flophouse where $5 bought you a room with a communal bathroom down
the hall.
</P>
<P>
   Now: The hotel's fortunes turned in 1984, when new owners turned
it into an elegant Southwestern-style inn. A second massive
renovation was undertaken in 1996 by the current owners, who added
the adjacent H3 Ranch restaurant and played up the Cowtown
connection. A new Old West decor features antique and reproduction
Texas-style furniture, Remington reproductions, suede
wall-coverings, and carpeting with longhorns woven into the design.
The wild-West theme plays particularly convincingly with Yankees
and Europeans; in fact, guests often ask if those are gunshot holes
in the antique window shutters. (Nope, that's just what the
original wormwood looks like.)
</P>
<P>
   They slept here: Wild Bill Hickok, Bonnie and Clyde.
</P>
<P>
   Details: 52 rooms, restaurant, bar. Rooms from $110, double.
(817) 625-6427. www.stockyardshotel.com
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Hotel: Hotel Paisano
</P>
<P>
   City: Marfa
</P>
<P>
   Then: Opened in 1930 as a resting spot for travelers between El
Paso and San Antonio, the Paisano's pink Santa Fe stucco exterior
housed a hotel that soon became a favorite location for proms and
weddings. But it would likely today be considered just another nice
old Texas hotel if not for an event in 1955 _ Elizabeth Taylor,
James Dean, Rock Hudson and the rest of the cast of ``Giant'' holed
up there for six months, making the Texas epic. (It was to be
Dean's last film.) The antique-filled lobby became a repository for
``Giant'' memorabilia, such as autographed star pictures, movie
stills, magazine clippings and stray props.
</P>
<P>
   Now: In 1979, rooms were converted into suites, each with a
small sitting area and kitchenette and a theme. There are
Southwestern rooms; a '60s room with kitschy shag carpeting; and
the James Dean room, which is No. 5, the one Dean actually stayed
in. The hotel still attracts Dean fans, and it sells movie-themed
T-shirts and postcards.
</P>
<P>
   They stayed here: Sylvester Stallone, Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid,
Melissa Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Details: 16 rooms. Rooms from $55, double; (915) 729-3145
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Hotel: Menger Hotel
</P>
<P>
   City: San Antonio
</P>
<P>
   Then: Dating to 1859, what's considered Texas' oldest
continuously operating hotel has an appropriately oversized
history. Gen. Robert E. Lee once rode his horse Traveller into the
lobby. O. Henry frequently mentioned it in his short stories. And,
most famously, in 1898 Teddy Roosevelt recruited his Rough Riders
at the dark, clubby Menger Bar, an exact replica of the House of
Lords pub in London, complete with paneled cherry-wood ceiling and
beveled French mirrors. (Later, during Prohibition, the bar was
dismantled and moved piece by piece to its current location in the
hotel.)
</P>
<P>
   Now: Between 1988 and 1992, the hotel was extensively renovated;
a new ballroom and 33 rooms and suites were added, and the original
1859 building was renovated. Antique paintings, clocks and
Victorian-era furnishings were retained in much of the redesign.
</P>
<P>
   They slept here: Oscar Wilde, President Dwight D. Eisenhower,
Ulysses S. Grant, Sarah Bernhardt, Mae West.
</P>
<P>
   Details: 350 rooms, restaurant, bar. Rooms from $135, double.

</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Hotel: Gage Hotel
</P>
<P>
   City: Marathon
</P>
<P>
   Then: Opened in 1927 by a Vermont refugee who had become a rich
banker and cattle baron, the Gage immediately became the meeting
spot for ranchers and miners. It also hosted many dances and the
occasional tourist who came out looking for Big Bend beauty. But
slowly, ``modernizations'' _ linoleum coverings pasted atop
beautiful oak floors, lowered ceilings _ began to ruin the
once-proud hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Now: Renovation began in the late 1970s, when the hotel was one
of the first to capitalize on the popularity of western chic. It
was redecorated with upscale furnishings mixing cowboy, Mexican and
Indian influences. An adjacent inn, Los Portales, came along later,
overlooking the pool; last year, a 1900-era guest house was
restored and opened.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the Gage is also known as the place that launched star
chef Grady Spears, now of Reata of Fort Worth, Alpine and Beverly
Hills; he was managing the restaurant there a few years ago when
the chef walked out in the middle of dinner, and Spears jumped in
and started cooking.
</P>
<P>
   They slept here: Zane Grey, Dwight Yoakam, Tracy Byrd, Tom
Brokaw, Dan Rather, Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   Details: 43 rooms, restaurant and bar. Rooms from $85, double.

<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Hotel: Hotel Limpia
</P>
<P>
   City: Fort Davis
</P>
<P>
   Then: The original pink limestone hotel was built in 1912,
replacing an 1884 Limpia Hotel that had become a private residence
perhaps 20 years earlier. By the '30s, the hotel was popular not
only with local ranchers, who stayed there while in town on
business, but also with doctors and lawyers and businessmen from
Houston and San Antonio, who installed their families there for
summer vacations. The hotel was also a gathering point for the
community, the place where election returns were announced to
citizens and meetings were held. But like many little inns in small
Texas towns, it had become somewhat run-down by the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Now: Nine years ago, Joe and Lanna Duncan left Dallas and bought
the hotel, which had been in the family for years, from relatives
and set about restoring it. First, they redid the kitchen and
dining room; then they renovated the rooms and the common areas
from top to bottom, leaving the original tin ceilings and filling
the rooms with a combination of reproduction furnishings and their
own Victorian antiques. Next, they added a second gift shop and
added 16 suites in two nearby Victorian houses that they also
renovated. Original features were saved when possible; for
instance, the original walk-in icebox in the hotel basement became
a wine cellar.
</P>
<P>
   They slept here: Meg Ryan and Dennis Quaid, James Garner, Larry
Gatlin, Tommy Lee Jones, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Literary talk show joins WABE's lineup
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For several weeks, Atlanta radio listeners have been getting an
opportunity to hear authors such as Ha Jin, Carl Hiaasen and Pearl
Cleage talk about their work. The half-hour program ``Between the
Lines'' airs at 7:30 p.m. Thursdays on WABE-FM 90.1 and at 5:30
p.m. on select Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Jackson, host of the local talk show ``Prime Time,'' has
teamed with Daren Wang, producer of last year's radio series
``Porches: The South and Her Writers,'' to create the literary
forum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do our homework,'' Wang said. ``We take pride in knowing
the authors and their books. This is not just a matter of
personality, but an attempt to get some real insight into an
author's work. We also like to find hidden gems, like `Bugs and
Critters I Have Known,' a book of children's poetry that has
received little attention but is a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, wife of former Atlanta mayor Maynard Jackson, says they
plan to continue to tap into visiting authors as well as local
writers. ``The caliber of talent coming through Atlanta in any
given week is a little overwhelming,'' she said, ``but I have
enjoyed reading these books and getting to know the writers.''
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 11 Discount Books, a sponsor of the program, will host a
party with Jackson and Wang from 6 to 7:30 p.m. May 4 at the
chain's Peachtree Battle store. 2345 Peachtree Road, 404-237-7199.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  All in the family: The filming of St. Simons Island author
Tina McElroy Ansa's novel ``Baby of the Family'' has turned into a
real family affair. The upcoming feature will be produced by Ansa,
and her husband, Jonee, and daughter Afrika will produce the
soundtrack and score.
</P>
<P>
   Recently chosen as the first film project of the newly formed
Macon Film and Music Commission, ``Baby of the Family'' is also the
first feature film of the Ansas' production company, DownSouth
Filmworks Inc., which is based on St. Simons. Author William Diehl

   ``Baby of the Family'' is a supernatural dramatic comedy set in
the mythical middle Georgia town of Mulberry in the 1950s and '60s.
It tells the story of Lena McPherson, a child born with mystical
powers. The film, starring Emmy Award-winning actress Alfre
Woodard, will be released next spring.
</P>
<P>
   Ansa's fourth novel, ``You Know Better,'' also comes out next
spring, from William Morrow.

<P>
   &QR;  Documenting history: The newly published ``The Papers of
Martin Luther King Jr., Volume IV: Symbol of the Movement, January
1957-December 1958'' (University of California Press, $50) probably
will be used primarily by scholars, and that's a shame.
Non-academics will find this 637-page book a fascinating glimpse
behind the scenes of the early stages of the civil rights movement.
With the Montgomery bus boycott at an end, this is the period when
King confronts the sudden demands of celebrity, establishes the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference and refines his nonviolent
campaign.

AETNA BEATS EXPECTATIONS BY 17 CENTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aetna (AET:NYSE), the troubled U.S. health insurer
currently undergoing a radical restructuring, surpassed Wall
Street's quarterly earnings expectations by 17 cents Thursday on
healthy performances from its three business divisions.
</P>
<P>
   For the first quarter ended March 31, operating earnings rose to
$184 million, or $1.29 a diluted share, from $158.4 million, or
$1.01 a share a year earlier. The consensus estimate of analysts
polled by First Call/Thomson Financial was $1.12.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose to $6.4 billion from $4.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The Aetna U.S. Healthcare division produced operating earnings
that rose 24 percent to $131.8 million, mostly because earnings
from Prudential HealthCare were included. The Aetna Financial
Services business reported that operating earnings rose 27 percent
to $60 million, primarily because of higher fee income.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna International, which sells life insurance, health and
pension products in emerging markets, reported that operating
earnings rose 14 percent to $48.9 million, reflecting business
growth and an improved economic environment in Asia and Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Results for the first quarter of 1999 and all comparisons
reflect the restatements that were announced on Feb. 1 after the
completion of a review by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Disclosed in October 1999, the review examined public filings
related to the company's acquisitions and divestitures.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna said it would separate
its global health and global financial services businesses into two
independent publicly traded companies. The company said Thursday
that it is searching for a chief executive of the health business.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the SEC review, Aetna has suffered from a plunging stock
price that forced chief executive Richard Huber to resign. He was
replaced at the end of February by William Donaldson, a board
member of the company since 1977 and the co-founder of the
investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Aetna closed up 4 3/4, or 8.61 percent, to 59 15/16.

`ARABIAN NIGHTS': A THOUSAND AND ONE NIGHTS IN TWO 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review. Time and station are
for New York area; see local listings.) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Aladdin'' is a tale so perfectly conceived it is nearly
impossible to mess up. The latest telling, the centerpiece of ABC's
miniseries ``Arabian Nights,'' is a witty and sumptuous version,
with Jason Scott Lee tremendously engaging as the poor young con
man who finds a magic lantern.
</P>
<P>
   John Leguizamo goes delightfully over the top playing two
genies, a cheerful roly-poly and his cousin, a growling demon (more
of a softy than he sounds). And though the genies change Aladdin's
fortunes with trunks of jewels and a palace that appears and
vanishes in a flash, the tale is irresistible because of its
good-hearted, scheming hero. Aladdin falls for a princess and
learns that magic is nothing without love.
</P>
<P>
   Which, naturally, brings us to special effects, the magic that
is to mini-series what the genie was to Aladdin. Many series have
flopped because they failed to learn Aladdin's lesson: Visual
wizardry is nothing without characters. (Think ``Leprechauns.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Arabian Nights'' is about storytelling, so it's no surprise
that its creators allow the effects to serve the tales. Yet the six
stories in this two-part series are uneven. At its best, as in
Aladdin's story, ``Arabian Nights'' allows viewers to share the
hero's wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the weaker segments include the narrative frame
tale in which Scheherazade spins bedtime stories to save her life,
scenes woven in and out of the four hours. At its worst, ``Arabian
Nights'' is an ordinary example of its special-effects genre.
</P>
<P>
   Aladdin's tale is the one left hanging between the first
installment on Sunday and the second on Monday. That seems a clever
mirroring of Scheherazade's own keep-him-in-suspense technique, but
there's not much suspense generated here. Instead, the story's
antic spirit draws viewers back.
</P>
<P>
   Lee brings a streetwise skepticism to Aladdin, as well as a pure
longing for his princess. Leguizamo does not try to compete with
Robin Williams' genie in the Disney ``Aladdin,'' which goes a long
way toward giving this version its own identity as it whooshes from
comedy to menace to sweetness. And there is a spectacular duel
between the two genies that has animals shifting shapes with
eye-blinking speed.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the first night is flatter than any ``Arabian
Nights'' should be, even though it has Ali Baba (Rufus Sewell)
fighting the 40 thieves. The best time to get a snack is during the
second story, about Bacbac the hunchback, a strained comedy about
the death of the court jester. Throughout, the series makes clunky
attempts at wit by dropping in contemporary language. ``I have
three blockheads for sons,'' one sultan says.
</P>
<P>
   But Monday's installment picks up and ends with the swiftly
told, appealing tale of three princes sent to search for the most
wondrous object on earth. It features a flying carpet, swordfights
and a swordfight (italics)on(end italics) a flying carpet.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Arabian Nights'' flounders where it should be strongest,
with Scheherazade. As in the classic tale, Sultan Schariar,
betrayed by his wife, vows to take a new wife each night and kill
her the next morning. Scheherazade marries him and tells stories so
alluring that her life is spared every morning so she can finish
her tale, only to start a new one that night.
</P>
<P>
   Mili Avital's Scheherazade is not a mesmerizing enough
storyteller and Dougray Scott not a menacing enough sultan to make
this device engaging. Alan Bates, as a master storyteller, gives
perfect advice to Scheherazade: ``If your audience isn't hooked,
you're dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Arabian Nights'' defies mini-series death, though its
shakiness suggests that the special-effects genre itself is wearing
thin. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `The X-Files' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   9 p.m. Sunday on Fox (Channel 5 in New York)
</P>
<P>
   Written and directed by David Duchovny, Sunday's episode of
``The X-Files'' is one of the most entertaining ever, an extremely
funny, light-handed satire about Hollywood and ``The X-Files''
itself. Here, Tea Leoni ( Duchovny's wife) and Garry Shandling play
Scully and Mulder in a movie. In a flashback, we see the case that
inspired it, and a film producer who is following the agents
around. The case, as the producer says, is ```Silence of the Lambs'
meets `The Greatest Story Ever Told.'''
</P>
<P>
   It involves the Lazarus Bowl, a ceramic dish from early
Christianity that Scully (Gillian Anderson) thinks may have a
singing message built into its grooves. One expert thinks the
lyrics say, ``I am the walrus,'' but he could be wrong about that.
The bowl is part of a plot involving a sacred text and a '70s
terrorist who literally goes underground, into a crypt.
</P>
<P>
   The episode leans heavily on show-biz in-jokes, including the
hilariously droll scenes on ``The Larry Sanders Show'' in which
Duchovny's character flirted with Shandling's. There are also
loving homages to the classically bad Ed Wood movie ``Plan Nine
From Outer Space.''
</P>
<P>
   This tongue-in-cheek episode is especially fun for people who
don't take their ``X-Files'' mythology seriously. Apparently, that
group includes David Duchovny, which says a lot about why the
series has flourished, its wryness intact. &QL;

DURING TIME WARP IN QUEENS, DEAD DAD RETURNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at end of review) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to plot, ``Frequency'' throws in a lot more than
the proverbial kitchen sink. For good measure, it piles on the
refrigerator, the stove, the floor boards and even the plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   Before this entertaining science-fiction tear-jerker ends, that
plumbing has produced several floods of emotion as it gushes forth
the story of a mournful grownup boy who unexpectedly contacts his
beloved dead dad on a ham radio broadcasting from the great beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The great beyond turns out to be not so far away. It is the same
house in which the son grew up and still lives in a state of
wistful adoration for his father who died 30 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Mystically reunited by short-wave radio, father and son
collaborate on averting family tragedies and on preventing and
solving some murders committed three decades earlier. Paced at a
gallop, these overlapping adventures tap into our wildest fantasies
of time travel, of communing with dead loved ones, of reliving our
lives knowing what we know now and of blood ties so deep and true
and lasting they make all-American households like the Cleavers'
look like vipers' nests.
</P>
<P>
   If it all sounds horribly icky, ``Frequency'' gets away with
much of its sentimentality simply by piling it on so aggressively.
And Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel, who play the father and son,
imbue their roles with a winning mixture of pained intensity and
macho heartiness, as Quaid puts on a perfect New York accent.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's spiritual center of gravity is an idyllic
baseball-crazed neighborhood in Queens, N.Y., populated mostly by
policemen and firefighters and their families in 1969. This Norman
Rockwell fantasy world of blue-collar solidarity and afternoon ball
games has just enough reality to make us wonder if such a cozy
little world ever did or might even still exist.
</P>
<P>
   Where most filmmakers would have been happy to stretch the
heart-tugging vignette in the movie's first 40 minutes into a
two-hour feature, ``Frequency'' isn't content to tell just one
story. As it relentlessly charges forward, it warps the initial
tale of a son who miraculously saves his dead father's life into
two weaker spinoffs.
</P>
<P>
   For having changed one crucial element of the past, our brooding
young policeman discovers that other things are different in the
altered (or alternate) reality he's helped create. One story
involves several unsolved murders by a serial killer who is still
alive in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That word ``warp'' is the narrative key to this nostalgic
cinematic mush pot. You can imagine it having been pitched by its
director, Gregory Hoblit (``Primal Fear''), and screenwriter, Toby
Emmerich (his first screenplay), as something on the order of
``Back to the Future'' meets ``Field of Dreams'' meets ``It's a
Wonderful Life'' meets ``The Sixth Sense.'' ``Frequency'' even has
an ``I see dead people''-like tag line in the father's reiterated
declaration to his son from Out There, ``I'm still here.''
</P>
<P>
   The time warp on which the story rides has something to do with
the mystical interaction of ham radio wavelengths and the aurora
borealis glowing floridly over a house in Queens on Oct. 12, 1999.
That's the evening John Sullivan (Caviezel), a morose New York
policeman who lives alone in the house where he grew up, begins
fiddling with the short-wave radio owned by his father, Frank
(Quaid), a firefighter who died heroically in a warehouse blaze 30
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In flashbacks, we see Frank teaching the 6-year-old Johnny
(Daniel Henson), whom he calls Little Chief, to ride a bicycle
while his wife Julia (Elizabeth Mitchell), a nurse, looks on
adoringly. We can't help but notice that the sky on Oct. 12, 1969,
glows with the same eerie radiance as it does now.
</P>
<P>
   As John chats with an affable stranger on the ham radio, it
dawns on him that through some incredible cosmic trick he is in
touch with his own father broadcasting from the same house the
night before his death. The New York Mets are in the midst of the
1969 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   While John (incredibly) even now can still reel off the
play-by-play of every game in the series, Frank, who died the
following day, doesn't know how it turned out. Seizing the
opportunity to change the past, John warns his father of his
impending death. And when the movie races to the warehouse fire in
which Frank lost his life while rescuing a young woman, the outcome
is different.
</P>
<P>
   From Little Chief, to its solemn, misty-eyed ``I love you's,''
to its fet-ishistically detailed baseball trivia, ``Frequency''
pours it on so thick that at moments you could almost gag. But it
also has a sense of humor. It slyly slips an Internet stock tip to
Little Chief's childhood playmate.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Frequency'' work despite is shamelessness is the
surreal aura that imbues almost every scene with a sense of
heightened feeling. Whether fire-fighting, or crime-busting or
swapping baseball lore, the characters seem to be living in dream
time where emotions run high, colors are sharper and everything is
tinged with subliminal import.
</P>
<P>
   As real as the Sullivan family members may be, they're also
archetypes we long to believe in. ``Frequency'' may be a good yarn,
but it is also a bereft little boy's dream of power over death that
leaves a biting tang of poignancy. &QL;

`WHERE THE HEART IS': NO-GOOD MEN, FOOLISH CHOICES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Young Novalee Nation (Natalie Portman), the unwed mother-to-be
in ``Where the Heart Is,'' is terribly phobic about the number
five, and about five minutes into this astonishingly shameless
melodrama with its lower-class sweetheart heroine, you'll start to
feel exactly the same way.
</P>
<P>
   The movie seems to be stuck with its own five fixation, too,
because what feels like every five minutes, a new character or
situation is introduced to keep things lively.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to lay this at the feet of the first-time
director, Matt Williams, except that ``Roseanne,'' the television
series that he helped create, had a tough-mindedness that this
movie couldn't hope to match, even in the early days of the show
before pitched disagreements between Williams and the artist
formerly known as Roseanne Barr sent him packing.
</P>
<P>
   Novalee is headed out west with the man that the Jerry Springer
crowd would call her baby's daddy, the no-good pretty boy Willy
Jack Pickens (Dylan Bruno), whose mullet haircut, the kind that
Billy Ray Cyrus helped make famous, signals that he is someone to
watch out for.
</P>
<P>
   Novalee should, since he abandons her while she does a little
on-the-road shopping at Wal-Mart. Because both the movie and
Novalee have nowhere else to go, she sneaks into the Wal-Mart after
closing and takes up residence at night.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't turn the acres of merchandise into an after-hours
playhouse, the way Frank Whaley did with a Target store in ``Career
Opportunities.'' She makes herself a little place to sleep and
records all the items she uses in a notebook for future repayment,
though it's unclear whether she also lifted the notebook from a
Wal-Mart shelf.
</P>
<P>
   She gives birth on a Wal-Mart floor after crawling out of Aisle
Five during a storm so monstrous that one expects to see Dorothy,
Toto and that tractor wheel from the ``Twister'' trailer come
crashing through a store window. During the storm, an eccentric
librarian (James Frain) crashes through a store window to help her.
</P>
<P>
   The cynical might say that Wal-Mart would happily extend its
corporate arms for the kind of publicity it gets here, and even the
most kindhearted may be rendered cynical by this movie. There are
more noble poor folks than in all the books of John Steinbeck and
Pearl S. Buck combined, along with a romantic motif that could best
be described as beautiful women, stupid choices.
</P>
<P>
   Novalee's friend Lexie Coop (Ashley Judd), a nurse, is a single
mom with a passel of kids she named after snack foods: Baby Ruth,
Praline, Brownie. No kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Portman's beautiful dark eyes used to shine with a slyness that
is being replaced by earnestness, though in the last ``Star Wars''
picture, one could attribute her stiffness to the fact that she
looked as if she were posing on camera for her action figure, like
everyone else. She seems to take the material for ``Where the Heart
Is,'' with its lump-in-the-throat relentlessness, very seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Williams does, too. He doesn't condescend to the facile
cheapness that Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel lavish on the script
_ based on a novel by Billie Letts _ though they don't stray too
far spiritually from the book, which turned Novalee into a magnet
for misery.
</P>
<P>
   The audience doesn't get credit for being able to track a
character through life without the film's being stuffed with enough
nutty incidents _ a kidnapping, another catastrophic storm _ for an
entire season of television. ( Williams doesn't seem to remember
anything about the way child rearing was depicted on ``Roseanne'';
the single moms here suffer only when the movie falls back on its
incessant need to juice up the plot.)
</P>
<P>
   The film also throws in characters with names like Sister
Husband (Stockard Channing) and Moses Whitecotten (Keith David), a
photographer who encourages Novalee to take up his trade. He also
encourages Novalee to give her baby a strong name, and she responds
with Americus.
</P>
<P>
   How much talent could Moses have? If he really had an eye, he
would shove the traffic-stoppingly hot Novalee and Lexie on a plane
to Manhattan, send them to a modeling agency and skim 10 percent as
a finder's fee. And there's a subplot that follows Willy Jack from
jailhouse loser to minor country star, which gives Joan Cusack, who
plays his Naugahyde-tough manager, a chance to steal a few scenes.
Williams gets to squander one of the best film casts in some time.
</P>
<P>
   If Wal-Mart stocked merchandise this shoddy, the Federal Trade
Commission would shut it down faster than this movie extorts tears
and murmurs of ``Aww . ... '' With its self-conscious poignancy,
though, ``Heart'' is poised to find an audience. &QL;

`SEARCH FOR THE PANCHEN LAMA': SEEKING A MISSING PAWN IN A LOADED
CHESS GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In May 1996, the official Chinese news agency reported joyfully
on the visit of the Panchen Lama, Tibet's second-most revered
religious figure, to the monastery where the Panchen Lama has
traditionally lived. The news agency said that the Tibetans at the
monastery were so happy that they ``sang and danced hand in hand in
the courtyard to express their heartfelt gratitude for the care for
Tibetan Buddhism from the central government and the Communist
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   This report of Tibetan love for the Chinese authorities,
recounted in Isabel Hilton's informative new book on China's
repression of Tibet, would seem to indicate that China remains
capable of inventing reality when the uninvented sort is deemed
unsuitable. The visitor in question was a 6-year-old boy named
Gyaltsen Norbu who in 1995 was chosen by the officially atheistic
Communist Party as the latest reincarnation of the Panchen Lama.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of the young boy was, as Hilton makes clear in ``The
Search for the Panchen Lama,'' a major event in recent Chinese
history, which explains the efforts by China's official media to
depict the whole matter as a cause of singing and dancing by
Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
   The Panchen Lama has been revered by Tibetans for about 300
years. Most important for Tibet's current political fate, he plays
a central role in sanctioning the choice of the most revered
figure, the Dalai Lama, who lives in a kind of celebrated exile as
the embodiment of resistance to Chinese domination. If the Chinese
control the Panchen Lama, Hilton argues, they will control the
choice of the successor to the current Dalai Lama, and thereby
``the future of Tibet and her unique religion.''
</P>
<P>
   In such a way does Hilton explain the stakes in one of the more
bizarre episodes of recent international politics. In 1995, six
years after the death of the 10th Panchen Lama, a group of
traditional Tibetan religious leaders chose a boy named Gedhun
Choekyi Nyima as the 11th Panchen Lama, a choice that was, perhaps
unwisely, announced by the Dalai Lama from his Indian exile. China,
which portrays the Dalai Lama as a renegade and a traitor, rejected
that choice, arresting the Tibetan monks who secretly made it in
collaboration with the Dalai Lama and taking young Gedhun Choekyi
Nyima into custody, from which he has still not emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Chinese engineered a sort of politico-religious charade
in which their candidate was selected instead. The whole incident,
described in intimate detail by Hilton, would seem almost comical _
atheistic Communist bureaucrats talking about miraculous events
surrounding the birth of their preferred boy _ but, of course, the
blatant fakery of China's actions, persuasively exposed in Hilton's
study, are not funny at all.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton, a British journalist who was granted special access to
the Dalai Lama during the entire Panchen crisis, manages to retain
her status as an independent observer of the Tibetan-Chinese
tragedy even while making no secret of her sympathies for Tibet.
She avoids the temptation, to which other writers have succumbed,
of presenting the oppressed Tibetans as living saints untainted by
the usual human vices of greed and mendacity. She depicts
traditional Tibetan society as a feudal theocracy dominated by
large, often wealthy monasteries living off the labor of serfs, and
she makes no secret of her sense that much of current Tibetan lore
is rank superstition. More to the immediate point, her history is
full of religious factionalism, power plays and Tibetan appeals to
outside intervention that make China's recent actions not less
repellent but at least not unique.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton, for example, devotes several chapters to a complex
quarrel between the 13th Dalai Lama and the ninth Panchen Lama
that, during the course of the 1920s and '30s, drew China deeply
into Tibet's religious processes. The ninth Panchen Lama, who spent
the last 14 years of his life in China, tried to promote a Chinese
military expedition to Tibet to enable him to defeat his rivals
there. When the ninth Panchen Lama died in 1937, the search for his
reincarnation evoked just about as much political rivalry as the
more recent choice of the 11th Panchen Lama. That person, the 10th
Panchen Lama, eventually became a fierce and courageous critic of
Chinese actions in Tibet, but when he first arrived in Tibet in
1951, he was accompanied by a large detachment of Chinese troops.
</P>
<P>
   If Hilton's account makes clear the precedents for Chinese
interference in Tibet's religious affairs, she demonstrates also
that the most recent effort to control the selection of the Panchen
Lama is qualitatively different, a threat to almost any semblance
of religious autonomy for Tibet. Hilton's account of the
complicated backgrounds to the current situation is not always
crystal clear; indeed there seems to have been a haste in the
writing of this book that here and there makes the thread difficult
to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Hilton has written a compelling and disturbing account
of a little-understood continuing political struggle, one that pits
the vast material advantage of China over the moral and spiritual
authority of the Dalai Lama. When Hilton comes to the latest battle
over the Panchen Lama, her narrative has the grip of a political
thriller, one involving secret messengers, Chinese spies and double
agents, anguished indecision on the part of the Dalai Lama and a
courageous resistance to Chinese control inside Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Some heroes emerge here, most conspicuously Chadrel Rinpoche,
the head of the Tashilhunpo Monastery in Tibet, who like many monks
stood up to China's threats regarding the Panchen Lama selection.
Chadrel Rinpoche was arrested in 1995 and has not been seen or
heard from since.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton clarifies a great deal about the nature of Tibetan
culture and history and the complexities of Tibet's relationship
with China. Her most graphic passages depict the extraordinary
lengths to which China's authorities were willing to go to make it
seem as if their domination of Tibet was taking place at the behest
of the Tibetans themselves. Her valuable account of this recent
history serves the purpose not of sanctifying the Tibetans but of
telling the truth at a time when the might of China has gone into
an effort to falsify it.

MCI WORLDCOM, NOKIA POST STRONG RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ MCI WorldCom (WCOM:Nasdaq) and Finnish cell phone
maker Nokia (NOK:NYSE), two leaders in wireless communications,
reported strong quarterly earnings Thursday and forecast a robust
year ahead.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom said net income jumped 80 percent to $1.3 billion, or
44 cents a diluted share, from $720 million, or 24 cents a share,
from the first quarter in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The results beat First Call/Thomson Financial's consensus
expectation of 43 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The stock rose 4 1/2, or 11 percent, to 45 3/8 in trading
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The company, based in Clinton, Miss., said profits were
propelled by strong Internet and data services, international
revenues, and declining access and technology costs.
</P>
<P>
   Revenue rose 14 percent to $10 billion from $8.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``On an annualized basis, data, Internet and international
services represent more than $18 billion of annualized revenue
growing at 32 percent,'' Bernard Ebbers, president and chief
executive of WorldCom, said in a statement. ``We are clearly
leading the communications industry into a new era dominated by
data- and Internet-based services.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Nokia said operating profit rose 71 percent to $1.27
billion, while sales rose 69 percent to $6.31 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange-listed shares of the Helsinki,
Finland-based company rose 4 3/4, or 9.16 percent, to 56 5/8.
</P>
<P>
   Jorma Ollila, Nokia chairman and chief executive, said in a
statement that he was confident the company would increase revenue
by at least the previously forecast range of 30 percent to 40
percent, based on current market conditions.

&HT;     BUSH AS NICE GUY? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush's sudden desire to
``restore civility and respect to our national politics'' strikes a
welcome chord after so many years of partisan hostility in the
nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   If only he meant it. But it's a real stretch to believe that he
actually intends to follow his own advice and stop trashing
opponents and distorting their records.
</P>
<P>
   Civility, after all, is a two-way street. But Bush's campaign
has shown no inclination to be polite to political rivals, let
alone play fair in the fights over competing policy positions.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore isn't respectful towards Bush, either,
and both men are practiced at personal insults and low blows. Nor
is Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., any patsy; he gave Bush nearly as
good as he got in their heated primary contest.
</P>
<P>
   It would be nice to think that Bush really would like to lower
the political decibel level. It would also be naove.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is still trying to shake the negative image from the South
Carolina primary of cozying up to the hard right, the source of
some of the nastiest and most intolerant rhetoric in recent years.
Now Bush wants to create the impression that he's a moderate fellow
who can get along with Democrats and independents. He thinks we
have short memories.
</P>
<P>
   Softening his language is a start, but only a start. Bush
deplored ``eight years of excessive partisanship and finger
pointing and eight years of attempts to exploit fear and foster
division.'' His description of Washington's hostile political
climate is accurate. But the deteriorating mood didn't begin eight
years ago with President Clinton. It has gone on longer than that,
but to reach farther back would _ oops _ include his father's
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Bush blamed President Clinton for creating most of
the bitterness. But Bush did concede that ``some in our party have
responded in kind,'' a mild poke at Republican congressional
leaders, who have devoted themselves to discrediting and harassing
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   That was putting it mildly _ but it was as far as Bush could
reasonably be expected to go before a Republican fund-raising
dinner. As it was, his comments were received coolly by the big
givers who had coughed up $21.3 million to dine with him.
</P>
<P>
   If Bush is sincere about nibbling away at the present cycle of
political cynicism, he has his work cut out for him. The distrust
between Bush and Gore as well as between the congressional
Democrats and Republicans is so deeply rooted that neither side is
likely to be the first to be nice, a quality often confused with
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bush included in his so-called outreach speech an attack
on Gore's character, claiming Gore was ``stretching the truth and
exaggerating.'' Was the conciliatory part supposed to be the
absence of the actual word ``liar''?
</P>
<P>
   Gore immediately ``responded in kind'' by attacking Bush for
pandering to selfish big business interests which have issues
before the government. Gore claimed they donated to the Bush
campaign to get favors from their pal that would harm consumers.
Among the biggest donors were insurance giants, the gun lobby,
tobacco companies and the oil and gas industry. Bush's public
policy positions side with all of them.
</P>
<P>
   George W. is picking up a theme of his father, who promised in
his 1989 presidential inaugural address to ``make kinder the face
of the nation and gentler the face of the world.'' Bush senior
added, ``We need compromise; we've had dissension. We need harmony;
we've had a chorus of discordant voices...not each other's ideas
are challenged, but each other's motives.''
</P>
<P>
   This was widely applauded as a signal that Bush would move away
from the divisive, uncompromising conservatism of Ronald Reagan's
years. It set a good tone early in the Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing changed. The ideological struggles went on, as rigid
and intemperate as before.
</P>
<P>
   A tax hike, in fact, is the only issue for which Bush the elder
is remembered for his cooperation with the then-Democratic
Congress. It cost him dearly within his party when he ran for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Bush the son clearly understands that he must persuade voters
who are not Republican that he will be ``president of all the
people,'' as Lyndon Johnson used to say, if he is to win the White
House. To that end, Bush will finally meet with McCain on May 9 to
discuss their differences and try to smooth over their mutual
antagonism. Whatever platitudes they issue in public, their private
session is bound to be uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCain is the GOP's most popular figure with the
independents that Bush is now pursuing. Any groveling would have to
be done by Bush, not McCain.
</P>
<P>
   The vice presidency is in the air, perhaps. And perhaps not. If
it is offered, it will be a measure of how serious Bush takes the
need to moderate his image. Words alone won't do the trick, but
McCain at his side could.

 &HT;    GAY MARCH'S TOP ORGANIZER SHRUGS OFF CRITICISM, FOCUSES ON CAUSE
 &HT;    With GAY-MARCH. For release Saturday, April 29.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid the chaos, Dianne Hardy-Garcia was a
lavender-clad oasis of calm.
</P>
<P>
   Her Palm Pilot was beeping and aides were scurrying in and out
of her cluttered office and tens of thousands of gay and lesbian
activists were descending on the nation's capital for a
mobilization that she is leading and some of her supposed comrades
within the homosexual rights movement were calling for a boycott of
the whole thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to keep my eye on the bigger prize and not get involved
in these little skirmishes,'' said Hardy-Garcia, a Texas lobbyist
turned demonstration director.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Hardy-Garcia, executive director of the Lesbian/Gay
Rights Lobby of Texas, was recruited to direct the Millennium March
on Washington for Equality that will be held this weekend. Almost
from its inception the previous year, this proposed rally of a
million gay and lesbian activists and supporters had been beset by
organizational problems and controversy.
</P>
<P>
   The march was announced by the Human Rights Campaign and the
Metropolitan Community Church, two national organizations,
``without any real community consensus'' from grassroots groups,
said Bill Dobbs, a spokesman for a gay and lesbian coalition
calling for a boycott. ``They alienated many constituencies, ...
replacing democracy and accountability with Hollywood celebrities
and back-room dealing.''
</P>
<P>
   The march's 34-year-old executive director disputed the
criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were some mistakes with the original organizing, but we
all make mistakes,'' she said. ``It's a fallacy to say all previous
marches were decided by some huge democratic process. They
weren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually the powerful groups in New York and California called
for a march and the gay and lesbian activists from the rest of the
country attended, she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you try to organize a big march on this scale, there
is a diversity of opinions on how to do it and why to do it and
when to do it,'' she said. ``What's most important to me is why we
need to march.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy-Garcia was born and reared in San Antonio and educated in
Catholic schools all the way through her graduation from Incarnate
Word College in her home town. It was after college that she
determined that she was a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to where I thought that gay and lesbian people would be
and that was New York City,'' she said. ``I couldn't be a gay
person and live in a closet. ... A lot of gay and lesbian people
flee to urban areas so that we can find acceptance and find some
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Her partner, Mary Anne Messina, moved with her from Texas.
Fourteen years later, they're still together. Both grew up in
conservative Catholic families, so telling relatives ``was tough,''
Hardy-Garcia recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come to realize, as I've gotten older, that I wasn't only
victim of homophobia. My parents were too,'' she said. ``My parents
have always been such good parents. For them to feel that in any
way that they did something wrong or have society tell them that
they did something wrong was very painful for them.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, after a couple of years as a social worker in New York,
Hardy-Garcia returned to Texas for graduate study. While attending
the University of Texas at Austin, she worked for state
representative Elliot Naishtat and was bitten by the political bug.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be crazy enough to say that I fell in love with the Texas
legislature,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She delights at how dozens of disparate interests are fit
together into a political mosaic. Uvalda needs a water bill. Gays
want a hate crime bill. Parents want better schools. Lubbock needs
a new road. Compromise is the only course.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give a little to get a little,'' she said.
``People come together from all walks of life in Texas and have to
pass a budget. ...And there are so many great characters in the
Texas legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   As a gay rights advocate, she believes her background has helped
her appreciate cultural differences and create coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people have said to me, 'Well you've got three strikes
against you. You're a woman. You're brown. And you're gay.' But on
the other hand that was sort of a gift,'' said Hardy-Garcia. ``I'm
able to bridge a lot of communities and feel comfortable in a lot
of communities.''
</P>
<P>
   She is anxious to return to Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to be done here on June 15,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So why march now?
</P>
<P>
   With the fall elections approaching, the gay and lesbian
community must be mobilized into an effective voting bloc, she
said. A national march spawns activists who return to their home
towns with passion for their cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the gay rights movement, we've tended to focus on the two
coasts,'' she said. ``Those of us in the middle of the country need
more resources. I shouldn't have had to leave Texas to feel safe.''
</P>
<P>
   There is civil rights legislation to pass in Congress and state
legislatures, she said. ``I'm sick and tired of telling people I
can't do anything about the fact that they lost their jobs because
they were gay.''
</P>
<P>
   She is frustrated that gay couples are often denied economic
benefits like health insurance that are granted to married
straights. Having lost two friends to AIDS in the past year, she is
outraged about the controversy over funding for HIV research.
</P>
<P>
   For months, critics of the march have been sounding off in the
gay press.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad to say, but this has caused a big rift and in some
ways set us back,'' said Dobbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to criticize. It's harder to do something about
it,'' said Hardy-Garcia. ``I try to be a doer.''

   The Next Thing, After DVD
</P>
<P>
   Now that we're getting acquainted with digital videodisc, or
DVD, have you heard about digital videotape? The abbreviation is
D-VHS, and it is a whole other system. A new device is promised.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, you say, yet another video format. Of the reasons cited,
one is security. This month Victor Co. of Japan Ltd., better known
as JVC, announced that it has developed a copy-protection system
that will allow high-definition movies and television programming
to be released or recorded on digital videotape, or D-VHS, with a
greatly reduced (never say nonexistent) danger of its being
pirated.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, appeals to the movie studios, which would
ultimately like to release their property on the Internet and by
other electronic methods without risk of its being stolen. DVD has
a measure of copy protection, but recently the disc security system
was compromised and proved vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   For the consumer the biggest news is that D-VHS will record.
Furthermore, it will record in high definition, which obviously
would be an advantage when high-definition television becomes
prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   At present DVD players can't record at all, though DVD-R, or DVD
recordable, is coming. ``I'm hearing a year or a year and a half,''
said Dick Kelly, president of Cambridge Associates, a consultant on
video replication matters.
</P>
<P>
   JVC says it will have a D-VHS player-recorder on the market by
the end of the year. The cassette is the same size as standard VHS
but, being digital, it requires a new machine, initially priced

   D-VHS is said to have about the same level of picture clarity as
DVD and about 10 times the storage capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with expanded electronic delivery systems drawing nearer,
will studios commit films to still another packaged-goods format,
especially with DVD enjoying substantial and growing success?
(Eleven million players are expected to be in use by the end of the
year.) Also, with D-VHS retailers might have to carry two cassette
versions of every movie, the D-VHS and the usual VHS tape for
people without D-VHS players. How likely are they to do that?

   NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   Seeing John Malkovich
</P>
<P>
   Other films won the Oscars, but for months a lot of people's
favorite movie has been ``Being John Malkovich,'' Spike Jonze's
film about a puppeteer (John Cusack) who discovers that he and his
wife and anybody else can crawl into a little door in the wall and
take a sloppy slide into the head of the actor.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday the film will be released on tape and disc by USA
Home Entertainment. The screenwriter Charlie Kaufman had the idea
four years ago, but the script sat around until Jonze discovered
it. ``I never thought it would be made, so I went about my
business,'' Kaufman said the other day.
</P>
<P>
   The film has enjoyed repeat audiences of all ages, which is
unusual. ``My sister has seen it several times,'' Kaufman said,
``and whenever she went, there were very old people and very young
people, and everybody was enjoying it sort of equally, which is so
great. I love to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   Fight Club
</P>
<P>
   Mistaken for a simple slugfest by some, David Fincher's film
takes a complicated look at the lure of violence in a regimented,
dehumanized culture. Life erupts for a nameless white-collar worker
(Edward Norton) after he meets the strangely charismatic Tyler
Durden (Brad Pitt), who goads the worker into fighting. Soon
dispossessed young men are brawling and being molded into an
anarchic cadre. Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times that in
his phantasmagorical search for lost masculine authority, Fincher
``finds subject matter audacious enough to suit his lightning-fast
visual sophistication.''

<P>
   After having a stroke, a retired New York policeman named Walt
Koontz (Robert De Niro) is given speech therapy in the form of
singing lessons by his drag-queen neighbor, Rusty (Philip Seymour
Hoffman). All in all, that might make a workable dramatic setup for
De Niro, whose quiet brooding adds dimension to the homophobic
Koontz, and Hoffman, who brings heat to a larger-than-life
performance. But gay stereotypes and recycled cliches do in a
garish, message-laden comedy that ``is so awful it just might put
an end to Hollywood's hypocritical infatuation with men in drag as
symbols of its own supposedly liberated sexual attitudes'' (Stephen
Holden).

   The Red Dwarf
</P>
<P>
   The message here is that in the heart of every man is an angry,
persecuted dwarf and that only when we realize everybody is in the
same fix do we find redemption. Anyway, in a surreal setting, a
dwarf-size law clerk (Jean-Yves Thual) strangles a mountainous diva
(Anita Ekberg) with whom he has been having relations. Later he
joins a circus, receives the unconditional love of a 12-year-old
acrobat and helps the slain diva's husband form a successful clown
act. Although it has plenty of narrative energy, ``what is
glaringly missing in the film is a compelling central performance''
(Holden).

   In a sorry reincarnation of William Castle's 1959 horror film
(which was pretty sorry to begin with), five strangers are offered
$1 million each to spend a night in a spooky mansion. (The original
offer was $10,000, but these days no one would spend five minutes
for that kind of money.) A fire in the 1930s destroyed the Vanacutt
Psychiatric Institute for the Criminally Insane, and now a nasty
theme-park magnate (Geoffrey Rush) wants to have a party with the
chosen five as entertainment. The idea was junk in 1959. ``And it
is still junk.'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).

on a religious connotation as two rural families face their
spiritual differences when their children fall in love. Dreyer's

&HT;     NAVY PLANS IMMEDIATE SHELLING OF VIEQUES  
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Navy warships will immediately fire non-explosive
shells at the target range on the Puerto Rican island of Vieques as
soon as federal authorities remove encamped Puerto Rican
demonstrators, defense officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Three defense officials outlined the Navy's plans for a quick
show of force as a Justice Department-led task force prepared to
end a year-long occupation of the 899-acre target range that has
thwarted Navy training on the range.
</P>
<P>
   The task force, including FBI agents, U.S. Marshals, the Coast
Guard, the Navy and 1,200 Marines, is expected to begin rounding up
protestors early next week, according to a fourth U.S. official who
said he is familiar with coordination planning between law
enforcement agencies on the U.S. mainland and in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
   Navy warships will begin using the 59-year-old range ``as
quickly as possible'' after the law enforcement operation is
complete, said one defense official. A second defense official said
the Navy wants to ``demonstrate use of the range in a prudent
fashion as soon as we can just to get that principle established or
restarted.''
</P>
<P>
   A third defense official said the Navy would ``be in a hurry to
make a statement by using the range.''
</P>
<P>
   The three officials spoke on background on the condition that
their identity not be disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, speaking at a Justice Department
news conference, declined to discuss the impending operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't comment on any prospective, or otherwise considered,
law enforcement action,'' Reno declared.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, a Pentagon spokesman, said the
Pentagon has been in ``consultation with the Puerto Rican
government (and) with the Department of Justice to work out a way
to clear the range of the trespassers,'' adding: ``That process
continues.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jose Serrano, D-N.Y., the senior Puerto Rico-born lawmaker
in Congress, urged Clinton in a letter to halt the plans for a
federal round up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be nice,'' warned Serrano. ``It's not too
late to call the whole thing off.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal raid to break up peaceful civil disobedience on
Vieques would likely be a hot campaign issue for the 900,000 Puerto
Rican voters in New York who could play an influential role in the
outcome of the Senate campaign of first lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, Serrano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happens in Vieques affects greatly the largest Hispanic
voting bloc in New York,'' he said. Many of Puerto Rico's 3.8
million residents _ U.S. citizens by birth _ have relatives living
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The removal of the protestors is designed to clear the way for
implementation of an agreement reached by President Clinton and
Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello on Jan. 31 to end a bitter standoff
between the Navy and the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of protestors, led by Puerto Rico Sen. Ruben Berrios, the
Puerto Rico Independence Party's candidate for governor in
November, occupied the beach-front bombing range after a Marine
bombing mishap in April 1999 killed a Puerto Rican security guard
working for the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   The occupation of the target range prevented the Navy and Marine
Corps from conducting the final air, land and sea combat rehearsals
on Vieques that have prepared every departing Atlantic-based combat
force since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton-Rossello agreement calls for the White House and
Congress to provide $40 million in immediate economic development
assistance to the 9,300 residents of Vieques and reduce noisy
military training on Navy-owned land to 90 days a year using only
non-explosive shells and bombs. The accord also calls for the
island's residents to vote in a binding referendum on future Navy
use of the island by February, 2002, with $50 million in additional
U.S. assistance due to Vieques if the residents vote to permit
combat training with explosive ordnance.
</P>
<P>
   The forcible removal of protestors is expected to take place
barely 10 days after a Justice Department-led operation broke into
a Miami home to take custody of 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez and
return him to his Cuban father.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy is poised to resume using the range. Four warships
armed with 5-inch guns with ranges of 15 miles will be in the
region in coming days as part of a combat exercise with the
aircraft carrier USS George Washington and a Marine amphibious task
force. The armada is scheduled for deployment in June to the
Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   Navy Secretary Richard Danzig told Congress in testimony on
March 22 that the Navy is eager for ``the resumption of the use of
the range and establishing the rhythms of cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown of the target range since April 1999 forced the
battle fleet led by the aircraft carrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower
to sail for duty in the Mediterranean and Persian Gulf in late
February with five of the eight escorting surface warships still
needing to requalify for their naval gunfire support mission by
firing roughly 100 shells of 5-inch ammunition at shore targets.
The ships broke away from the fleet in transit to requalify at
ranges at Cape Wrath, Scotland, or Capoteulado, Sardinia.

 DOWN-HOME `WHERE THE HEART IS' HARD TO RESIST
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B-  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Deserted by her no-good boyfriend at an Oklahoma Wal-Mart,
Novalee Nation has just $7 in her pocket and a baby on the way in
``Where the Heart Is.''
</P>
<P>
   Natalie Portman's Novalee secretly moves into the store, hiding
in the restroom as the store closes, sleeping in the camping supply
section at night. When her baby is born there, she gets her 15
minutes of fame, followed by a full-time job from the kindly
Wal-Mart folks and a place to live with a saintly woman (Stockard
Channing).
</P>
<P>
   The movie traces her life over the next five years as she finds
a rewarding career and learns something about the nature of true
love.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the film chronicles the parallel story of her
rat of a boyfriend, Willy Jack Pickens (Dylan Bruno). He spends
some time in jail before hooking up with a hard-nosed country music
agent (Joan Cusack) and beginning to rise as a songwriter-singer.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a brief appearance by Sally Field as Novalee's
long-missing floozy of a mother who drops into her life again after
her Wal-Mart baby fame; and a larger one from Ashley Judd as
Novalee's best friend, a good-hearted hospital worker and mother of
five who keeps meeting the wrong men.
</P>
<P>
   In no way is this a serious movie. The southern milieu is as
phony as an episode of ``Green Acres,'' the script (by the prolific
team of Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel) is as fast and slick as a
Nike commercial.
</P>
<P>
   Portman _ the Natalie Wood of the new millennium _ is some kind
of wonderful, but just too super-model gorgeous to be credible.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's hard to resist. With director Matt Williams throwing
in a dandy special-effects tornado, a tear-jerking tragedy of some
kind in every reel, and constant threats from fiendish child
molesters and crazed religious fanatics, it plays like a downhome
version of the old Connie Stevens romance-weepie, ``Susan Slade.''
</P>
<P>
   Where the Heart Is. Directed by Matt Williams. Screenplay by
Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel. Cast: Natalie Portman, Ashley Judd,
Stockard Channing, Dylan Bruno, Joan Cusack. 20th Century-Fox. 120
minutes. Rated PG-13 for sexual references and some violence.

SLEEPWALKING TO DREAMY RHYTHMS IN SUMPTUOUS RIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bruno Barreto dedicates ``Bossa Nova'' to Antonio Carlos Jobim
and Francois Truffaut. He is out to create a film that has a
similar becalmed magic, the subtleties of rhythm that pull you
slowly but deftly into Jobim's music and Truffaut's films.
</P>
<P>
   But Barreto's film is too wan to achieve a rhythm. This
anonymous romantic farce may leave you exhausted, if only because
your toes and knees have been bouncing along to the friendly bossa
nova grooves of the songs selected for the soundtrack. It includes
one of those world music tunes from Sting (who performs ``How
Insensitive,'' a Jobim song), who apparently has a contractual
obligation to include one such song on each of his albums.
</P>
<P>
   There must be a name for a picture so inconsequential, in which
the music provides so much of the chemistry that you get the
feeling ``Bossa Nova'' would be funereal without it. The picture
seems to be lacking a regular pulse as it is.
</P>
<P>
   It's great to look at, with the vivid colors of the Brazilian
countryside captured by Pascal Rabaud's alluring cinematography.
But when that's all a movie has to offer _ and these days, what
film doesn't look good? _ it means the visuals take on a life of
their own instead of blending into the whole. In other words, why
not just play a Jobim CD while watching a Truffaut film on video?
</P>
<P>
   What you're waiting for is the love connection between the two
principals, which begins to take on a grim inevitability. Amy
Irving, who looks as if she's using a rather heavy astringent,
plays Mary Ann, an American living in Brazil. Antonio Fagundes is
Pedro Paulo, a suave lawyer whose wife, as they used to say in the
opening of ``The Odd Couple,'' has kicked him out, asking that he
never return, since she's living with another man.
</P>
<P>
   And when a romantic comedy has you idly reminiscing about Jack
Klugman and Tony Randall _ when even Brazil's seductive landscapes
and music can't hold your attention _ it's time to start eyeing the
exits or longing for the intrusive trill of a cell phone.
</P>
<P>
   An airline pilot's widow, Mary Ann takes a swim every day and
communes with his spirit in the soothing blue coastal water. To
support herself, she teaches English to a motley group of
Brazilians, including Acacio (Alexandre Borges, who looks like a
Latin John Cusack), a revved-up soccer star who is more physically
interested in Mary Ann than in polishing up his rudimentary English
so that he can understand the contract that's going to take him to
London.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann wanders through Brazil in a daze, though not so much of
one that she can't slip into a tight-fitting Campari-colored dress.
That's what she's wearing when Pedro Paulo sees her for the first
time. It seems that through being a dish comes healing for Mary
Ann.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bossa Nova'' has a few sophisticated moments. Pedro Paulo's
father (Alberto de Mendoza), who seems to be only a couple of years
older than his son, is a master tailor. And when a smitten Pedro
Paulo stands behind Mary Ann in an elevator, he surreptitiously
uses his hand to measure her without touching, so he can make her a
blouse with the tailoring skills he learned from his dad.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly the movie sleepwalks through the empty hectic farce
complications. Pedro Paulo's shy younger half-brother (Pedro
Cardoso) falls in love with Sharon (Giovanna Antonelli), the
ambitious and cute-as-a-bug legal intern who has also been pursued
by Acacio.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann's friend Nadine (Drica Moraes) is conducting an e-mail
romance with a man who says he is a strapping downtown Manhattan
artist with a ponytail. (Judging from this description, one guesses
that his e-mails have been trapped in a time warp since 1987.)
</P>
<P>
   In explaining the difference between Brazil and Colombia or
Venezuela, Pedro Paulo proudly tells a friend that ``they invented
mambo; we invented bossa nova.'' Lines like that make this movie
seem the product of a frustrated tourist out to blame the bossa
nova. &QL;

 &HT;    Stuggling TV shows and how to fix them
 &HT;    Palm Beach Post TV reporter Kevin D. Thompson's offers these
prescriptions for
 &HT;    ailing TV shows
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH Fla. _ You can handle traffic tie-ups.
Insensitive bosses. Nosy neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you cope when your favorite TV show is no longer the
rare gem it used to be?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it's bound to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Think of your favorite show. OK, now, try to imagine that show
five years from now. Will it be just as good? Probably not. Few
shows can consistently churn out quality episodes. It's not a
pretty sight when a fine TV series gets creaky and predictable.
</P>
<P>
   With the start of May sweeps, I figured now would be a great
time to analyze five once-good programs. I'll tell you what made
them good, what went wrong and, most important, how they can be
fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Ally McBeal
</P>
<P>
   Mondays, 9 p.m., Fox
</P>
<P>
   _ What was good about it: Three words _ Ally, Billy, Georgia.
That thorny love triangle was the show's core. ``Ally'' was also a
refreshing series with a distinctive point of view. There was no
other series like it on television. You were crying one minute
(remember Jennifer Holiday's touching performance as a jilted
lover?) and falling down laughing the next.
</P>
<P>
   _ What went wrong: Hmmm ... How much time do you have? The cases
got strange (women who turned orange!), and the characters got even
stranger (Billy's macho posturing; a forever horny Elaine turning
down sex; any scene with the goofy Cage). The series stopped being
poignant and tender. ``Ally McBeal'' is now better suited for The
Cartoon Network than Fox.
</P>
<P>
   _ How I'd fix it: Ditch the kooky humor. We never need to see
Cage's nose whistling in court again. I'm getting sick of Al Green
and Barry White, too. Keep Billy's ghost around. Since he's dead
and no longer a blond-haired creep, his scenes with Ally are
achingly sweet and moving. Continue adding new cast members _ but
the jury's still out on teeth-obsessed Mark. Most important, get
back to telling heartfelt relationship stories.
</P>
<P>
   ER
</P>
<P>
   Thursdays, 10 p.m., NBC
</P>
<P>
   _ What was good about it: The fast-paced action, rapid-fire
dialogue and compelling cases put us in the operating room with
those heroic doctors. It was exhausting, yet totally exhilarating.
Such fleshed-out characters as the naive Carter, somber Benton,
suicidal Hathaway, hot-tempered Ross and down-to-earth Greene made
for one of TV's best dramatic ensembles _ ever.
</P>
<P>
   _ What went wrong: Familiarity may breed contempt, but in
``ER'''s case, it resulted in boredom. Maybe we got to know these
characters too well. The medical stories also have a been-there,
done-that feel. Misguided plots (Benton's affair with Corday;
Carter's infatuation with Lucy) helped put ``ER'' in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
   _ How I'd fix it: Trim the cast size _ STAT! ``ER'' has an
amazing 12 characters. That's not a TV show _ it's a football team!
You can easily lose half the cast, and no one would notice. You
don't miss Lucy, right? Start with the annoying Dr. Dave. Cocky is
not lovable. Cleo can go, too. She just seems to be around as
Benton's love interest. Let Weaver and Romano go at it more often _
they sizzle together. Break up TV's most boring couple: Greene and
Corday. Their parents are more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   NYPD Blue
</P>
<P>
   Tuesdays, 10 p.m., ABC
</P>
<P>
   _ What was good about it: ``NYPD Blue'' ushered in a new breed
of cop show. Quick edits. Jittery camera movements. Raw,
in-your-face situations we've never seen on TV. Add to that a
terrific Dennis Franz and a smoldering David Caruso and you had the
makings of a hit. ``Blue'' told stories with edge and attitude. It
tackled sensitive race-related issues with sheer intensity and
gritty realism.
</P>
<P>
   _ What went wrong: Cop dramas are tough to keep fresh. After
all, how many baby-found-in-a-dumpster stories can you tell? What
was riveting in season one is just plain stale today. This year's
mundane plots include: a home invasion robbery of an elderly
couple, stolen artwork, and a woman killed by her husband.
Zzzzzzzzzzz. It also doesn't help that ``Blue'' is no longer the
pink elephant it used to be. Today, just about every cop show rips
off ``Blue'''s signature style.
</P>
<P>
   _ How I'd fix it: Add a new detective every other season. Just
when I'm about to give up on ``Blue,'' a new character jump-starts
this tired series. Jimmy Smits did it. Rick Schroder, too. So has
Henry Simmons. As the barrel-chested Baldwin Jones, Simmons demands
your attention whenever he's on screen. He can slap around low-life
skels with the best of 'em. Make sure Simmons gets major face time.
Also, show more of Sipowicz's vulnerable side. Scenes with his kid
work. So do awkward dates. Watching a scowling Sipowicz is now a
major chore. And someone, please give these maddeningly routine
cases a twist. My 5 1/2-year-old daughter can solve these crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Providence
</P>
<P>
   Fridays, 8 p.m., NBC
</P>
<P>
   _ What was good about it: In a TV landscape littered with silly
sitcoms and cookie-cutter dramas, ``Providence'' was like a breath
of fresh air. It was a sappy, feel-good family drama that pretended
to be nothing more than what it was _ a sappy, feel-good drama. As
a thriving plastic surgeon who chucks her career to move back home
with her family, Melina Kanakaredes is a bona-fide TV star. The
smile! The hair! The smile!
</P>
<P>
   _ What went wrong: Sappy can't last forever. Stories are now too
predictable. Hey, did you really think Joanie (does she have the
biggest eyes on TV, or what?) wasn't going to get her baby when she
was trapped alone under a fallen tree? Of course you didn't. These
characters started out cute and lovable, but now most of them are
downright grating.
</P>
<P>
   Dog Boy is at the top of the list. Pet-loving dad runs a close
second. Watching him prowl the streets for a blind basset hound in
a storm was cute, but dad's a tad too much in love with animals.
Don't be surprised to see him necking on the couch with a pooch in
a sweeps episode.
</P>
<P>
   _ How I'd fix it: Syd needs to start dating _ now. Giving this
fine doctor a love life would only make her _ and the show _ more
appealing. She did have a crush on a 19-year-old Russian art
prodigy.
</P>
<P>
   What happened? The guy had a brain tumor. Also, pink-slip Dog
Boy and ditzy Heather. Finally, let Syd suffer a major setback at
the clinic. No doctor can cure everyone, can she?
</P>
<P>
   Dawson's Creek
</P>
<P>
   Wednesdays, 8 p.m., WB
</P>
<P>
   _ What was good about it: Originally pegged as an over-sexed,
silly teen soap, ``Dawson's Creek'' was actually a wonderfully
acted series that beautifully mirrored the teen-angst experience.
Stories about failing to fit in, homosexuality and coping with
mental illness were often handled with care and intelligence. A
standout episode was the one in which a driven-to-be-perfect Andie
admitted she had cheated on a high school exam. Fine acting turns
by Katie Holmes as tomboyish Joey, Joshua Jackson as wisecracking
Pacey and Kerr Smith as sensitive Jack also made ``Dawson's Creek''
worth watching.
</P>
<P>
   _ What went wrong: Kevin Williamson left. ``Dawson's Creek''
suffered a major blow when Williamson, the show's creator and
driving force, bailed to concentrate on his new baby: ABC's
``Wasteland.'' For months, several writers attempted to capture
Williamson's distinctive voice. The result? The show felt lost _
and so did I.
</P>
<P>
   _ How I'd fix it: Make Pacey the star. That might be tough,
though, since Dawson's name is in the title. But Pacey has always
been the more interesting character. I still remember when he spit
on an obnoxious teacher. I'd let boring Dawson lose his virginity
in a ``very special'' two-part episode. And I'd make sure he lost
it with Eve _ the mysterious hottie Dawson wrecked his dad's boat
with. Get Pacey and Joey together ... finally! They're becoming the
new Niles and Daphne.

   AIRFOOD _Food is an issue as Delta negotiates a new deal with

   COMPAQ _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Michael Capellas presides over the
Houston computer maker's first annual meeting since he took over
day to day control of the company nine months ago. He'll likely be
asked by shareholders why the company's stock is stuck around $25 a

&HT;     DOW CHEMICAL TO HELP NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION PROMOTE
SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Dow Chemical Co. announced Thursday it will
help fund a National Science Foundation program to bring famous
scientists to middle schools nationwide and to alert Congress about
science issues.
</P>
<P>
   Dow said its $600,000 grant to the science foundation would help
bring more than 240 award-winning scientists into schools around
the country in the coming year. Dow has also made a $100,000 grant
to Dartmouth College in Hanover, N.H., for a conference this July
where leaders from academia, industry and government will meet for
five days and draft recommendations to Congress and other
government agencies on science and technology policy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We view science and technology as a means by which we can
contribute to society,'' said Rick Gross, vice president for
research and development at Dow, at a news conference here. ``Dow
is investing in the future of science and technology, a future that
will increasingly require science literacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made by Gross and officials from Dartmouth
and the foundation, which is a federal agency that funds science
and engineering research and education.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation is sponsoring the programs in celebration of its
50th year. It also announced the launch of a web site,
www.nsfoutreach.org, to demonstrate the foundation's role in aiding
innovations and discoveries such as Internet browsers, Doppler
radar and fiber optics.
</P>
<P>
   The web site is meant ``to demonstrate how findings of basic
science and engineering and technology have helped bring (important
innovations) to fruition,'' said foundation spokesman Bill Line in
an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hopes it will ``let the American public know this is
what their tax dollars are helping to produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Middle schools in at least 37 states will receive visits from
individual scientists and engineers, who will contact school
administrators to arrange meetings. Line said the foundation hopes
to have scientists visit schools in all 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   The schools will include public and private institutions, and
there will be no particular curriculum. Line said the foundation
hopes the scientists will provide anecdotes about the reasons they
became interested in science to encourage the interest of the
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an effort by scientists and engineers to go into
schools to focus attention on science and technology and
engineering . . . as a possible career choice,'' Line said.

COLLOQUIES ON THE FINER POINTS OF DROOLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Production notes are at end of review)

   Article 8 of the Vow of Chastity promulgated in 1995 by the
Danish film movement, Dogma, says, ``Genre movies are not
acceptable.'' One of the two Dogma films currently showing in this
country, Soren Kragh-Jacobsen's ``Mifune,'' could be accused of
flouting this rule, since it uses the movement's austere principles
_ hand-held cameras, available light, no dubbed sound, no props _
to produce what is essentially a romantic comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lars von Trier, one of Dogma's founders, has used these
techniques to produce a two-hour, semi-pornographic Mentos
commercial. In case you haven't seen them, these ads, produced in
not-quite-English by a European agency, feature impish, appealing
Nordic young people whose love of a certain chewy candy induces
them to perform pointless actions that scandalize and amuse snooty
old ladies, uptight yuppies and other guardians of social
propriety.
</P>
<P>
   Each clip ends with the semi-nonsensical tag line ``Mentos: the
fresh maker,'' an epithet that might be applied to von Trier, who
has, with missionary zeal, devoted his talents to ridding world
cinema of stale aesthetic conventions.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he has succeeded is a matter to be debated elsewhere.
His earlier films ``Zentropa'' (which trafficked in the kind of
arty illusionism he would later renounce) and ``Breaking the
Waves'' have been widely and extravagantly praised, and each one
depends on a provocative moral premise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zentropa'' suggests that Germany's problem after World War II
was that ``nobody had been very nice to it for a long time,'' and
``Breaking the Waves'' portrays a woman's willing submission to
utter sexual degradation as an act of transcendent spiritual
import.
</P>
<P>
   Even if one concludes that these ideas are meretricious and
repellent, the films that advance them are intellectually and
formally rigorous enough to make them seem worth thinking about.
Unfortunately ``The Idiots,'' shot in smeary, hand-held digital
video, has nothing on its mind besides the squirming discomfort of
its audience, the achievement of which it holds up as a brave
political accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Its heroes are a group of mischievous, good-looking young
Nordics dedicated to a pastime the subtitles render as
``spassing,'' which means going into public places and behaving
like mentally disabled people. They do this in the time-honored
bohemian tradition of shocking middle-class sensibilities and to
affirm the naturalness and dignity of mental disability.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being an idiot is a luxury and a way forward,'' explains
Stoffer (Jens Albinus), their unofficial leader and chief
theoretician. ``Idiots are the people of the future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the service of this utopian vision, Stoffer and his comrades,
who occupy a lovely suburban estate owned by Stoffer's bourgeois
uncle, visit a factory, a public swimming pool and a biker bar,
where they drool, twitch and hobble around in theatrical defiance
of middle-class values. Then they come home for candlelight
self-criticism sessions, angry debates on the finer points of
idiotology and a writhing orgy.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of these activities, they reveal bits and pieces
of their lives. One has gone AWOL from his wife and child and from
a job in an advertising agency, another may be suffering from a
real mental disorder; another is a doctor. And hovering at the
margins, skeptical of the ethics of spassing but grateful for the
sustaining community the idiots offer, is Karen (Bodil Jorgensen),
who carries around a sense of hurt the source of which is only
revealed in the movie's last scene, during which the film descends
to truly contemptible emotional brutality.
</P>
<P>
   It is also contemptible that ``The Idiots,'' which was shown two
years ago at the Cannes Film Festival and has been released
throughout Europe, is being shown in the United States in a
compromised and censored version, with solid black squares
superimposed over body parts whose display would have earned the
film an NC-17 rating.
</P>
<P>
   The point is not that American audiences need to see genitals,
but that they deserve to see movies as filmmakers intended. It's
hard to say what's more idiotic: a director who treats his audience
like uptight prigs in need of a gratuitous shock, or an industry
organization that treats filmgoers like children.

DON'T OVERLOOK THESE SMALL GEMS WHEN SEEKING OUT HISTORIC HOTELS
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies TEXAS-OLD HOTELS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICIA RODRIGUEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Years ago, nearly every Texas town of any size had a hotel _
partly because the state was so large that those traveling across
it needed many places to stop for the night. And many of those
smaller lodgings have been supported and preserved by Texans over
the years, particularly during the past decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a resurgent interest in our older hotels, and
I think that's because of the great increase in heritage tourism,''
says Carter Schildknecht, president of Historic and Hospitality
Accommodations of Texas, or HAT.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you walk into one of these historic hotels, you get a
feel for where you are. It's just the fact that you can see what it
looked like back then, and you get a sense of how people lived.''
</P>
<P>
   HAT counts as members a number of small inns, hotels and
bed-and-breakfasts that are housed in buildings built as hotels
more than 100 years ago. Some of our favorites from Schildknecht's
list:
</P>
<P>
   BOERNE: Ye Kendall Inn. A residence when built in 1859, it
became the Boerne Hotel when wings were added in 1878. It was a
stagecoach inn during the 1880s. (830) 249-2138;
www.yekendallinn.com
</P>
<P>
   CASTROVILLE: Landmark Inn. Dating to 1849, it became the Vance
Hotel during the 1870s. It was rechristened the Landmark Inn during
the 1940s after a restoration. Now part of the state park system,
the 2-story inn, surrounded by wildflowers, operates as kind of a
living, working museum. (830) 931-2133; www.tpwd.state.tx.us
</P>
<P>
   COMFORT: The Meyer B&AMP;B on Cypress Creek. The 2-story frame
building dates to 1872, when it was built to accommodate railroad
passengers. It replaced an older building that had hosted
stagecoach riders from 1862 to 1872. (830) 995-2304
</P>
<P>
   D'HANIS: J.M. Koch Hotel. Nearly 100 years old, this old
railroad hotel was renovated and reopened about two years ago and
now is a five-guestroom bed-and-breakfast. (830) 363-7500;
www.texassleepaways.com/jmkoch
</P>
<P>
   FORT DAVIS: Indian Lodge. The original part of this lodge,
located in Davis Mountains State Park and owned by the state park
system, was built by the Civilian Conservation Corps. It was
modeled after Southwestern Indian pueblos, with adobe walls more
than 18 inches thick. (915) 426-3254; www.tpwd.state.tx.us
</P>
<P>
   FORT DAVIS: The Veranda. Starting out as the Lempert Hotel in
1883, this adobe inn has been used continuously as a public
lodging, making it the oldest such inn west of the Pecos. (888)
383-2847; www.theveranda.com
</P>
<P>
   GLEN ROSE: Inn on the River. Set on the banks of the Paluxy
River, this inn was once a resort spa known as Dr. Snyder's
Drugless Health Sanatarium, where guests came to take restorative
waters. Today, it's a restored 22-room inn with a restaurant
serving three-course gourmet dinners. (254) 897-2929;
www.innontheriver.com
</P>
<P>
   MADISONVILLE: The Woodbine Hotel. This hotel, consisting of two
``kit houses'' (probably from Sears, Roebuck) joined by an upstairs
and downstairs parlor, was built in 1904. It changed hands several
times before reopening as a bed-and-breakfast, with full
restaurant, last fall. (409) 348-3333; www.woodbinehoteltexas.com
</P>
<P>
   NEW BRAUNFELS: Prince Solms Inn. Originally named the Comal
Hotel, for the river that runs through town, the brick-and-stone
hotel dates to 1889, when it was built by a German craftsman. Many
antique-filled rooms are named for their decorative, old-fashioned
wallpaper. (830) 625-9169; www.princesolmsinn.com
</P>
<P>
   PORT ISABEL: The Historic Queen Isabel Inn. The oldest seaside
resort in the Valley, the Queen Isabel was built at the turn of the
century as an exclusive hunting and fishing resort, located on the
Laguna Madre Bay. (956) 943-1468; www.queenisabelinn.com
</P>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO: The Fairmount Hotel. A small but lovely hotel
dating to 1906, The Fairmount made history in 1985 when the whole
thing was moved six blocks, through downtown San Antonio, to its
current location. Moving the 42-foot-tall building took six days
and involved crossing the River Walk. (210) 224-8800;

VIETNAM TODAY: KENT STATE KEEPS ITS MEMORIES OF VIETNAM ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This is one in a series of articles marking 25 years since
the end of the Vietnam War.) 
(See also VIETNAM-WESTPOINT) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KENT, Ohio _ The sense of history's turning is strong this
spring here at Kent State University as a campus meadow of 58,175
carefully planted daffodils bursts to life once more in memory of
America's body count in the convulsive war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   The power of that memory is at a definitive point for the
nation. For it was a generation ago _ 25 years _ that the war was
brought to an inglorious end, its meaning left to the encroaching
forces of history.
</P>
<P>
   And it was 30 years ago that the home front of that war _ the
running confrontation between government authority and popular
resistance _ was made shockingly clear as civilian casualties fell
here on this prototypical American campus. National Guardsmen,
confronting students in one of the countless protest pavanes of
that time, unexpectedly wheeled and opened fire down a hillside,
killing four students and wounding nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings back this flood of memories that stay very real,''
said Laura L. Davis, a freshman at the time who cowered in
witnessing that 13-second, 61-shot volley and still tries to come
to terms with its meaning as an English professor and assistant
dean at Kent State.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson from it that I tried to teach was to emphasize the
power of language, how people are manipulated through language, and
how to see through the language to reality,'' she said, recalling
the furious debate over patriotism and free speech between
government officials and student protesters that spilled over into
blood back in that fast-fading time.
</P>
<P>
   Across campus, her 20-year-old son, Jesse Clapper, a sophomore
at the university, looks back upon the Vietnam era with none of his
mother's sense of immediacy and, in fact, with a vagueness that
many students readily admit to.
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation doesn't have a strong understanding of that
era,'' he said. ``The Vietnam time really isn't a big topic of
conversation around here,'' Jesse Clapper said, even as the
university prepared a memorial conference on freedom of expression
and students readied their annual all-night vigil to mark the May 4
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never once till college did I get past World War II in
history,'' Clapper said. ``That's ridiculous. I mean, it's
important to be able to look back and see how, if people band
together, change can occur, to see how ultimately the students of
that day won.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, as anywhere else in the nation, there are multifarious
answers to the question of what the lingering lessons of Vietnam
are. Older teachers emphasize the dangers of government hubris in
enlarging a disastrously unpopular war. Students with fresh campus
causes are clearly becoming fascinated by the era's lessons in the
power of organized protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It still seems inconceivable,'' David Halberstam, the former
Vietnam War correspondent, said recently of soldiers actually
marching here to cut down American students. He presented a richly
detailed review of the era to an attentive crowd of young and old
here in a memorial address, doggedly recalling that bloody past to
penetrate ``the inexplicable quality of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Canfora, a 51-year-old veteran of a category of Americana
once known as ``campus radical,'' is one of the Kent State
casualties. He was shot that May 4 as he brazenly stepped forward
to wave a black flag of anti-war protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a good number of students nowadays that are still very
active across this country in the student movement, and they want
to learn the lessons of the antiwar movement in the '60s,'' said
Canfora, who belonged to the militant Students for a Democratic
Society. Now, he is a bullet-scarred, discreetly ponytailed alumnus
who never really left the campus. He founded the Kent May 4 Center,
a private information outlet (www.may4.org) on the shootings, the
war and its escalation when President Nixon began the bombing of
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   That was an event that ignited Kent State and countless other
protest sites in spring 1970. The ROTC building was torched here on
campus. Nixon rallied his supporters nationally by denouncing
campus ``bums.'' And the Ohio state government sent in the National
Guard with battlefield gear and live ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The events of the war protest, Canfora finds, are being
consulted increasingly by a dedicated, if relatively unnoticed
minority of concerned students. They lack a singular rallying cause
but have a portfolio of protest issues, from global trade to
capital punishment, from literacy to animal rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority we're hearing from are from middle school,
high school and college,'' said Canfora. He noted that the teachers
and parents with influence over those students are from the
baby-boom generation who, before their power ebbs, are trying to
pass on eye-witness lessons.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Thus here, as on many campuses, the Vietnam era has gradually
become an elective, often driven by faculty members who lived
through the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we leave, who's going to do it?'' asked Gayle L.
Ormiston, who witnessed the shootings while a student and is now
chairman of the philosophy department. ``But these days there's a
great emphasis from students demanding to know the relevancy'' of
Vietnam to their career hopes, he said. He worries that, a
generation after the war, universities are more than ever job
hatcheries rather than sanctuaries for studying history's lessons.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For decades, two professors who witnessed the shootings, Jerry
M. Lewis, a sociologist, and Thomas R. Hensley, a political
scientist, have made a meticulous, passionate academic specialty of
the subject as a focal point on the Vietnam era. Dozens of students
recently took notes in room 224 at Bowman Hall as Lewis lectured on
what has come to be known as the ``Pieta'' photo _ _ the memorable
photograph of a young woman keening with upraised hands as she
knelt by a mortally wounded campus victim.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not talking about Beirut or Berlin; we're talking about
200 yards from here,'' he declared as the class looked back upon
one of that time's definitive images. In the back of the room, Sean
Wheeler, 22, explained that his war curiosity had little to do with
student activism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a relevant event, not only because of the war but
also because kids my age are interested in that period for the
surrounding culture in terms of music and film,'' he said. ``That's
where we get our information _ like Jimi Hendrix playing the
national anthem at Woodstock. But I don't think you can really
understand it unless you were there.''

</P>
<P>
   Across the years, it has been a small group of students, far
more than the university administration, who have forced some
candid remembrance of the May 4 shootings and their historic
context of Vietnam protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been a pain in the university's side,'' Jeffery
Ritter, a 21-year-old senior majoring in public relations, said
proudly as a leader of the May 4 Task Force. This is a student
group, decades old, with freshman members taught about the Vietnam
era and the dynamics of protest by departing seniors.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the task force organized demonstrations and succeeded
in having parking lot sites near the places where the four students
were killed cordoned off with plaques and memorial lanterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If those children hadn't applied pressure nothing would have
happened,'' said Doris Krause, whose daughter, Allison, was one of
those four students. ``It would have been well forgotten, but those
children had a cause and were seeking justice,'' she added,
describing the task force's willingness to protest as the ultimate
memorial in this time of more passive campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Critics rate the university administration's history as spotty
on the issue. Officials enraged much of the campus to large-scale
protest in 1977 when a new gym was built on some of the land where
the shootings occurred. In 1990, after long controversy, the
university finally built a formal hillside memorial with four
pylons representing the victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still some mixed feelings about the events back then
and the university's role within world history,'' said the
university president, Carol A. Cartwright, who feels the passage of
time finally is allowing a more scholarly approach to this
commemoration. ``I want people to begin to turn their eyes
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   This spring, visitors who look beyond the daffodils can notice
one telling sign of change, the return of the full ``Kent State''
to campus building logos, a title that was expunged after the
shootings. A simpler declaration of ``KENT'' had been attempted
across the 30 years. But now the familiar title is being restored,
as if the university were more fully coming to terms with its own
dark tableau in the history of the Vietnam War.

&HT;     RENO SAYS `FORCE' WAS NEEDED TO SEIZE CUBAN BOY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Thursday defended
the government's ``show of force'' in seizing Elian Gonzalez,
saying the possibility of resistance from the boy's relatives and
their supporters in Miami made it necessary for her to end talks
and order the armed raid.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a federal appeals court in Atlanta denied a request
by the Miami relatives to visit the boy, accepting instead the
government's offer of regular reports from a psychiatrist and a
social worker.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected a series of
requests from the 6-year-old boy's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez,
whose family cared for Elian for five months until federal agents
returned him to his father on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Florida relatives had asked the court, which is
now weighing whether to reinstate a claim of political asylum they
filed on Elian's behalf, for a series of orders giving them access
to Elian, who is staying with his father, stepmother and half
brother at a retreat in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials, who had opposed the relatives'
moves, did not immediately comment.
</P>
<P>
   During her weekly news conference on Thursday, Reno said the
pre-dawn hours of Saturday were ``the most appropriate time with
the least crowd'' for federal agents to conduct the raid. ``This
appeared to be the safest time possible to effect the transfer,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at everything that we could do to make sure that it
was done safely and yet with the least impact on Elian,'' she said
of the government's seizure of the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Top Republicans in Congress have accused the attorney general of
using excessive force to take custody of Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's raid of the home of Lazaro Gonzalez home followed
overnight negotiations with Miami intermediaries who were in
telephone contact with Reno in Washington. The attorney general
said threats from the family forced her to end the talks and order
an armed raid.
</P>
<P>
   Reno indicated the family at first promised not to resist the
removal of Elian, but they ``then started talking in the last days
about, `You're going to have to use force to take the child.'''
</P>
<P>
   She added that sending a small group of unarmed agents to the
house to retrieve the boy ``almost certainly'' would have failed
and that it would have tipped off the community that another,
larger group of government agents would be coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the situation where, if we did not go (in force),
people were sure to find out that we were prepared to go, and the
crowd would gather and keep a vigil and make it more difficult in
the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said the agents knocked twice, waiting 30 seconds, before
breaking through the front door, which was blocked by a couch.
</P>
<P>
   She said people outside the Miami home ``tried to throw ropes
around the agents as they came up to the house.'' However, a
Justice official later said what appeared to be rope to the agents
may have been cable belonging to a television cameraman who raced
into the house before the agents, but tripped as his cable got
caught in the door.
</P>
<P>
   Once inside, she said, the agents followed procedure by using a
display of overwhelming force to prevent the family from attempting
anything that could put them or the agents in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the agents had to be in force,'' she said. ``Elian
was being held by this person, and there had to be a show of force,
not a use of force, to show that we were in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the surprise raid, Reno said she believed Elian would
not hold any permanent emotional scars from the night.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, she said, ``has had a lot of bad luck along the way. He's
still resilient, he's still strong, he's still a smiling little
boy.''
</P>
<P>
   The boy was one of three survivors of a shipwreck in which his
mother, her boyfriend and nine others drowned when their boat sank
as they were trying to flee Cuba for the United States last
November.

</P>
<P>
   Justice officials said the Elian Gonzalez case, including the
raid, had cost more than $578,000 from Thanksgiving Day, when Elian
was found, through Monday. This preliminary estimate does not
include the costs of the family's stay at Andrews Air Force Base
from Saturday until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The largest figure was $374,000 for the INS and included the
cost of training and housing 131 immigration agents who
participated in the raid and Elian's flight to Washington aboard a
government plane.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Marshals Service, which provided 20 deputies for the
raid and security for Elian's father in Washington and the entire
family since Saturday, spent $161,000. The figures included
overtime but not regular salaries that would have been paid anyway.
Other amounts were spent on legal work, mediators and conciliators,
and expenses for psychiatric consultants.

 &HT;    POLITICAL TICKER: GIULIANI DIAGNOSED WITH PROSTATE CANCER
 &HT;    (EDs: A brief roundup of the day's campaign events, pulled from
Cox staff and wire reports.)
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rudy Giuliani announced Thursday he has prostate cancer, and
said the disease could affect his Senate campaign against Hillary
Rodham Clinton. Giuliani, 55, sounded upbeat: ``It's a treatable
form of prostate cancer. It was found at an early stage.'' He said
a biopsy was performed Wednesday, 2 1/2 weeks after a screening
test indicated the follow-up test was necessary. Treatment options,
which include radiation and chemotherapy, have not yet been
decided. Asked how it would affect his Senate run: ``I have no
idea.'' Giuliani said he couldn't answer that until he decides on a
course of treatment. Clinton said that, ``like all New Yorkers,''
she's hoping and praying for his speedy recovery. Giuliani's father
died of prostate cancer in 1981, before the latest screening tests
that catch it early.
</P>
<P>
   MAYBE A LITTLE MORE THAN THEY WANTED TO HEAR
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush proved once again he's a master fund-raiser,
bringing in $21.3 million for his party at a black-tie Republican
Party dinner that was a who's who of lobbyists and businesses with
interests before the government. Those represented included AT&AMP;T,
Chevron, Philip Morris, the National Rifle Association and the Blue
Cross and Blue Shield Association. Yet, even as he was being
toasted by the Washington establishment, Bush tried to create some
distance from it, criticizing ``eight years of excessive
partisanship and fingerpointing.'' Bush: ``The Clinton-Gore
administration has been the most relentlessly partisan
administration in our nation's history. But sometimes some in our
own party have responded in kind.'' Reaction to that last sentence
from the 1,500 in attendance? Stone silence.
</P>
<P>
   INFLUENCE COSTS MONEY ON BOTH SIDES
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore excoriated George W. Bush for his ties to the tobacco,
health insurance and gun industries, suggesting their huge campaign
contributions influenced Bush to take positions sympathetic to the
donors _ and perhaps contrary to his own ``basic common sense.''
Why does Bush always do what the National Rifle Association want
him to? Gore asked. The Bush campaign fired right back with this
statement: ``Less than one week after the FBI questioned the vice
president about the Democrats'
</P>
<P>
   potentially illegal fund-raising practices, Al Gore once again
showed his lack of credibility by criticizing Gov. Bush for
(Wednesday night's) completely legal fund-raiser.''
</P>
<P>
   AGREEMENT ON FIRST NEW YORK DEBATE _ BUT
</P>
<P>
   A day before Rudy Giuliani disclosed his prostate cancer, he and
Hillary Rodham Clinton agreed to the first of what aides for both
said would be a series of debates. The two New York Senate
candidates accepted an invitation for a statewide forum with ``Meet
the Press'' host Tim Russert to be broadcast this fall on MSNBC
cable and NBC affiliates across New York. If it comes off now, it
would be held Sept. 11 in Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   TOWN HALLS WORKED FOR MCCAIN
</P>
<P>
   Answering questions on topics ranging from economic growth and
agriculture to health care and the fate of Elian Gonzalez, Hillary
Rodham Clinton held the first of a series of town hall meetings
that her aides said would be a new way of bringing her campaign
directly to New Yorkers. She also vowed not to run for president in
four years if elected to the Senate and a Republican is in the
White House. ``I am going to serve my six-year term as senator. I
owe it to the people of New York,'' she said. Relaxed, with hands
frequently clasped, Clinton stood to respond to questions from an
audience of 350 students, faculty members and residents at the
State University of New York at Buffalo. The first hour was
broadcast live on CNN, but she continued to take questions for 40
more minutes.
</P>
<P>
   MCCAIN CAN DO WITHOUT MEETING
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, after reading a newspaper column by Robert Novak
that cited George W. Bush advisers grousing about the planned May 9
Bush-McCain meeting, reportedly told his political director, John
Weaver, to scrub the meeting. The meeting, according to online
magazine Salon, was always more important to Bush, who seeks the
independent voters who backed McCain's candidacy, than to McCain.
Salon says that while a meeting between the two may eventually take
place, for the time being it's off.
</P>
<P>
   THAT'S MORE THAN 7 CENTS A MINUTE
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, which is awaiting government approval of a $59 billion
purchase of MediaOne and is in a high-stakes race with cable
companies to provide high-speed internet connections, contributed
$651,050 to both political parties in the first quarter of this
year. The donations pushed AT&AMP;T's total since the beginning of 1999
to $2.03 million. That's $760,000 more than any other company
contributed in the same period, Bloomberg News reports. The
Republicans got 52 percent of it; the Democrats 48 percent,
according to Federal Election Commission data.
</P>
<P>
   BUT ENQUIRING MINDS WANT TO KNOW
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore said he was surprised to hear that his aides refused to
tell reporters where he was one weekend in March when it turned out
that he and wife Tipper went to Florida for a post-primary-season
respite. He says he's resigned to an ever-present news media
trailing him. Gore told reporters he understands there is a greater
public right to know where he is and what he's doing since he is
not only the vice president but also effectively the Democratic
presidential nominee. ``Let's say I'm resigned to it. Personally I
would prefer to have more of an ability to, you know, go to the
store by myself,'' Gore said. ``But I understand it and I don't
chafe under it _ much.''
</P>
<P>
   THEY'RE OFF TO THE RACES
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush and his father, George H.W. Bush, the former
president, will attend the Kentucky Derby on May 6. They're
expected to be in Louisville only for the race. Bush the elder has
been a Derby visitor before, most often as the guest of close
friend Wil Farish, who owns Lane's End Farm in horse country's
Woodford County. Al Gore attended the 1999 Derby as a guest of
Democratic Gov. Paul Patton, but is not expected at Churchill Downs
this year.
</P>
<P>
   CONSUMER-TESTED FOR QUALITY
</P>
<P>
   Guess which presidential candidate received the highest net
favorability rating among the four tested presidential candidates
in an Ohio Poll: George Bush, Al Gore, Ralph Nader, or Pat
Buchanan? Nader's net favorability was 24 percent, higher than Bush
at 22 percent, Gore at minus 3 percent and Buchanan at minus 36
percent. Net favorability was calculated by subtracting the
unfavorability rating from the favorability rating received for
each candidate. The Ohio Poll, conducted by the Institute for
Policy Research at the University of Cincinnati (4.3 percentage
point margin of error) also showed Nader to be the only candidate
tested who received a positive net favorability rating among
Democrats (40 percent), independents (20 percent) and Republicans
(10 percent) alike.
</P>
<P>
   COUPS DON'T ALWAYS OCCUR WITH TANKS
</P>
<P>
   To Pat Buchanan, his tour of 23 Reform Party state convention
sites is a legitimate, if aggressive, bid for the group's
presidential nomination. But to supporters of party founder Ross
Perot, Buchanan's march across the country looks more like a quiet
coup. ``They want to elect their own chairmen, take over the party
and make sure all of the delegates vote for Pat Buchanan,'' said
Charles Dodge, who resigned as Wisconsin chairman amid a ruckus
between factions this month. ``We're a democratic group; we don't
work that way.'' Buchanan's sister and campaign manager, Bay
Buchanan, said problems arise only when when state parties try to
amend the rules to exclude Buchanan supporters from participating
or running for party offices, which influence delegate selection.
</P>
<P>
   OUSTER OF BUSH APPOINTEE DEMANDED
</P>
<P>
   Civil rights groups and the Congressional Hispanic Caucus say
George W. Bush should ask the Texas state health commissioner to
resign over his comments about teen pregnancy and Hispanics. Dr.
Reyn Archer, a Bush appointee, has been under fire since telling
The New York Times that Hispanics are culturally resistant to the
idea that ``getting pregnant is a bad thing.'' He has apologized,
in writing and in person, to state legislators. But the Texas
Freedom Network, League of United Latin American Citizens,
Mexican-American Legal Defense &AMP; Educational Fund, and Rainbow
Coalition said apologies aren't enough and they want him gone.
``Archer's comments only fuel questions about Governor Bush's
tolerance of racism and sexism,'' said Samantha Smoot, director of
the Texas Freedom Network.

   THE KIDS' CIVICS LESSON FOR THE DAY

<P>
   Pre-cancer announcement Rudy Giuliani called a reporter a

 &HT;    'DAUGHTERS TO WORK DAY' SPARKS DREAMS FOR MILLIONS, BACKERS SAY
 &HT;    By EMILY DEANS and BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Eight years after the Ms. Foundation for Women
called for an annual Take Our Daughters to Work Day, the event has
given millions of young girls a glimpse of the American workplace.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, it has become a window into the widening choices
girls have in a society of increasing possibilities for women, said
Marie C. Wilson, president of the Ms. Foundation for Women.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about America's daughters,'' she told about 150 women and
girls attending a White House ceremony to spotlight the annual
event. ``I want every girl in this country to know that you have
every right to grow up to be the president of the United States of
America or the secretary of the Treasury or to run a dot-com.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, about 19 million girls journeyed to jobs across the
country, most with a mom or dad, Wilson estimated.
</P>
<P>
   While some educators have discouraged participation in the event
because it requires missing a day of school, its backers said it
has become a vital reminder of the broadening career horizons women
may pursue.
</P>
<P>
   ``It encourages girls to really be anything they wish to be, to
reinforce that beautiful voice that every girl has inside herself
that tells her 'You can do this,'' said Luz Borrero, executive
director of ``Cool Girls,'' an Atlanta organization that helps
low-income girls build a foundation for successful careers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every girl needs that reinforcement, and I think this program
provides that opportunity,'' said Borrero, who attended the White
House event.
</P>
<P>
   Borrero said Atlanta businesses have embraced the annual day.
Atlanta companies such as the King &AMP; Spalding law firm, the UPS
parcel delivery service and Emory University took in 85 girls on
Thursday, she said, offering them mentoring programs and a day on
the job.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson also spoke up for stay-at-home moms, saying that women
who run households and raise children are creating ``social
capital.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time she cooks you a meal, every time she goes to a PTA
meeting,'' Wilson said, ``she's creating wealth.''
</P>
<P>
   Also speaking at the White House event was Treasury Secretary
Larry Summers, who brought along his twin 9-year-old daughters.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who was traveling in Arkansas, sent a
prepared statement in support of Take Our Daughters to Work Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks to the courage and determination of women who blazed
new trails in our society, young women in America today have more
career opportunities open to them than ever before,'' Clinton
stated. ``Our daughters can look to a wide variety of inspiring
role models straight from today's headlines.''

AUSTIN AND SAN ANTONIO: BOOMING IN SIZE AND BRIO

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ More than 150 years ago, San Antonio gave Texas
its enduring symbol of us-against-them pride and courage, the
Alamo. Austin's moment in the sun is now. Its technology boom has
generated fortunes that surpass even the staggering riches earned
by the state's cattle and oil barons.
</P>
<P>
   The two cities are only 80 miles apart, not much more than an
hour's drive down I-35 for lead-footed local drivers, and their
metropolitan areas are slowly growing together. They share the
equable south-central Texas climate; close proximity to the Hill
Country, an area of easy, unspoiled rustic beauty; a compactness
envied by sprawling Dallas and Houston; an unhurried approach to
life, and an unusual ethnic flavor, arising from the interaction of
Hispanic culture with that of the early settlers from Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Both take much of their character from modest rivers that they
have turned to great effect. But no one would ever confuse them.
</P>
<P>
   Austin is defined by the enormous University of Texas, with
50,000 students on a single campus, and by the state government,
headed at the moment by an up-and-coming politician named George W.
Bush. Plus the vast chip and computer plants just outside the city
and one of the country's liveliest, most varied popular music
cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Nelson lives here, and Lady Bird Johnson, the president's
farsighted widow, who has enriched Austin, Texas and the whole
nation with her beautification projects. So do Ann Richards and
Molly Ivins, a pair of bright, witty women, one a former governor,
the other a syndicated newspaper columnist, who find plenty of
targets hereabouts for their barbs.
</P>
<P>
   Austin's population has grown by a third and its work force by
almost two-thirds in the last decade. But George Christian, Lyndon
B. Johnson's press secretary, who was born here, said that the city
retains its essential character, despite traffic jams and rocketing
real estate prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a tolerant, casual, laid-back place, different from
most of the rest of the state,'' he told me over a lunch of meat
loaf, black-eyed peas and deep-fried pickles at Threadgill's, Janis
Joplin's old hangout. ``Nothing changes that.''
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio is older, poorer and slightly larger, with 1.5
million people vs. Austin's 1.1 million _ a margin that is
shrinking fast. It is a city of fiestas, especially the nine-day
Fiesta, an annual wingding every bit as flamboyant as, if somewhat
less boozy than, Mardi Gras in New Orleans. This year's edition
comes to a clamorous conclusion on April 30.
</P>
<P>
   The city has turned its evident charms into a significant
economic asset, luring dozens of big conventions every year. It
earns further millions from three major Air Force bases, including
Randolph Field, where many pilots were trained in World War II, and
from the Army's Fort Sam Houston.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio is also much more heavily Hispanic. It is, in fact,
the largest Hispanic-majority city in the country, represented in
Congress for 37 years by Henry B. Gonzalez, a power on the House
Banking Committee who brought home plenty of federal bacon, and now
by his son Charles. Much of its modern momentum was imparted by
another Hispanic politician, Henry G. Cisneros, who served as mayor
from 1982 to 1990, before heading to Washington, where he served
the Clinton administration as secretary of housing and urban
development. He later resigned during a scandal involving a former
lover.
</P>
<P>
   ``San Antonio,'' Graham Greene wrote in 1939, ``is more Mexican
than American _ not quite genuine Mexican (it is far too clean for
that) but picture-postcard Mexican.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Neither city, in truth, can claim to be a national or even a
regional cultural capital. Neither has a museum in the same league
as the Kimbell in Fort Worth or a symphony orchestra that can
compete with the excellent ensemble built in Houston by Christoph
Eschenbach. But scratch the surface a little, and discover that
Nelson A. Rockefeller's wonderful collection of Latin American art
has found a home in San Antonio, and that the University of Texas
houses one of the world's greatest troves of 20th-century
manuscripts, including important items by Joyce, Shaw and Waugh.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio boasts a stunning new library designed by the
Mexican master Roberto Legorreta. A series of boxes piled one on
another, with a breathtaking six-story atrium, it is painted an
eye-popping color known to locals as ``enchilada red.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin's own architectural spectacular, a new building for the
university's Jack S. Blanton Museum, was stalled when hidebound
members of the Board of Regents raised so many objections that the
architects, Herzog &AMP; de Meuron, probably the hottest firm in the
world at the moment, threw up their hands and quit. The dean of the
architecture school resigned, too.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, while the search for a new designer continues,
the Blanton's interesting collection is split between two campus
buildings, neither of them adequate. The most important holdings
are the 20th-century American pictures donated by the author James
A. Michener and his wife, Mari (ranging from the Ashcan School
through a jaunty yellow oil by Arthur G. Dove called ``Good
Breeze'' to Sam Gilliam and Larry Rivers), and the recently
acquired Suida-Manning collection, parts of which had been on
long-term loan to the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Among its notable
paintings are works by Poussin, Guercino and Simon Vouet, plus a
Veronese ``Annunciation'' showing the virgin, swathed in luminous
pink, turning modestly away from the Angel Gabriel.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin Museum of Art, which is still amassing a permanent
collection, is moving ahead with its new building, to be designed
by Richard Gluckman, the New Yorker who adapted older buildings for
the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh and the Georgia O'Keeffe
Museum in Santa Fe. The small but solid Austin Symphony Orchestra
and Austin Lyric Opera (13 performances of three productions this
season) continue to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   Residual conservatism and insularity have done nothing to
inhibit the development of dozens of active theater companies in
Austin. Nor has it slowed the seemingly unstoppable expansion of
the popular music business here, which now extends to 810 recording
artists and 150 clubs and other stages, featuring everything from
rockabilly to Texas swing to Tejano. Every March, music journalists
and record-company executives flock here for the Southwest Music
and Media Conference, known as SXSW, to look for future stars. This
year almost 1,000 acts from all over the world showed up, each
allotted a mere 40 minutes to sell itself to the bigwigs.
</P>
<P>
   In San Antonio, a significant effort has been made to build
artistic links to Mexico and Latin America as a whole, as Ron
Bechtel, a local architect and food critic, explained to me.
</P>
<P>
   The commission for Legorreta, who won the American Institute of
Architects Gold Medal for 1999, is one instance; another is a
continuing effort by Christopher Wilkins, the music director of the
60-year-old San Antonio Symphony, to program works by Latin
composers, often interpreted by Latin conductors or soloists. Works
by many contemporary Hispanic artists are displayed in galleries in
the old warehouse district that is anchored by the The strongest
element in this linkage, however, must be the Rockefeller Latin
American Art Center at the San Antonio Museum of Art. The main part
of the museum is housed in a castellated converted brewery dating
from 1904, a fine example of the city's unusually imaginative reuse
of intriguing old buildings. The Rockefeller center, which includes
not only the collection of the onetime New York governor but
material from other sources as well, was opened in October 1998, in
a well-conceived addition.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Aztec, Mixtec and other pre-Columbian art,
Spanish colonial silver and altarpieces and contemporary Latin
American painting, the Rockefeller wing owns a riotously
uninhibited collection of Mexican folk art, including dozens of
masks, an elegant crane fashioned from a gourd and brightly colored
ceramic churches, trucks, trains and planes.
</P>
<P>
   A highlight of the museum's other collections is Martin Johnson
Heade's tiny ``Passion Flowers and Hummingbirds,'' which a wall
label aptly described as ``a very private vision of the Garden of
Eden.'' He painted it, appropriately enough, in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Texas is full of small museums too little known outside the
state, like the Ima Hogg decorative-arts collection in Houston and
the Trammell Crow Museum of Asian Art in Dallas. In San Antonio,
the sleeper is the McNay Art Museum, in a parklike sitting on the
north side of town, where the Richie Riches of San Antonio live.
</P>
<P>
   It has one of the nation's premier theater arts collections,
which is augmented this spring by a special showing of treasures
from the St. Petersburg State Museum of Theater and Music. The
splendor of Aleksandr Golovin's costumes for ``The Firebird'' came
as no surprise, but I was amazed to see the sketches by Kasimir
Malevich done in 1913 for a production of the now-forgotten
experimental opera ``Victory Over the Sun,'' and the captivatingly
witty Constructivist costumes designed in 1931 by Tatyana Bruni for
an early Shostakovich ballet, ``Bolt.'' Keen Shostakovich fan
though I am, I confess I had never before encountered the ballet or
Bruni.
</P>
<P>
   If you go to the McNay, do not miss the permanent collection,
especially the van Goghs and Gauguins, Matisse's ``Red Blouse'' and
a memorable Redon, but also superb graphics by Edward Hopper and
John Marin.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you happen to be a circus junkie like me, you will
enjoy the Hertzberg Circus Museum, which houses the 20,000-object
collection of a former state senator from San Antonio. What might
be called, in circus-speak, A Peerless Panorama of Posters, recalls
a simpler, more credulous era: Frank Buck (``Bring 'em Back
Alive''), Gargantua the Great and the Giraffe-Women of Burma! The
best carries a portrait of P.T. Barnum himself _ without his name,
just the words ``I Am Coming.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Nazis began a campaign of genocide that
would claim the lives of 6 million Jews, a few thousand refugees
from Poland found temporary shelter in Japan, a nation then allied
with Germany. I was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   My parents and I survived the Holocaust because two diplomats _
one Dutch and the other Japanese _ issued life-saving visas that
let us dodge Nazi death camps and the Soviet Gulag.
</P>
<P>
   We were among a band of refugees who journeyed from Poland,
which was overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in September
1939, to Lithuania, occupied by Soviet troops in June 1940.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it took nearly two weeks on the Trans-Siberian
railway to reach the Far East port of Vladivostok. After a
storm-tossed voyage across the Sea of Japan, the escapees arrived
in Kobe a few months before the attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Those who found immigration visas and could afford to travel
dispersed around the globe. A few, including our family, came
directly to the United States. After World War II broke out, the
Japanese interned about half the escapees in Shanghai, China.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years later, the story of the refugees' escape from
Europe, called ``Flight and Rescue,'' is being told in an exhibit
opening May 4 at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. It runs
through Oct. 21, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit documents the 6,000-mile odyssey of about 2,000
Polish Jews with artifacts, films, photos and testaments, said
David Marwell, the Holocaust Museum's associate director for
special projects.
</P>
<P>
   The key figure who made the journey possible was Chiune
Sugihara, the first Japanese diplomat to be posted to Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   For 29 days _ from July 31 to Aug. 28, 1940 _ Sugihara and his
wife, Yukiko, wrote visas by hand for many hours, charging no fees.
When refugees who had been standing in line in front of his
consulate in Kaunas for days began climbing the compound wall in
despair, he came out to calm them and assure them that he would do
his best to help. In all, he issued 2,139 visas.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat in Hungary whose
chief purpose in 1944 was to save Jews, Sugihara had no apparent
reason to rescue Jews. By doing so, he openly violated repeated
written orders from Tokyo, which was aligned with Berlin and Rome
in the Axis pact.
</P>
<P>
   Said Masha Leon, a fellow survivor: ``Even when he was at the
train station (on his way to Berlin) after the consulate had been
closed down, he was writing these hand-written visas and throwing
them out of the train window. It was an extraordinary act, it was
extraordinary heroism, but he was an extraordinary man.''
</P>
<P>
   About 3.1 million Jews lived in Poland before the 1939
blitzkrieg. About 100,000 survived the war.
</P>
<P>
   As the Nazis and the Communists carved up a vanquished Poland,
some 15,000 Jews bolted the Soviet-controlled area into neighboring
Lithuania in the vain hope that the small Baltic nation could
remain neutral.
</P>
<P>
   My family headed east from Warsaw with a Catholic taxi driver
whom my late father, then 28, befriended as the two cleared
bombed-out rubble. We left only hours before German troops ringed
the Polish capital and made escape all but impossible.
</P>
<P>
   In Lithuania, during a month-long window in 1940, there opened a
four-step chance to attain asylum.
</P>
<P>
   _ First, the Polish government-in-exile took our word for it
that we were Polish citizens. Moscow classified Lithuanian Jews as
Soviet citizens, barring them from leaving. Some 225,000 of them
later perished.
</P>
<P>
   _ Then, Jan Zwartendijk, an electronics importer and a part-time
acting Dutch counsel, issued a unique document. It stated that
visas weren't needed to enter Curacao, a Dutch possession in the
Caribbean. Zwartendijk ignored the fact that it was up to the
colonial governor to approve each entrant, which he rarely did.
</P>
<P>
   Between July 26 and Aug. 2, 1940, Zwartendijk gave out 2,400
``Curacao visas.'' His rescue operation was shut down when the
Soviet government nationalized his company and sent back to Holland
the man known to Polish Jews as ``Mr. Philips Radio.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Next, with the key Dutch document in hand, we applied for
transit visas from Sugihara. Fluent in Russian, he was sent there
in 1939 to spy on German and Russian troop movements. Although
Sugihara never met Zwartendijk, his entry papers gave Sugihara the
cover to act.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Kremlin posed the last hurdle. Wanda Glass, my 87-year-old
mother, recalls that the new Soviet masters of Lithuania allowed
some Polish Jews to depart while barring the way to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly everyone who had travel papers from Zwartendijk and
Sugihara was interrogated by the (Soviet) authorities and asked
whether we would work for them if we left,'' she said. ``They
wanted us to be spies.''
</P>
<P>
   Would-be emigrants also faced a Catch-22: The Soviets would
accept only U.S. dollars in payment for travel charges. But any
Pole caught with dollars was subject to arrest and exile in
Siberia. My father took the risk by handing a Soviet official a
sealed envelope on which he had written: ``Dollars to be Used Only
for Travel in the Soviet Union.''
</P>
<P>
   Sugihara's records, preserved in Tokyo, show that my father,
Marian, was issued visa No. 160 while my mother received No. 165.
As a boy of 4, I traveled on my mother's visa.
</P>
<P>
   In hopes that other family members could flee across German
lines and join us, my father asked Sugihara for 10 more visas,
including ones for my paternal grandparents and for each of his
siblings. But none escaped Poland. All my relatives perished.
</P>
<P>
   As the war ended, Sugihara, by then posted in Romania, was
seized by the Russians and sent for 18 months to a concentration
camp with his wife and young son. On arriving in American-occupied
Japan in 1947, the foreign ministry ousted him for his wartime
``insubordination,'' offering him a small pension.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, Sugihara lived in obscurity, selling light bulbs.
Then, in 1969, Yehoshua Nishri, an Israeli diplomat based in Tokyo
and one of the refugees he had rescued, found him and aired his
deeds.
</P>
<P>
   Praised by the Israeli government as one of ``the righteous
among nations'' _ the phrase used for non-Jews who helped save Jews
in the Holocaust _ Sugihara won the same honors that had been
bestowed upon Wallenberg and German businessman Oskar Schindler.
</P>
<P>
   Born Jan. 1, 1900, Sugihara died in 1986, still all but unknown
in his native land. In the year before his death, 45 years after
his visas had saved our lives, Sugihara was asked why he did it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were human beings and they needed help,'' he replied.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As the Nazis began a campaign of genocide that
would claim the lives of 6 million Jews, a few thousand refugees
from Poland found temporary shelter in Japan, a nation then allied
with Germany. I was one of them.
</P>
<P>
   My parents and I survived the Holocaust because two diplomats _
one Dutch and the other Japanese _ issued life-saving visas that
let us dodge Nazi death camps and the Soviet Gulag.
</P>
<P>
   We were among a band of refugees who journeyed from Poland,
which was overrun by Germany and the Soviet Union in September
1939, to Lithuania, occupied by Soviet troops in June 1940.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it took nearly two weeks on the Trans-Siberian
railway to reach the Far East port of Vladivostok. After a
storm-tossed voyage across the Sea of Japan, the escapees arrived
in Kobe a few months before the attack on Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Those who found immigration visas and could afford to travel
dispersed around the globe. A few, including our family, came
directly to the United States. After World War II broke out, the
Japanese interned about half the escapees in Shanghai, China.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty years later, the story of the refugees' escape from
Europe, called ``Flight and Rescue,'' is being told in an exhibit
opening May 4 at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. It runs
through Oct. 21, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibit documents the 6,000-mile odyssey of about 2,000
Polish Jews with artifacts, films, photos and testaments, said
David Marwell, the Holocaust Museum's associate director for
special projects.
</P>
<P>
   The key figure who made the journey possible was Chiune
Sugihara, the first Japanese diplomat to be posted to Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
   For 29 days _ from July 31 to Aug. 28, 1940 _ Sugihara and his
wife, Yukiko, wrote visas by hand for many hours, charging no fees.
When refugees who had been standing in line in front of his
consulate in Kaunas for days began climbing the compound wall in
despair, he came out to calm them and assure them that he would do
his best to help. In all, he issued 2,139 visas.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Raoul Wallenberg, the Swedish diplomat in Hungary whose
chief purpose in 1944 was to save Jews, Sugihara had no apparent
reason to rescue Jews. By doing so, he openly violated repeated
written orders from Tokyo, which was aligned with Berlin and Rome
in the Axis pact.
</P>
<P>
   Said Masha Leon, a fellow survivor: ``Even when he was at the
train station (on his way to Berlin) after the consulate had been
closed down, he was writing these hand-written visas and throwing
them out of the train window. It was an extraordinary act, it was
extraordinary heroism, but he was an extraordinary man.''

blitzkrieg. About 100,000 survived the war.

AUSTIN, Texas: Am Coming.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A quarter-century ago, Austin was a sleepy town, about as
vibrant as Carson City, Nev., with a couple of enormous buildings _
Texas Memorial Stadium, where the Longhorns roam, and the pink
granite state capitol, the largest and the most southerly in the
United States, except of course for Hawaii's, with a dome that
looks uncannily like the one in Washington. The political carnival
inside is similar, too.
</P>
<P>
   Quite a few one- and two-story cow-town buildings still stand on
Congress Avenue and along the streets running off it, but that's
not where the action is. The action is out along Loop 360 and Loop
1, at the region's 2,100 high-tech companies. Austin's
Entrepreneurs' Association had 476 members at recent count, and the
entrepreneur-in-chief has to be Michael Dell, 35, the youngest
chief executive to lead a company onto the Fortune 500; the
sixth-richest person in America, according to Forbes; and the
richest Texan ever. No, that's not a misprint; Dell is richer than
the Basses of Fort Worth and the DeMenils of Houston, and richer by
far than H. Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   He made his money by grafting an old idea to a new business: he
eliminated the middleman (and avoided the inventory costs of his
rivals) by building computers to order and selling them direct to
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   That simple scheme made millionaires of many of Dell's early
employees, even secretaries and clerks, and it made billionaires of
some. Aided by federal research dollars funneled into the area by
its former congressman, the legendary J.J. Pickle, and by the
talent pool at the university, new companies sprang up like
wildflowers after a spring rain. Soon all of Austin was gossiping
about the new ``Dellionaires.''
</P>
<P>
   Which represents a big change, because until recently Austin was
a stranger to Dallas-size bankrolls. During the 1960s, in fact, it
was a counterculture center, a Haight-Ashbury with 10-gallon hats,
and some of that individualism lingers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a funny, funky, outrageous town,'' said Ivins. ``Where
else do they have Spamarama? Spam with Chinese food, Spam
foo-young, for goodness sake. Where else do people celebrate
Eeyore's birthday?
</P>
<P>
   ``We do.''
</P>
<P>
   Austin doesn't have bats in its belfry. It keeps its bats under
the Congress Avenue Bridge, or rather they keep themselves there:
1.5 million Mexican free-tailed bats, who live beneath the bridge's
concrete arches from March until November, streaming out at dusk to
eat.
</P>
<P>
   The bridge crosses Town Lake, an idyllic sliver of water formed
by a dam on the Colorado River (the Texas Colorado, not the longer
one farther west). By some miracle of good sense, all motorboats
are banned, so the waters are roiled by nothing more modern than
sculls, canoes and a poky little excursion stern-wheeler.
</P>
<P>
   Austin climbs from the lake to the university, centered on the
307-foot tower of the Main Building. One of the richest state
universities, the fortunate owner of extensive oil lands in the
Permian Basin, U.T., as the students call it, has attracted
distinguished faculty members from other campuses. Steven Weinberg,
a physicist, won the Nobel Prize in 1979 and left Harvard for
Austin in 1983; now ``you couldn't blast him out of here with a
howitzer,'' a friend says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michigan and Berkeley are the ideals we aspire to,'' said
James S. Fishkin, ex-Yale and now a U.T. professor of ethics and
American society, with a chair improbably named for Darrell K.
Royall, an old Longhorn football coach. ``We're already there in
some areas, and we undoubtedly have the resources to get there in
most others.''
</P>
<P>
   At the edge of the campus stands the Lyndon Baines Johnson
Library and Museum, an exemplary institution of its kind, which is
just one of the monuments, all well worth visiting, to the former
president and his family in this area. Another is the Lady Bird
Johnson Wildflower Center, where the magnificent bluebonnets
(Lupinus texensis) and the Indian paintbrush are ankle deep this
time of year. A third is the LBJ Ranch, out in the Hill Country
near Stonewall, Texas, hard by the Pedernales River (which Johnson,
in keeping with the local usage, always pronounced as
``Purdenales'').
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio is drenched in history. Its Hispanic past is
exemplified by the 18th-century missions along the San Antonio
River south of the center, notably Concepcion, a starkly beautiful,
twin-towered building that retains traces of its original frescoes,
and San Jose, with exquisite Churrigueresque ornamentation around
its windows and doors.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose gives a good impression of the privations of life in
what was then the wilderness, with its gun ports and defensive
walls, and of what must have been, then as now, the pleasures of
spring in the Southwest, with its feathery mesquite trees and
flame-colored pomegranate blossoms.
</P>
<P>
   Closer to downtown stands the King William District, full of
Victorian houses built of beautifully dressed pale limestone blocks
by German burghers in the mid-1800s. Once known for obvious reasons
as Sauerkraut Bend, the neighborhood is remarkably intact, although
some houses have been lovingly restored while others in the same
block remain decrepit. It reminded me a bit of Georgetown in the
late 1950s before it became compulsively chic.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Steves Homestead at 509 King William, with a fine
Mansard roof, and Groos house, an Italianate villa at 335, are very
handsome.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio boosters will remind you that theirs is a big-league
town; they are proud of the Spurs, National Basketball Association
Champions in the 1998-99 season, led by a pair of walking
skyscrapers named David Robinson and Tim Duncan. Me, I'm pretty
excited about the Class AA San Diego Missions, and especially their
mascots, the Puffy Taco and Ballapeno, a hot pepper with a
baseball-shaped head.
</P>
<P>
   For the average visitor, though, San Antonio is synonymous with
the Alamo and the Riverwalk. The former, where 188 heroic Texans,
including Jim Bowie and Davy Crockett, held off 5,000 Mexicans
under Santa Anna before perishing on March 6, 1836, is a shrine to
the Texas nationhood that for many Texans has never ceased to
exist. The Alamo itself, which was once a mission church, has a
somber dignity that quiets even the hordes of schoolchildren who
troop through every day. But the ``museum shop'' next door is a
travesty that sells Alamo butter-spreaders and other equally
tasteful goods.
</P>
<P>
   The Riverwalk, fashioned with WPA funds during the Depression,
consists of paths along the downtown reaches of the San Antonio,
overhung with cypresses, crossed by humpbacked footbridges,
sparklingly lighted at night. Hotels, restaurants and clubs, like
the Landing, where the joyously old-fashioned Jim Cullum Jazz Band
toots every night, open onto it. Commercial the walk may be;
resistible it isn't, not to the hardest of hearts.

   Hotel: Excelsior House Hotel
</P>
<P>
   City: Jefferson
</P>
<P>
   Then: Opened in the late 1850s _ allegedly just six months after
San Antonio's Menger Hotel _ the Excelsior House has hosted guests
continuously since that time. At the time, the East Texas town was
a steamboat port and one of the state's leading cities; the hotel
was built with the Southern ambience prevalent in the town and was
the city's leading inn for years.
</P>
<P>
   Now: After a period of decline, the hotel in the 1960s was
purchased by the Jessie Allen Wise garden club, whose members
decided to restore it and run it as a working hotel and not a
museum. Today it is a repository of period antiques, such as Jennie
Lind trundle beds, English porcelain, claw-foot tubs, marble-topped
dressers, Oriental rugs and rosewood Napoleon beds.
</P>
<P>
   They slept here: Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B.
Hayes, Lady Bird Johnson, Oscar Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   Details: 14 guest rooms; restaurant. Rooms from $75, double.

<P>
   Hotel: Hotel Galvez
</P>
<P>
   City: Galveston
</P>
<P>
   Then: Named for Bernardo de Galvez, the Spanish governor from
whom Galveston also took its name, the 6-story hotel was the
grandest on the beach when it opened in 1911. During its early
years, it hosted the first ``bathing beauty'' contests in the
nation; contestants included Dorothy Lamour. During World War II,
it was used as a base for the U.S. Coast Guard, but it returned to
civilian use afterward, with several renovations keeping it fresh
between the '50s and the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Now: New owners completed another wholesale renovation in 1999,
working from historical photos. The grand circular entrance was
restored, and soaring original archways were uncovered in the music
hall. New light fixtures and furnishings were made to look like
those from the original era, and all rooms were completely redone.
Also added was a lushly landscaped pool, complete with swim-up bar,
which is lovely but seems more suited to an upscale Caribbean
resort.
</P>
<P>
   They slept here: President Franklin D. Roosevelt, Frank Sinatra,
Howard Hughes, Jimmy Stewart, Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
</P>
<P>
   Details: 231 guest rooms, restaurant, bar. Rooms from $230,
double. (409) 765-7721; www.wyndham.com

</P>
<P>
   Hotel: The Tremont House
</P>
<P>
   City: Galveston
</P>
<P>
   Then: If you count all the Tremont House incarnations, which
date back to 1839, this hotel, located in Galveston's Strand
district, has one of the richest histories in the state. The
original 2-story hotel was built in 1839 and was the finest hotel
in Texas until it burned in 1865; seven years later, it was rebuilt
on the same site. This hotel hosted such disparate guests as a
group of Sioux Indian chiefs, six presidents, cotton barons and
Gen. Sam Houston, who delivered his last speech there. But the
hotel faltered after the turn of the century; it was demolished in
1928.
</P>
<P>
   Now: In 1984, developers George and Cynthia Mitchell
appropriated the Tremont House name for their historic hotel, for
which they renovated a former dry-goods store built in 1879. Period
furnishings _ such as enamel-and-brass beds and lace curtains,
ironwork balconies, bird-cage elevators and a great black marble
stairway _ evoke the town's Victorian heyday.
</P>
<P>
   They slept here: Ulysses S. Grant, Clara Barton, Edwin Booth,
Buffalo Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Details: 117 rooms, restaurant, bar. Rooms from $155, double.

   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Jim Spurlock is an unlikely activist. The
prosperous airplane broker is a private pilot and a lifelong
Republican. Since 1976, he has spent much of his time in an office
at Fort Worth Meacham Airport putting airplane buyers in touch with
owners, sometimes spending months arranging a single purchase. But
in 1991 and 1992, the U.S. Customs Service seized two of his
customers' jets because of a paperwork error. Spurlock said he
spent nine months and thousands of dollars getting them returned.
He said he learned that basic legal principles, such as presumption
of innocence, could be upended by federal asset forfeiture laws.
``The rule of law is disappearing. Something needs to be done to
change it back,'' said Spurlock, 57, of Fort Worth. By MIKE LEE and

 (Includes a color slide and a black-and-white photo of Eric Close
in a scene from ``Now and Again.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
 &HT;    Eric Close hardly looks like an actor whose show is on the
bubble.
 &HT;    The amiable star of the freshman CBS series ``Now and Again,''
is sitting in the makeshift cafeteria at Silvercup Studios in Long
Island City, N.Y. He's sporting blue pajamas, chowing down on lunch
and smiling as he ponders the show's fate.
 &HT;    ``All I can say is I have no insider information _ but of all
the series I've done, I think this one has the best prospect of
being picked up,'' says Close, who counts ``The Magnificent
Seven,'' ``McKenna'' and the sci-fi hour ``Dark Skies'' among his
previous series stints.
 &HT;    ``It's the best show on television,'' he says matter-of-factly.
```Now and Again' is intelligent, clever, funny, romantic,
adventurous and downright original. More and more people are
discovering the show every week.''
 &HT;    All of that may be true, but CBS airs ``Now and Again'' on
Friday nights at 9, a death slot if ever there was one. And though
the show has performed well when measured against both its
competitors and its predecessors, the ratings are iffy,
jeopardizing its future.
 &HT;    Despite the pajamas, Close isn't losing sleep over the
situation. Instead, he and his colleagues in the ``Now and Again''
company are doing their damnedest to make the best episodes
possible and leaving the rest to fate _ and to CBS boss Leslie
Moonves.
 &HT;    Created by Glenn Gordon Caron of ``Moonlighting'' fame, the show
follows the adventures of Michael Wiseman (John Goodman), whose
brain was transplanted into a bioengineered superbody (Close) after
a deadly subway accident. Wiseman now works for the U.S. government
as an uberagent, answering to Dr. Theodore Morris (Dennis Haysbert)
and pining for his wife, Lisa (Margaret Colin), and their daughter
(Heather Matarazzo).
 &HT;    ``At this point, I think Michael is more confident in his
role,'' the actor says. ``He's starting to get more accustomed to
his situation. He's more confident and less depressed than he was
before.
 &HT;    ``I'm curious to see where Glenn takes him,'' Close says. ``I'm
curious to learn more about Michael's past, more about what went on
in his life back when he was John Goodman. I don't know if Michael
went to war. Did he fight in Vietnam? Where did he go to college?
Aside from Roger (Gerrit Graham), who were his friends?
 &HT;    ``Hopefully, as we move along, Glenn will bring out those things
that made Michael who he was,'' he concludes. ``And I mean things
aside from the fact that he likes Snickers bars.''
 &HT;    If there's a gripe to be made about ``Now and Again,'' it's that
too often Dr. Morris has gone from trading buddy-buddy banter with
Wiseman to threatening to kill him if he disobeys orders. It didn't
take long before such idle threats lost credibility.
 &HT;    ``We've actually had that conversation,'' Close says, nodding.
``Several episodes ago, when Lisa came to visit Michael at the
townhouse, Dr. Morris told Michael, `If you guys run, I will kill
you.'
 &HT;    ``Basically, the way I played that was, `Oh, yeah, well, I've
heard that before,''' he says. ``And I didn't pay it much mind. We
all realized that Dr. Morris is becoming the boy who cried wolf.
 &HT;    ``I made the suggestion to Glenn that he should have Dr. Morris
actually follow through on one of his threats and kill someone, or
he should just stop having him make threats. I don't know what
they'll do.''
 &HT;    Only a few more weeks remain in ``Now and Again's'' debut
season, and CBS likely won't decide whether or not to renew the
show until the ratings for the last batch of episodes have been
analyzed.
 &HT;    Whatever happens, however, Close sounds pleased simply to be
part of a show that has received critical accolades and attracted a
deeply loyal core of viewers.
 &HT;    In other words, even if ``Now and Again'' is over and done, it's
been a success for Close.
 &HT;    ``I think the most important thing is that it adds to your
confidence,'' he says. ``You know that your career is moving along
and moving in the right direction. You know that the hard work is
paying off.
 &HT;    ``The goals that I've set for myself are being achieved, and I'm
blessed that that's happening.''

`TIME CODE': A DIGITAL PRISM REFRACTS REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Toward the end of ``Time Code,'' Ana Pauls (Mia Maestro), a
fetching young avant-garde filmmaker in a minimal black dress,
arrives at the offices of Red Mullet Productions to pitch a project
to a roomful of harried executives. Accompanied by the spacey
hip-hop stylings of her boyfriend (Alessandro Nivola), she drops
names _ Leibniz, Eisenstein, Walter Gropius, Guy DeBord _ like a
highfalutin gossip columnist or a desperately trendy graduate
student giving her first paper at the Modern Language Association.
In her heart-stopping, unplaceable accent, Ana explains that the
advances of art and technology have made it necessary for
filmmakers ``to go beyond the paradigm of collage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Montage has created a fake reality,'' she declares, and she
asks her listeners to imagine a film made not by slicing and
splicing but by four digital video cameras recording four separate
stories simultaneously in real time without cuts.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, she asks them to imagine the movie they inhabit:
the film we've been trying to absorb with our poor analog brains
and our low-resolution eyeballs for the previous hour or so. Alex
Green (Stellan Skarsgard), the Red Mullet honcho whose florid
dysfunction has bled upward and diagonally from the lower
right-hand quadrant of the screen for much of that time, pronounces
Ana's speech pretentious nonsense.
</P>
<P>
   Some impatient critics and exhausted viewers may want to apply
his judgment to ``Time Code'' itself, but the way the film pauses
for this priceless moment of self-satire before moving on to darker
matters is evidence of its brilliance. It's amazing to see a film
so brazenly experimental, so committed to reflecting on the
circumstances and techniques of its making, that is at the same
time so intent upon delivering old-fashioned cinematic pleasures
like humor and pathos, character and plot.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 19 Mike Figgis set out with four digital cameras and a
good-humored, adventurous ensemble of actors to explore the
multiple realities of filmmaking. The stories that diverge and
crisscross for 90 minutes disclose a slice of Hollywood whose
governing social conventions are easily gleaned: The primary
function of public restrooms is to provide convenient places to
snort cocaine, the dispensing of which is the primary function of
security guards. Everybody has a cell phone, and nobody has only
one sexual partner. Irony is as indistinguishable from sincerity as
loneliness is from intimacy. The difference between fantasy and
reality is, of course, moot.
</P>
<P>
   Like Robert Altman's ``Player,'' ``Time Code'' is at once a
mordant satire of the hypocrisy and self-delusion of the film
industry and an earnest declaration of faith in the medium itself.
And like Altman, Figgis places unusual _ to some, perhaps,
intolerable _ demands on the audience's attention. It's always a
breach of decorum to give away the ending of a movie, but ``Time
Code'' could be spoiled by a careless disclosure of the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the fun is the swirling disorientation of the opening
scenes, in which each sector of the screen comes to life with a
perfectly ordinary, utterly mysterious situation, the relationships
among which are far from apparent. In the upper left-hand quadrant,
two women (Salma Hayek and Jeanne Tripplehorn) take a tense
limousine ride, which is juxtaposed with another woman's therapy
session in the upper right, the arrival at Red Mullet of a chatty
English masseur (Julian Sands) on the lower left and a rambling
morning meeting at the bottom right.
</P>
<P>
   As the film progresses, you learn to direct your attention
according to cues from the soundtrack, and to parse the complex
geometry that links the four story lines as the characters pass
through them.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it's over, you feel you've mastered the movie's
rhythms well enough to see it again. And when you do, it will be
apparent that beneath the impressive technical bravura lies some
wonderful improvisational acting, ranging from Stephen Weber and
Holly Hunter's low-key schtick to Richard Edson's careening anxiety
to the rich, strong emotionalism of Tripplehorn, Saffron Burrows
and Skarsgard, whose entwined destinies send this satire staggering
toward the precipice of tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Well maybe not. Maybe, like Paul Thomas Anderson's ``Magnolia,''
another recent film to forsake the discipline of montage for the
reckless freedom of the long take, ``Time Code'' offers nothing
more than melodrama in the end. But both films leave you with the
exhilaration of having seen something genuinely and importantly
new.
</P>
<P>
   Figgis' recent films have been wildly overpraised (``Leaving Las
Vegas''), unfairly ridiculed (``The Loss of Sexual Innocence'') and
shockingly ignored (``Julie''). Each one presses, in different ways
and with varying degrees of success, against conventions of linear
storytelling and psychological exposition. In ``Time Code'' his
restless experimentalism at last yields completely satisfying
results.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it will ultimately be seen as bold prophecy of the new
digital dispensation or as a passionate, gimmicky curio is for the
future to decide. At present, it's hard to think of a more exciting
demonstration of the inexhaustible possibilities of film. Most
movies offer carefully calibrated insults to the intelligence. This
one just might make you smarter.

   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `AMERICAN PSYCHO,' starring Christian Bale. Directed by Mary
Harron (R, 104 minutes). Harron's sleekly brilliant screen
adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis' notorious 1991 novel pares away
most of the book's gore to portray the main character's homicidal
butchery as a high-gloss fantasy. The movie's chic blend of satire,
comedy and horror is anchored in a star-making performance by Bale
as Patrick Bateman, a fashion-obsessed late-'80s Wall Street
hotshot who goes on a killing spree. Reese Witherspoon, Chloe
Sevigny, Samantha Mathis and Cara Seymour give dazzling cameo
performances as the unfortunate women in his life. The movie's
message about a soulless, surface-obsessed society still applies
(Stephen Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BEAU TRAVAIL,' starring Denis Lavant and Gregoire Colin.
Directed by Claire Denis (not rated, 90 minutes). A loose
adaptation of ``Billy Budd,'' moved to the present and set in the
East African enclave of Djibouti, Denis' finest film to date
observes the day-to-day rituals of a troop of French Legionnaires
training in a harshly beautiful wasteland. The visually
spellbinding movie depicts their rigorous drills and rituals as
ecstatic rites of purification and the embodiment of an
impenetrable masculine mystique. In this version of the allegory,
the Claggart figure, Sergeant Galoup (Lavant), is a disillusioned
officer, and his prey (Colin), a soldier whose humanity offends the
sergeant. Not to be missed (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `BLACK AND WHITE,' starring Brooke Shields, Mike Tyson and
Robert Downey Jr. Directed by James Toback (R, 100 minutes).
Toback, who also wrote the script, hits the subject of white
teen-agers worshiping black culture with a chain saw, and chunks
fly. The movie dashes through more melodrama and moral crises than
an entire season of ``E.R.'' In addition to the bigger story, there
is a documentary filmmaker (Shields) and her fey husband (another
brilliant performance by Downey) shooting the whites trying to be
ghetto-fabulous; there's a street hustler (Power) out to go legit
in the recording business; a college hoop star (Allan Houston)
caught in a point-fixing scheme; and the weak, corrupt cop (Ben
Stiller) who traps him. The movie's sheer pop excitement carries
the day. And despite being about teen-agers, it's got an adult take
on shifting loyalties and envy (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE COLOR OF PARADISE,' starring Mohsen Ramezani and Hossein
Mahjur. Directed by Majid Majidi (PG, 90 minutes). This beautiful
Iranian movie about a widowed father who is reluctant to care for
his blind 8-year-old son is a heartbreaker done with such
conviction that it avoids mawkishness. When the special school the
boy has been attending won't keep him on, the father takes his son
first to the family's woodland homestead, then leaves him in the
care of a blind carpenter. The movie evokes nature with an ecstatic
sensuousness, and its heady soundtrack teems with the sounds of
birds, insects, wind and rain (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `EAST-WEST,' starring Sandrine Bonnaire, Oleg Menchikov and
Catherine Deneuve. Directed by Regis Wargnier (PG-13, 115 minutes).
After World War II the Soviet government undertook a propaganda
campaign to entice Russians living in the West to return home.
Alexsei Golovine (Menchikov) and his French wife, Marie (Bonnaire),
the couple at the heart of Wargnier's sumptuous, moving historical
melodrama, are luckier than most of their fellow returnees, who are
killed or imprisoned on arrival. ``East-West'' chronicles Alexsei's
ambivalence about their new life in a drab, depressing communal
apartment and Marie's desperate attempts to escape it. The film may
be faulted for dissolving the horrors of history in Hollywood-style
catharsis, but it also uses the resources of old-fashioned
emotionally emphatic filmmaking to shed light on forgotten history.
``East-West'' is a grand costume pageant, full of grandeur and
period detail, but it is also the portrait of a marriage under
extreme external and internal pressure, and a showcase for two
great film actresses: Bonnaire and Deneuve, playing an actress who
becomes aware of Marie's plight during a tour of the Soviet Union
(A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `ERIN BROCKOVICH,' starring Julia Roberts and Albert Finney.
Directed by Steven Soderbergh (R, 127 minutes). After a promising,
effective beginning in which Roberts proves what a fine actress she
can be and Soderbergh demonstrates yet again that he is one of the
most thoughtful and original directors in Hollywood, this becomes a
doggedly conventional crusader-for-justice Hollywood melodrama, a
smooth secondhand amalgam of ``Norma Rae'' and ``Silkwood,'' with
vigorous nods to ``The Rainmaker'' and ``A Civil Action.'' Roberts,
playing a working-class single mother who spearheads an effort to
win justice for victims of corporate negligence, aggressively
solicits an Oscar nomination. After acting for about 40 minutes,
Roberts spends the next 90 content to be a movie star. As the movie
drags on, her performance swells to bursting with moral vanity and
phony populism. It's as if she had a clause in her contract
strictly limiting anyone else's right to be attractive or appealing
on screen. Who could have foreseen that Soderbergh, the most
brilliantly unpredictable of filmmakers, could have made a movie so
utterly hokey and conventional? (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `THE FILTH AND THE FURY.' Directed by Julien Temple (R, 105
minutes). If you thought the passage of time had rendered the Sex
Pistols quaint objects of pop-culture nostalgia, Temple's
electrifying new documentary will make you think again. The film
presents the great, short-lived British punk band in all its
scabrous glory _ spewing obscenities on British television,
spitting at journalists and fans and generally smashing through the
drabness and hypocrisy of 1970s Britain like a brick through a shop
window. At a time when every obscenity or aesthetic shock tactic
feels like the product of either careful market research or dutiful
graduate-school training, the filth and the fury of British punk
rock at its moment of impact retains a surprising dignity. These
guys hated everything, but at least they believed in something.
Nihilism like this makes you glad to be alive (Scott).

<P>
   `HIGH FIDELITY,' starring John Cusack, Jill Peterson, Iben
Hjejle and Joan Cusack. Directed by Stephen Frears (R, 107
minutes). Although its setting has been moved from London to
Chicago, the screen adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling 1995
novel is wonderfully true to the spirit of the book. Cusack has one
of his juiciest roles in Rob, a 30-something record store manager
and vinyl fanatic sorting through the ``Top 5'' breakups in his
disastrous romantic history while trying to salvage his latest
relationship. The movie hilariously captures the mind-set of
not-so-young men for whom pop music is a kind of religion and hip
musical taste an ultimate measure of a person's worth (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `JOE GOULD'S SECRET.' Starring Sir Ian Holm, Stanley Tucci and
Hope Davis. Directed by Tucci (rated R, 108 minutes). Roaring with
obnoxious energy, Sir Ian has one of his greatest roles as Joe
Gould, the bohemian writer, alcoholic, loud-mouthed crank and
beggar immortalized in two New Yorker profiles by Joseph Mitchell.
The episodic movie, steeped in 1940s New York ambience, tracks the
relationship between Gould and the genteel Southern writer (Tucci)
who made him semifamous. But it is so one-sided that Mitchell
barely comes into focus. He is more observer than the participant
in their mutually exploitative relationship (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `KEEPING THE FAITH,' starring Edward Norton, Ben Stiller and
Jenna Elfman. Directed by Norton (PG-13, 129 minutes). Norton
doubles as actor and director in this competent comedy with a
premise that's both high concept and the punch line to a barroom
joke: a priest (Norton) and a rabbi (Stiller) fall in love with a
woman (Elfman) they've known since they were children. Norton
wisely chose not to make himself the star. He places that burden on
Stiller's shoulders, and both seem to be doing Woody Allen to
compensate for the underwritten material (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `LOVE AND BASKETBALL,' starring Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps.
Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (PG-13, 118 minutes). The
writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood's feature-film debut, about
the romantic and competitive bond between the basketball players
Monica (Lathan) and Quincy (Epps), has an enchanting, lived-in
homeyness. Prince-Bythewood does a wonderful job of creating an
atmosphere for her characters _ particularly for the superb Lathan
_ but the movie fails to fashion a consistent narrative. It doesn't
seem to be about anything. But it's a promising first movie from a
filmmaker with a lot to offer. Who knew anyone could get a drama
out of Title IX, the federal law ensuring that girls get a chance
to compete in high school sports (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE ROAD TO EL DORADO,' with the voices of Kevin Kline, Kenneth
Branagh and Rosie Perez. Directed by Eric Bibo Bergeron and Don
Paul (PG, 89 minutes). This animated buddy movie aspires to the
airiness of a Bob Hope-Bing Crosby road romp, but it's hopelessly
bland even by those timid 1940s standards. Kline and Branagh
provide the nearly interchangeable voices of two perky con men who
foil Hernando Cortes' 1519 invasion of the mythical El Dorado.
Though scenic and fast-paced, the main characters have no life, and
the movie plays history false. Elton John and Tim Rice provided six
clunky songs (Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `RULES OF ENGAGEMENT,' starring Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L.
Jackson. Directed by William Friedkin (R, 123 minutes). The two
powerhouse actors muster all the technique they can bring to bear
for this by-the-numbers courtroom drama with flashes of bruising
action: it's like the world's most expensive episode of ``JAG,''
with bits of ``The Verdict'' mixed in for extra flavor. Jones plays
a shaky, alcoholic Marine lawyer brought in to defend his fellow
marine (Jackson) against charges of military misconduct. Since
``Rules'' makes it clear from the outset that Jackson's character
is innocent, the only suspense comes from wondering whether Guy
Pearce, as the prosecutor, will be able to maintain his bizarre
accent (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `28 DAYS,' starring Sandra Bullock, Viggo Mortensen and Dominic
West. Directed by Betty Thomas (PG-13, 110 minutes). Sandra Bullock
gives a creditable performance as Gwen Cummings, a fun-loving New
York writer ordered to visit a drug and alcohol rehabilitation
clinic after a drunken car accident. Veering unsteadily between
comedy and suds, the movie portrays Gwen's fellow residents at
Serenity Glen as a bunch of goofy caricatures and confuses things
further with its dime-store psychologizing. It ultimately reduces
the rehab experience into a zany (but mostly unfunny) summer-camp
farce (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `U-571,' starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton and Harvey
Keitel. Directed by Jonathan Mostow (PG-13, 120 minutes). Mostow,
whose previous film, ``Breakdown,'' was a marvel of B-picture
minimalism, shifts from the wide-open spaces to the cramped
interior of a World War II submarine movie. McConaughey, whose
knotted-with-unease face makes it look as if he's cramming for
finals, is part of a secret mission to capture a Nazi
code-encryption machine and get it back to the Allies. He and his
crew have to do so on a Nazi U-boat they've subjacked. Mostow does
a fine job of building tension, given that he's working in a minor
genre whose climactic notes you'll know if you've ever seen a movie
set on a sub (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE VIRGIN SUICIDES,' starring Kirsten Dunst, James Woods and
Kathleen Turner. Directed by Sofia Coppola (R, 97 minutes).
Coppola's directorial debut, in a movie adapted from Jeffrey
Eugenides' 1993 novel about the self-destruction of five sisters in
a 1970s Michigan suburb, shows her to be a filmmaker with fine
visual and emotional instincts, adept at matching the book's
hypnotic, sensual black humor. The movie's best moments have an
inspired feeling of playfulness and freedom matched by Dunst's
smart, beguiling performance as Lux Lisbon, whose sexual awakening
propels her and her sisters to their doom. But despite Coppola's
keen instincts, and the beautifully understated acting of Woods and
Turner as the Lisbon parents, ``The Virgin Suicides'' is marred by
the self-conscious aestheticism and emotional detachment of its
source (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `WHERE THE MONEY IS,' starring Paul Newman. Directed by Marek
Kanievska (PG-13, 89 minutes). A heist comedy, bizarrely
overdirected at times, in which Newman comes through with a
thoughtful, lean performance. He's burned down to pure essence now,
and his concentration has never been better. That he chose to break
through in this wafer of a film about a convicted bank robber is a
shock; maybe he realizes he's only got a few shots left, and he
doesn't want to waste any of them. With Linda Fiorentino, who's
quite good herself once she lowers her vamping a few notches
(Mitchell).

 &HT;    Pilots' beef: flying the hungry skies
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Is the path to an airline pilot's heart through his
stomach?
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines is rolling out a new plan to ensure regular
in-flight meals for pilots, a move that could prevent a foodfight
from erupting in union contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Delta pilots now have no contractual provision for on-duty
meals, although the airline normally provides food for crews on
international routes. On domestic flights, which can last several
hours, surplus passenger meals are sometimes available but flight
attendants get first crack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes we get food and sometimes we don't,'' said 757
captain Andy Deane. ``In my personal experience, more often we
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Deane added the issue is about more than just grumbling
stomachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who's been on a long car trip or gone without a meal
knows it can have a physiological effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Deane, who's also a spokesman for Delta's Air Line Pilots
Association unit, said pilot contracts at American and United
mandate pilot meals. He said ALPA will seek such a provision in
contract talks now under way at Delta.
</P>
<P>
   But the issue may not be that sticky, since Delta is moving
ahead with a plan to provide regular pilot meals. Cost to the
airline: $3 million to $5 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Bushy, senior vice president-flight operations at Delta,
said the plan isn't just a reaction to the potential contract
demand. A pilot himself, Bushy said it's long bothered him, too,
that there wasn't a system to ensure pilots maintain regular eating
habits. He said it's one of several ``quality of life issues'' he's
tried to address since taking the post.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots get expense money and can buy food in airports and take
it aboard. But long lines and tight connections often don't allow
time for a food court stop. That practice has another disadvantage,
Deane noted, recalling a co-pilot who brought aboard overstuffed
subs that he stowed away until lunch time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole cockpit smelled like a deli,'' Deane said.

PUBLIX CHAIN TO PROVIDE ONLINE FOOD PURCHASING 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW SAUER   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herlad-Tribune   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Publix Super Markets Inc has announced plans to
enter online grocery selling.
</P>
<P>
   The supermarket chain said it would create a subsidiary to
provide the service and make all of its grocery items available for
home delivery or store pickup.
</P>
<P>
   Publix's announcement Wednesday did not say when the service
would start, but a spokeswoman said ``the company is moving forward
quickly.'' The company also did not announce a site address or an
explanation of costs for customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is speeding up the way groceries are purchased,''
said Howard Jenkins, chairman and chief executive of Publix, in a
statement issued Wednesday. ``People want this convenient service,
and Publix is preparing to meet that demand. Customers will receive
the same premier quality service they experience in our stores, but
literally at their fingertips.''
</P>
<P>
   The supermarket chain is searching for locations for warehouses
from where the orders would be filled. Publix said it has looked at
locations in major Florida and Georgia markets.
</P>
<P>
   Publix's effort is not unique. A number of national players
already are trying to entice people to buy groceries through their
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline.com, the Internet company best known for letting you
``name your own price'' for airline tickets and hotels, has a dozen
supermarket chains and approximately 1,200 stores in Philadelphia
and parts of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut participating in
its grocery-shopping service. The Priceline.com groceries, however,
are not delivered, but are assembled for shoppers to pick up at
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan Inc. of Foster City, Calif., is working with Bechtel
Group, a global engineering and consulting company, to create
highly automated distribution centers to deliver customers'
groceries in 26 markets across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Other larger online-grocery players have struggled with the
concept.
</P>
<P>
   Peapod Inc., Skokie, Ill., is the largest online grocer but was
down to its last $3 million this year before Dutch grocery retailer
Royal Ahold came to the rescue. Royal Ahold gave Peapod $73 million
in cash in exchange for 51 percent of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Publix, which is based in Lakeland, is owned and operated by its
119,500 employees. The supermarket chain had 1999 sales of $13.1
billion and has 625 stores in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and
Alabama.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAZARETH, Israel _ In the very shadow of the Christian and
Muslim holy sites that define this sleepy city's conservatism, Yara
Mashour, a tall and willowy young Nazarene, was contemplating
orgasms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has them, right?'' said Mashour, 26, the editor of a
slick new woman's magazine for Israeli Arabs, which is based here.
``So they shouldn't be taboo subjects. If people have sex and
people have orgasms, then they want to read about them _ even in
our community, or maybe especially in our community, where such
things are not discussed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mashour's first issue of the magazine, Lilac, came out this
month, its Arabic logo plastered, in lilac, on buses. It is the
first magazine, she believes, produced by Israeli Arab women for
Israeli Arab women. A first printing of 18,000 copies, at $2.50
each, sold out almost overnight in Israel, the West Bank and
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   The rose-pink cover features a pouty blond supermodel in a
slinky, revealing gown that is a long way from the local fashions.
</P>
<P>
   Decolletage and pink feather boas are not routine here. If there
is a look, it would best be described as covered-up. Even secular
Muslim and Christian women hesitate before revealing so much as an
upper arm, much less, like the cover model _ Esther Canadas, who is
Spanish _ an entire length of thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a far cry from our woman,'' said Afnan Safardi, a teacher
here, who looked at the cover once, averted his eyes, looked again,
and then turned the magazine over. ``It's hard for a lot of people
here to even look at this. It's not only that the woman is
half-naked. By our standards, she's ugly. She's bony and scary.''
</P>
<P>
   The cover image, which screams Cosmo Girl, hardly represents the
magazine's contents. The publication seems a bit confused about its
identity and comes across as a curious hybrid: Seventeen, People,
Ms. and The National Catholic Reporter, all rolled into one and
translated into an Arab setting.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the cover model, for instance, stands a far different
kind of tease, this one a promo for a long and sober portrait of a
Palestinian Catholic nun in Haifa: ``I don't feel the separation
between being a nun and a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue also includes a profile of an Egyptian feminist _ ``A
woman's dignity does not reside in her hymen,'' she says daringly _
and an extensive article on plastic surgery, which, as one can
imagine, is as commonplace in Israeli Arab villages as Manolo
Blahnik mules. ( Not very, that is, although a Lilac survey of 525
local Arabs revealed a latent desire for nose jobs and tummy
tucks.)
</P>
<P>
   But Mashour, who is Catholic, is speaking to a minority within
the minority of Israeli Arabs, who make up 1.2 million out of
Israel's 6 million people.
</P>
<P>
   She is speaking to other young women like herself, who are
educated, Western-styled and determined to pursue a career or delay
marriage or otherwise assert themselves in both frivolous and
serious ways. About 20 percent of 600,000 Israeli Arab women work
outside the home; some are breaking barriers, like the first
Palestinian flight attendant for El Al, who is showcased in the
Israeli airline's advertisement in the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided this is going to be a magazine for modern women,''
Mashour said. ``And I have a feeling it's going to be a magazine
for not-so-modern women either. We sold many, many issues in a
religious Muslim town.''
</P>
<P>
   Mashour and her sister Varia, 25, who runs their family's
advertising agency, are atypical, even for Westernized Israeli Arab
women.
</P>
<P>
   While they are rebels in their society, their rebellion is
fostered by their parents, Vida and Lutfi Mashour, who publish a
twice-weekly newspaper aimed at Israeli Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mashours took the rare step of sending their girls abroad to
study. The sisters traveled first to the United States, where they
graduated from Belmont Abbey College, a small Catholic liberal arts
school near Mashour relatives in North Carolina. Then they moved to
England, where they both earned master's degrees in political
theory from the London School of Economics and are pursuing
doctorates from King's College London.
</P>
<P>
   Both the sisters are single _ ``not over the hill, off the
map,'' Varia Mashour said _ and encouraged to stay that way by
their mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always advise them to wait and my husband gets mad,'' Mrs.
Mashour said.
</P>
<P>
   They returned to Israel partly because their dissertation topics
require research here, but also to try making a life for themselves
in a place where they don't feel entirely comfortable. They share
mixed feelings about Israeli Arab life. Well off and well scrubbed,
they are routinely grilled by Israeli security officials when they
leave the country. After years of being treated like intellectual
and social equals abroad, they say, they are outraged at being
treated like suspects in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day I do not feel 100 percent Israeli,'' Yara Mashour
said. ``I perceive myself to be a Palestinian Arab who lives here,
and there is no certainty that I will remain.``
</P>
<P>
   In Nazareth, though, where the sisters were raised and the
family is prominent, they are cocooned in the business. Lilac is a
family enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mashour writes editorials, and Mr. Mashour a column called
``Confessions of a Man.'' Another relative, Dr. Mary
Mashour-Haddad, who was the first Israeli Arab woman to become a
doctor, writes an advice column.
</P>
<P>
   (In this issue, under the headline ``He offered me a drink, I
woke up in his bedroom,'' Mashour-Haddad advises a young woman to
report a sexual assault to the police if she is brave enough. ``But
if you think publicizing this will create a scandal that harms your
reputation and might lead to acts that could be avoided'' _ a
reference to revenge by her relatives _ ``then I support your
decision not to file a complaint and I ask you to pay attention to
your health.'')
</P>
<P>
   (STORY MAY END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Although sexual politics permeate the magazine, other politics
are absent. Palestinian nationalism doesn't sell like it used to,
publishers say.
</P>
<P>
   Atalla Anjjar, who founded the first local Arab-language
magazine for women in 1987, started out with a very different kind
of publication.
</P>
<P>
   Abir, his Jerusalem-based magazine, used to feature a local
woman in traditional embroidered dress on every cover. The articles
ranged from interviews with female student leaders to interviews
with the mothers of ``martyrs,'' young men who died for the
Palestinian cause.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Anjjar, too, is showing cleavage on his magazine
covers, and Palestinian nationalism has given way to what he calls
``fabricated tales of genies,'' and sensational rape stories, and
love stories including some ``sexual details.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The younger generation is so frustrated with the peace process
that they just want escapism,'' Anjjar said. ``And we feed them
what they want. We are like the owner of a shoe store who sees his
neighbor making lots of money selling drugs. We are closing down
our shoe store and getting into the drug business. We are
corrupting our society.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mashour, proud of what she considers the purely feminist
stories, is not guilt-racked at all by the rest of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``People ask me, isn't this rather shallow stuff?'' she said,
pointing to a story listing ``26 Reasons to Break Up with Him.''
(``If he's an addict; if he's a spendthrift; if his friends are
disgusting; if instead of talking about marriage, he turns to
sports.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you want deep, read a book!''

   HO CHI MINH CITY _ The young businessman peered out of the large
open front of his restaurant and talked about the policemen who
drop in, pausing to drink, chat and, almost always, ask for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come every day,'' he said, gesturing with a smile toward
a local police station across a street crowded with small shops.
``They say they are collecting taxes, but they put it in their
wallet.''
</P>
<P>
   Try to complain, he said, his smile turning into a grimace,
``and they follow you, step by step, or come and question you in
the middle of the night, or take you away.''
</P>
<P>
   The description typifies the sense of quiet discontent here 25
years after victorious North Vietnamese troops swept into the city,
driving the U.S.-backed Saigon government from power, sending
thousands into re-education camps and installing their own
officials at every layer of the bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   It is a largely hidden struggle in which people accept the need
for compromise, avoid political discussion, hustle for survival as
capitalists in a communist framework _ and reveal inner feelings
and complaints amid pleas for anonymity and furtive looks to see if
informants are listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we think about our lives, we just put our feelings
in our hearts,'' said an old schoolmate of the businessman. ``You
cannot say anything. All you say is the war is over for 25 years,
and you try to make money the best way you can.''
</P>
<P>
   While store windows are full of luxury goods, fresh produce
fills food markets and prices for necessities are far below those
of the rest of region, people here describe a two-tiered system in
which the victors reap the rewards while everyone else pays ``under
the table'' to survive.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who work in the government can do anything they want,''
said Nguyen Thi Huong, wife of a former South Vietnamese soldier,
now working on a small farm on the outskirts of the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't have any rules,'' said the woman, talking as her
husband remained carefully silent. ``They have their own rules.
They can change them any time. If you worked with the Americans,
for the old government, it's very hard to find a job, and your
children cannot get good jobs either. The Communists don't trust
anyone from the previous army.''
</P>
<P>
   She looked enviously on the large families of party workers and
officials, some of them old-line liberation fighters given
influential bureaucratic posts as a reward for their years ``in the
jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of them may have five or six children,'' she said. ``They
run large stores or work in government companies on joint ventures.
They grow more rich and powerful as time goes on. We just try to
stay where we are.''
</P>
<P>
   Resourceful and cynical, the city and its people defy authority
partly by ignoring the ideology of communist rule, preferring to
live up to the culture left behind by the Americans and the French
colonialists before them.
</P>
<P>
   More so than in other one-time enclaves of U.S. influence in old
``South Vietnam,'' the legacy endures here in a mood of
hard-driving materialism that impresses a visitor as little changed
from the height of ``the American time'' that peaked in the decade
before April 30, 1975.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, the phenomenon of corruption today echoes the
massive pilferage of a succession of American-backed South
Vietnamese government and military leaders, fattened economically
by U.S. aid and accustomed to extracting whatever they could from
local business people. ``Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose''
_ the more things change, the more they stay the same _ remarked
the French-educated son of a former high-ranking official from a
bygone era. ``Maybe the Communists are learning from us.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities respond to the corruption by occasional arrests,
along with denunciations of the evils of corruption, but no one in
business here seems to be listening. The overwhelming instinct is
to cling to old habits while fighting to adapt to new realities.  &LR;  &QL;

<P>
   The need to pay off extends to all areas of life, from getting
into a university to graduating to finding a job to paying for
licenses and permissions to signing contracts to getting permits to
leave the country. ``Everything costs money,'' said Duong Pham, an
engineer with a construction company.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to do anything, you must give money,'' said Pham.
``If you don't give money, maybe five or 10 years later, they sign
the form for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Communists control the big companies. Maybe we make enough
to live, but we cannot put anything in the bank. The Communist
Party people, the government officials are the rich ones. They get
rich from bribes and from state trading companies.''
</P>
<P>
   That backstage view contrasted with the superficial image of a
society surging to expand as glistening glass-and-steel high-rises
loom above traditional neighborhoods that have changed little since
American military vehicles crowded the streets and U.S. officials,
GIs and contractors filled rambling villas and apartment buildings
behind sandbags and barbed wire. &QL;   &LR;  &QL;

   Some of the seeming prosperity of this and lesser urban centers
may be attributed to funds sent to relatives back home by more than
2 million Vietnamese now living overseas. Remittances last year
were estimated at $3 billion.

   ``When you see middle-class people with much money, they
probably got it from overseas,'' said an elderly Vietnamese man
with two grown-up sons and a daughter in California. ``Some people
from abroad come back here just to live cheaply.''
</P>
<P>
   Nguyen Ngoc Minh, a writer, laughed when reminded of the
appearance of exuberant capitalism in the center of a metropolitan
region of more than 5 million people that accounted for well over
50 percent of the country's gross domestic product of $28 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreigners come to Vietnam, and they always have the feeling

while the government relaxed economic restrictions and extended
certain freedoms, including the right to worship.

finally undermine the authority of the North, leaving the southern
region quasi-independent from central authority.

 &HT;    Bets are that `Viva Rock Vegas' isn't worth a yabba-dabba-doo
 &HT;    By Dave Larsen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Universal Pictures takes ``The Flintstones'''
appeal for
</P>
<P>
   ``granite.''
</P>
<P>
   The studio's Bronto-budgeted, live-action version of the popular
'60s cartoon was a critical dud, but the 1994 film made more than
$350 million at the box office worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, ``The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas'' _ a lame chip off
the ol' block.
</P>
<P>
   Again directed by Brian Levant, the corny romantic comedy is a
prequel that recounts how the modern Stone Age family first met.
The plot, which involves wealthy heiress Wilma Slaghoople falling
for blue-collar construction worker Fred Flintstone, doesn't run
much deeper than the two-dimensional cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Univershell,'' as the studio's lashed-bones logo appears
on-screen, has scaled back the production compared with the
original film. The colorful prehistoric sets aren't nearly as
elaborate, and the more youthful characters are portrayed by a
B-list cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Full Monty's'' Mark Addy replaces John Goodman as Fred.
Joan Collins takes over for Elizabeth Taylor as his disapproving
future mother-in-law, Pearl Slaghoople.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the rock-bottom casting is film's greatest asset.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Baldwin (``The Usual Suspects'') is ideal as Fred's
blank-eyed buddy, Barney Rubble. Baldwin nails Barney's voice, as
well as his shoulder-shaking, ``heh-heh-heh'' laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Cumming (``Titus'') is also perfect as the little green
alien, the Great Gazoo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal's'' Jane Krakowski doesn't master Betty O'Shale's
giggle as well as Rosie O'Donnell did in the first film, but she is
the spitting-image of her cartoon counterpart.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their game performances, ``Viva Rock Vegas'' is hardly a
gay old time.
</P>
<P>
   More effort went into the cartoonish-looking costumes and sets
than into the story, which finds Fred vying for the affection of
Wilma (Kristen Johnston) with suave and debonair casino owner Chip
Rockefeller (Thomas Gibson). Gazoo has been sent to Earth to
observe the mating habits of primitive humans. At most, it's mildly
amusing.
</P>
<P>
   There are few big laughs, and the best of those will sail over
young viewers' heads.
</P>
<P>
   Barney takes an early leave from a double date, telling Fred
that Betty has offered to come back to their place and make him
breakfast in the morning. ``I don't know what we're going to do
until then, but I can't turn down a good meal,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the film's humor is of the juvenile pie-in-the-face,
spit-take variety.
</P>
<P>
   The funniest sight gags, such as the ``Polarock'' camera bird
that rapidly chisels the photographic image on stone, are lifted
straight from the television series.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Henson's Creature Shop again provides the dinosaur puppets,
including a rambunctious baby Dino. The visual highlights are
several computer-generated dinosaur sequences, such as a looping
Bronto Roller Coaster and a Bronto drawbridge.
</P>
<P>
   After ``Viva Rock Vegas,'' the ``Flintstones'' franchise should
go the way of the dinosaur.

DON'T JUDGE THOMPSON RIGHT AWAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Justin Thompson had a 5.11 earned-run average
in 24 starts for the Detroit Tigers last year while pitching in
pain much of the time.
</P>
<P>
   He's healthy now and close to returning to the rotation, but the
Rangers will be lucky if Thompson has an ERA as low as 5.11 by the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   That's the harsh reality for pitchers coming back from surgery
and a major arm injury. They need time, lots of time. They need
time in the training room, in the weight room and on the mound, and
a handful of starts in the minor leagues isn't going to be enough.
</P>
<P>
   As eager as the Rangers are to get Thompson in their rotation,
it's foolish to think he's going to have an immediate impact. He is
not going to be the pitcher he was in 1997, when he made the
American League All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   At least not right away.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Perisho knows that as well as anybody. He underwent
shoulder surgery on Aug. 5, 1998, to repair a torn labrum and
rotator cuff, then bounced back to win 15 games at Triple-A
Oklahoma last year.
</P>
<P>
   But he said it took time for the aches, pain and soreness to go
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me about 100 innings,'' Perisho said. ``I told Justin
eventually the burning goes away and you start feeling great again.
It will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Perisho made 27 starts for Oklahoma last year. He was 7-6 with a
6.13 ERA in his first 17 games and 8-1 with a 2.71 ERA in his
remaining 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess that's what I've got to look forward to,'' Thompson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The same can be said for Kerry Wood, Matt Morris, John Smoltz
and Scott Elarton, all of whom have undergone major arm surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers would probably be best-served keeping Thompson in
the minors until his 30-day medical rehabilitation assignment runs
out May 15. But their thinking clearly seems to be that he doesn't
need to be Tom Glavine as long as he's better than Mark Clark.
</P>
<P>
   That might be the case right now, especially considering what
happened with Clark on Wednesday at The Ballpark. But the best-case
scenario is probably Thompson needing two months to build arm
strength and control, then doing in the second half for the Rangers
what Esteban Loaiza did last year.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 2001, watch out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a betting man, even as much as he pitches this
summer, he'll be better next summer,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
``It's going to take a little longer for him to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson is still the most-important player acquired in the Juan
Gonzalez trade, even if Francisco Cordero looks like the only
keeper right now. Who knows? Maybe in 20 years it will be known as
the Francisco Cordero trade.
</P>
<P>
   For all the post-trade garbage being spewed about Gonzalez being
moody, selfish and a distraction in the clubhouse, it's becoming
more and more obvious the Rangers miss that big bat in the middle
of the lineup. That's no indictment on Gabe Kapler, who's better
than what he has shown so far and should have a long and productive
stay in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   However, even with all the spring-training euphoria and the
``Attitude is Everything'' marketing campaign, it was stupid to
even suggest the Rangers wouldn't miss Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   He might not be much for diving for fly balls, but he didn't win
those two MVP awards for congeniality and looking good in a bathing
suit. Just wait until he shows up next year at The Ballpark looking
quite dapper in that Yankees uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Kapler was never the central figure in that trade. Thompson was.
If the Rangers were going to trade a Hall of Fame run producer and
become a better team in the process, they needed to get a very good
starting pitcher in return.
</P>
<P>
   They did. He is. He just needs time.

   HO CHI MINH CITY _ There is a quiet discontent here 25 years
after victorious North Vietnamese troops swept into Saigon on April
29, 1975, driving the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government from
power, sending thousands into re-education camps and installing
their own officials at every layer of the bureaucracy. It is a
largely hidden struggle in which people accept the need for
compromise, avoid political discussion, hustle for survival as
capitalists in a communist framework _ and reveal inner feelings
and complaints amid pleas for anonymity and furtive looks to see if
informants are listening...By Don Kirk, The International Herald

beleaguered Benjamin Netanyahu's performance on almost every front.

   HO CHI MINH CITY _ There is a quiet discontent here 25 years
after victorious North Vietnamese troops swept into Saigon on April
29, 1975, driving the U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government from
power, sending thousands into re-education camps and installing
their own officials at every layer of the bureaucracy. It is a
largely hidden struggle in which people accept the need for
compromise, avoid political discussion, hustle for survival as
capitalists in a communist framework _ and reveal inner feelings
and complaints amid pleas for anonymity and furtive looks to see if
informants are listening...By Don Kirk, The International Herald

   HO CHI MINH CITY _ One of the most celebrated photographs of the
Vietnam war, which gave the world so many haunting images, was
taken during the last few hours of April 29, 1975. It captured the
final chaotic moments before the American evacuation was complete.
Now, 25 years after the photograph was taken by UPI photographer
Hubert Van Es, it has emerged that the building in the picture was
not the U.S. Embassy but, in fact, an apartment block, some
distance away from the embassy compound. Most of the people in the
photograph were Vietnamese...By Fiona Bell, The Independent &QL;

slogan which turned Ehud Barak from old soldier into Israel's new

beleaguered Benjamin Netanyahu's performance on almost every front.
Nearly a year later, though, the same staccato mantra could now be
used against the man for whom it helped secure a rare landslide
victory. The wave of giddy optimism that flooded Israel with
Barak's election last May has melted away. And _ against all odds _
Netanyahu is beginning once again to make a serious showing in the

   WASHINGTON _ A few days before setting off for the U.S. to speak
at a conference in Boston of the Palestinians' ``Right of Return''
to their homes in pre-Israel Palestine, I walked again through the
ruins of the Sabra and Chatila Palestinian refugee camp in Beirut,
where up to 2,000 civilians were massacred by Israel's Lebanese
Christian allies in 1982. I've been there perhaps a hundred times
since the slaughter, yet the place never ceases to horrify me. If I
lived there, I always think, I'd go mad. Is it any wonder that the
Arabs are losing the Middle East's war of words? That American
liberals fail to understand the real dangers of their hopelessly
biased policy in the region? Or that America and the Sabra Chatila
refugee camp are a million miles apart?...By Robert Fisk, The

POKEMON COMES FULL CIRCLE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OK, stick with me on this: in the beginning, there was Pokemon,
a delightfully involved but graphically simple pair of nearly
identical games for Nintendo's Game Boy handheld machine that
spawned an entire industry's worth of spinoff products.
</P>
<P>
   That fabulously successful franchise begat a trading-card game
(and massive secondary market for collectible rare cards) from
Wizards of the Coast, the same company that created Magic: The
Gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Several billion dollars and goodness knows how many skipped
homework assignments later, we now have arrived back where we
started, with a Game Boy game based on the trading-card game based
on the Game Boy game. Got all that?
</P>
<P>
   The new Game Boy game is called, in a nomenclatural stretch, the
Pokemon Trading Card Game. And like its predecessors, it's pretty
darned involved and pretty darned good.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference is that it cuts out most of the adventure
part of the original. Where Pokemon Red, Blue (and eventually
Yellow) focused heavily on capturing and ``training'' all 151
Pokemon in a lengthy adventure, the new game's focus is on building
up a ``deck'' of cards, including basic Pokemon, its upgrades,
energy cards that allow characters to fight and retreat, and other
special cards.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it's much like the game you can play with the
trading cards, with a sparse narrative skeleton that hangs together
all the duels and deck building. As ever, the details of what each
creature does well and poorly are as arcane, even as Byzantine, as
any parent can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   It can make for an involving game, but that different structure
may prove somewhat frustrating to children who collected the
trading cards but never played the game based on the cards. The
transfer to an electronic version has many virtues, but simplicity
isn't one of them.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike the original Red and Blue games, this game doesn't
ease players into its complexities as gently, if my test boy, the
normally overachieving 7-year-old Pokey-maniac Dakota, is any
guide.
</P>
<P>
   It allows head-to-head play (using the Game Link cable) and you
can print out the 18 ``exclusive'' cards in the electronic version
on your Game Boy Printer.
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot to the game if you're into the series, but parents
of younger children should tread carefully. This one might be best
for the card sharps.
</P>
<P>
   Doing it the HD way
</P>
<P>
   The long wait is over at KCET-TV, the Los Angeles public
television station that's been waiting _ and waiting _ to erect the
transmitting tower that would allow it to join other Los Angeles
stations in broadcasting digital television programming, both in
high- and standard-definition formats.
</P>
<P>
   The debut on May 17 of ``Rainier: The Mountain,'' a look at the
tallest active volcano in the Lower 48, will finally end the
station's minor misadventures with its tower, allowing it to join
the city's commercial stations in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   KCET initially looked like it would be able to join that club
not long after the commercial stations kicked on their transmitters
in the fall of 1998. The station had raised $12.5 million for a
showy digital broadcast center that opened last fall and was
raising other money, for a total of $20 million, to pay for new
programming only possible with digital.
</P>
<P>
   But the new center couldn't be fully used because a federal
grant that would pay for the transmitting tower was repeatedly
delayed. No tower, no signal, no digital, no nothing.
</P>
<P>
   But the grant finally arrived, the tower was completed in March,
and beginning May 17, the station will begin broadcasting high-def
programming, with ``Rainier'' and a May 24 broadcast of ``Sahara.''
With an HDTV tuner, you can pick up the broadcast on Channel 59.
</P>
<P>
   You can see some bits of test programming now on the station's
channel 59 (you'll need an HDTV-capable tuner to get it), but the
station plans to soon do more than just show occasional gorgeous
documentaries.
</P>
<P>
   Within a month or so, it plans to take advantage of digital's
multicasting abilities to run three standard-definition channels of
programming on parts of the same high-definition frequency,
basically channels 59.1, 59.2 and 59.3, during the day and when
it's not showing big ``event'' programs in high-definition format.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have a choice of children's programming on PBS Kids, 30
different college courses on PBS YOU and a digital version of the
station's regular analog broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   Digital's ability to simultaneously send three lower-resolution
signals through the same high-definition digital channel has been
little exploited so far locally, but holds great promise in the
future for just this sort of intelligently segmented programming.
It's very good news for fans of digital television.
</P>
<P>
   Make A List
</P>
<P>
   One little side effect of the ability to split a high-definition
TV signal into three or more standard-definition broadcasts is some
serious confusion for the companies that provide TV listings, said
KCET's Laurel Lambert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've called a couple of the services and asked what they were
going to do and they said `I don't know,''' Lambert said. They have
to figure out how to show the multicasting, which typically will be
done in daytime and other off-peak hours, and then the high-def
broadcasts done in prime time. And even if a station isn't
multicasting, it may show very different programs sometimes on its
digital and analog channels.

<P>
   Game winners
</P>
<P>
   Want a quick rundown on the best games of 1999? Take a gander at
the finalists for top honors in next month's Interactive
Achievement Awards, overseen by the Academy of Interactive Arts and
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The awards spotlight the best of the 1,900 or so titles released
last year by the $6 billion video- and computer gaming industry.
Nominees for Game of the Year are:
</P>
<P>
   Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings (on PC; a particular
favorite of mine); Donkey Kong 64 (Nintendo 64; the big ape
continues to throw his weight around); Pokemon Yellow (Game Boy; a
nominee though it differs little from its powerhouse Red and Blue
predecessors); Soul Calibur (Dreamcast; the best-looking console
fighter title ever); The Sims (PC; a complex, involving simulation
of, well, you and me); and Unreal Tournament (PC; the year's best
first-person shooter).
</P>
<P>
   Age of Empires II had the most nominations overall _ seven,
including four in the ``craft'' categories _ fitting given its
handsome and deep game play.
</P>
<P>
   In the Console Game of the Year category, add the great driving
games Crazy Taxi (Dreamcast) and Driver and Gran Turismo 2 (both on
PlayStation), and the first really good extreme sports title, Tony
Hawk's Pro Skater (on PlayStation, but recently available on N64
and Game Boy) to the console nominees for Game of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   In the Computer Game of the Year finalists, add the fabulous
space war simulation Homeworld; the involving theme-park simulation
Roller Coaster Tycoon; and Command &AMP; Conquer: Tiberian Sun, an
excellent sequel that nonetheless disappointed fans who wanted more
innovation in the latest from the ground-breaking, real-time
strategy series.
</P>
<P>
   The awards ceremony will be held at the Biltmore Hotel on May
11, the first night of the massive Electronic Entertainment Expo at
the Los Angeles Convention Center. Comedian Martin Short will host,
and though it's not like the Oscars, you'd better have a ticket to
get in. &QL;

MORE REFORMIST NEWSPAPERS ARE SHUT DOWN IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran's Islamic hard-liners intensified their
attack on reformers Thursday, summarily closing a daily newspaper
run by the brother of President Mohammad Khatami and another
newspaper run by a Khatami adviser who was the target of an
assassination attempt last month.
</P>
<P>
   The court orders accused the two pro-Khatami papers, Moshareket
and Sobh-e Emruz, of the all-encompassing crimes of insulting Islam
and spreading corruption. Between them, the two newspapers had a
daily circulation of about 400,000.
</P>
<P>
   The latest actions brought the escalating political conflict
between the reformers, who hold the presidency and recently made
strong gains in parliamentary elections, and the conservative
Islamic clerics who still wield the highest state powers, directly
to the president's doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   Moshareket is run by Mohammad Reza Khatami, the president's
younger brother and the top vote-getter in parliamentary elections
in Tehran two months ago. Sobh-e Emruz is run by Saeed Hajjarian,
the main political strategist for the reformers, who barely
survived a bullet wound to his face a few weeks after pro-Khatami
candidates swept to victory in the first round of parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   A third publication, the weekly Ava based in the city of
Esphehan, was also ordered to close Thursday. Ava is closely tied
to a prominent dissident, Ayatollah Hossein Ali Montazeri, who has
been under house arrest since 1997 because of his acerbic criticism
of Iran's system of clerical rule.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 16 reformist newspapers have now been closed in the past
five days by the conservative-dominated courts, all without a
hearing. In addition, three journalists have been jailed over the
past week, and two more, both leading voices of the movement for
social and political change, are scheduled for trial next week on
charges of offending religious sensibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining seven national daily newspapers in operation are
all associated with hard-line religious factions or with Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani, the still-powerful former Iranian president who
was humiliated in the Feb. 18 parliamentary elections and won
barely enough votes in Tehran to win a seat.
</P>
<P>
   Reform leaders have said that the closing of their newspapers
violates provisions of the Iranian constitution and its press law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only a violation of Iranian law, but a violation of
Iran's obligation to uphold freedom of expression,'' said Elahe
Hicks, a representative of Human Rights Watch in New York who is on
a research mission in Iran. ``This increasing intimidation and the
closings are clearly politically motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Tehran, the news of the latest closings left
many people anxious and angry, with some saying they feared this
was a prelude to an attempt to oust President Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   But reformers have urged the public, especially university
students who have boycotted classes and held on-campus protests
since the crackdown, to avoid confrontations that could get out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to do something to make people excited and come out
on the streets,'' said Mohammad Ali Bakhtiari, a 25-year-old civil
engineer. ``Then they can aggravate the situation and say the
government of Mr. Khatami is not capable of running the country.''
But Iranians will heed the call of reformers to remain calm, he
added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can do nothing but wait,'' Bakhtiari said. ``We know we
should control ourselves and not give the hard-liners what they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Editors at the closed newspapers declined to comment Thursday.
But one of the pro-reform journalists who is facing trial next week
said that even if leaders advocate calm, there could be a dangerous
public backlash against the hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've experienced this repression for years, so we are used to
bitterness,'' said Emadeddin Baghi, one of the editors of Fath, a
national pro-reform daily that was opened five months ago after
conservatives closed an earlier incarnation. ``But it's going to
cost the country a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Fath was one of 12 newspapers that the conservative courts
ordered closed on Sunday. Another of its editors was sent to prison
a few days before the closing.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, whose landslide win in 1997 has been seen by members of
the religious establishment as a threat to their powers, has
maintained a stoic silence on the specific issue of the banned
newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   But in a speech to city council members in Tehran Thursday
morning, before the public announcement of the new press bans, he
repeated his constant theme, appealing to Iranians to settle their
political differences peacefully and according to the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's powers as president are limited. Ultimate authority
rests with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who owes his
position to the clerical hierarchy. Even legislation endorsed by
the president must often pass first through a committee headed by
Rafsanjani and a conservative-dominated council appointed by the
supreme leader.
</P>
<P>
   Ayatollah Khamenei on Wednesday condemned ``elements'' in the
pro-Khatami press, but lavishly praised the president.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his circumscribed powers, Khatami has managed to convey
symbolic authority as a promoter of greater freedom of expression,
political pluralism and democracy. Under his rule, a lively
independent press has expanded and taken up long-taboo subjects
such as the security services and the elite Revolutionary Guards
Corps.
</P>
<P>
   His popularity among Iran's young people, a majority in the
population, was demonstrated in the parliamentary elections two
months ago, when his supporters triumphed in the first round of
voting on the strength of their allegiance to him.
</P>
<P>
   But as the hard-liners' vise tightened around the reform
movement in the past few weeks, Khatami has watched the
conservatives and their demands for Islamic purity in the press
undermine one of his few concrete achievements of the past three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The shutout of the reform press effectively denies Khatami's
supporters any outlet to promote their candidates in next week's
parliamentary runoff elections. It also ensures that they will not
report to the public on the defense arguments of the accused
journalists and several sensitive ongoing trials.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Several of the closed newspapers have reported extensively on
the killings two years ago of several pro-democracy activists and
have accused security forces of carrying out the assassinations.
Suspects in that case are expected to go on trial soon. Akbar
Ganji, a journalist who wrote many of the articles on the case, was
sent to jail last week after a court accused him of defaming Iran.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the trial of eight men accused in the murder attempt
on Hajjarian, the managing director of Sobh-e Emruz, opened in
Tehran. One man has confessed in court to the shooting, saying it
was justified according to Islamic law because he believed the
newspaper editor was against Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Hajjarian is still hospitalized. The court said it shut his
newspaper Thursday in part because the job of director has been
kept open for Hajjarian, leaving no one to answer for dozens of
complaints from conservatives that Sobh-e Emruz was spreading
corruption.
</P>
<P>
   In another trial in Tehran, several police officers stand
accused of participating in a bloody raid on a student dormitory
last year. The raid followed student protests at the closing of a
national pro-reform paper in July and touched off violent protests.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Miss Saigon,'' the epic Vietnam War musical that
landed a helicopter onstage, sparked a fevered debate about race
and casting, and has now played the Broadway Theater for more than
nine years, will close its run on New Year's Eve, its producer said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The musical, a loose adaptation of Puccini's opera ``Madama
Butterfly,'' will have played 4,063 performances, making it the
sixth longest-running show in Broadway history.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron Mackintosh, the British impresario who produced ``Miss
Saigon,'' said Thursday that the show had simply run its course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an amazing run,'' Mackintosh said, speaking from
London. ``I'm very proud of the work, and very proud of the work
the actors and crew have given. It's a better show now than when we
opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Opened at a cost of $10.9 million, which made it the most
expensive show ever at the time, ``Miss Saigon'' is expected to
leave Broadway having grossed more than $280 million, and having
been seen by more than 6 million people, numbers that place it in
rare company in the theatrical world.
</P>
<P>
   But the news of its closing also comes at a time when the
splashy British megamusicals defined by works like ``Les
Miserables'' and ``Phantom of the Opera'' seem to be slowly giving
way to a new generation of shows.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the fall of ``Saigon'' comes just two months after word
that ``Cats,'' the longest-running show in Broadway history (7,329
performances and counting), would close on June 25.
</P>
<P>
   Derided by some critics as valuing flashy effects over
substance, musicals of this kind rely heavily on stage pyrotechics,
and ``Miss Saigon'' is no exception, with an elaborate sequence in
Act II depicting the evacuation of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon. In
it, a helicopter descends from the rafters, lands onstage, picks up
evacuees and lifts off again.
</P>
<P>
   The effect repeatedly wowed audiences, making the show a hot
ticket for fans of musicals and stage magic alike. But like
``Cats,'' the show had become increasingly dependent on tourists as
the years passed. Of late, that audience has diminished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had very few losing weeks,'' Mackintosh said. ``But as
with any show, the longer you go into your run, the harder it is to
maintain those levels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Saigon,'' with music by Claude-Michel Schonberg and
lyrics by Alain Boublil, was a smash critical and popular hit in
London's West End in 1989. And it made headlines even before
opening in New York, but not necessarily the sort producers like.
</P>
<P>
   Mackintosh had decided to import his British stars, Jonathan
Pryce and Lea Salonga, to Broadway. Asian-American actors objected,
saying the roles should be recast with Asian-American performers.
</P>
<P>
   Actors Equity, the union of actors and stage managers, sided
with the U.S. actors and initially denied permission for Pryce to
perform, on the ground that a Caucasian actor should not play a
Eurasian. (His character, the Engineer, was French-Vietnamese.)
</P>
<P>
   Equity's decision caused a major outcry among union members and
prompted Mackintosh to cancel plans to transfer the production.
Equity quickly reversed its decision.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, the controversy was reopened when Salonga,
who was born in the Philippines, was denied permission to perform.
That, too, prompted a hue and cry; the issue was eventually
resolved in Salonga's favor by an arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   The show, with a $100 top ticket, another Broadway high, finally
opened in April 1991 to strong reviews. Frank Rich, writing in The
New York Times, said the musical was ``gripping entertainment'' and
the ``most exciting of the so-called English musicals.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Pryce and Salonga won Tony Awards for their work.
</P>
<P>
   The show paid back its investors in just 39 weeks, a nearly
unheard-of rate of return.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'd ever dreamt of having one show as successful as `Miss
Saigon,''' Macintosh said, ``I'd be a happy man.''

   Building Rome By Computer
</P>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ When Russell Crowe, dressed in full Roman regalia,
strides onto the dusty floor of the Colosseum, the camera follows
his gaze in a 360-degree sweep of the scene, taking in the three
tiers of cheering people, the rippling flags, the glinting armor.
It is all very big, very imposing and very real.
</P>
<P>
   Except it isn't real. At least, not all of it. The Colosseum as
recreated for Ridley Scott's ``Gladiator'' _ a sword-and-sandal
epic of the kind they didn't make anymore until he did _ appears to
be three massive stories high, but only the first story actually
existed on the set, which was built on the Mediterranean island of
Malta. The rest was painstakingly added with computer-generated
effects, one byte at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator,'' which opens on May 5, bringing the first big
blast of summer-movie spectacle, took upon itself the task of
recreating ancient Rome in the years after the death of Marcus
Aurelius in A.D. 180. Its main set was constructed around a
17th-century Spanish fort on Malta that Napoleon refurbished in a
classical style. Adding to images made of this set, the filmmakers
mixed in pictures of classical buildings from around Europe and
inserted computer-generated, or CG effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a firm believer in CG as a support for story and
character, absolutely,'' said John Nelson, senior visual-effects
supervisor on the film, who worked with the production designer,
Arthur Max, in recreating ancient Rome. ``I know with Ridley, he
could care less what's easy to do and what the computers are
capable of. What interests him is getting the shot the way he wants
it, to look right and to tell the story.''
</P>
<P>
   The 360-degree shot had its origin, Nelson said, in a question
he asked Scott: how would he shoot the scene if the Colosseum were
actually there in all its glory? Scott said he would have the
camera do the full sweep so the audience would get a good first
look at it. So the computer-effects team made that happen. ``We
didn't do the shot to show off the technology,'' Nelson said. ``We
did it because it was the way the director wanted to tell the
story.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer-generated movie making has come a long way since George
Lucas had Darth Vader in a laser-saber duel with Alec Guinness back
in the first of the ``Star Wars'' movies. Now the effects teams are
as likely to be trying to create reality as fantasy, turning 500
real actors into an army of thousands or giving a sense of solidity
to pure wind.
</P>
<P>
   The gladiator sequences, which are at the heart of Scott's film,
were shot to mimic the way modern-day sporting events are shown on
television, Nelson said, to subliminally make them more real to
today's audiences. There is, for example, the ``blimp shot,'' a
favorite at the Super Bowl, in which the camera seems to float over
the top of the massive Colosseum. There is even what the filmmakers
called their ``Wembley shot.'' In every soccer event broadcast from
Wembley Stadium in London, Nelson said, there has always been a
shot from the uppermost rows looking down toward the stadium floor
over a sea of raised arms, so ``Gladiator'' has this perspective,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Ridley Scott likes are the big shots and the impressive
shots, so that's what we tried to give him,'' Nelson said. ``He
doesn't care for showy visual effects that call attention to
themselves. With this movie, our charge was to convey the size and
scale of Rome, and so our sets were huge, really huge, and our
effects made them seem even bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   Into Africa, Again
</P>
<P>
   When the director Hugh Hudson was looking for locations to shoot
``I Dreamed of Africa,'' his adaptation of Kuki Gallmann's memoirs
of the struggles that accompanied her aristocratic family's move
from Italy to a remote cattle ranch near the Great Rift Valley in
Kenya, he decided to shoot in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's considered more secure, and it certainly has a better
infrastructure for making movies,'' Hudson said. ``And the day we
started shooting, there was the explosion at the U.S. Embassy in
Nairobi.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie, which opens on May 5, brought Hudson back to Africa
as a director for the first time in 16 years. In 1984 he shot
``Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes'' in the rain
forests of West Africa. ``But that's a whole different place, an
entirely different landscape,'' Hudson said.
</P>
<P>
   This time he selected a remote corner of Natal Province, in the
heart of the former Zulu homeland, which was sufficiently distant
yet not too far from hotels that could comfortably accommodate the
large crew and cast. Kim Basinger plays Gallmann. A second unit
eventually went to Kenya for shots of wildlife and the Great Rift
Valley, though most of the movie, set on Gallmann's ranch, was shot
in Natal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took our key people over with us, but as much as possible
we tried to use locals in the production, at every level,'' Hudson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between shooting in a high plains setting and
shooting in the rain forest of ``Greystoke'' were vast, he said.
But there was still something very similar and compelling about the
two African locations. ``I think we all feel it,'' Hudson said.
``Whether it's the Arab parts of the plains or the deepest forest,
you find yourself always drawn back to it once you have been
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tinkering With Destiny
</P>
<P>
   Some screenplays are told in long, flowing arcs. Others are
intricate interweavings of flashback and dream sequences. Still
others are posed like puzzles, almost daring audiences to try to
catch the filmmakers out. The director Gregory Hoblit said he and
the screenwriter of ``Frequency,'' Toby Emmerich, worked long hours
on the intricate plot, making sure every angle held firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way the story is constructed,'' Hoblit said, ``every time
we made even a small change in one sequence, it could have
important effects on other scenes elsewhere in the movie, and we
had to be sure that everything came together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequency,'' which opens on Friday, is a kind of time-travel
fantasy in which Jim Caviezel, as a New York police officer in
1999, finds himself talking on an old ham radio set to his father
(Dennis Quaid) in 1969. The kink is that the police officer uses
the moment to save the life of his father, a New York firefighter,
by warning him of his impending death, thus setting off a chain of
effects that multiply and must eventually be set right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time we changed something, I would say, OK, what is the
elephant in the room?'' Hoblit said. ``What is it that we're
missing? If we change this moment, then how does that change the
past or change the future or change what the characters know? It's
sort of a puzzle piece, and every piece has to link up together or
the movie won't work.''

   NEW YORK _ Aetna Inc., the nation's largest health insurance
company, said Thursday that its first-quarter operating profit rose
16 percent, helped by reduced losses at its Prudential Health Care
unit and a rebound in international business, including financial
services in Asia and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that important challenges still remained for the
company but that the results were generally positive and well above
their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, which has been under pressure to slim down from
disgruntled shareholders, said operating earnings were $184
million, or $1.29 a share, compared with $158.5 million, or $1.01 a
share, in the quarter a year earlier. Revenue rose 39 percent, to
$7.89 billion from $5.69 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts had expected the company to earn $1.12 a share,
according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent quarter, a $14.6 million charge made net
income $169.4 million, or $1.19 a share. In the period a year
earlier, a gain of $11.2 million made net income $169.6 million, or
$1.09 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Aetna rose $4.75, or 8.6 percent, to $59.9375 Thursday
on the New York Stock Exchange, well above their $38.50 low on Feb.
18 but still 40 percent below their 52-week high of $99.875 last
May.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a large degree, all they had to do was not screw up because
expectations were so low'' said Joseph D. France, a health care
analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``They did better than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sigh of relief,'' added James A. Lane at Salomon
Smith Barney. ``Some people thought this was going to be a
disaster.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The results strengthen the hand of William H. Donaldson, the
recently appointed chief executive, who was expected to face sharp
questioning by shareholders at the annual meeting Friday at Aetna
headquarters in Hartford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining their surprise, Wall Street analysts said Aetna had
provided scant guidance on its financial trends since last fall as
it wrestled with its $1 billion acquisition of Prudential Health
Care.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Aetna said Prudential losses had dropped to an annual
rate of $25 million after tax in the quarter, not counting paybacks
from the seller, the Prudential Insurance Co. of America, good will
and interest from the purchase. Prudential Health Care lost more
than $300 million in 1999, according to state insurance filings.
The paybacks, which partly shielded Aetna from Prudential's losses,
will end early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna said it had raised premiums 14 percent to 16 percent for
unprofitable Prudential customers and that they had been leaving
faster than Aetna had expected. Prudential membership plummeted to
5.1 million in December from 6 million in October 1998 and is
expected to drop to about 4 million this year, Aetna said.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Healthcare covers 19.5 million people, including
about 700,000 in Medicare health plans for the elderly and
disabled. Robyn Walsh, a spokeswoman for the company, said Aetna
was losing money on half its Medicare members and would be
notifying Washington officials in July of plans to drop some of its
Medicare health plans next January.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting rising medical costs, the company's profit margins
slipped for both commercial and Medicare health maintenance
organizations, compared with figures in the first quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Walsh said medical costs were rising 7 percent to 8 percent for
commercial HMOs, 9 percent to 10 percent for Medicare HMOs and 9
percent to 11 percent for preferred provider organizations.
</P>
<P>
   She said prescription drug costs were ``moderating'' after steep
increases. The company has raised the amount that members for many
higher priced drugs, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cost trends are continuing to rise,'' said Lori M. Price, an
analyst at Chase H&AMP;Q, making it hard for Aetna to increase profits.
``The price increases they are getting this year are not going to
be adequate to sustain improved margins.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that they did show some improvement in the
first quarter,'' Price added. ``But they underestimated the rise in
expenses.''

`THE BIG KAHUNA': JUST A COUPLE OF SALESMEN, GOING NOWHERE, AND
SLOWLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``Here's to the profound religious experience that
comes from doing a job well and being grossly underpaid,'' Larry
(Kevin Spacey) says to his fellow salesmen in ``The Big Kahuna,'' a
picture that from its low-budget looks guarantees the pleasure that
can come only from a labor of love.
</P>
<P>
   If the movie looked any cheaper, you might think you were paying
more to get into the theater than was spent on making the film.
</P>
<P>
   Spacey, who is one of the movie's producers, breezes into the
picture as if he has the world on a string. It's his chance to
address his role in James Foley's ``Glengarry Glen Ross,'' in which
he mostly stood in the corner and let everyone else blow through
like a force of nature. (It's almost as if he were doing Verbal
Kint, his fearful alter ego in ``The Usual Suspects.'')
</P>
<P>
   Spacey is the most theatrical of actors working today. He's the
rare actor who does not exclude audiences when he amuses himself.
Not many performers can pull this off; Eddie Murphy is one of the
few others who can. Spacey suggests a Satanic version of his idol,
Jack Lemmon. In ``American Beauty,' he seems to have gleefully
recycled Lemmon's turn in ``How to Murder Your Wife'' as much as
his work in ``The Apartment.'' Spacey was born to bark ``I rule!''
as he did in ``American Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   As Larry, he definitely rules ``The Big Kahuna,'' which seems to
be some kind of Tae-Bo for actors, a way to keep trim until a role
that really demands a workout comes along.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the action takes place in a hotel room in Kansas. It's a
cheap hospitality suite laid out with cheese slices and raw
vegetables that Larry shares with Phil (Danny DeVito), a member of
the walking wounded, recently separated from his wife and musing
about the death of a salesman, and Bob (Peter Facinelli), a
fresh-faced young Baptist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't smoke,'' Larry says to Phil. ``You don't drink, and
Bob here wouldn't think about lusting after another woman. Between
the three of us, we're practically Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   The guys are camped out for one big customer to peddle their
wares _ industrial lubricants _ to, but Spacey is really the kahuna
here. While he has the showiest role, DeVito gets to build toward
something, though it is wholly unsurprising. The movie, which is
based on Roger Rueff's play ``Hospitality Suite,'' works best when
Larry decides ``not to get too deep'' and bite into the few good
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this worn material is a passed-over good from a
dramaturgical secondhand store. The guys are flawed, waiting to
sell to Godot in their one-ring circus. The director, John
Swanbeck, decided to keep most of the action in one room instead of
opening things up, but this choice doesn't give him the tension he
desired.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end, ``The Big Kahuna'' actually feels as if it is
taking place on a stage. Swanbeck lacks the resources to enhance
the action, and dust fills the set as the tired truths are aired
out. It's just hard to tell what would have served this play, which
was adapted by Rueff for the screen, better. It's so transparent
you could wrap sandwiches with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Kahuna'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It includes competitive and salty
disgruntled-salesman language.
</P>
<P>

ISRAELI ACTRESS LEARNS BY DOING
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Replaces earlier version sent in error)

c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   cc,78p3 &QL; 
Once there was a beautiful young girl in Tel Aviv who attended a
professional arts high school. She began studying painting and then
switched to acting because she thought it was so easy.
</P>
<P>
   She soon was cast in a professional production of a play and
learned that acting is challenging work taken quite seriously by
others in the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Movie stardom in Israel followed, but that was nothing compared
with what lay ahead ...
</P>
<P>
   Mili Avital says she always has held storytelling in high
regard, but she appreciates it even more now that she is portraying
perhaps the most legendary storyteller, Scheherazade, in the ABC
miniseries ``Arabian Nights.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a little girl, I would literally make up a story and put on
a costume,'' Avital said. ``It wasn't as clean as Scheherazade does
it, but it was my version of storytelling.''
</P>
<P>
   Avital said she believes imagination is an individual's most
important asset. ``That's what makes your life, that's what makes
your future, that's what allows someone to heal, that's what gives
us hope. It's the one limitless thing in the world, our
imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in the two-part miniseries premiering 8 p.m. Sunday,
viewers will see the Middle Eastern folk tales processed through
the imagination of executive producer Robert Halmi Sr., complete
with buffoonish heroes, murderous thieves and as many
computer-generated effects as that famous magic lamp could hold.
</P>
<P>
   Avital's role is the framework, the well-modulated anchor for
all the adventure, calamity and even comedy in her stories about
Aladdin, Ali Baba and the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Halmi said of this leading lady, ``It's casting a bit against
the grain. You think casting Scheherazade you would get the most
glamorous lady you ever saw in your life. But Mili has character
... and that's what's needed.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Arabian Nights,'' the sultan of Baghdad, Schahriar, is
haunted by nightmares of his evil brother's ongoing plot to kill
him and seize the throne, and the sultan's betrayal by his own
bride, whom he killed while she was conspiring with his brother.
</P>
<P>
   Scheherazade, a member of the sultan's harem, offers to marry
Schahriar to maintain his rightful claim to the throne, knowing
that the tormented sultan plans to have her killed hours after the
wedding because he fears any wife would murder him.
</P>
<P>
   She enters the marriage, not out of a sense of duty to her
country nor to be a martyr for the harem, but because she truly
loves the sultan _ her favorite childhood playmate _ and she
believes she can rescue him from his torment.
</P>
<P>
   On their wedding night, as the executioner hovers outside the
sultan's bedchamber, Scheherazade summons the lessons she learned
from the bazaar's best storyteller as well as her own vivid
imagination, and the stories begin, stories that will make her too
valued to slay, stories that will liberate the sultan from his
personal demons.
</P>
<P>
   While the cast and crew of 235 bounced from one locale to
another in Turkey or Morocco, creating action sequences and scenes
that would be embellished later with CGI dragons, genies and
giants, Avital was practically stationary, performing nearly all
her scenes with Dougray Scott (``Ever After'') in the sultan's
chamber or sitting at the feet of storyteller Alan Bates (``Women
in Love'') in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had to basically sit demurely on the bed and tell the
stories. The director, Steve Barron, had a really specific vision
in his mind, and I knew he was right,'' she said. ``Every time I
start telling a story, then it cuts to a lot of action. When you
come back to me, it has to stay somewhat reserved, otherwise the
movie would be all over the place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very active person, so it was really an incredible
experience to try to hold back everything,'' Avital said. ``It's
very scary for an actor because you're always try to bring in
activity _ you know, they're washing dishes as they're having the
conversation _ business. This had to be so clean, period-wise
because they just didn't do that stuff as they were talking, but
also aesthetically and dramatically it was very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Avital said her scenes with Bates, when Scheherazade seeks his
advice on how to keep the sultan captivated, rang true in her own
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scheherazade is going to the master storyteller, and in a way
I felt like the actress going to the master actor to ask, `How do
you do this? What do you do?''' she said. ``He was like the master
class.''
</P>
<P>
   It was her acting studies that brought Avital, now 28, to New
York in the early '90s, and she says she hadn't intended to stay.
After one year at Circle in the Square's school, she was discovered
by Myrna Jacoby, who is now Avital's manager, and two weeks later
was cast in Roland Emmerich's universe-crossing odyssey
``Stargate,'' opposite Kurt Russell and James Spader.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shocking way to get into the industry,'' she said.
``I didn't think those stories existed, and I couldn't believe it
was happening to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that was beside the point. When I actually arrived on the
set of a $60 million movie six years ago, I was just so
flabbergasted. I had never seen anything like it in my life. The
last movie I did in Israel before I came was, I would say, one of
the biggest productions in Israel, and the budget was $200,000 _
including my star salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have so many departments in American films, it's
amazing,'' she said. ``You have a water boy! In Israel, the
director gives you water if you're thirsty, or you go to the
nearest faucet, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Avital had a speaking role in ``Stargate,'' but as an ancient
Egyptian girl she conversed in an undocumented dialect _ gibberish
Avital made up herself. If she were required to speak English, she
surely would have lost the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spoke very little English when I first came,'' Avital said.
``Thank God I didn't have to speak English because I didn't even
understand what the script was about. I was just trying to figure
it out as I was going. The only words I recognized were 'action,'
'cut' and 'do it again.'''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later, Avital speaks flawless English easily and
appears ready to merge into Hollywood's fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of this interview, she was in Belize filming Ernest
Hemingway's ``After the Storm'' with Benjamin Bratt and Armand
Assante, and another Avital movie, ``The Young Girl and the
Monsoon,'' with Diane Venora and Terry Kinney, was screened at the
recent Los Angeles Independent Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The West Hollywood resident has appeared on many red carpets
around town on the arm of ``Friends'' star David Schwimmer, her
boyfriend since they co-starred in the 1998 comedy ``Kissing a
Fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Avital does not want to lose her expatriate perspective
and says she would be happy to be a part of any project like
``Arabian Nights'' that can broaden viewers' horizons beyond their
own back yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Living in the States, I kind of got used to the fact that, oh,
I live in the biggest country in the world, why do I need to see
anything that's not American?'' Avital said. ``You really forget
that, and it's so important to be reminded of the entire world, and
the fact that we can bring another culture in. The point shouldn't
be just bringing the American culture to other cultures _ it should
also be vice versa.''

   NY-GIULIANI-ASSESS (New York) _ Political analysis: The
announcement by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani Thursday that he has been
struck with prostate cancer presents him with a series of pressing
medical decisions in the two weeks ahead. But the confluence of
Giuliani's diagnoses and the state's political calendar could force
the mayor to make some pivotal decisions about his Senate candidacy
just as quickly, and over precisely the same difficult period of
time. By Adam Nagourney.

   CUBAN-BOY-VIEWS (Miami) _ In Cuba, playwright Carmen Duarte's
work was often censored, and she and the actors in her theater
troupe were once beaten by policemen. Now living in the nation's
largest and most potent Cuban-American enclave, Duarte is trying
once again to give voice to a point a view that many experts on
exile politics say can lead to ostracism. She believes that Elian
Gonzalez should have been reunited with his father, and she has
said so on her daily radio show. Such talk, though, has been met by
some of the same intransigence Duarte encountered in Cuba. By Juan

five lesson section on Vietnam, the students pulled out their maps
and pondering how the most powerful nation in the world could have
been defeated, as one of the instructors in the course put it, ``by
a second-rate agricultural Third World country.'' It is a question
being faced here at West Point with a critical frankness, startling
to an outsider who might expect a more hidebound military. By John

   BIEN HOA, Vietnam _ Nguyen Anh Ha has never heard of the trade
talks between Vietnam and the United States. But Ha, a 26-year-old
migrant from northern Vietnam, knows all too well the fragility of
life as a factory worker in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been worried ever since I came here,'' said Ha, as he
rested after work in his bare one-room shelter, not far from the
sprawling Nike plant near Ho Chi Minh City where he makes
$120-a-pair athletic shoes. ``We keep hearing rumors that they
might reduce the number of workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike executives insist they have no plans to slash their work
force in Vietnam, which numbers more than 45,000 at five factories
owned and operated by South Korean and Taiwanese contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they acknowledge that Nike's future here has grown cloudier
because of the Hanoi government's reluctance to sign a landmark
trade agreement with the United States. The deal, which was agreed
to in principle in July, has stalled since Vietnamese negotiators
began quibbling over various provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're missing out on the biggest market in the world,''
complains Lalit Monteiro, general manager of Nike's operations in
Vietnam. ``Our factories here are heavily dependent on the Asian
and European markets. If those markets go sour, we're going to feel
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Nike is banned from exporting products to the
United States. Nor have the attacks on Nike's labor practices in
its factories played a role in limiting U.S. purchases. But with
the United States imposing import duties of 18 percent to 35
percent on all goods made in Vietnam, the company says it is not
economical to use this country as a manufacturing base for the U.S.
market.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, based in Beaverton, Ore., is one of dozens of foreign and
local companies in Vietnam whose fortunes would be affected by an
agreement. But as the largest private employer in the country, it
illustrates better than most the huge stakes of the deal for the
Vietnamese people. Countries like Vietnam can pay a high price if
they choose not to accede to the demands of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Monteiro estimated that Nike would increase the percentage of
its shoes made in Vietnam from 12 percent to 15 percent if the deal
is approved. That translates to more than 20,000 new jobs. Other
U.S. executives here said the company has talked about shifting as
many as 40,000 jobs from its plants in China. On the other hand,
some doubt that Nike will stay in Vietnam without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that is a risk,'' said Pete Peterson, the U.S.
ambassador to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson, a retired Air Force pilot who was shot down in Vietnam
and spent more than six years as a prisoner of war here, has been
one of the trade agreement's most dogged proponents. In addition to
promoting its merits to the Vietnamese government, he has lobbied
the U.S. business community _ exhorting sometimes demoralized
business people not to give up on the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest risk for Vietnam is the missed opportunity,''
Peterson said. ``They have to find a way to create jobs. This trade
agreement would be a major job-creation vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   Like trade pacts with other countries, the deal would guarantee
access to Vietnamese markets for U.S. companies. In return, the
United States would lift stiff duties on imports from Vietnam. In
Nike's case, that would slice 14 percent off the average cost of a
pair of shoes made here.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement also has some new provisions, including a
requirement that Hanoi disclose government procurement contracts.
Vietnamese officials protest that no other country has been asked
to do this. And they note that the World Trade Organization failed
to ratify such a requirement at its meeting in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In a country where _ 25 years after the end of the Vietnam War
_suspicion toward Washington bubbles under the surface, some people
view the deal as a way for the United States to win economically
what it could not win militarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Vietnamese are driven by fear,'' said Thomas J. Vallely,
director of the Indochina program at the Harvard Institute for
International Development. ``They ask, `Is globalization destroying
us? Is this a political as well as an economic move on the part of
the Western world?'''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Vallely and other experts said, a trade agreement would
benefit Vietnam far more than the United States. Vietnam exports
$650 million worth of goods to the United States, while U.S.
companies export only $350 million worth to Vietnam. While Nike
would be able to sell its shoes here, that would be a fraction of
what Nike's factories could export to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Access to the U.S. market would expand Nike's business in
Vietnam by more than just the sneakers shipped to California, Texas
or New York. Because its Vietnamese factories export only to Asia
and Europe, they are limited in the number of models they make. A
model popular in the United States, as well as Europe, would be
made in China or Indonesia _ not Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're losing orders because we don't have the flexibility to
ship to the U.S. market,'' Monteiro said. Not surprisingly, Nike
produces fewer shoes in Vietnam than in China, Indonesia or
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   For Monteiro, who used to work in Nike's product development
division, the delay in the trade deal has been a frustrating
introduction to Vietnam.

BALLOON CATHETER INVENTOR WINS $500,000 AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Thomas J. Fogarty, who invented the world's first balloon
catheter for the cardiovascular system and holds 63 patents in
surgical instrumentation, has been awarded the $500,000 annual
Lemelson-MIT prize _ the world's largest single award for invention
and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gross, the inventor of the walkie-talkie and the first
wireless pager, was honored with the Lemelson-MIT Lifetime
Achievement Award for invention and innovation. Gross, often called
the ``founding father' of wireless communication, developed the
walkie-talkie in 1938 when he was still in high school in
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Fogarty's catheter marked the beginning of less invasive surgery
and was the precursor to the first device used for angioplasty _ a
standard treatment for blocked coronary arteries.
</P>
<P>
   Other Fogarty inventions include surgical clips, clamps, and an
aortic stent-graft. He has founded several companies and teaches
surgery at Stanford University Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tom Fogarty epitomizes American ingenuity and has made a
lasting and beneficial impact on society,'' said Lester C. Thurow,
an economist and Lemelson-MIT board chairman. The Massachusetts
Institute of Technology oversees the awards, which were established
in 1994 by inventor Jerome Lemelson and his wife, Dorothy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what excites me is making something work better,''
Fogarty said in a telephone interview Thursday. ``Part of the
process is acknowledging what does not work as well as what could
work. The first thing to determine is that it is a real problem and
not just an inadequacy on your part or other individuals, but it is
a pervasive problem. Then you have to apply technology to resolve
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogarty, 66, said of all his inventions, ``the one that brings
the most satisfaction is the orginal balloon catheter. It kind of
opened a whole new technology and a less invasive approach. It was
documented you could use a catether to correct problems and it also
led to the realization that you could do procedures much less
invasively and eliminate trauma to patients and avoid anesthesia.''
</P>
<P>
   Fogarty, who lives in Portola Valley, Calif., founded or
cofounded 25 start-up companies that manufacture medical products
and cofounded Three Arch Partners, a venture capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not only remarkably inventive but is also a dedicated
mentor and inspiring role model for young scientists, engineers,
and clinicians,'' said Thurow.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, 82, said he became an amateur radio operator at an early
age.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most amateur radio operators had their radios in a room. I
wanted to be mobile, that was my desire _ and I worked hard to
figure out a transceiver,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   His handiwork caught the attention of the Office of Strategic
Services, the World War II precursor to the CIA, and he developed
for the agency a two-way air-to-ground communications system used
in the war.
</P>
<P>
   Gross said he is astonished by the proliferation of wireless
technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``The genie is out of the bottle'' he said.

 BIEN HOA, Vietnam: to Vietnam.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   And it comes at a time when Nike finally seems to have addressed
another chronic problem in its operations here: labor conditions.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1997, Nike was stung by the release of an internal
report that documented unsafe conditions at one of its biggest
plants. The report, by the accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young, said the
factory, also near Ho Chi Minh City, exposed workers to
unacceptably high levels of toxic chemicals. It also said 77
percent of the workers suffered respiratory problems.
</P>
<P>
   Nike said it was acting to improve conditions in the factory
even before the report was publicized. And even the company's
critics acknowledge that conditions are better. Dara O'Rourke, an
environmental consultant who helped distribute the report to the
news media, was allowed to conduct a follow-up inspection of the
factory, known as Tae Kwang Vina, in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``They felt the heat, which has motivated them to do things,''
said O'Rourke, an assistant professor of environmental policy at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``They switched away
from the most toxic compounds. But they continue to work with
organic solvents and glues.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a visitor on a tour of Tae Kwang Vina recently, Nike
officials pointed out improvements that had been made since
O'Rourke's inspection. The factory, owned by a Korean company, now
uses water-based, as opposed to chemical, solvents everywhere on
its assembly line. It is introducing water solvents in the
stitching area, where the leather parts of the shoes are pieced
together.
</P>
<P>
   Above workers' heads, powerful fans circulated the air, fans
that Nike officials said had been installed since O'Rourke's visit.
In noisy parts of the factory, a vast majority of workers wore
rubber earplugs _ addressing another of his worries.
</P>
<P>
   Nike's contractors said they were prodded to improve conditions
by the storm of criticism in the United States. ``I had pride in my
factory,'' said C. T. Park, president of Tae Kwang Vina, which has
more than 10,000 workers. ``And then suddenly it was the worst
factory in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike has not been able to fix every problem in what are still
monotonous, taxing jobs that can require handling hazardous
material. Ha and two other workers in Nike's Chang Shin factory
complained of runny noses, which they said began soon after they
started there. Their job is to press synthetic rubber into a heavy
metal cast and heat it to create the contoured shape of a sole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I have good health,'' Ha said. ``But in five years,
I won't be able to work at this job anymore. It is too hard. I'll
have to look for lighter work at another factory.''
</P>
<P>
   Ha works 10-hour shifts, six days a week, plus overtime, earning
the equivalent of $50 a month. That is slightly below Nike's
declared average monthly wage of $55. But the company notes that it
is still well above Vietnam's average _ $26.
</P>
<P>
   Labor laws in Vietnam are stricter than in many Asian countries,
and Nike says it complies, or does even better, in every category.
For example, Vietnam's minimum age for factory workers is 15. In
Nike's footwear factories, workers must be 18; in its garment
factories, they can be 16.
</P>
<P>
   Employers cannot demand more than 48 hours a week from workers,
excluding overtime. But they can run their factories every day.
Even so, Nike said it ordered its factories to close on Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   Ha, however, said he had worked in the Chang Shin factory on a
few recent Sundays. After an investigation, Nike confirmed that the
plant had asked workers to do cleaning and maintenance on those
days. Looking perturbed, Monteiro said he would discourage the
practice.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike previous Nike executives in Vietnam, Monteiro is neither
secretive nor particularly defensive about the company's labor
practices. He says he welcomes inspections of the factories by
outside monitors like O'Rourke. ``We closed down after the
controversy,'' Monteiro said. ``In retrospect, it was a mistake.
But you learn and you move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Nike has also learned there are some battles not worth joining.
The Vietnamese government, for example, is weighing whether to
reduce the work week to 40 hours from 48. The American Chamber of
Commerce has urged Nike, as the largest foreign employer, to lobby
against the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could never come out in public and ask the Vietnamese
government not to have people work fewer hours,'' said Chris
Helzer, Nike's director of government affairs. ``We'd get strung
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, with the trade agreement hanging in the balance, Helzer
noted there were far more dire threats to Vietnam's
competitiveness.

SCANDINAVIAN LEADERS PUT SEAL OF APPROVAL ON SMITHSONIAN'S VIKING
EXHIBIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif., Canada)   By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One thousand years after Leif Eriksson reached the
coast of North America _ apparently at Newfoundland and probably
elsewhere, too _ royalty and political leaders of Scandinavia
showed up here Thursday to put their seal of approval on what
promises to be the Year of the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Led by King Harald and Queen Sonja of Norway, the Scandinavian
visitors inspected a new exhibition, ``Vikings: The North Atlantic
Saga,'' at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. The
show opens to the public on Saturday and will run through Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 300 objects on exhibit include silver and bronze
inlaid swords, battle axes and silver jewelry and other loot from
the raids on Europe and the British Isles that made Viking
marauders so feared between 750 and about 1050 and fixed their
pillage-and-plunder reputation down through history. A Swedish
ninth century ``picture stone'' depicts two Vikings battling with
swords in Valhalla, the warriors' heaven. A centerpiece of the show
is a replica of a classic Viking ``ship burial.''
</P>
<P>
   Another side of the Vikings, though, is reflected in samples of
textiles and carvings, a manuscript of the Iceland Sagas _ the only
written record of the Norse explorations in the North Atlantic _
and various artifacts found in their Greenland settlement and along
the shores of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William W. Fitzhugh, an archeologist and director of the
museum's Arctic Studies Center, said that previous exhibitions
``had failed to communicate the depths of Viking culture,
especially in lands west of Europe.'' Recent archeological finds
and new interpretations of historical documents, he said, cast a
new light on the Vikings, also known as the Norse, as more than
just horn-helmeted warriors but also as successful boat builders
and traders, canny navigators and explorers who planted colonies
across a northern arc of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   On entering the exhibition gallery, visitors read the message
the show strives to deliver: ``Say Vikings! and images leap to
mind, yet the well-worn stereotypes hardly tell the whole story.
Behind battle axes and dragon-prowed longships lay a bustling world
of keen traders, prosperous townsmen, diligent livestock farmers
and master shipbuilders. From their ranks came extraordinary,
legendary explorers and settlers _ men and women who expanded the
horizons of their world, and ours.''
</P>
<P>
   More than once, the royal visitors and curators pointedly
remarked that these westering mariners had made it to what would be
called America 500 years before Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   An honored guest Thursday at the exhibition was Helge Ingstad,
100 years old, who was the Norwegian explorer and writer who found
at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland what has turned out to be the
first established site of a Norse settlement around 1000. Excavated
in the 1960s, the ruins of sod houses and the location itself,
scholars say, fit the descriptions in the sagas of a base camp
Eriksson erected.
</P>
<P>
   King Harald praised Ingstad for discovering ``new knowledge
about our history.'' He said the exhibition had significance for
both Scandinavians and Americans as a reminder of ``our common
Viking past.''
</P>
<P>
   Other representatives from the Viking homelands at Thursday's
event included: Olfur Ragnar Grimsson, president of Iceland; Tarja
Halonen, president of Finland; Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden,
and Prince Joachim of Denmark. Like the others, Elsebeth Gerner
Nielson, chairwoman of the Nordic Council of Ministers for Cultural
Affairs, a sponsor of the exhibition, seemed cheerfully willing to
accept both the pillaging and heroic sides of the Viking image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we're not terrifying anyone anymore,'' she said, ``we
still like the comparison with Vikings.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other support for the $3-million exhibition was provided by
Volvo. The curators, Fitzhugh and Elizabeth I. Ward, both of the
Smithsonian Institution, obtained artifacts from museums in Canada,
Denmark, Greenland, Iceland, Norway and Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   After its Smithsonian run, the exhibition will move to the
American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, opening there on
Oct. 20 _ which happens to be eight days after Columbus Day _ and
closing next Jan. 20. Then it is to travel to Houston, Los Angeles
and Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   The millennial anniversary of Norse explorations of North
America has inspired several other events, especially in Canada. A
Viking exhibit is to open in St. John's, Newfoundland, on June 2. A
re-enactment of the people, crafts and foods of the Viking era is
planned at L'Anse aux Meadows, the confirmed Norse settlement site.
And several replicas of Viking ships will be plying the coastal
waters of Newfoundland and Labrador, stopping at community
festivals marking the 1,000 years since Leif Eriksson passed this
way.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Boston Globe reporter David Filipov has won the
Overseas Press Club's Hal Boyle award for best newspaper or wire
service reporting from abroad for his coverage of Russia's war in
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Filipov, the Globe's Moscow bureau chief, was cited Thursday for
the group's top prize by judges for his courage, persistence, and
vivid depictions of ``the ambiguity of a war in which Russian
troops fought Islamic militants, Russian bandits fought Russian
soldiers, and Chechen gangs fought Russians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This honor is richly deserved,'' Globe Editor Matthew V.
Storin said. ``David is not only a highly knowledgeable foreign
correspondent, aided by his fluent Russian capability, but also
he's courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Among other winners at the annual awards ceremony were The
Associated Press for its investigation of reports of widespread
killings by US troops during the start of the Korean War; Mark
Schoofs of the Village Voice for his examination of AIDS in Africa;
and several who were recognized for coverage of Kosovo: National
Public Radio, NBC Nightly News, Newsweek, Reuters photographer
Yannis Behrakis, and Magnum photographer Gilles Peress.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Herald reporter David Talbot won an award for reporting
on international environment on the price of oil development in
Ecuador, and Sebastian Rotella of the Los Angeles Times won the
best Latin American reporting award for his series on reform in the
region.

<P>
   STOCKBRIDGE, Ga. _ Rachel Hetherington no longer is a stranger
at Eagle's Landing Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   Walking by the putting green or up the hill from the practice
range, fans and volunteers are quick to notice Hetherington, now
that she's the defending champion in the Chick-fil-A Charity

</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm always `the other Australian,''' she said

</P>
<P>
   Such is the Karrie Webb phenomena. Hetherington, 28, a native of

   But Webb, with four wins already this year and a domination of
Tiger Woods proportions, is the story of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it will take another win here for Hetherington. Or a major
championship. It seems as if Rachel Hetherington is always feeling
a need to prove something. Hetherington's 1999 Chick-fil-A victory
came on the first hole of a sudden-death playoff. She won when
Lorie Kane missed a 4-foot putt at No. 18 and parred, to lose to
Hetherington's up-and-down birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Kane, famous for her second-place finishes, almost became a
bigger story by losing again. Lost in the post-tournament analysis,
however, was that Hetherington had birdied 16 and 18 to get into
the playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think a lot of people thought of it that way, because Lorie
has had so many near-misses,'' Hetherington said this week. ``It's
tough to see anybody miss a putt like that. I guess everybody would
have been more excited if I'd made a 30-foot putt, but it was still
a birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later came another win with a disclaimer. With rounds of
69-68 at Myrtle Beach, Hetherington managed her third career win
when rain shortened the event to 36 holes.
</P>
<P>
   Although Chick-fil-A host Nancy Lopez, for one, notices how much
more confident Hetherington seems this year, the Aussie's
personality typically is as low-profile as her game.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a quiet player,'' Lopez said. ``She'll just kind of come
up there and win, all of a sudden. She just inches her way up
there, and the next thing you know, she's winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Hetherington, who tied for fourth last week in the Longs Drug
Challenge, will require all of her game to repeat this week. She
must conquer not only Webb but also the Eagle's Landing rough,
which thrived in a warm spring and has grown thicker and longer
than before. More than in past years, hitting the fairway earns a
reward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember it being this thick last year,'' Hetherington
said, ``especially just off the fairway.''
</P>
<P>
   Hetherington is 24th on the current money list. Last year, in
her third full season on the LPGA Tour, she finished 12th, with
$538,034.
</P>
<P>
   Hetherington is experiencing a tournament as defending champion
for just the second time, and she isn't comfortable with the role.
But improvement seems likely: After a playoff win over Annika
Sorenstam in the 1998 Big Apple Classic, Hetherington missed the
cut the next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just going to try and feed off the confidence of last
year,'' she said. ``I feel like I've already won the tournament, so
anything else is bonus.''

 &HT;    Eds: Don is cq for woman's name
 &HT;    Treat others as family, Tutu
 &HT;    urges at his Emory farewell
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Archbishop Desmond Tutu preached about the family of
God on Thursday to a community that feels as if it's losing a
beloved brother and uncle as he leaves his teaching post at Emory
University's Candler School of Theology.
</P>
<P>
   With the sunlight of a bright spring day streaming in, the small
man with the powerful presence kept a packed house spellbound under
the soaring ceiling of the university's 400-seat Cannon Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are sisters and brothers, a gift to one another,'' he told
them, ``children of God.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, he said, they have the right to address the creator as
``Daddy God, Papa God ... with intimacy and warmth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he added, ``is mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu, 68, a Nobel peace laureate for his work against apartheid
in his native South Africa, has taught courses at Emory's
550-student theology school for the last two academic years. He
conducted the last chapel service of the school year as his own
farewell to the theology school and the 155 students who are
graduating. They, in turn, honored him with a traditional South
African hymn.
</P>
<P>
   Don Drenth of Montgomery, Ala., a second-year theology student
and member of the Episcopal Church, took a class on
``Transfiguration, Forgiveness and Reconciliation'' from Tutu.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings tears to my eyes every time I hear him speak,'' she
said. ``To be part of his family and know that he's part of mine is
very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, my goodness!'' said Charles Foster, interim dean of
Candler, when asked what Tutu had meant to the faculty. ``The
generosity of his spirit, the depth of his compassion, the freedom
with which he enters into all sorts of situations and relationships
has demonstrated to us what it means to be a tranforming,
reconciling Christian.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu's farewell message _ which followed an Academy Awards-like
litany of thanks to everyone from the doctors who treated his
prostate cancer to the staff who mowed his lawn _ was not all
warmth and fuzziness. It carried a punch _ the responsibility of
treating others as kin.
</P>
<P>
   How, he asked, can a family support ``obscene amounts of money
in what you call the defense budget'' while some of the world's
children lack food, clean water and health care? Or let ``Third
World nations groan under unpayable debt?''
</P>
<P>
   God dreams of a day when ``people matter more than things'' and
``when there are no outsiders, all belong,'' he said. ``And God
says, 'I have no one except you to help me realize my dream, and
God says, 'Please, help me.'''
</P>
<P>
   When he had finished his sermon, presided over the communion
table and graciously received a parting gift of a sculpture, people
crowded around to ask the archbishop to sign their programs and
have his picture made with them. He fulfilled every request.
</P>
<P>
   Tutu said he will ``partly'' remain in the United States through
the summer, with trips to Wales and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   In an impromptu news conference after the service, Tutu said he
and his wife Leah will cherish their time in the city. ``Atlanta,
with its history in the Civil Rights movement, has always been a
place that has a special place in our hearts.''

   LAWRENCEVILLE, Ga. _ They seemed harmless enough. Two plastic
pink flamingos stuck in the ground in front of a home in
Lawrenceville's Towne Park subdivision.
</P>
<P>
   For Ellen and Doug Henry, though, the pink flamingos added up to
more than just tacky yard decor. They added up to nearly $3,400 in
fines for violating the subdivision's covenants.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lot of money for two little flamingos,'' said Ellen
Henry, a 37-year-old paralegal, who has refused to pay the fine.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes over the proverbial pink flamingo are not uncommon
within the mass of metro Atlanta subdivisions where homeowners
associations enforce covenants. Such rules and regulations are
designed to stifle bad taste, motivate lazy homeowners and
eliminate creative additions to one's home, all in the name of
protecting fair market value. Yet they often end up pitting
neighbor against neighbor, with resolution coming from a judge.
</P>
<P>
   In the Henrys' case, the dispute actually is over pink
flamingos, birds that originally cost $15 for the pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was totally shocked,'' said Ellen Henry, who learned last
month that the Towne Park Homeowners Association had placed a lien
on her home after she and her husband put it up for sale. ``I
thought at first it was because of past homeowners' dues and that
they had the wrong address.''
</P>
<P>
   Back in October, Doug Henry had planted two bright pink
Flamingos next to the front door. He later placed them on either
side of a ``For Sale'' sign at the curb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always had just kind of a thing for them,'' said Doug
Henry, a 51-year-old attorney, who bought the birds at an antique
market. ``I think they are a kin to yard art.''
</P>
<P>
   In late November, the homeowners association began fining the
Henrys $25 a day for breaking a covenant that prohibits ``exterior
lawn decorations'' unless approved by the association's board.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the lien, the attorney who handled the sale of the
Henrys' home last week withheld the fine from the money the couple
was due. The closing attorney agreed to hold it in escrow until
today, however, while the couple attempted to resolve the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The Henrys say they would have removed the offending flamingos
had someone knocked on their door, given them a call or sent them a
letter to inform them of the violation. The homeowners association
says it did write.
</P>
<P>
   George Nowack, who has made a specialty of representing
homeowners associations, said the board sent a certified letter
Oct. 14 giving the Henrys 30 days to remove the birds. The letter
came back undeliverable. A second certified letter Nov. 23 informed
the Henrys they would be fined $25 a day because they hadn't
complied. It, too, was returned by the post office as
undeliverable.
</P>
<P>
   The Henrys claim they never saw the letters, nor any notice of
them by the postal service. They wonder why no one bothered to find
out the reason for their silence.
</P>
<P>
   Nowack said the bylaws require only that the association send a
certified letter. Asking board members to personally visit every
home where there's a violation would put an undue burden on the
association's board, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Nowack said Thursday that the association will end
the matter for $374, which includes attorneys' fees. During a phone
call Thursday afternoon, Doug Henry said he's inclined to accept
the offer. Ellen Henry, who was on the line with him, abruptly cut
in and insisted they would pay no more than $100.
</P>
<P>
   If that turns out to be the case, Nowack said he'll just take
the $3,400 when it's released from escrow.

NEW YORK MAYOR SAYS HE HAS PROSTATE CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rudolph Giuliani, the city's famously combative mayor
and a candidate in the nation's hottest Senate race, says he is
battling prostate cancer and is uncertain whether he will continue
his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor emphasized at a news conference that he has been told
his is a ``treatable form'' of the cancer, confined to the prostate
gland, and that he caught it at ``a very, very early stage.''
</P>
<P>
   However, when asked if the disease would force him out of the
Senate race, he replied, ``I have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in fairness to me, to the Republican Party, to all of
the parties and everybody else, you need some time to think about
it,'' he said. ``I really need to know what the course of treatment
is going to be before I can evaluate. . . . Then, I will figure
out, does it make sense this year or doesn't it or whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he has known his diagnosis for just a day, Giuiliani said,
he and doctors have just begun the process of deciding what kind of
treatment he should undergo _ radiation, hormones, surgery, or some
combination. He said he will probably have to take some time off
from the job and from the campaign trail during his treatment, but
hopes his absence won't extend for ``months and months.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the unsettling diagnosis, Giuliani said he feels great
and enjoys ``perfect'' health. Asked whether coping with the
disease might make him ``nicer,'' the mayor, known to delight in
tagging annoying questioners as ``silly'' and ``jerks,'' drew a
laughter with his reply: ``No way.''
</P>
<P>
   The 55-year-old mayor is running for the US Senate against first
lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, and has raised nearly $20 million for
his campaign. The race, which polls show to be extremely tight, has
such a high national profile that his news conference Thursday was
broadcast live on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said, through a spokesman, that she had spoken briefly
to the mayor and told him her prayers were with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like all New Yorkers, my prayers and best wishes are with the
mayor for a full and speedy recovery,'' she said before giving a
lunchtime speech in Penn Yan, N.Y. ``And I hope that everyone joins
me in wishing him well as he undergoes the treatment that is
required.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's speedy announcement of his diagnosis is the result of
having been spotted Tuesday coming out of Mt. Sinai Hospital. New
York 1, the local news cable channel, reported late that night that
he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer. At his news conference
Thursday, Giuliani confirmed the report, saying he had gone to Mt.
Sinai for a biopsy and that his doctor told him later in the
afternoon that the results were positive.
</P>
<P>
   The biopsy followed a blood test two weeks ago that showed an
elevated prostate specific antigen _ a warning of a possible
malignancy.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said Thursday that the diagnosis ``brings up very
painful memories.'' His father died of prostate cancer in 1981 at
age 73. However, the mayor noted that back then, there was no
treatment for the disease and no way to detect it early.
</P>
<P>
   Medical statistics indicate that 90 percent of men with prostate
cancer survive the disease, at least for the first five years after
detection.
</P>
<P>
   New York Yankees manager Joe Torre, a good friend of Giuliani's,
was diagnosed with prostate cancer in March 1999, was back in the
ballpark by mid-April, and led his team to the World Series. City
comptroller Alan Hevesi, who is thinking about running for mayor in
2001, underwent surgery for prostate cancer in 1996 and resumed his
job within a matter of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Political figures of all stripes sent Giuliani good wishes for a
speedy recovery. Among them were the Rev. Al Sharpton, Hevesi, and
US Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island, who has long
expressed an eagerness to step into the Senate race if Giuliani
ever withdraws _ although Lazio said nothing about that subject
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement caused a great stir in the city's political
circles and prompted speculation on a number of possible scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   One envisions Giuliani dropping out of the Senate race and then,
two years from now, running for the governor's seat. (Term-limit
laws prevent him from running a third time for mayor.) It is widely
speculated that the current governor, George Pataki, another
Republican with national ambitions, may not run for reelection.
</P>
<P>
   Some who make this prediction believe his medical condition
could provide Giuliani with an excuse for doing what he half-wants
to do, anyway. His numbers have been dropping in the polls, and
many have noted that his temperament seems better-suited to
executive than to legislative office. He has displayed no great
enthusiasm in campaigning for the seat, at one point canceling a
long-scheduled upstate fund-raiser to attend the home opener at
Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has also publicly expressed worries over the fact that,
if he wins the Senate race, the city's public advocate, Mark Green,
would automatically succeed him for one year until the mayoral
election of November 2001. Giuliani dislikes Green personally and
politically, and fears his brand of traditional big-city liberalism
will overturn much of his own legacy.
</P>
<P>
   A very different scenario sees Giuliani staying in the Senate
race and his battle with cancer giving him a political boost _ a
dimension of sympathy and humanity, which he has seemed, especially
in recent months, to lack. One Republican consultant said,
``Certainly it's going to be hard for anybody to attack him for
quite a while.''
</P>
<P>
   A third scenario has Giuliani's prospects gravely damaged by his
disease. Nobody in recent memory has ever successfully run for
higher office while undergoing treatment for something as serious
as cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Others think the announcement of his diagnosis will have no
political effect. Prominent pollsters John Zogby and Maurice
Carroll said Thursday that the revelation probably won't make, in
Carroll's words, ``a dime's bit of difference'' in the election
results.

RESEARCHERS DEVELOP YOUNGER CLONE CELLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Researchers say they have found a way to reverse the aging
process in the cells used to create cloned calves, potentially
overcoming one of the biggest obstacles to cloning human organs,
from replacement hearts to new brain cells for victims of
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, experiments such as the creation of Dolly the cloned
sheep have produced offspring whose cells were biologically as
``old'' as the original, raising fears that clones could be doomed
to premature decline and death.
</P>
<P>
   But the six young calves cloned by researchers at Advanced Cell
Technology in Worcester, Mass. not only show no signs of premature
aging, but their cells in fact appear to be 50 percent younger than
other calves born at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen if the animals, now ranging in age from
several months to a year old, will have prolonged lifespans. But
the report in the current Science vastly reassures scientists who
had worried that clones might be born with prematurely aged cells.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is important, cutting-edge work,'' said Huber Warner, a
research official at the National Institute on Aging. But, he
added, the researchers ``are very careful to not claim that this is
going to reverse aging'' in people.
</P>
<P>
   However, scientists at Advanced Cell Technology say the finding
is highly encouraging for the prospect of cloning human cells to
create healthy cells, tissues and organs to repair the damage of
illness and aging.
</P>
<P>
   Judging by the new results, said Dr. Robert Lanza, vice
president for research at ACT, ``you might be able to produce
young, healthy cells by the billions or trillions _ enough to make
a patch for a damaged heart, or even a whole heart itself.''
</P>
<P>
   The key issue tackled by the ACT research has to do with the way
living cells age. The long strands of chromosomes inside each cell
are capped on each end by structures called telomeres, which
resemble the tips of shoelaces. Each time the cell reproduces, the
telomeres get shorter until they wear out completely and the cell
dies.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Dolly, her telomeres were shown to be the same
age as the six-year-old ewe from which she was cloned by the Roslin
Institute in Scotland. By comparison, the cells in ACT's calves
have telomeres 50 percent longer than the parent cells.
</P>
<P>
   Michael West, president and CEO of ACT, said the results confirm
``that cloning (from aged cells) is possible, and that you can run
the biology in reverse'' to transform old, worn-out cells into
pristine embryonic cells with a normal _ or perhaps even extended _
lifetime ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now have this really elegant story that tells us we can
take cells from mature individuals and reset their telomere clock''
to rejuvenate them, added Dr. Ronald DePinho, a Harvard and
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute researcher.
</P>
<P>
   DePinho, a leading investigator of telomere function and aging,
said that chronic diseases like cirrhosis of the liver are caused
partly by speeded-up aging of cells' telomeres, and that the new
research might lead to better treatments.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Lanza and West, authors of the Science paper
include scientists from the Lankenau Institute for Medical Research
in Wynnewood, Pa., and Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia;
Terry Fox Laboratory in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada; and
the University of British Columbia. The animals themselves are
presently on a farm in South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The cells used for cloning ACT's calves came originally from a
45-day-old calf fetus. These cells, from connective tissue, were
spurred in the laboratory to divide rapidly until they had reached
95 percent of their expected lifespan and showed many of the
typical signs of aging. The aim here was to show that the
age-reversing technique would work even in the oldest cells.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclei of those cells then were placed into cow eggs whose
own nuclei had been removed. Of the 1,896 embryos thus created, 79
were placed into the wombs of surrogate mother cows, resulting in
the birth of six identical heifers. The calves, named Persephone,
Lily, Daffodil, Crocus, Forsythia and Rose, now live on a farm in
South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The recent spate of cloning research in cows, mice, sheep and
pigs was touched off by the birth of Dolly, the first mammal ever
cloned from an adult cell, at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh in
1996. Although Dolly's cells were found to be the same age as the
ewe from which she was cloned, the significance of that fact isn't
clear: Dolly has been healthy and given birth at least twice.
</P>
<P>
   The biological age of Dolly's cells was an estimate based on the
lengths of the telomeres in her cells.
</P>
<P>
   The ACT researchers aren't sure why the calves' telomeres were
reset when Dolly's weren't. But they used a different type of cell
than the one from which Dolly was cloned, and they combined it with
the egg at a different phase of the cell's life cycle. It was also
done in different species.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ian Wilmut of the Roslin Institute, credited with creating
Dolly, said in an e-mail comment that the ACT paper ``is very
interesting.'' But he added, ``there is no reason to suppose that
increasing telomere length in the calves will increase their
lifespan. Lifespan is determined by many factors of which telomere
length may be one under some circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar comments came from Dr. Jerry Shay, a cell biologist and
pioneer in telomere research at the University of Texas Southwest
Medical Center in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Shay was skeptical that the lengths of their telomeres meant all
that much either for Dolly or the new calves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dont think Dolly was a sheep in lamb's clothing and I don't
think these cows are younger than they look,'' said Shay who is on
the scientific advisory board of rival Geron Corp. of Menlo Park,
Calif. ``I believe aging is much more complex than just telomere
biology.''
</P>
<P>
   Geron is pursuing a different strategy for rejuvenating cells,
which relies on adding telomerase, an enzyme involved in rebuilding
telomeres, to cells to reverse their aging.
</P>
<P>
   West, the ACT president, emphasized that the company is not
interested in cloning whole human beings. ACT researchers are
currently continuing their efforts to clone human cells to create
embryos from which primitive stem cells can be harvested.
</P>
<P>
   Those stem cells, once scientists learn to manipulate them,
could give rise to specialized cells and tissues to be implanted
into patients.

TAXPAYERS, PRIVATE GROUPS FINANCING GONZALEZ CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three days before the federal government forcibly
removed Elian Gonzalez from the home of his Miami relatives, a
small plane passed over the house, carrying a banner that read,
``Send Elian home _ the taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, taxpayers in Miami, and Boston and Washington for
that matter, are spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to
resolve the international custody battle, a dispute that has
occupied the nation's attention almost since the day the 6-year-old
Cuban was found floating in the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Justice Department, providing the first
preliminary cost estimates, said the federal government had spent
more than $578,000 on the case through Monday, including Saturday's
dramatic raid. That does not include the cost for Elian and his
family's stay at Andrews Air Force Base in suburban Maryland from
Saturday to Tuesday, and it excludes normal salary and benefits for
personnel.
</P>
<P>
   But, whenever the Elian matter is finally sorted out, the US
government's cost may be the easiest fact to figure. Far more
complicated is who is paying for what the government is not, and
how much that is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since there are so many private entities involved and Cuba
itself is involved, it would be surprising if we ever find the cost
for some of this stuff,'' said Tom McClusky, senior policy analysis
with the National Taxpayers Union. ``Everything is so convoluted.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a United Methodist agency footing the legal bills for
Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and a legal fund in Miami set
up by a Cuban-American, Armando Gutierrez, to help Elian's
great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez in his fight to keep the child in the
United States. The Cuban-American National Foundation is paying for
Elian's Florida relatives' travels to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not exactly clear who is paying for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez's meals and other costs associated with living in the
United States while he awaits court action next month on whether he
can take his son back to Cuba, if he desires, and also who is
paying for friends and relatives traveling here from Cuba. US
government officials this week said that the Cuban government is
picking up some of those expenses, but specifics were hard to come
by.
</P>
<P>
   The General Board of the Church and Society of the United
Methodist Church has collected more than $50,000 in contributions
to pay Gonzalez's legal bills and hopes to raise $100,000. The
agency set up the fund at New York's Chase Manhattan Bank and it is
being administered by the National Council of Churches.
</P>
<P>
   Gretchen Hakola, an official with the United Methodist agency,
could not say for certain whether the money collected was being
used only for legal expenses or whether it was also helping finance
Elian's family's stay here.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set up the fund to assist Juan Miguel,'' Hakola said. ``The
bank account is now in the hands of the National Council of
Churches and how that is being paid out _ we have no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendy McDowell, a spokeswoman with the council of churches, said
the group was only administering the legal fund and referred
questions about how the money was being spent to the United
Methodist agency. She said even if the fund succeeds in collecting
$100,000 that might not be enough to pay for Juan Miguel Gonzalez's
legal bills.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez, a spokesman for Elian's Miami relatives, said the
legal defense fund he set up for Lazaro Gonzalez had received more
than $200,000 in donations, including many checks for $5 and $10.
Most of that sum came from a weekend marathon in March sponsored by
four radio stations in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Gutierrez said the fund had paid for at least one relative's
trip to Washington, but most of their trips were paid by the Cuban
American National Foundation, a lobbying group based in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their lawyers are working for free; they are only charging for
expenses, filing fees and secretaries,'' Gutierrez said.
</P>
<P>
   But the cost of tending to the case has not been free for
taxpayers. The city of Miami has spent about $1 million patroling
the Little Havana neighborhood and keeping peace in the city during
the fight over Elian.
</P>
<P>
   And the $578,000 preliminary estimate for the US government is
likely to climb much higher. That figure covers $374,000 spent by
the Immigration and Naturalization Service, including the cost of
Elian's government airplane flight to Washington and the cost of
training and housing 131 immigration agents who participated in the
raid.
</P>
<P>
   US marshals, who provided 20 deputies for the raid and security
for Elian's father in Washington and his family since Saturday,
spent $161,000. Other amounts spent included psychiatric
consultants, mediators and conciliators and legal work.

MUGABE PRESSURED TO RESTORE RULE OF LAW IN ZIMBABWE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Chenjerai Hunzvi is the man behind the
growing state of anarchy in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans
Association, he is the general behind the campaign to confiscate
millions of acres of commercial farmland from whites. His
nom-de-guerre, dating back to the 1970's, is ``Hitler,'' but at
times he has also called himself ``Jesus.''
</P>
<P>
   But prominent disaffected war veterans say he is little more
than a thug and a thief. Two internal probes by the association
have found he guilty of bilking hundreds of thousands of dollars
invested on behalf of the veterans, and he was jailed a year ago
for fraud. The case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   The High Court, meanwhile, charged him with contempt two weeks
ago for failing to end the farm invasions, which the court twice
ruled were illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Hunzvi claims to be fighting for land on behalf of all his
comrades who risked their lives to liberate the country. In fact,
observers say, he is one half of the most important personal
relationship in Zimbabwe. The ties between Hunzvi and President
Robert Mugabe lie at the crux of the violence ripping through
Zimbabwe. Through the brutal exploitation of the masses, sources
close to the two men say, each meets the other's needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are two bedfellows,'' said a former official of the war
veterans, requesting anonymity. ``Hunzvi feels that if Mugabe stays
in power, the case against him will be dropped. And Mugabe feels
that with the war veterans on his side, he will remain in power.
They are fighting a common war.''
</P>
<P>
   As political violence escalates _ at least 15 people have been
killed and scores more have been badly beaten in recent weeks _
Mugabe faces growing international pressure to reestablish the rule
of law.
</P>
<P>
   British diplomats Thursday received a high-level Zimbabwean
delegation in London for talks on defusing the southern African
country's crisis. Britain had offered an additional $57 million for
land reform if Mugabe ends the farm attacks and takes steps to
ensure that upcoming parliamentary elections are free and fair. But
the delegation refused to provide those assurances and the talks
broke down.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at the end of eight hours of talks with the Zimbabwean
ministers, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said ``I made it crystal
clear there would be no further talks until the end of occupations.
. . . The ball is now in their court.''
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, meanwhile, Hunzvi told farmers again Thursday that
the invasions of their land would continue. Leashing the war
veterans, observers say, would mean that Mugabe would lose his
trump card ahead of the elections.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his 20-year reign, critics say, Mugabe has relied on
intimidation to retain power. By all appearances, he is doing so
again now. With his country facing its worst economic crisis in at
least a decade, however, Mugabe cannot completely ignore
international reaction. Zimbabwe has been ground to a halt by
chronic shortages fuel and foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe appeared Thursday to be appealing to Britain with a
different approach. Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri said he
would begin using special powers granted under the Law and Order
Maintenance Act to quell political violence. The provisions allow
the police to restrict political activities such as rallies and
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights lawyer Brian Kadoro viewed the announcement as both
an attempt to trip up the opposition and appease Britain on the day
his envoys sat down in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really a public exercise in response to Britain's
insistence for a return to law and order, to create an impression
that war veterans are not being violent,'' Kadoro said. ``But
political parties are not the ones beating people on the farms.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's supporters have sown intimidation across nearly 1,000
farms, beating farmers and their workers and demanding their
allegiance to the ruling party. Hunzvi has vowed that the veterans
will start another war if Mugabe's party loses the elections.
</P>
<P>
   It may be bluster. Hunzvi represents only a small percentage of
the war veterans, who themselves number only about 50,000 in a
population of 12.5 million. Leaders of the Zimbabwean Defense
Forces and several prominent veterans have distanced themselves
from the association chairman. Others want him out.
</P>
<P>
   According to minutes of an extraordinary meetings of veteran
investors held in Harare last month, Hunzvi is guilty of grossly
mismanaging a joint fund set up with veterans' money to finance
development projects for ex-combatants and their families. The
minutes also allege that Hunzvi fired several association officers
who accused him of corruption.
</P>
<P>
   That follows a special association probe last year which found
that ``almost all the projects created to promote the welfare of
the members are almost bankrupt.'' A recent audit discovered huge
sums of money invested by veterans in the joint fund, which is
administered by Hunzvi, has gone missing.
</P>
<P>
   With fraud charges still pending, Hunzvi's motive for
orchestrating the farm attacks was simple to understand, Kadoro
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hunzvi misappropriated funds,'' he said. ``Mugabe has that
against him, but he also has the power to pardon. So Hunzvi will
sing any song Mugabe asks him to sing.''

TWO IS BETTER THAN ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft, is unrepentant. Steven
Ballmer, the company president, will admit at worst to bad manners.
The inability of Gates and Ballmer to acknowledge that Microsoft
illegally wielded monopoly power suggests the government would be
wise to break up the company.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft defenders argue that the government case is based on
5-year-old, stale allegations. However, the software at the heart
of the case is ubiquitous today. Microsoft Windows is the dominant
operating system in personal computers. Microsoft Office remains
the dominant set of programs for word processing, spreadsheets, and
slide presentations. And because the company gave it away and
pressured computer manufacturers to include it in their machines,
Microsoft Internet Explorer has become the dominant browser. Based
on recent interviews, Gates and Ballmer are ready to resume
bullying tactics if the government lessens the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   One way to control Microsoft would be to monitor its every
action, but that would require enormous time and expertise. The
government is focusing on a neater solution: Breaking Microsoft
into two companies, with one controlling Windows and the other in
charge of Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we didn't have Office and Windows and those groups working
together, thinking about users, there would be no Windows as we
know it today . . . ,'' Gates said in opposition. It might have
made sense a decade ago, for the sake of standardization, to have
the same company develop the operating system and key applications.
Nowadays this amalgam is a drag on competition.
</P>
<P>
   The Linux operating system will not be a true competitor to
Windows unless Microsoft Office programs can run on it, yet Ballmer
has no plans to develop this capability. Control over Windows and
Office cements Microsoft's monopoly position.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will use its enormous financial power to oppose a
break-up if, as expected, the Justice Department proposes one
Friday. ``My life is devoted to building great software,'' Gates
said this week. He ought to continue this work in the competitive
environment that a break-up would promote.

<P>
   The money managers panicked. The people bought.
</P>
<P>
   That is the real story of the wild month that ends Friday. After
the worst week in Nasdaq history ended two weeks ago, Wall Street
braced for a wave of selling that did not arrive. Instead, there
was a rebound.
</P>
<P>
   That has happened time and again in recent years. Just as market
fundamentalists take heart from the collapse of highflying stocks
and proclaim that value now matters, the fall ends. The bears are
vanquished.
</P>
<P>
   If that pattern is repeating _ as I believe it is _ the most
interesting question for investors is how they will be able to tell
if the next plunge, whenever it comes, is the real thing or just
another buying opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is: Check the dollar and the economy. One or both of
them are likely to get into trouble before the stock market suffers
a prolonged downturn.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because professional money managers really don't matter
much in the current environment. They can move money from stock to
stock, but they cannot stay out of stocks for very long. The
pressures to be fully invested are too great. The managers may fear
the Federal Reserve, which is more likely than ever to raise
interest rates after the report Thursday that consumer spending is
rising at the fastest rate since 1983. But their customers are not
worried. The Nasdaq market fell Thursday morning because
professional investors feared rising interest rates. But the
amateurs were buying, and soon prices were up nicely.
</P>
<P>
   American investors are certain that stocks are the best
long-term investment. That lesson, learned over many years, will
not soon be unlearned.
</P>
<P>
   A recession would operate on many investors as margin calls
operated on some during the Nasdaq swoon this month; it would force
selling by people who needed to raise cash. The selling would be
slow and prolonged, bringing a gradual market erosion rather than a
crash. The stock market would follow the economy down.
</P>
<P>
   The other group of investors worth watching is foreigners,
particularly Europeans. If they were not eager to invest in this
country, the huge trade deficits caused by all that consumer
spending would have led to a dollar crisis. If foreign investors
turned negative, or even if they invested less than they are now, a
falling dollar would provide a warning of stock weakness.
</P>
<P>
   That is not happening now. Instead, it is the euro that is weak,
despite Europe's strong current account surpluses. For a variety of
reasons, few want to invest in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans worried about their own currency have bought American
stocks, thus pushing up our stock prices and supporting the dollar.
Someday, perhaps when European investments begin to look more
attractive _ or American ones less so _ the circle will reverse,
and selling American stocks will damage the dollar, which will
damage the stock market, and so on. The euro is likely to rally
markedly at some point, to well above the current level.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, those who argue that technology stocks still
reflect ridiculous optimism may be proved right. But most investors
have not been scared off even as some Internet wonders have
collapsed. The Nasdaq composite is down 17 percent for April, and
its volatility _ measured as the standard deviation of daily
percentage changes _ is the greatest in Nasdaq history, surpassing
October 1987. But the Dow Jones industrial average is off less than
1 percent for the month, and Nasdaq is higher than it was in
mid-December. Investor faith is still alive.

EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK RAISES INTEREST RATES, BUT EURO PLUNGES
AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The European Central Bank raised interest
rates Thursday for the fourth time in six months but Europe's
common currency, the euro, once again defied its guardians and
plunged to another record low against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The rate increase, from 3.5 to 3.75 percent, would normally tend
to support the euro's value. But in a display of the gloom that now
envelops the new currency, the euro sank to less than 91 cents from
92.15 cents before closing in New York at 91.01 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro is now in uncharted waters, and you don't know how
far it will go down,'' said Gerhard Grebe, an economist at Bank
Julius Baer in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Since its debut at the start of 1999, when it was worth $1.17,
the euro's value against the dollar has slid about 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While it once seemed to represent an unthinkable decline in the
euro's value, parity with the dollar now looks to many traders like
an impossibly high target, at least for the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the decline of the euro was more of a political
embarrassment than an economic problem. Indeed, the weak euro has
provided a major boost to European exporters by making their
products cheap in terms of dollars and creating windfall currency
profits from sales in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But European officials have become increasingly concerned that
the euro's weakness will fuel inflation here by raising the prices
of imported goods.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's plight has even begun to alarm some of its most
ardent supporters. Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche
Bank, has long contended that the new currency would be a powerful
challenger to the world dominance of the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Walter argued that European central bankers
should intervene if the euro's value slips meaningfully below 90
cents. In an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt, Walter
went on to argue that European central bankers ought to sell off
their reserves of dollars, which now total about $250 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't they sell now?'' Walter said. ``It would
simultaneously make an impression on international speculators and
support the euro.''
</P>
<P>
   Adopted by 11 European countries at the start of 1999, the euro
is on its way toward creating a single European economy as big as
that of the United States. Though the countries will continue to
have their own national currencies until 2002, their monetary
policies are now locked together under the control of the European
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the euro has been anemic ever since its birth, and the
problem has become more acute in the last several weeks. The German
mark is worth about 46 U.S. cents, its lowest level in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank said its primary concern Thursday was
about inflation rather than exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   But inflation is closely linked to the weakness of the euro,
which has already started to drive up import prices.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists and currency strategists had been expecting
Thursday's action, and most believe that the central bank will
raise rates at least once more in the months ahead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Far more puzzling is why the euro continues to fall so sharply
in value.
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth in the 11-nation euro zone is expected to reach
3.4 percent this year, its fastest pace in years, and employment is
climbing rapidly for the first time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inflation is lower in Europe than in the United
States. Investment and employment are both accelerating, and Europe
has a big trade surplus while the United States has a mammoth trade
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the United States continues to grow faster. The United
States Commerce Department reported Thursday that the U.S. gross
domestic product increased at annual rate of 5.4 percent in the
first quarter. Beyond statistics, the mystique associated with U.S.
technology has made it a magnet for foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists had been forecasting that the euro would start
to climb by the second half of 1999. Then they predicted it would
appreciate in the first few months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Dannesboe, a currency strategist at the Dutch bank ABN
Amro, said part of the euro's most recent distress stems from the
grievously optimistic views of many international fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced last fall that the euro would recover after tumbling
to $1.06 from $1.17, fund managers started buying up euros and
selling dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States and the dollar both defied expectations,
as U.S. growth accelerated rather than slowed, and direct
investment continued to pour into the United States from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the fourth quarter, international fund managers
were massively overweight on the euros,'' Dannesboe said. The
result, he continued, is that investors are looking for at any
momentary rise in the euro as a chance to sell their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties were compounded earlier this month, after the
Nasdaq market plunged as a result of fears about overpriced U.S.
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors viewed the turbulence in U.S. stocks as a new
reason for believing that European assets and the euro would become
a safe haven.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not happen. When the euro barely budged against the
dollar and then the Nasdaq market bounced back, the pressure to
sell euros intensified further.
</P>
<P>
   The entire life of the euro has left economists and currency
traders bewildered. But Ralf Schneider, an economist at Dresdner
Bank, noted that the violent currency swings are hardly
unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1980 and 1985, the dollar nearly doubled in value
against the German mark _ the currency that continues to be at the
heart of the euro. The mark plunged to $3.45 from about $1.70,
largely because the U.S. economy underwent a powerful growth spurt
between 1983 and 1985. By 1988, the dollar had slumped back to
about $1.70.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that growth differentials are very important,''
Schneider said. ``My argument is that the euro has done better than
the D-mark would have.''

THE TOUR KEEPS EVOLVING

<P>
   One of the challenges folks in charge of revamping the tram tour
at Universal Studios Hollywood had was what to do about Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   The great white shark from the 1975 hit ``Jaws'' had been
``attacking'' an unfortunate wooden fisherman (and tour
participants) for more than 20 years. But now the studio tired of
trying to out-thrill ride major amusement parks had decided to go
back to what they knew best _ the art of movie making _ and an
ultra phony mechanical fish just didn't looked like something
anybody would consider an example of cinematic magic.
</P>
<P>
   Or did it? Suppose, with the use of newly installed high tech
video and DVD equipment, you could show people a scary scene from
``Jaws'' immediately after their encounter with the mechanical big
mouth? Before your eyes, the clunky reality of Bruce is transformed
into movie wizardry. The implied message: Look how we can turn
wires, plastic etc. into the spectacular.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shark in the movie wasn't any more sophisticated than the
one we have out on the tour,'' says John Murdy, creative director
for the tour, and the man primarily responsible for its revamping.
And we've got (``Jaws'' director) Steven Spielberg talking about
how it never worked. We've got outtakes of the shark
malfunctioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story is how a great filmmaker was able to overcome it and
use it as a positive, using the camera as a shark and making the
audience afraid of something they don't get to see. We're tying
things back into movie-making.''
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, Murdy and his team have taken a close
look at every aspect of the studio tour. They concluded that any
park can offer roller coasters, food and souvenir shops, but guest
surveys indicated that Universal was getting the most out of the
park's most marketable commodity. What other attraction, after all,
actually takes its visitors onto a working movie studio?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past we've added theme park type gags and attractions
to the tour that didn't have a lot to do with movie making,'' said
Murdy. ``The overall job is to put the focus back on the movie
making experience and the movies we've made to make this our
marquee attraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a ton of research into the Universal archives and the
installation of video monitors in trams giving tour guides access
to hundreds of DVD clips. Spielberg is a part of every tour. So are
director Ron Howard (``Apollo 13'') and actor Jason Alexander (of
``Seinfeld'' fame), all of whom had memorable experiences on the
lot. Even while waiting in line, guests can study the Universe of
Stars, colorful boards with built in video displays featuring movie
stars from all film genres (Tom Hanks, Goldie Hawn, Meryl Streep,
Robert De Niro) and highlighting the movies they've made for
Universal.
</P>
<P>
   Studio archivist Jan-Christopher Horak went over the original
scripted tour (last refined in the 1980s), corrected several
inaccuracies. He also interviewed Carla Laemmle _ the oldest living
relative of former studio founder Carl Laemmle _ about her
recollections of working on the lot. Carla Laemmle had appeared in
both the 1931 ``Dracula'' and in 1925 version ``The Phantom of the
Opera''
</P>
<P>
   ``They did some polling,'' said Horak. ``Even after going on the
tour, a lot of the people didn't who had gone to the park didn't
know that films were still being made here or that they had been
made for as long as they have.
</P>
<P>
   Now, anybody who leaves the tour with that kind of ignorance
hasn't been paying attention. As the tram heads down the hill from
the theme park to the studio lot, the first thing guests will see
are number of movie posters from Universal classics dating from the
silent era to the present.
</P>
<P>
   With such feature as Courthouse Square, Little Europe and New
York Street, the Universal lot itself remains as much a star of the
tourist attraction as the rides. Film clips on the tour will now
show guests how a street they are passing has been used in movies
from three different decades. Courthouse Square, for example, was
part of ``To Kill a Mockingbird,'' the ``Back to the Future''
movies and will be seen once again doubling for Beverly Hills in
the upcoming film version of ``Charlie's Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   The lot was a veritable playing ground for legendary director
Alfred Hitchcock who, after 1955, filmed parts of many of his
classics there. The Bates Motel, from his 1960 classic ``Psycho,''
remains another tour landmark.
</P>
<P>
   Tour stops can change depending on what project either is
currently shooting or has recently concluded. Recent visitors will
get a peek at the town of Whoville constructed for Ron Howard's
upcoming holiday release ``Dr. Seuss' How The Grinch Stole
Christmas,'' starring Jim Carrey. Four times a year, video clips
will be updated to keep the coming attractions current. And one of
the tour's final clips will be a trailer for an upcoming Universal
movie for ``Grinch'' or ``The Nutty Professor II.''
</P>
<P>
   There are new attractions as well, most notably The Curse of the
Mummy's Tomb and a new demonstration of weather special effects.
Inspired by the 1999 summer blockbuster ``The Mummy,'' the curse
plunges visitors into the sacred temple of Hamunaptra (it's the
former site of the ice tunnel and later Dante's Peak on previous
tours) where a bunch of flesh devouring scarabs attack the tram.
The King Kong attraction, one of the tour's most popular, now takes
place inside a sound stage.
</P>
<P>
   New features mean new blood _ a new crop of Universal Studios
Tour Guides who must audition and turn themselves into walking
encyclopedias of Universal lore before they're ever permitted to
grab the microphone and plunge their guests into cinematic peril.
Tour administrators have hired 30 new guides while retraining the
existing corp of 150 guides in the new routines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much more complicated tour now,'' says Murdy, a tour
guide himself 12 years ago. ``In addition to the tour, they have to
work the DVD. They're their own stage manager. I don't think I
could give this tour now, and I wrote the damn thing.''

NEW PASSAT WAGON IS ALL 4MOTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was either the last howl of winter or a young spring behaving
very badly, but the conditions were perfect: hammering winds that
were knocking down trees and spreading debris across roads and
highways, deep puddles that threatened hydroplaning, swirling spits
of snow.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 Passat 4MOTION station wagon, Volkswagen's entry, along
with a Passat sedan, in the ever-expanding all-wheel-drive market,
was made for weather like this.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Volkswagen made an AWD wagon in the past _ its last
was the Quantum wagon in 1988 _ but those were hardly the halcyon
days of the German manufacturer and the time was not too far away
when the minivan would kill off demand for station wagons.
</P>
<P>
   But as they say in the land of Citroen, plus c'est change and
all that. Station wagons are making a comeback and, equipped with
AWD systems, they are viable options to minivans and even SUVs. And
as I have seen with the Volvo Cross Country, Subarus and Audis, the
new generation of AWD is remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   The Passat, its system born of Audi's Quattro, is among the
best.
</P>
<P>
   4MOTION refers to the fact that when the car is in motion, all
four wheels are driving, all the time, no matter what the speed. In
normal conditions, engine torque is distributed 50/50 front and
rear. If conditions get slippery and one set of wheels can get
better grip than the other, an automatic-locking center
differential ships engine torque where it is needed and the split
can be as much as 67-33 either way.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all. A separate monitoring system watches for
individual wheel slippage, and should any wheel threaten to break
into a spin applies the brakes individually at that wheel to get it
gripping again.
</P>
<P>
   It is a seamless driving experience and you are not even aware
it is all taking place unless you test it _ say on a wet road
littered with snow, early-blown tree buds, puddles, twigs _ so hard
you expect the car to try to break away from you. Trust me. It
won't. I took it into a big, empty parking lot, with all the
storm's flotsam and jetsam strewn about, cranked the wheel around
and tried to lose control. I couldn't, because the car was in
control.
</P>
<P>
   And this is a comforting experience when you are sitting in what
is a fairly luxurious car: in this GLS model, leather seats, walnut
wood trim, even heated windshield washer nozzles (what a fine
winter idea).
</P>
<P>
   The view all around was expansive, with a low dash and a chopped
hood giving the appearance that the road is right there where you
could touch it and the big glass of the back, sides and rear,
providing good vision all around. Even the rear pillars, often an
obstacle in wagons, are thin and do not block the line of sight.
</P>
<P>
   The front buckets have fairly flat leather planks for seats and
could use some lateral wings and a slight bump at the front edge to
give the sense you're better held in them. Lateral wings on the
sides are fine. The back seat is comfortable and there is good
legroom, though three adults do not fit comfortably. Fold those
seats down, however (60/40 split), and you've got what seems an
enormous cargo area for a midsize wagon. The big rear hatch, which
opens way up high, lets you easily load large objects.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, what the Passat has in big space is offset by
what it lacks in small storage areas, those nooks and crannies that
families, in day-to-day hauling of children and their associated
goods, or couples on vacation and the paraphernalia that entails,
so desire. Door slots are small, the bin in the fold-down armrest
between the front seats is tiny, and an ashtray front and center on
the console is a waste of what could be useful space for most
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   One very nice touch is the way all four doors have been scooped
out up high, giving extra room all around and providing useful
armrests.
</P>
<P>
   The Passat is powered by a 2.8-liter, 190-horsepower V6, not a
screamer when it comes to passing, but sneaky fast just rolling
down the highway. The AWD system could handle lots more power, but
this car isn't aimed at folks looking for performance. It had a
wide band of torque, which really kicked in at about 3,500 RPMs and
held steady to beyond faster than you can legally travel. The AWD
system does seem to eat gasoline _ I got about 18.5 miles per
gallon over a week.
</P>
<P>
   The Passat comes with a five-speed automatic that gives you a
Tiptronic manual option that lets you shift without a clutch. I'd
prefer a standard transmission in an AWD, but at least the
Tiptronic comes close to letting me feel as though I'm in control.
</P>
<P>
   The ride is rigid in a good way and the Passat holds firm in the
corners. This is a tightly engineered car and is remarkably quiet
inside, even as winds swirl about outside.
</P>
<P>
   It's the 4MOTION that keeps you moving in bad conditions, but it
is the suspension that makes the ride comfortable. Up front, it has
a four-link setup with coil springs, telescopic shocks and
stabilizer bar. The rear has fully independent wishbone with the
rest of the goodies found in the front.
</P>
<P>
   Four-wheel ventilated disc brakes, with ABS, bring you to
straight, sure stops and if you can't stop in an emergency, there's
a sound safety system to protect you: a rigid body with crumple
zones that fold up like cheap accordions and protect the passenger
compartment. There are front and side airbags up front and in a
neat touch, the side bags are built into the seats so that when you
move your seat the bag travels with you. The National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration has given the Passat its highest
rating for occupant protection both front and rear.
</P>
<P>
   I'm not one who's sorry to see winter go, but I wish I had had
the chance to try this out in deep snow or on ice. I suspect its
performance would have been an eye opener.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyances:
</P>
<P>
   --The side mirrors are small rectangles and didn't give me as
good a look backward as I would like.
</P>
<P>
   --The cupholders, all of a half-inch deep, were useless.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touches:
</P>
<P>
   --The wiper control stem that is so simple to use: up and down
for front wipers, in and out for rear wiper. No fiddling with
separate controls or looking for just the right spot on some dial.

IN NYC _ TRUCKS, TRUCKS, AND MORE TRUCKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many of you have asked, sometimes in anger over their
very existence or simply out of befuddlement over their popularity,
when the big truck/SUV craze will die down. Doesn't everybody who
wants a high-riding big rig have one by now? Won't rising gasoline
prices send consumers looking for smaller vehicles and
manufacturers back to the ramps for new products?
</P>
<P>
   The answer, in a New York minute: Faggedaboudit.
</P>
<P>
   At the 100th year of the New York International Auto Show,
trucks and SUVs were everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Pickup trucks are becoming SUV-like. Some SUVs are becoming more
carlike _ downright station wagony, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Zarella, executive vice president at General Motors, said
the message from customers is clear: ``Give us more trucks. Give us
more trucks. And keep 'em coming.''
</P>
<P>
   So GM will comply, and this year, for the first time, Zarella
said, the company will sell more trucks than cars. And they'll
equip them with ever more powerful, Vortec 6000 V8 engines. After
all, you wouldn't want some whining little power plant under the
hood as you motor along in your Chevrolet Silverado 3500 Big Dooley
Crew Cab would you?
</P>
<P>
   Also notable from GM was the announcement that its Denali XL
(used to be the GMC Suburban) will get full-time all-wheel drive.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan, which got left behind without a big truck when the
big-truck/SUV wave arose, announced that it, too, will begin
building big trucks. Its first V8 pickup will be here in 2003. And
once you've got the big-truck platform and the engine, four-door
pickup trucks and a line of big SUVs obviously will not be far
behind.
</P>
<P>
   For proof of that, look no further than Toyota's presentation at
this year's show.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota made big news last year with its highly acclaimed Toyota
Tundra, the first non-American V8 truck. Today, they can't build
them fast enough. But they aren't stopping there.
</P>
<P>
   The Tacoma pickup will now be offered with four doors _ just
like the Tundra.
</P>
<P>
   And with the unveiling of two new SUV models here this week,
Toyota now will offer five SUVs.
</P>
<P>
   It's no wonder that Don Esmond, group vice president and general
manager for Toyota Motor Sales, boasted at the presentation that
America now has a Big Four group of auto manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the SUV lineup that already includes the Land Cruiser
and 4Runner will be a redesigned RAV4, a big SUV called the Sequoia
(based on the Tundra platform), and a ground-up model called the
Highlander.
</P>
<P>
   The new RAV4 is taller and bigger than previous models, looking
much like the BMW and Mercedes SUVs. Toyota is aiming this car at
younger buyers, a market that the company acknowledges it left
behind in recent years. That's why on the non-SUV front, Toyota is
also pushing its new MR2 sports car, a new Celica, and the all-new
Echo.
</P>
<P>
   The Sequoia, introduced earlier in Detroit, is a luxurious SUV,
and with the Lexus-based V8 that powers the Tundra under the
Sequoia's hood, it will be a silky, powerful vehicle. The
Highlander will be more carlike _ for those who want good driving
in bad weather, who want to sit a bit higher, and who want the
expansiveness of an SUV.
</P>
<P>
   As he stood before Toyota's lineup of five SUVs, Esmond was
upfront about the conflicting mission of trying to build cleaner,
more environmentally friendly cars while at the same time meeting
customer demand.
</P>
<P>
   There is ``no argument about what customers are demanding,''
Esmond said, referring to the demand for trucks and SUVs. So while
building its SUV and truck fleet, he said, Toyota will also begin
selling its hybrid gasoline-electric Prius this summer at under
$20,000. For the anti-SUV crowd, this is a chance to bolster the
manufacture of a car that not only runs clean, but gets more than
50 miles per gallon and seats five. If some folks can demand trucks
and SUVs, it will be up to others to show demand for hybrid
vehicles such as the Prius and Honda's Insight.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the demand for bigger, for more powerful, for
taller, longer, roomier continues unabated.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the American market, V8 power rules,'' Esmond summarized.
``It gets you into the big games.''
</P>
<P>
   Other auto show highlights:
</P>
<P>
   --Oldsmobile showed off a new Bravada, promising that this
6-cylinder SUV will perform like it's got a V8. Interestingly, its
platform will be shared with Honda Passport, Isuzu Rodeo, Chevrolet
Blazer, and the GMC Jimmy.
</P>
<P>
   --More on SUVs: Audi got into the
is-it-an-SUV-or-is-it-a-station-wagon game with the Audi 2.7
Allroad Quattro, which looked very much like a Volvo Cross Country
set higher off the road and made taller and more muscular.
</P>
<P>
   --And speaking of Subaru, they introduced a new engine, the H6
3.0, a horizontally opposed engine that will deliver 212
horsepower. Slap that in your Outback and you're ready to rumble.
</P>
<P>
   --And finally, as that guy Fitzgerald said, writing about that
other guy Gatsby, we seem to be borne back ceaselessly to the past.
So it was with great pleasure that I toured a small exhibit of cars
that had been introduced down the years at earlier New York shows.
Among my favorites: A 1903 Olds Doctor's Coupe with a single
cylinder engine, a 1916 Cadillac Town Car, a 1927 Pierce Arrow
Limousine, a 1930 Franklin Sport Runabout, a 1955 Ford Thunderbird,
a 1958 Dual Ghia ``400'' prototype with a record player installed,
a 1948 Chelvrolet Fleetmaster ``Woody'' Station Wagon, and finally,
from among all of them, the car I would take home with me, if I
could: a 1929 Stutz Vertical 8 Black Hawk Speedster.

   PORT ARTHUR, Texas _ The Soul Food Kitchen is not an eatery that
many people just happen to stumble across by accident _ unless, of
course, as proprietor Mirinda Jacko puts it, ``it's God's will.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, it's on one of Port Arthur's main streets all right, and
there is a sign out by the street. It's just that most people
aren't used to looking for a cafe inside a church.
</P>
<P>
   A letter-sized handwritten sign on a side door of Christian
Faith Church leads the hungry into a hallway, around a corner and
into the dining room and its six long tables and 36 metal folding
chairs. Sometimes a customer's nose will lead him on the more
direct route from the parking lot in back of the church _ through
the back door right into Jacko's kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just tell them to come on in and make themselves at home,''
said Sister Jacko, as she's known around the church where she's
been a member for 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   This is definitely not McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, this isn't fast food,'' chuckled Jacko during a rare
occasion when she could sit down. ``This isn't restaurant food.
This is home cooking. It's just good old home cooking like folks
used to eat at home before they had all of this fast food. It's
good, healthy food. I don't make it with all that grease like you
find in restaurant food.''
</P>
<P>
   She will fix a hamburger, if a customer really wants one, and
there is a real menu. But most customers just order a $5 plate
lunch special from the sign above the table that holds six
different kinds of hot sauce, ketchup and other condiments.
</P>
<P>
   What's on the special varies every weekday. There might be
country ribs, meatloaf, stuffed bell peppers, turkey necks or the
hen wings that Jacko explains are ``bigger and tougher than fryer
wings, so I have to cook 'em more.''
</P>
<P>
   Side orders vary from black-eyed peas, red beans and pinto beans
to cole slaw and macaroni and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Every day the menu includes pig's feet and oxtails. ``We sell a
lot of oxtails,'' Jacko said. ``People sure do like those
oxtails.''
</P>
<P>
   Oxtails aren't something found on the menus of ordinary cafes,
after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had oxtails in a long, long time,'' said 77-year-old
Vickie Falcon. ``My grandmother used to make them. Of course she
cooked them the Spanish way with hominy.'' Falcon, a widow, lives
alone and said she doesn't much care to cook just for herself, and
it's hard to find a good place to get home cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Later, gnawing on the bones, she allowed that her grandmother
would have approved of Jacko's oxtails. ``I'll be back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacko said she starts out with a roux, similar to one used to
make gumbo, and boils the oxtails for a good long time to make them
tender. Pig's feet start out with a roux, too, ``but it's a lighter
roux, and I put vinegar in it. Those people, they just like to suck
on those pig's feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson County Justice of the Peace Thurman Bartie looked at
the list of daily specials and said, ``I want it all. Like my
grandmother used to say, I get big eyes sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacko, a 49-year-old grandmother, learned her country cooking
skills from her mother, grandmother and especially one great-aunt
while she was growing up in Port Arthur and Lafayette, La. ``My
father died when I was 11 years old and us kids had to grow up
fast,'' she said of herself and her five brothers and sisters.
</P>
<P>
   She remembered cooking stewed rabbit and greens called pepper
grass.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Jacko and Pastor J. Barrington Minix decided that
opening the cafe would cure her problem of what to do with her
time, while at the same time serving as a ministerial outreach for
the church and perhaps help raise money for church projects.
</P>
<P>
   Tammie Davis, a waitress, is also the church secretary. ``It's
all God's work,'' she said. Paul Anderson, who also helps out, is
the church gardener.
</P>
<P>
   Jacko bought an entire commercial kitchen from a closed
smokehouse restaurant that included everything from pots and pans
to a six-burner stove with a deep fryer.
</P>
<P>
   A portable tape player is constantly playing gospel music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes you feel good,'' Jacko said. ``We leave all that
fuss and worry of the world outside. People come in here and they
get some good food and they go away feeling good. See, the people
who come in here are people of the world and this might be the only
place they hear the Word, so we give them the Word.''
</P>
<P>
   She's thinking of installing a television to play sermons and
gospel music from church services. There won't be any soap operas
or talk shows on that television, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since opening in November, the place hasn't made much of a
profit, but Jacko said she feels good that it's at least paying for
itself. The 36 chairs aren't often full.
</P>
<P>
   But every day there are more and more people who find their way
through the side door and down the hall to the Soul Food Kitchen,
where the heady scent of home cooking mingles with gospel music.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes those who come can't afford a meal. Jacko recalled one
man with a car so rickety that he kept it running while he dashed
inside and asked if he could get a breakfast for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fed him and gave him $5 for gas,'' she said. ``He came in
here with a great big Bible and sat right there and prayed. You
know, you never will know when God might send you an angel.''

 &HT;    Toys 'R' Us to sell children's tools with Home Depot logos
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Home Depot and Toys ``R'' Us are reaching out to
budding do-it-yourselfers with a new line of tools for tots.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's largest toy chain has begun selling Home
Depot-branded tools and kits.
</P>
<P>
   Scaled down in size for half-pints, a line of real tools for
ages 8 and up are working models of what you'd find at a Home
Depot. Hammers, screwdrivers, pliers and wrenches are sold in sets
with miniature goggles and tool belts.
</P>
<P>
   Kids as young as 2 years old can fire up a whirring
``Eco-Ranger'' toy chainsaw or a mini-jackhammer.
</P>
<P>
   All of the tools, real or toy replicas, are emblazoned with the
bright orange Home Depot logo. Prices range from $9.99 to $29.99.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a branding standpoint, this is a big deal,'' said Karen
Parham, supervisor of community affairs for Home Depot. ``This
certainly is a chance to build brand loyalty at an early age.''
Parham is overseeing the new program.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Toys ``R'' Us deal, Atlanta-based Home Depot receives
a royalty from the toy sales. This is the first time another
retailer has sold a product with Home Depot's name on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toys `R' Us came to us with the idea as an extension of our
kid's workshops,'' said Suzanne Apple, Home Depot's vice president
of community affairs. About 3 million children have taken the
how-to classes in the past three years, Apple said.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us is considering holding a ``product demo'' night
every week, said David Konigsberg, store director of the Alpharetta
store near North Point Mall. The retailers are also talking about
creating a line of Home Depot wheelbarrows and lawnmowers, Parham
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Depot partnership is part of a new push by Paramus,
N.J.-based Toys ``R'' Us to boost profits and take back its ranking
as the No. 1 toy seller. Toys ``R'' Us lost that spot to Wal-Mart
Stores two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us recently struck licensing deals with OshKosh
B'Gosh, a children's clothing line, and Animal Planet, a cable
channel, to develop exclusive products.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Depot tool displays will be rolled out to 16 Toys ``R''
Us stores next month and should arrive in 170 U.S. stores by the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Christmas, this stuff is going to be a big hit,'' said
Konigsberg. ``We see it as a great gift idea for grandparents and
uncles.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time, scientists have successfully used gene
therapy, the replacement of defective genes with working copies, to
save the lives of several infants who might otherwise have died of
a severe immune disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said the achievement, announced Thursday, was the
first unequivocal success for gene therapy, a field whose widely
heralded promise has until now ended in disappointing results.
</P>
<P>
   The work involved three babies who could not grow complete
immune systems. The only other treatment for the condition, a form
of severe combined immune deficiency, is a bone marrow transplant,
which works just 60 percent of the time. Otherwise, patients must
live in germ-free bubbles or fall prey to the ever-present
microorganisms that most people easily fend off.
</P>
<P>
   In a report of the work, in Friday's issue of the journal
Science, Dr. Alain Fischer, a professor of pediatric immunology at
the Hospital Necker-Enfants Malades in Paris and his colleagues
describe the course of two of the babies, ages 11 months and 8
months at the time of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after their gene therapy, the researchers
recounted, the babies were home from the hospital, living like any
other children. Ten months later, their immune systems were normal.
Ordinarily, infants born with SCID (pronounced like skid), die
before their first birthdays unless they remain in a germ-free
environments.
</P>
<P>
   In a footnote, the researchers said they had successfully
treated a third baby, who was 1-month-old at the time. In a
telephone interview, Fischer said he had since treated two more
babies and was waiting to learn whether the effort succeeded with
them as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very happy and the families are very happy,'' Fischer
said. ``It is a success today. Then the next question is, `How long
will it be a success?' It may be that after some time there will be
a decline in these cells and that sooner or later we will have to
treat them again. We hope that if this happens it will not be for a
very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene therapy experts were exuberant. ``It's a very exciting
study,'' said Dr. R. Michael Blaese, who was a member of a medical
team at the National Institutes of Health that attempted the first
gene therapy on a human patient nearly 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Blaese, now the head of the human therapeutics division at
ValiGen in Newtown, Pa., added: ``This would probably be the first
example in any disease where gene therapy could be a fully
successful treatment. You can't distinguish these patients from
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   The success comes after a tumultuous decade in which, according
to the National Institutes of Health, more than 390 gene therapy
studies were initiated, involving more than 4,000 patients and more
than a dozen medical conditions. While those doing the research
always expressed confidence in its promise, critics said many of
the companies formed to capitalize on the technology exaggerated
preliminary data in hopes of raising capital.
</P>
<P>
   And, at times, some scientists promised more than the technology
was ready to deliver, leaving the field a target for accusations
that patients were being endangered by reckless experiments that
were doomed to failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all been so burned by saying, `Ah, this looks like it
worked, that looks like it worked,' '' said Dr. W. French Anderson
of the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern
California, and a member of the team that attempted the first gene
therapy in 1990. ``Now when it finally looks like something is
working, I don't want to be in the position of saying the same
words. We've all been criticized for hyping too much.''
</P>
<P>
   The babies treated by Fischer had a rare disorder known as
severe combined immunodeficiency-X1, or SCID-X1, which almost
exclusively affects boys, occurring once in every 75,000 live male
births. It is caused by mutations that destroy the function of a
gene that is needed to make T cells, a class of white blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the condition is a perfect target for gene therapy.
With scid-X1, the cells that need a new gene are readily accessible
in the bone marrow, which is relatively easy to remove from the
body.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, if functioning genes actually get into the marrow
cells of patients with SCID-X1, those genetically corrected cells
will proliferate and displace cells with the defective gene. That
is because, as the body tries to grow a complete immune system, it
sends waves of chemical signals to the bone marrow to stimulate it
into providing T cells. T cells with the defective gene start to
grow and then die. Any cells with a functioning gene will be fueled
by the body's hormones and will grow rapidly to populate the bone
marrow.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said he began working on gene therapy for SCID-X1 in
1993, as soon as the missing gene was identified. He studied the
treatment in mice and in the laboratory, attempting to insert the
gene into patients' cells for six years before trying to treat
patients. Last year, he said, he decided ``there was a serious
chance that the treatment could work in this particular disease,''
and the success with the first babies was the result.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Scientists, of course, were well aware that SCID-X1 and other
rare genetic diseases of immune system cells would be perfect for
gene therapy. In fact, the very first human gene therapy patient
had a similar disease. The experiment took place at the National
Institutes of Health on Sept. 14, 1990, and involved a 4-year-old
girl, Ashanti de Silva, whose gene defect prevented her blood cells
from making an enzyme that clears metabolic toxins from the body.
Those toxins, left unchecked, kill T cells.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers removed some white blood cells from Ashanti, added
the needed gene to those cells, and infused about a billion of the
cells back to her. They repeated the treatment 10 more times over
the next few years. Ashanti's disorder had another treatment _ she
could have received injections of the enzyme she was missing, which
would have enabled her to make T cells.
</P>
<P>
   But the scientists hoped that gene therapy would enable her to
survive without the enzyme treatment. It did not. ``We never felt
we could stop her enzymes completely,'' Blaese said. She is still
alive and still taking enzymes.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with the experiment, Anderson explained, was that
researchers needed to get the new genes into stem cells, which are
the progenitor cells of the bone marrow, from which all other
cells, including T cells, grow. Any genes added to stem cells would
become a permanent part of the person's immune system.
</P>
<P>
   But any genes added to more mature immune system cells would die
when the cells did, in weeks or months. When Ashanti was treated,
however, scientists faced a problem. If they tried to put genes
into stem cells that were at rest and not dividing, the cells would
not accept the genes.

   If they allowed the cells to divide, they would accept the
genes. But, Anderson said, ``then they would differentiate and they
weren't stem cells anymore.'' Now, researchers have learned how to
grow progenitor cells in the laboratory so that they divide but do
not differentiate. That makes it possible to add genes to them.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer said it was that discovery along with numerous technical
achievements in molecular biology that enabled him to successfully
treat babies with SCID-X1.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing new intellectually here,'' said Dr. Stuart
Orkin, a professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School.
``They've put together all the incremental advances that occurred
over the past several years.''
</P>
<P>
   But many gene therapy researchers had not waited for such
advances, experts said. Starting with Ashanti, scientists attempted
gene therapy after gene therapy in patients, attempting to cure at
least a dozen diseases, including cystic fibrosis, cardiovascular
disease, Alzheimer's disease, hemophilia, hypercholesterolemia, and
_ in more than two-thirds of the studies _ cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, Orkin, as director of a federal panel reporting
on gene therapy, said that there were very large numbers of
clinical trials ``many of which have been approved without
extraordinary oversight in terms of scientific or clinical
benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``There were a lot of people going around
grandstanding and saying they could cure cystic fibrosis and many
other things, which is a vast oversimplification. The awful history
is not just the companies. Some of it, unfortunately, is the
investigators and the academic institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the festering discomfort many felt with the
proliferating gene therapy trials came to a head when a teen-ager,
Jesse Gelsinger, died in a clinical trial at the University of
Pennsylvania. The death brought investigations of all gene therapy
studies and widespread cries that the field was moving ahead
recklessly, with no success in sight.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview on Wednesday, Orkin said that the panel he
headed never questioned whether gene therapy would work,
eventually. ``What we argued for was to do the research and to look
for actual clinical benefit, which hadn't been demonstrated even in
a mouse at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   The success, at last, of gene therapy shows the wisdom of such
an approach, experts said. ``They did all the science beforehand
and then translated it to the patient, which is what I think the
field should be doing,'' Orkin said. He and others said that, of
course, SCID-X1 was a very special case and that it did not follow
that gene therapy would work immediately for other diseases.
``Because you correct SCID doesn't mean you can correct any other
disease,'' Anderson said. ``But if you can't correct SCID, you
can't correct anything else.''

 &HT;    COURT GRANTS ELIAN'S FATHER LIMITED LEGAL STANDING, RENO GIVES
EMOTIONAL DEFENSE OF RAID
 &HT;    With ELIAN-COSTS-0428.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Elian Gonzalez awaited the arrival of relatives
and friends from his homeland of Cuba, his father scored an
important legal victory Thursday when a federal appeals court
allowed him to intervene in the court case that could determine
whether the boy is granted political asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision essentially
gives Juan Miguel Gonzalez a voice in the case, a potential first
step toward giving the 31-year-old Cuban father sole authority to
speak for his son in the legal proceedings here.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday the court chose not specifically address that
issue, which Gonzalez had raised in an earlier motion.
</P>
<P>
   Granting such a request could effectively end the legal
tug-of-war between Elian's father and the Miami relatives who cared
for the 6-year-old for five months after he was rescued from a
shipwreck in the Florida Straits on Thanksgiving Day. It would
clear the way for the father to withdraw the political asylum
request that originated with the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said it would put off any action on the
request by Elian's father to substitute him for Lazaro Gonzalez,
the boy's great-uncle in Miami, as the one who speaks for the
child.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the federal appeals court in Atlanta denied
a series of requests from the Miami relatives for visits with Elian
and rejected their request to appoint a guardian for the boy as the
legal maneuverings head toward a May 11 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The court action highlighted a day that began with U.S. Attorney
General Janet Reno giving an emotional defense of the raid that
removed the boy from his Miami relatives's home and reunited him
with his father, who arrived in the United States three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   And while the appeals court denied the Miami relatives request
to visit Elian, Reno suggested that perhaps the boy and his Miami
cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, could visit each other at some point
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that Marisleysis will be out of his life,''
the attorney general said at her regular weekly news conference,
her first since Saturday's dramatic pre-dawn seizure of Elian. ``I
mean, you could look at them and see a connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez has said she has become a surrogate mother
for Elian, whose mother died in the tragic attempt to flee Cuba
last November. She and 10 other people died when their boat
capsized. Elian survived in an inner tube for two days until
rescued by fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed by the government with the court in Atlanta, a
psychiatrist, Dr. Paulina Kernberg of Cornell University, said
Elian's feelings for Marisleysis Gonzalez are ``similar to the
romantic feelings of a school boy for his teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatrist, who examined Elian for nearly three hours,
said the boy displays a ``sense of well-being and happiness with
his father,'' adding, ``Whenever he made eye contact with his
father, his face brightened.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court rejected the request from Marisleysis Gonzalez
and her father, Lazaro Gonzalez, for ``regular and reasonable
access'' to Elian until the court decides whether to reinstate a
claim of political asylum they filed on Elian's behalf during the
legal tug-of-war with the father over custody of the child.
</P>
<P>
   But the court, in a brief order, accepted the government's offer
to supply it with biweekly reports on the boy from a psychiatrist
and a social worker hired to monitor Elian.
</P>
<P>
   However, the court also continued its order barring Elian from
any site in this country that has diplomatic immunity. His presence
at such a site would put him out of the legal reach of the U.S.
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez's wife and their
6-month-old son are staying in a two-story Maryland farmhouse owned
by the Aspen Institute. It is adjacent to the Wye River estate that
was used for Middle East peace talks by the Clinton administration
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   One of Elian's teachers and a 10-year-old cousin from Cuba
arrived in the United States Wednesday night to keep the boy
company through what could be a prolonged legal battle over the
political asylum application from his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Elian's schoolmates and four adult chaperones arrived in
the Washington area late Thursday afternoon and were expected to be
reunited with Elian later in the day. Cuban President Fidel Castro
gave them a personal farewell in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez has asked the State Department to grant
visas to an entourage of 25 Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who ordered the raid on Lazaro Gonzalez's home in the
Little Havana area of Miami, fought back tears at one point during
her news conference Thursday as she recalled what went through her
mind as she made her final decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``How he (Elian) would feel suddenly being put in the arms of a
stranger _ what would he think, how frightened would he be? And I
kept thinking, I wish that I could see him when his daddy gets on
the plane,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was transported to the Washington area on a government
aircraft after U.S. marshals and federal immigration agents removed
him from Lazaro Gonzalez's home following the breakdown of
negotiations between the attorney general and the Miami relatives's
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   She said Elian ``has had a lot of bad luck along the way,'' but
added, ``He's still resilient, he's still strong, he's still a
smiling little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate hearings have been scheduled for next week to air
congressional criticism that Reno authorized excessive force in the
raid to seize Elian, but the attorney general said Thursday that a
show of force was necessary after negotiations for a peaceful
transfer to the father began to falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the agents had to be in force,'' she said. ``Elian
was being held by this person, and there had to be a show of force,
not a use of force, to show that we were in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the negotiations with the Miami relatives, she said, ``It
wasn't going to get any better.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the pre-dawn hours of Saturday were ``the most
appropriate time with the least crowd'' for the raid. ``This
appeared to be the safest time possible to effect the transfer,''
she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   She denied that the agents who conducted the raid used abusive
language, as the Miami relatives's have contended since the raid on
their home.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the anger Cuban Americans feel toward her would
prevent her from returning to Miami, her home, when her term as
attorney general is over, Reno said, ``Won't be difficult at all.''
When asked to elaborate, she replied, ``What is there to talk
about? It's my home.''

 &HT;    TAXPAYER COST FOR ELIAN SAGA SURGES PAST $2 MILLION
 &HT;    With CUBA-ELIAN-0428.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE, MIKE WILLIAMS and SUE SCHULTZ 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Elian Gonzalez and his dad get reacquainted
courtesy of the private owner of a 25-room mansion on Maryland's
Eastern Shore, the bill to the American taxpayers for the saga of
the 6-year-old Cuban refugee is soaring well beyond $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Costs include overtime for local and county police in Florida,
expenses for 151 federal agents who executed the raid to snatch
Elian from the home of his Miami relatives and $2,900 an hour to
fly Elian to the Washington area aboard an eight-seat Sabreliner
jet.
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary tally, Justice Department officials Thursday
estimated their agency's costs through last Monday had reached
$578,000, most of it paid by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The total so far does not include expenses at Andrews Air Force
Base, outside Washington, where Elian his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, were first reunited on April 22 and spent three nights
subsequently.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Marshals Service said Thursday that it paid for five
suites on the high-security Air Force base, one for the Gonzalez
family and the rest for for marshals in their security detail. The
cost was $36 a night per suite, said Drew Wade, a spokesman for the
Marshals Service.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, law enforcement costs are continuing to mount, now
that the Gonzalez family reunion has moved to the Wye River
conference center, site of the 1998 Middle East Peace talks. The
family is staying as the guests of owner Nina Houghton, who chairs
the Wye Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But round-the-clock security is provided by the U.S. government.
Marshals guard the pastoral setting by land, and a 41-foot U.S.
Coast Guard rescue boat patrols the shores, shooing away curiosity
seekers or anyone else who tries to come too close. The boat costs
roughly $2,000 a day to operate, a Coast Guard spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Luis Fernandez, a spokesman in the Cuban Interests
Section, said he had ``no idea'' what the Cuban government costs
have been in regard to Elian.
</P>
<P>
   In the final tally, however, the heaviest load will be carried
in Florida, where the City of Miami and Miami-Dade County have paid
for overtime for police officers stationed at the Little Havana
home of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, to deal with protests
during the past five months.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Miami Police Department said Thursday that
no updated totals were available. But as of April 8, the city had
spent more than $800,000, mostly for overtime for police officers.
</P>
<P>
   That amount is sure to skyrocket when the city adds the expense
of the large protests after heavily armed INS agents and U.S.
Marshals took Elian in the pre-dawn hours of April 22. All
uniformed officers were called out on 12-hour shifts for the
protests that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Miami-Dade County has estimated its overtime costs
at $1 million for the entire period, including the April 22
disturbances, said Rhonda Barnett, a spokeswoman for the county
government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two state agencies _ the Florida Highway Patrol and
the Florida Department of Law Enforcement _ spent a combined
$105,000 through early April, mostly for overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Beach police spent more than $28,000 dealing with crowds
at the home of Barry University President Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin,
who hosted Elian's reunion with his grandmothers and a meeting
between the Miami relatives and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Even Florida's toll booths took a hit. The state lost about
$55,000 in Miami-Dade County, where road tolls were lifted in early
January when protests paralyzed traffic following the initial
federal decision to send Elian back to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County, Md., will pick up the security tab for Juan
Miguel's stay at the suburban home of the top Cuban envoy in the
United States. Early costs were $50,000, according to the
Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, local communities seek reimbursement from the federal
government for some of their law enforcement costs. Washington,
D.C., for example, has asked for $5 million to cover police costs
for dealing with a weekend of protests against the International
Monetary Fund earlier this month.

STRONG GROWTH COULD LEAD THE FED TO RAISE RATES A HALF-POINT IN
MAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ECON-REPORT) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The reports Thursday that the economy is flirting
with inflation were probably not enough on their own to lock the
Federal Reserve into adopting a more aggressive course of interest
rate increases when it meets on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   But the robust pace of growth in the first quarter and the clear
warning signs of an acceleration in wage and price increases all
but guarantee that Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, and his
colleagues at the central bank will seriously consider raising
rates by half a percentage point rather than by the quarter-point
that investors and economists have been anticipating.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fighting a phantom _ the theoretical possibility of
a pickup in inflation _ the Fed can now point for the first time to
specific if early evidence that the economy is overheating.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic data make an overwhelming case for picking up the
pace of tightening,'' said James F. O'Sullivan, an economist at
J.P. Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Fed has tended not to change policy on the basis of
one or two economic reports. Greenspan did not mention the latest
indicators in a speech today on the rural economy. But he has long
preferred to change monetary policy in gradual, consistent steps
that are well telegraphed to the markets, a practice he has
followed faithfully over the last 10 months in raising rates five
times in quarter-point increments.
</P>
<P>
   Because Greenspan has given no public indication that he is
ready to raise rates in bigger steps, some analysts think the Fed
is unlikely to opt for a half-point increase in May. The Fed's
benchmark federal funds target rate stands at 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some Fed officials have also emphasized in recent months that
small rate increases are the most prudent course at a time when
there are so many unresolved questions about how fast the economy
can grow without igniting inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan has expressed hope about improvements in productivity,
the crucial factor in determining the economy's noninflationary
speed limit. But he has also said that at some point even
productivity cannot offset upward pressure on wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in a fog, you take small steps,'' said Bill
Cheney, an economist at John Hancock, the life insurance company.
``One could argue strongly for a course of sticking to
25-basis-point increases.'' (A basis point is one-hundredth of a
percentage point.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if Greenspan sticks to his gradualist approach, he will
confront pressure from other members of the central bank's policy-
setting Federal Open Market Committee, some of whom have been
pushing for half-point increases since February.
</P>
<P>
   The minutes of the Feb. 1-2 meeting, when the Fed raised rates
by a quarter-point, indicated that a few members even then were
pressing for an increase of 50 basis points ``in order to provide
greater assurance against a buildup of inflationary expectations
and inflation'' in subsequent months. Other members, the minutes
said, acknowledged that more aggressive action might be needed if
the economy continued to roar along, as it has.
</P>
<P>
   The minutes of the meeting on March 21, when the Fed voted for
another quarter-point increase, have not been made public.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how many of the committee's 10 voting members
would favor a half-point increase. But they are almost certain to
include Jerry Jordan, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of
Cleveland, who is perhaps the most vociferous inflation hawk on the
Fed. They are likely also to include Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed
governor who has long warned that the current combination of 4.1
percent unemployment and strong growth cannot continue indefinitely
without creating a cycle of rising wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainties about the economy's capacity to grow without
inflation have led to a monetary policy course that has been
``somewhat more gradualist, in my view, somewhat less pre-emptive
than it otherwise might have been,'' Meyer said in a speech several
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer added, pointedly, that ``there are limits to monetary
policy's tolerance for above-trend growth and for further labor
market tightening.''
</P>
<P>
   Before making its decision, the Fed will have several more sets
of economic data to consider, including a report on job creation
and unemployment next Friday and the report on the Consumer Price
Index, which will be released on the morning of the Fed meeting on
May 16.
</P>
<P>
   Another wild card for the central bank is the stock market. A
stabilization or rebound in the market in coming weeks could add to
pressure on the Fed to raise rates more aggressively. Should the
market turn down again and stay down, it could help dampen consumer
spending and overall demand, reducing inflation pressures.

 &HT;    COURT GRANTS ELIAN'S FATHER LIMITED LEGAL STANDING, RENO GIVES
EMOTIONAL DEFENSE OF RAID
 &HT;    With ELIAN-COSTS-0428.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Elian Gonzalez awaited the arrival of relatives
and friends from his homeland of Cuba, his father scored an
important legal victory Thursday when a federal appeals court
allowed him to intervene in the court case that could determine
whether the boy is granted political asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision essentially
gives Juan Miguel Gonzalez a voice in the case, a potential first
step toward giving the 31-year-old Cuban father sole authority to
speak for his son in the legal proceedings here.
</P>
<P>
   But on Thursday the court chose not specifically address that
issue, which Gonzalez had raised in an earlier motion.
</P>
<P>
   Granting such a request could effectively end the legal
tug-of-war between Elian's father and the Miami relatives who cared
for the 6-year-old for five months after he was rescued from a
shipwreck in the Florida Straits on Thanksgiving Day. It would
clear the way for the father to withdraw the political asylum
request that originated with the Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court said it would put off any action on the
request by Elian's father to substitute him for Lazaro Gonzalez,
the boy's great-uncle in Miami, as the one who speaks for the
child.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, the federal appeals court in Atlanta denied
a series of requests from the Miami relatives for visits with Elian
and rejected their request to appoint a guardian for the boy as the
legal maneuverings head toward a May 11 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The court action highlighted a day that began with U.S. Attorney
General Janet Reno giving an emotional defense of the raid that
removed the boy from his Miami relatives's home and reunited him
with his father, who arrived in the United States three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   And while the appeals court denied the Miami relatives request
to visit Elian, Reno suggested that perhaps the boy and his Miami
cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, could visit each other at some point
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine that Marisleysis will be out of his life,''
the attorney general said at her regular weekly news conference,
her first since Saturday's dramatic pre-dawn seizure of Elian. ``I
mean, you could look at them and see a connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez has said she has become a surrogate mother
for Elian, whose mother died in the tragic attempt to flee Cuba
last November. She and 10 other people died when their boat
capsized. Elian survived in an inner tube for two days until
rescued by fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed by the government with the court in Atlanta, a
psychiatrist, Dr. Paulina Kernberg of Cornell University, said
Elian's feelings for Marisleysis Gonzalez are ``similar to the
romantic feelings of a school boy for his teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   The psychiatrist, who examined Elian for nearly three hours,
said the boy displays a ``sense of well-being and happiness with
his father,'' adding, ``Whenever he made eye contact with his
father, his face brightened.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court rejected the request from Marisleysis Gonzalez
and her father, Lazaro Gonzalez, for ``regular and reasonable
access'' to Elian until the court decides whether to reinstate a
claim of political asylum they filed on Elian's behalf during the
legal tug-of-war with the father over custody of the child.
</P>
<P>
   But the court, in a brief order, accepted the government's offer
to supply it with biweekly reports on the boy from a psychiatrist
and a social worker hired to monitor Elian.
</P>
<P>
   However, the court also continued its order barring Elian from
any site in this country that has diplomatic immunity. His presence
at such a site would put him out of the legal reach of the U.S.
justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Elian, his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez's wife and their
6-month-old son are staying in a two-story Maryland farmhouse owned
by the Aspen Institute. It is adjacent to the Wye River estate that
was used for Middle East peace talks by the Clinton administration
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   One of Elian's teachers and a 10-year-old cousin from Cuba
arrived in the United States Wednesday night to keep the boy
company through what could be a prolonged legal battle over the
political asylum application from his Miami relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Four of Elian's schoolmates and four adult chaperones arrived in
the Washington area late Thursday afternoon and were expected to be
reunited with Elian later in the day. Cuban President Fidel Castro
gave them a personal farewell in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez has asked the State Department to grant
visas to an entourage of 25 Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who ordered the raid on Lazaro Gonzalez's home in the
Little Havana area of Miami, fought back tears at one point during
her news conference Thursday as she recalled what went through her
mind as she made her final decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``How he (Elian) would feel suddenly being put in the arms of a
stranger _ what would he think, how frightened would he be? And I
kept thinking, I wish that I could see him when his daddy gets on
the plane,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was transported to the Washington area on a government
aircraft after U.S. marshals and federal immigration agents removed
him from Lazaro Gonzalez's home following the breakdown of
negotiations between the attorney general and the Miami relatives's
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   She said Elian ``has had a lot of bad luck along the way,'' but
added, ``He's still resilient, he's still strong, he's still a
smiling little boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate hearings have been scheduled for next week to air
congressional criticism that Reno authorized excessive force in the
raid to seize Elian, but the attorney general said Thursday that a
show of force was necessary after negotiations for a peaceful
transfer to the father began to falter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the agents had to be in force,'' she said. ``Elian
was being held by this person, and there had to be a show of force,
not a use of force, to show that we were in control.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the negotiations with the Miami relatives, she said, ``It
wasn't going to get any better.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the pre-dawn hours of Saturday were ``the most
appropriate time with the least crowd'' for the raid. ``This
appeared to be the safest time possible to effect the transfer,''
she told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   She denied that the agents who conducted the raid used abusive
language, as the Miami relatives's have contended since the raid on
their home.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the anger Cuban Americans feel toward her would
prevent her from returning to Miami, her home, when her term as
attorney general is over, Reno said, ``Won't be difficult at all.''
When asked to elaborate, she replied, ``What is there to talk
about? It's my home.''

 &HT;    TAXPAYER COST FOR ELIAN SAGA SURGES PAST $2 MILLION
 &HT;    With CUBA-ELIAN-0428.
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE, MIKE WILLIAMS and SUE SCHULTZ 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Elian Gonzalez and his dad get reacquainted
courtesy of the private owner of a 25-room mansion on Maryland's
Eastern Shore, the bill to the American taxpayers for the saga of
the 6-year-old Cuban refugee is soaring well beyond $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Costs include overtime for local and county police in Florida,
expenses for 151 federal agents who executed the raid to snatch
Elian from the home of his Miami relatives and $2,900 an hour to
fly Elian to the Washington area aboard an eight-seat Sabreliner
jet.
</P>
<P>
   In a preliminary tally, Justice Department officials Thursday
estimated their agency's costs through last Monday had reached
$578,000, most of it paid by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service.
</P>
<P>
   The total so far does not include expenses at Andrews Air Force
Base, outside Washington, where Elian his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, were first reunited on April 22 and spent three nights
subsequently.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Marshals Service said Thursday that it paid for five
suites on the high-security Air Force base, one for the Gonzalez
family and the rest for for marshals in their security detail. The
cost was $36 a night per suite, said Drew Wade, a spokesman for the
Marshals Service.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, law enforcement costs are continuing to mount, now
that the Gonzalez family reunion has moved to the Wye River
conference center, site of the 1998 Middle East Peace talks. The
family is staying as the guests of owner Nina Houghton, who chairs
the Wye Institute.
</P>
<P>
   But round-the-clock security is provided by the U.S. government.
Marshals guard the pastoral setting by land, and a 41-foot U.S.
Coast Guard rescue boat patrols the shores, shooing away curiosity
seekers or anyone else who tries to come too close. The boat costs
roughly $2,000 a day to operate, a Coast Guard spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Luis Fernandez, a spokesman in the Cuban Interests
Section, said he had ``no idea'' what the Cuban government costs
have been in regard to Elian.
</P>
<P>
   In the final tally, however, the heaviest load will be carried
in Florida, where the City of Miami and Miami-Dade County have paid
for overtime for police officers stationed at the Little Havana
home of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, to deal with protests
during the past five months.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Miami Police Department said Thursday that
no updated totals were available. But as of April 8, the city had
spent more than $800,000, mostly for overtime for police officers.
</P>
<P>
   That amount is sure to skyrocket when the city adds the expense
of the large protests after heavily armed INS agents and U.S.
Marshals took Elian in the pre-dawn hours of April 22. All
uniformed officers were called out on 12-hour shifts for the
protests that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Miami-Dade County has estimated its overtime costs
at $1 million for the entire period, including the April 22
disturbances, said Rhonda Barnett, a spokeswoman for the county
government.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two state agencies _ the Florida Highway Patrol and
the Florida Department of Law Enforcement _ spent a combined
$105,000 through early April, mostly for overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Miami Beach police spent more than $28,000 dealing with crowds
at the home of Barry University President Sister Jeanne O'Laughlin,
who hosted Elian's reunion with his grandmothers and a meeting
between the Miami relatives and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
   Even Florida's toll booths took a hit. The state lost about
$55,000 in Miami-Dade County, where road tolls were lifted in early
January when protests paralyzed traffic following the initial
federal decision to send Elian back to his father.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery County, Md., will pick up the security tab for Juan
Miguel's stay at the suburban home of the top Cuban envoy in the
United States. Early costs were $50,000, according to the
Washington Times.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, local communities seek reimbursement from the federal
government for some of their law enforcement costs. Washington,
D.C., for example, has asked for $5 million to cover police costs
for dealing with a weekend of protests against the International
Monetary Fund earlier this month.

IN CUBA, AS IN MIAMI, TV COVERAGE IS `ALL ELIAN ALL THE TIME' 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: with CUBAN-BOY-NYT; for a complete list of sidebars, see
UPDATE-NYT-BUDGET) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ His classmates blow kisses into the camera and promise
hearty hugs when he returns. His relatives clown for the camera,
with one donning a wig to the delighted squeals of the clan. Two
cousins splash about in a swimming pool, show off karate moves _ in
slow motion as dreamy violins play _ and romp with three puppies in
an idyllic park that could be in, well, Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not. It is Cuba, and it is the Elian home video, shot
in and around his hometown, Cardenas, and sent as a sort of letter
from home.
</P>
<P>
   The ostensible reason is to counteract any homesickness Elian
may feel as he and his father await court rulings to determine
whether the boy should remain in the United States, as is the wish
of the Miami relatives who had cared for the boy after his
shipwreck last November. He was forceably removed from their home
last Saturday after they refused to turn him over to his father.
</P>
<P>
   But the indisputable message for Elian Gonzalez _ and perhaps
Cubans who saw excerpts of the 41-minute video Wednesday night and
Thursday morning _ is that, whatever impressions they may have of
Miami, life is good here, too.
</P>
<P>
   The video is part of the propaganda campaign President Fidel
Castro has waged almost since the inception of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Every night for over two hours, Cuba's two television stations,
which are state run, broadcast round-table discussions in which a
panel of six or seven people, often citing reports in the U.S.
media, dissect the latest turns in the case before a studio
audience that often includes Castro.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fixtures in the broadcasts has been Yasmani
Betancourt, Elian's 10-year-old cousin, who arrived in Washington
on Wednesday for a visit with Elian. Cuban television has broadcast
interviews with the boy, in which he talked about how much he
missed his cousin and playmate. Yasmani also was at center stage in
the video, doing the karate kicks, and speaking at a demonstration
before thousands of people last Saturday after Elian was returned
to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demonstrations, the video, the round-table discussions all
are calculated to whip up patriotic fervor, with this boy at the
center of it all.'' a Western diplomat said of the fight over
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, the propaganda war is aimed at answering the
Cuban-American community in Miami, routinely referred to here as
the Miami mafia by party stalwarts. So Cuban media have taken
unusual steps, replaying interviews _ faithfully translated into
Spanish _ with Attorney General Janet Reno, the immigration
commissioner, Doris Meissner, and other officials, conducted by
CNN, NBC and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   To an unprecedented extent, Cuban television _ during the
discussions and newscasts _ has shown extensive images of Miami and
anti-Castro demonstrators, glimpses rarely seen here except by
those with the illegal satellite dishes or antennas jury-rigged to
pick up signals from Miami television stations 100 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The images shown on Cuban television, however, seem intended
less to present the other side than to set up incendiary
commentary. The pictures are usually accompanied by analysis from
Cuban journalists ridiculing things like the weeping visage of
Marisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's cousin, who has fought for his
custody, and the ``total failure'' of demonstrators to shut down
the city on Tuesday in protest of Elian's seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators on the round-table discussions have often repeated
a important criticism of Castro from the Cuban-American community,
that Elian will be brainwashed upon his return, though such remarks
have been quickly and arduously disputed by Cuban psychologists,
who often appear on the show.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cuban video, images of horses and buggies clattering by
stone bungalows on the streets of Cardenas are interspersed with
clips of neighbors and relatives in their homes wishing him a quick
return.
</P>
<P>
   After its broadcast, a beaming Cuban commentator pronounced it
``moving.''

MCCAIN SAID CLOSE TO CANCELING MEETING WITH BUSH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a sign of continuing friction between the two
main combatants during the Republican presidential primary season,
Senator John McCain of Arizona is close to canceling his
much-anticipated May 9 meeting with Texas Governor George W. Bush.
As of late Thursday, a McCain aide said the session might occur but
remains ``tenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who is traveling in Vietnam, has been upset for weeks
about comments from Bush aides about him. Most recently, McCain was
angered at a Robert Novak column that said, without attribution,
that Bush aides anticipated ``all pain and little satisfaction''
from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush aides had hoped that McCain would endorse Bush at the
Pittsburgh session, but privately have said they are unsure whether
the Arizona senator would, especially because Bush has no intention
of endorsing McCain's campaign finance bill.
</P>
<P>
   Aides gave differing answers about whether the meeting will
occur. ``There was a period of uncertainty, which has been
resolved,'' Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said, asserting that the
meeting will happen.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain spokesman Todd Harris said that the meeting is
``tenuous,'' and that no decision will be made until aides to Bush
and McCain meet Friday to discuss a possible agenda for the
session. McCain aides said the meeting must focus on issues, not on
whether McCain would consider the vice presidential spot.

JUDGE HOLDS OFF ON   ENDING HMO'S RECEIVERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LIZ KOWALCZYK  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It will be at least two weeks before the Supreme
Judicial Court decides whether to end the state's first HMO
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Justice Francis Spina heard arguments about the future
of Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, which was forced into state
receivership Jan. 4, but ended the 90-minute hearing without
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The most vociferous objections to ending the receivership came
from the advocacy group Health Care For All, which argued there's
not enough evidence the HMO is fixing its troubled finances.
</P>
<P>
   The organization criticized Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly
for not releasing details of Harvard Pilgrim's turnaround plan and
2000 business plan and demanded more consumer protection measures
in the state's proposed rehabilitation order.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know if the success of this plan depends on Harvard
Pilgrim increasing premiums, selling off assets, or leaving certain
markets,'' said Laurie Martinelli, executive director of Health Law
Advocates, which represents the consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   J. David Leslie, special assistant attorney general, said
regulators are protecting conumers by requiring that Harvard
Pilgrim submit monthly business plans and financial statements. The
HMO will remain under administrative supervision.
</P>
<P>
   But Leslie said regulators do not want to make public business
documents that other HMOs keep secret, which would put Harvard
Pilgrim at a competitive disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
   He said Harvard Pilgrim is raising premiums _ as are most health
plans in Massachusetts _ but that decisions about selling assets
and leaving markets will require regulators' approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan is a success,'' he said. ``That's why there is no
one in this courtroom filing objections from the Massachusetts
Hospital Association'' or from the state's doctors' organization.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie said the health plan has paid the $300 million it owed
hospitals when the receivership began. He said it is paying current
hospital claims, too, though he acknowledged an ongoing dispute
about whether the plans pay claims fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators amended the rehabilitation proposal Thursday to say
Harvard Pilgrim's outstanding debts, for which the receiver must
approve payment, do not include routine claims from hospitals and
doctors.
</P>
<P>
   In several days, regulators will file with the court a
settlement agreement for the HMO to pay Rhode Island providers $10
million for outstanding claims. Objections must be filed within 10
days, which means that Spina cannot make a ruling for at least two
weeks.

BAY STATE WORKPLACE FATALITIES DOUBLE IN 1999 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE E. LEWIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The number of Massachusetts workers who died on the job
more than doubled last year to 91, from 41 in 1998, the biggest
increase in fatalities since the state started collecting such data
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In its report, ``Dying for Work in Massachusetts: The Loss of
Life and Limb,'' the Massachusetts AFL-CIO attributed the increase
in deaths to poor safety measures and inadequate training. It also
pointed to low fines for offending companies and repeat offenses
that send the message that state and federal agencies are falling
down on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``One death is too many, but 91 is inconceivable,'' Robert
Haynes, president of the 400,000-member union federation, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, an additional 1,000 employees died from
occupational diseases such as cancer, lung disease, or renal
disease. Another 50,000 employees suffered injuries including
amputations, contusions, burns, repetitive stress syndrome, and
electric shock.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such injuries, fines assessed by the US Occupational
Safety and Health Administration, a unit of the Labor Department,
were reduced in 10 of 16 settled cases to $10,000 or less. In four
of those cases, companies were fined less than $5,000. Overall, the
average fine paid by employers for workplace safety violations last
year was $17,883, down from $19,316 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Lessin, health and safety coordinator for the
Massachusetts AFL-CIO, attributed the increase in fatalities to
accidents involving several workers, as well as an increase in
forced overtime, downsizing, and work-rule changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Work is being restructured in ways that hurt workers,'' she
said. ``Mandatory overtime, not having enough people at the job
site, reorganizing work duties without the proper safety training
are all factors that contributed to workplace injuries and
deaths.''
</P>
<P>
   The data, gleaned from federal and state records, showed that
several companies had been fined or cited repeatedly for safety
violations. One firm, Revoli Construction Co. of North Reading, has
been cited for 56 violations over the last 13 years. At least 30 of
the citations involved failure to ensure the safety of construction
workers in trenches.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1998 two workers were buried in dirt and debris
up to their waists when a trench caved in at a Revoli work site. A
fine of $218,000 was recommended by local OSHA officials.
</P>
<P>
   In January, OSHA proposed an $81,000 fine against the firm after
an inspection revealed construction workers were working in an
unprotected 7-foot trench.
</P>
<P>
   Shawqui Alsarabi, president of Revoli Construction, said the
company was inspected recently by the agency and, aside from a
minor problem, ``was found to be taking precautions regarding our
safety program.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall that we had 56 violations,'' Alsarabi said.
``We have run into situations where there has been employee
misconduct.''
</P>
<P>
   OSHA is responsible for inspecting and monitoring safety
measures at private companies across the country. In Massachusetts,
166,986 workplaces come under the purview of 45 inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is similar in other states. Last year, the agency
employed 2,145 inspectors around the country to monitor seven
million workplaces. At its current staffing levels, it would take
the agency 107 years to inspect each workplace under its
jurisdiction only once, according to a report released this week by
the AFL-CIO's parent in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend, however, that the agency could expand its reach
by increasing fines or referring more cases to the US attorney's
office for criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   John Chavez, a spokesman for the Labor Department's regional
office in Boston, said OSHA sometimes refers cases for prosecution,
but there is no guarantee they will be accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Francis X. Flaherty, chief of the Fair Labor and Business
Practices Division of the attorney general's office, noted that in
most cases jurisdiction for workplace safety violations in the
private sector lies with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   When fatalities occur, however, the state attorney general could
determine in an egregious case that an employer's conduct led to
criminal recklessness and, as a result, manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that is an extremely high standard to reach,'' said
Flaherty. ``Most cases just don't rise to that level.''

&HT;     HEALTH OFFICIAL AGREES TO SENSITIVITY TRAINING AFTER ETHNIC
REMARKS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (EDS: Stands for BUSH-APPOINTEE)  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Health Commissioner William R. ``Reyn''
Archer III, under fire even after apologizing for remarks about
minorities and teen pregnancy, has agreed to top-to-bottom
sensitivity training at his agency, Hispanic lawmakers said after
meeting with him Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Archer, who said he believes he still can work productively with
minority leaders, also agreed to report on the number of Hispanics
and African-Americans in top positions at the Health Department and
to work on budget priorities of importance to minority lawmakers,
according to two who people attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he came away from this meeting knowing that he has no
rope left. He has to deliver to the state,'' said Rep. Robert
Puente, a San Antonio Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   While a number of minority groups and some other leaders have
called for Archer to resign, Puente said, ``Resignation for me is
not really an issue any more. It's just, `Do a good job.'''
</P>
<P>
   As he left the meeting, Archer said he has no intention of
resigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were very willing to listen to what I had to say,
and I think they were very generous as people, and I look forward
to working with them,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are issues that we have very much in common that we want
to see happen in Texas,'' Archer said.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's troubles have spilled over into the campaign of Gov.
George W. Bush, the presumed Republican presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   While Archer wasn't appointed by Bush, the governor approved his
selection by the Board of Health. Some have urged Bush to call for
Archer's resignation; Bush has declined to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Among comments drawing criticism, Archer was quoted in a New
York Times story as saying Texas' high teen-age pregnancy rate is
due to Hispanics lacking ``the belief in your culture that getting
pregnant is a bad thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were to go to a Hispanic community and say, `Well, we
need to get you into family planning,' they say, `No, I want to be
pregnant,''' he said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   Archer also was criticized for being described in the same story
as saying he doubted that insurance coverage made much real
difference to health.
</P>
<P>
   The furor intensified after a recent Houston Chronicle story
saying Archer made similar comments about African-Americans two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The story quoted Archer as saying ``we need to figure out why it
is when blacks were more segregated and had less opportunity that
they did better on cultural measures than they do in that sense
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The story said Archer also commented that black people ``don't
buy'' such cultural and legal institutions as marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made errors in my statements, and I'm sorry I made those
errors. But my intention is to create a state which can be an
inclusive state for everybody,'' Archer said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Puente and Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Democrat from Laredo, said the
lawmakers didn't direct Archer to use a particular entity or group
to conduct the sensitivity training. Some agencies do such programs
in-house, Cuellar said.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawmakers said it was important that Archer himself
attend the program, not just those who work under him.
</P>
<P>
   One issue Archer has committed to work on is reducing the rate
of teen-age pregnancy, Cuellar said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Cuellar and Puente, the meeting was attended by Reps.
John Longoria and Ruth Jones McClendon, both Democrats from San
Antonio; Pete Gallego, a Democrat from Alpine; and Glen Maxey, a
Democrat from Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Bledsoe, state president of the NAACP, also attended, as
did aides to other lawmakers who belong to the Mexican-American
caucus in the state House.
</P>
<P>
   Cuellar said the lawmakers offered Archer a piece of advice:
Keep away from theory and ``just stick to the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers were hurt by Archer's comments, and they intend to
hold him to his commitments, Gallego said. But there also was some
sympathy for a fellow public official making ill-advised,
much-reported comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some anguish in the room today, but do we want him
to quit? I think everybody in public life at one point or another
says something really stupid, and something they regret,'' Gallego
said. ``And I'm lucky that I haven't had those mistakes brought out
on the front page of every newspaper in this state every day for a
week.''

SERIES BRINGS EXPOSURE FOR DIRT RACERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEN HAYWARD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Mark Martin had an observation for Billy
Moyer when the two saw each other last week at a restaurant in
Batesville, Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows our sport, and he said he can't believe the kind of
money there is in dirt racing,'' Moyer said.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, like many NASCAR Winston Cup drivers, is also a race
fan. But the stars of Dirt Late Model racing, such as Moyer, are
relatively unknown to casual motorsports fans.
</P>
<P>
   The Hav-A-Tampa Dirt Late Model Series is picking up some speed
in its chase for exposure with its debut at the Texas Motor
Speedway Dirt Track tonight and tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer and others have been successful for more than 20 years in
a sport mainly popular at small dirt bullrings in the Southeast and
the Midwest. They have made money in their sport, but they also
have been racing outside of the motorsports mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys were so geared to the outlaw way of racing,'' said
Mike Swims, president of the United Dirt Track Racing Association,
the sanctioning body for the Hav-A-Tampa series. ``That outlaw
image is very attractive to the fans where it is rough and on the
ragged edge of all-out racing. But it is not conducive to the
growth of our sport.''
</P>
<P>
   There are close to 5,000 Dirt Late Models in the United States,
but Dirt Late Model racing did not have a national series for the
best drivers to compete for the most money until Hav-A-Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Promoters believed if they paid enough money they would get
enough cars and enough stars to attract fans without a sanctioning
body. Big money shows often were scheduled on top of each other,
and it was not uncommon for each show to have more than 100
entrants, but they split up the best drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has never really been an organization pushing to get
successful stars and a traveling show,'' Ohio resident Donnie Moran
said. ``I have done Dirt Late Model racing for so long I want to
see it get some recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hav-A-Tampa series has been compared to the Pennzoil World
of Outlaws, a sprint-car dirt series that started in 1978. The
Hav-A-Tampa series debuted in 1990, and it took a while to convince
independent-minded Late Model drivers that following a series was
the best way to make a living. The efforts have paid off for the
drivers and the series.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer, who is 15th in the Hav-A-Tampa points standings, has
earned $14,000 in 10 races this year. Rick Eckert, the points
leader, has made $43,000 this season with four victories.
</P>
<P>
   Speedway Motorsports, Inc. is helping to make sure those top
drivers stay on the series. Three SMI tracks will be the host to
four events this season. Along with this weekend's event at the TMS
Dirt Track, the series will run two races at the Lowe's Motor
Speedway dirt track and at Bristol Motor Speedway. An event is also
scheduled at Houston Raceway Park in Baytown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tickled to see that people as high up as \RSMI chairman\S
Bruton \RSmith\S are getting into our kind of racing,'' Moyer said.
``It's important for our sport. Hav-A-Tampa is getting our purses
better and better each year. But we've got to get us some TV
time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hav-A-Tampa television schedule with the Speedvision cable
network has been expanded, but races are still broadcast on a
tape-delay basis several weeks after a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like the right people have not got a hold of the
sport,'' said Wendall Wallace, of Batesville, Ark., who finished
second in last year's Hav-A-Tampa points standings. ``Hav-A-Tampa
brought themselves up above everybody else, and it is the toughest
series out there. The best Late Model drivers are on that
circuit.''

   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ It sounds like one of those questions
that has an obvious answer. ``What makes a good barn?''
</P>
<P>
   Good horses, right?
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not a trainer has fast horses in his barn, there are
other things he's hoping for when a trainer comes for the racing
season at Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vicinity to the racing surface,'' trainer Bob Young said.
``How cool are the barns, because some barns can get as hot as an
oven during the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   There are 29 barns at Lone Star, and they're located on the
northeast side of the property beyond the seven-furlong chute of
the racing surface.
</P>
<P>
   Young, a native of San Antonio, is stabled in Barn 16. As for
his concerns about vicinity to the racing surface, Young is about
in the middle of the barn area.
</P>
<P>
   The racing stables that enter the most horses or win the most
races tend to get closer to the racetrack. When trainer D. Wayne
Lukas moves his horses to Churchill Downs or Belmont Park, he's in
one of the closest barns to the track.
</P>
<P>
   At Lone Star Park, trainers Ronnie Werner and Gerald Romero are
stabled in barns adjacent to the track. Werner trains horses owned
by Tom Durant, a prominent car dealer from Grapevine who set a Lone
Star Park single-season record last year when he raced 80 horses.
Romero trains for Corsicana-based horse owners Leland and Sue Cook,
and they were the leading owners in races won last year.
</P>
<P>
   Leading trainer Steve Asmussen, however, takes a barn five spots
back.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever it's located, the barn serves as a locker room for each
trainer's stable, or team of horses. It's where the horses are fed,
bathed, groomed and given medical treatment. The horses live there
until the racing season is done.
</P>
<P>
   The trainer also keeps an office in his barn. Sometimes he makes
arrangements to rotate horses from an off-site training facility or
from other tracks. For example, Asmussen's family has a training
center located near Laredo. He also keeps horses at Churchill Downs
during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   With the amount of activity, and because the floors are dirt the
barn area can get quite filthy. Young said he makes an extra effort
to keep his place clean. The floors are raked, and tools are put
away after training hours. Some trainers, Young included, even
plant flowers outside the barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not have good stock,'' Young said, ``but it doesn't
have to look like it. Keeping the barn clean is very important. I
think it depicts how you treat your stock.''

300 SAVES IMPRESSIVE, BUT NOT A TICKET TO THE HALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Cal Ripken achieved a major career milestone
a couple of weeks ago when he became the 23rd player since 1900 to
collect his 3,000th major-league hit. If his incredible consecutive
games streak wasn't enough, the liner up the middle all but
guaranteed the Baltimore Orioles' legend admission in the Hall of
Fame.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland is on the verge of achieving a career milestone
of his own. The Rangers' reliever needs two saves to become the
12th player in major-league history with 300.
</P>
<P>
   It appears that Wetteland, though, will only get into the Hall
of Fame if he buys a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball people agree that a quality closer, someone who
consistently can come in and preserve a slim lead in the ninth
inning, is an important ingredient for a successful team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about a save is they're all tough outings,'' Rangers
general manager Doug Melvin said. ``There are not many cheap
saves.''
</P>
<P>
   But while closing is an important piece of the modern game, it's
too modern to determine the closers' place in history. Saves didn't
become an official statistic until 1969, and the evolution of the
one-inning, only-with-a-lead reliever has occurred only in the past
20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, it's too soon to say if 300 saves should be viewed
in the same light as 3,000 hits, 300 victories or 500 home runs,
the traditional statistical benchmarks for Hall of Fame inductions.
</P>
<P>
   The man who should become the next closer to reach 300 doesn't
think so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that 300 is not going to be a benchmark,'' Wetteland
said. ``I'm talking in 20 years from now or so. There are guys now
with just incredible stuff, and guys are taking care of themselves
much better than before. I think in the future you're going to find
closers that get to 300 in no time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame voters apparently agree.
</P>
<P>
   Hoyt Wilhelm and Rollie Fingers, who pre-date the
one-inning-closer era, are the only pitchers in baseball's shrine
who pitched the majority of their games in relief.
</P>
<P>
   Fingers is sixth on the career list of saves with 341. Wilhelm
pitched just four of his 21 seasons after the advent of the save
rule, but researchers going over records from past games have found
save totals for every reliever. He's credited with 227.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the players ahead of Fingers on the career list _ John
Franco, who's second with 416 and Randy Myers, who's fifth with 347
_ are active. Two more _ Lee Smith, the leader with 478, and Dennis
Eckersley, who's third with 390 _ haven't been retired long enough
to be eligible for the Hall.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth, Jeff Reardon, was on the ballot for the first time
last year. He won't be next year. Despite being fourth with 367
saves, he received only 24 votes, less than the required 5 percent
to remain on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Sutter and Rich ``Goose'' Gossage, two other relievers
considered among the best ever, did receive significant numbers of
votes. But Sutter with 192 and Gossage with 166 were well short of
the 375 needed to be inducted.
</P>
<P>
   That only 11 people have achieved the 300-save milestone hasn't
swayed the voters. Then again it doesn't impress Wetteland, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's out of a very shallow pool,'' Wetteland said. ``You talk
about people who have hit 400 homers, like Raffy \RRafael
Palmeiro\S is going to, and that's out of thousands of people over
the years.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not 300 saves is worthy of enshrinement in the Hall
of Fame, it's still considered a remarkable achievement by those
who know the mixture of physical and mental ability it takes to be
a big-league closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say you've only got to get three outs, but they're
pressure-packed outs every time out there,'' said Derek Lowe, who
is in his first season as the Boston Red Sox closer. ``Three
hundred is a milestone that a lot of closers want to get to. For me
to think about a number like that, I've got to do this for 10 years
or something like that. That's doing a very good job for a very
long time. You've got to tip your hat to guys like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland said the current group of talented young closers will
push the benchmark well beyond 300.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the likes of Ugueth Urbina, Matt Mantei, Billy
Wagner, Armando Benitez, Billy Koch, John Rocker and Lowe, who are
all under age 28, have the ability. But the past is littered with
closers with talent who weren't able to do it year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wohlers saved 72 games for the Braves in 1997-98, but
suddenly couldn't throw a strike.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Rojas replaced Wetteland as the Montreal Expos' closer in
1995, and saved 66 games in two seasons. But he couldn't handle the
mental demands of the role, and lost his job. This week, he signed
a minor-league contract with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only his physical ability, the closer has a mental
strength to his game, too,'' Melvin said. ``If they blow it,
they've got to be able to handle it. Can they come back? Do they
walk out of the bullpen the next time and charge to the mound
because they want the ball again? There's no safety net for the
closer. Some guys can't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes 300 saves a major achievement, even if it doesn't
punch a ticket to the Hall of Fame.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Go right ahead, puckheads. Rejoice.
</P>
<P>
   Continue to celebrate the Stars' good fortune. It's ``only'' San
Jose, heh, heh, heh. And don't try to hide your grin over how that
other Western Conference rumble is also an added blessing from the
hockey gods.
</P>
<P>
   Teeth and snot will be flying in a renewal of the Red
Wings-Avalanche hate-fest, which means the survivor will be
physically and mentally exhausted for the final-four round of the
Stanley Cup marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it's only San Jose, thanks to Dr. Henry J. Heimlich
being unable to make a house call in St. Louis. Those choking Blues
gifted the Stars with excellent postseason field position after six
months of local fretting that Roman Turek had been the gift Bob
Gainey would forever regret. See what happens when we doubt Gainey?
</P>
<P>
   But as local glee runneth over, it might be best to pause for
one quick second to consider this echo:
</P>
<P>
   It's ``only'' the Stars. That's exactly what San Jose is
thinking. The glee is mutual. Come riding high out of St. Louis
after finalizing the first-round shocker against the top-seeded
Blues, and the Sharks had to conceal a few chuckles of their own
that Dallas was the next destination.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was only two weeks ago when the Sharks were all
mouth and teeth about wanting this exact matchup, except in the
first round. Only an el foldo by San Jose in the regular-season
finale prevented that, but things do have a way of working out.
</P>
<P>
   And while the local thought process is suddenly centered on,
``it's only San Jose,'' this is a complete reversal from two weeks
ago. A chorus of concern was heard then about having to open the
playoffs against a Sharks club that had spanked Dallas butts in
four of six regular-season games. Speaking of a blessing, that's
what stumbling into Edmonton in the first round was supposed to be.
As it turned out, it was a blessing.
</P>
<P>
   But San Jose easy? Starting with Game 1 tonight at Reunion
Arena, there will be nothing easy. Of the four series remaining in
the NHL, this one will lead the league in three categories: (1)
Nasty. (2) Nasty. (3) Nasty. And you can also throw in ugly. As
high-profile as Red Wings-Avalanche will be, and should be, that
series is patty-cake compared to this one.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose stands alone as the cheap-shot kings of the NHL, led,
of course, by the pig of pigs, bryan marchment, a lower-case evil.
marchment is a small man in a large body who has a strange fetish
for other guy's knees.
</P>
<P>
   Having said all that, you can take the above paragraph,
substitute ``Stars'' for ``San Jose,'' and ``Derian Hatcher'' for
``bryan marchment'' and that's exactly the way the Sharks feel
about you-know-who. Except our man Derian rearranges jaws instead
of knees.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, the Sharks didn't skate their way to a first-round
shocker. They put the kill, not the skill, on St. Louis,
intimidating the Blues' forwards with muscle and mayhem. When the
Blues got around to responding, it was usually at the wrong time.
St. Louis was repeatedly suckered into bad penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, since it worked so well, you can imagine the feeding
frenzy San Jose will display tonight. Except...
</P>
<P>
   Rosterwise, the Stars are better-suited for this style of
confrontation than at any time since becoming a Stanley Cup threat.
Plus, there couldn't have been a better first-round opponent than
the testy Oilers in preparing for what awaits.
</P>
<P>
   Back to general manager Gainey, who has jumped off the hook on
the Turek trade, and now appears to have been one jump ahead with
his retooling of the team since October.
</P>
<P>
   Remember ``younger, faster, cheaper?'' Back in October, that was
Gainey's answer to Stanley Cup glory. That was how the Stars had
been restructured. But as the season opened, and Gainey watched a
listless effort night after night, he suddenly ditched the new
blueprint. New veterans started to show up, along with rookie
Brenden Morrow. And so did muscle and meanness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Younger, faster, cheaper'' became ``older, tougher,'' and for
the most part, ``more expensive.'' For example, consider this swap
of roster bodies: Scott Thornton for Juha Lind, Brenden Morrow for
Pavel Patera and Dave Manson for Kevin Dean. Those three changes
alone were made months ago for the sole purpose of handling
down-and-dirty San Jose in the second round of the playoffs. OK, so
that's a lie. There was no such plan. But it did work out that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are indeed fortunate,'' said forward Mike Keane, ``to have
an owner \RTom Hicks\S who allows his hockey people to add players,
regardless of cost. But that's only half of it. Adding people won't
work if the fit isn't there, teamwise, and if the chemistry isn't
right. New York \Rthe Rangers\S is a prime example of that. But the
changes made here, they have worked in all areas. The fit was
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   And certainly perfect for the hockey-in-combat-boots that starts
tonight.

BRITAIN TIES MONEY FOR ZIMBABWE TO THE END OF LAND SEIZURES
</HEADLINE>
  By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Eight hours of tense negotiations on Zimbabwe's
deepening political crisis ended in impasse Thursday night after
Britain refused to provide extra money for land resettlement until
government-backed squatters end their occupation of hundreds of
white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's foreign secretary, Robin Cook, said he delivered the
message in talks with a delegation of three Zimbabwean ministers
and made clear that Britain would ``refuse to take any further
steps until the next step is taken, and that is for the occupations
to come to an end.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is now in their court,'' he said of the Zimbabwean
negotiators, led by John Nkomo, the minister of local government.
</P>
<P>
   The Zimbabwean negotiators offered no immediate public comment
on the farm occupations that have heralded a wave of political
violence against adversaries of President Robert Mugabe in advance
of elections scheduled for next month.
</P>
<P>
   Violence associated with the farm occupations and a campaign of
political intimidation by Mugabe's supporters have claimed 14 lives
in the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis has spilled into and beyond Zimbabwe's already
battered economy, with tobacco farmers, who earn one-third of
Zimbabwe's foreign exchange, withholding crops from the annual
auctions while neighboring countries like Botswana and South Africa
say they are becoming increasingly concerned about the impact on
the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   The South African currency, the rand, fell Thursday to its
lowest-ever level against the dollar and some experts blamed the
crisis in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   British officials said the Zimbabwean negotiators Thursday
wanted Britain to release some $56 million for land resettlement
without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
   As the former colonial power, Britain acknowledges a moral
obligation to help finance land redistribution in a country where
some 4,500 white farmers own the bulk of the fertile land while
hundreds of thousands of black peasants farm meager plots. Cook
said Britain was prepared to help pay for land reform and seek
further international aid for Zimbabwe. But, he said, ``I made it
clear we could not take any of these steps against a background of
occupations and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   The farm occupations have been led by Chenjerai Hunzvi, head of
an organization representing veterans of Zimbabwe's seven-year
guerrilla war against white minority rule. ``Our stance on land has
not changed,'' he said Thursday in Harare, Zimbabwe's capital.
``When we are ready to move we will let you know.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Cook said in London that he had a ``clear
impression'' that the government negotiators in Thursday's talks
wanted to see an end to the farm occupations.
</P>
<P>
   Nkomo, the leader of the Zimbabwean team, sought to avoid the
impression that the negotiations had broken down altogether. ``We
have broken the ice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a colonial past dating to 1890, when white settlers
first pushed north of the Limpopo River from South Africa to seize
land in what became Rhodesia, Britain has a tense and ambiguous
relationship with Mugabe's government.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his 20 unbroken years in office, during which he has
been frequently accused of handing over expropriated white-owned
land to cronies rather than to poor peasants, Mugabe both holds
Britain responsible for his country's land problems and resents
British interference in Zimbabwe's affairs.

`COMMITTED': LACKING THE COURAGE OF ITS CONVICTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the minds of the editors of Esquire, who recently put her on
the cover of their magazine clad only in a pink towel and a quart
of eyeliner, Heather Graham is somebody the average American male
would do anything to get close to. In ``Committed,'' Miramax's
latest smiley, air-headed romantic comedy, Luke Wilson plays an
average American male who can't get far enough away. Not from the
lovely Graham herself, of course, but from Joline, the disturbingly
thin, strawberry-blond avatar of perkiness and pluck she portrays.
</P>
<P>
   And well he might. After fewer than 600 days of marriage to
Joline, all of which take place off-screen, Wilson's Carl decamps
for parts unknown, leaving a terse, vague note on the counter of
their New York loft. His stated reason for leaving is a
professional crisis. He's an aspiring photojournalist who has been
relegated to taking photographs of cheesecake: the high-cholesterol
dessert kind, not the towel-draped starlet kind. But it seems more
likely that Joline's monomaniacal devotion to her own goodness, in
particular her endlessly reiterated belief in the sanctity of her
marriage vows, drove him out into the desert in search of a little
peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Which, as it happens, he neither deserves nor gets. He doesn't
deserve such a loyal wife, either, which is clear long before he
opens his mouth, two-thirds of the way through the movie.
Indomitable and literal-minded, she tracks him to El Paso, Texas,
in a rented car, which she parks outside his blue trailerlike home.
Oddly enough, he never notices, but his neighbor (Goran Visnjic), a
suave sculptor with continental manners and a sexy European accent,
is quickly smitten with her. Since this is a romantic comedy, you
know, more or less, where it's all heading.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Committed'' reaches its generic destination by a
circuitous, unusual route, in which intriguing possibilities are
glimpsed like scenery through a car window. There is, for example,
an inkling of real satire in the film's premise, which is that in
today's casual sexual landscape marital fidelity is an inexplicable
anomaly. Joline's brother Jay (Casey Affleck), for instance,
happily lives in curious menage with a lesbian couple, one of whom
is also divorced. And Carl, once in El Paso, takes up with a
waitress named Carmen (Patricia Velasquez), who denies that the
jealous truck driver stalking her is her ex-boyfriend because she
slept with him only seven or eight times.
</P>
<P>
   Affleck and Graham have an interesting, almost inappropriate
brother-sister chemistry (another interesting possibility the film
raises but declines to pursue), but they spend most of the movie
sitting around waiting for instructions. Lisa Kreuger, who wrote
and directed, relies heavily on voice-over narration and on comic
situations that take forever to establish and then never really pay
off. She and her cast seem uncertain about what the tone of the
exercise should be, and the result lacks both the heat of romantic
longing and the spark of comic invention.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, ``Committed'' lacks the courage of its convictions.
Intending to affirm the values of permanence and
stick-to-itiveness, it instead presents a world without emotional
consequences, in which relationships are frictionless, frivolous
and easily discarded. The point is not that a sense of human
complexity and risk would have made this movie more serious, but
that without the feeling that something is at stake, it fails to be
funny. Without the danger of real tears, there's no real laughter.
Comedy, like marriage, takes more work than this.

huge as his 1980s NBC series, ``Cosby'' was just-good-enough TV.
</P>
<P>
   For the finale tonight, Erica and Darien are worried about their
marriage, so ol' Hilton (the Cos) offers them his wisdom on how to
keep love alive in a marriage. Sounds like time to settle in for
some serious ruminating.

   &QR;  ``Nelson Rockefeller: Passionate Millionaire'' (8 p.m. on A&AMP;E)

``Did this ruthless redhead sexually manipulate an underage boy
into killing her husband? We'll tell you at 11.''

<P>
   &QR;  ``Arabian Nights'' (9 p.m. on ABC, concluding 9 p.m. Monday) _
Another fantasy and special-effects extravaganza from Robert Halmi,
who will soon have filmed everything ever written. Sometimes this
stuff just falls apart (``Noah's Ark''), but sometimes it dazzles,
and ``Nights'' has enough sparkle to warrant a look.
</P>
<P>
   In some vaguely long-ago Middle East (the original ``1,001
Nights'' stories date from the 10th century), beautiful
Scheherazade (Mili Avital) tells a never-ending series of stories
to her semicrazed new husband (Dougray Scott), a sultan who has
vowed to kill her. To keep him interested in her, she spins the
tales of Ali Baba (Rufus Sewell), Aladdin (Jason Scott Lee, with
John Leguizamo as the Genie) and others. There's belly dancing,
flying carpets, slapstick, magic, spitting camels and lots of cool
effects. The frame story and the stories themselves are smartly
interwoven.
</P>
<P>
   Although these fables have been retold for children in other
forms (Disney's ``Aladdin,'' for example), this version is
moderately sexy and occasionally violent. It has a touch of magic,
but it's a mature magic.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   Best Bet
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The X-Files'' (9 p.m. Sunday on Fox)
</P>
<P>
   David Duchovny wrote and directed this house-of-mirrors episode
that's aimed at fans who like inside jokes. In a
movie-within-a-TV-show feature film, Garry Shandling plays Mulder
and Tea Leoni plays Scully. The cognoscenti know that Leoni is
married to Duchovny in real life, and Duchovny did a couple of
memorable guest shots as himself on Shandling's ``Larry Sanders
Show.''
</P>
<P>
   In the movie, Mulder/Shandling and Scully/Leoni end up making
out (in a coffin), prompting Scully to utter the line, ``Is that a
flashlight in your pocket, Mulder, or are you just ... ?'' There's
also a little homage to old Doris Day/Rock Hudson movies, with a
split-screened Mulder and Scully (the ``real'' Mulder and Scully _
this gets a bit goofy) talking on the phone from respective bubble
baths.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there's the case they're trying to solve in the middle
of all this, a whimsical little muddle involving Jesus, ``Plan 9
From Outer Space,''
</P>
<P>
   ``I Am the Walrus'' and dancing zombies. Or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   Worst Bet
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The '70s'' (9 p.m. Sunday on NBC, concluding 9 p.m. Monday)
</P>
<P>
   That much-maligned decade is now a deserves-to-be-maligned
two-part movie that's as shallow as a smiley-face button and as
obvious as Richard Nixon's guilt (when they do the montage of
feminism news clips, for example, they play ``I Am Woman'').
</P>
<P>
   Four friends survive the National Guard at Kent State in 1970,
then go their separate, desperately cliched ways. Byron (Brad Pitt
look-alike Brad Rowe) is an obnoxous twit who works for Nixon and
gets caught up in Watergate. His sister Christie (Amy Smart, who's
Ruby on ``Felicity'') is a talentless blonde who becomes a fashion
model, then moves to California to mess with drugs, self-awareness
and a cult. Eileen (Vinessa Shaw, ``Eyes Wide Shut'') is a good
girl who works as a secretary and ends up suing her boss for sexual
discrimination. And Dexter (Guy Torry) gets caught up in Black
Power, then black entrepreneurship. There's more real truth in one
episode of Fox's ``That '70s Show.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The '70s'' frantically tries to cram in everything _
streakers, pet rocks, Jimmy Carter, feminism, jogging, Mary Tyler
Moore, blaxploitation films, cocaine, and on and on _ so that
nothing is developed. And it can't even get its time line right:
``I'm OK, You're OK'' is called a ``new book'' in 1976, about seven
years too late.
</P>
<P>
   Not to give away the ending, but Ronald Reagan gets elected and
the '70s end. And none too soon, in this telling.
</P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cool, unsettled weather will linger from the northern
Mississippi Valley to the Atlantic coast as a series of jet-stream
disturbances moves overhead. The strongest disturbance will be
surrounded by showers and some strong thunderstorms from the
eastern Tennessee Valley to the Southeast coast. Some storms,
particularly from northern Florida to the eastern Carolinas, will
have strong winds and large hail. The southern Middle Atlantic
states will have periods of rain.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast will have some sunshine, but cold air aloft will
promote thickening clouds and scattered showers by afternoon,
especially over the hilly terrain. Thundershowers will occur near a
weak front in the western Great Lakes. A few potent thunderstorms
will form in West Texas and along the eastern slopes of the
southern Rockies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: SHUTTLE SCRUB
</P>
<P>
   After two delays caused by wind in Florida, Wednesday's
scrubbing of the shuttle launching came from rain and wind at three
emergency landing cites in Spain and Morocco. These cites are south
of the typical path of most transient inclement systems that
frequent the middle latitudes. But a ``high amplitude'' upper-wind
pattern, which has extreme poleward swings of warm air and dramatic
equatorward bulges of cold air, has dominated North America and the
Atlantic. On Wednesday, an inclement cold pool aloft bulged far
south from Europe, forcing cancellation of the shuttle launching.

SENATE AGAIN REJECTS MOVE TO FORCE VOTE ON MARRIAGE TAX PROPOSAL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate turned back another attempt Thursday to
force a vote on a marriage tax penalty relief bill, but Texas Sen.
Kay Bailey Hutchison and other sponsors of the measure vowed to
bring it up again.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-44 vote marked the second time in two weeks that
Hutchison and other Republicans had failed to muster the 60 votes
needed to bring the legislation up for final consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would provide $248 billion in tax cuts for
married couples and other taxpayers, is opposed by a solid block of
Democrats. They favor a smaller $150 billion measure that would
eliminate tax code provisions penalizing married couples but would
not provide breaks for other taxpayers who would benefit under the
GOP plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that the Senate has been blocked from voting
for marriage penalty tax relief,'' Hutchison said, criticizing the
Democratic filibuster against her bill. ``This is really a needed
tax correction more than a tax cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison said her bill is aimed at correcting the provision in
the tax code that gives single taxpayers a $4,400 standard
deduction, but provides only a $7,350 deduction for couples filing
jointly. Her bill would raise the deduction for married couples
filing jointly to $8,800, providing them with the same deduction
they would get if they filed separately.
</P>
<P>
   Her bill would affect an estimated 21 million Americans. But
Democrats claim that their measure, though smaller in scope, would
provide relief for more married taxpayers because it would
eliminate dozens of other provisions _ in addition to increasing
the standard deduction _ that force couples to pay.

 &HT;    New Web memorial lets widows share pain
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was 8:10 a.m. on a warm spring day when an Army captain
knocked softly on her front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came in and told me my husband had been killed in action,''
Atlantan Mattie Brown remembers. ``It seemed so unreal. I just
couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 31 years ago, during the height of the Vietnam War.
Brown, 54, still sees her late husband, Sgt. Preston Tribble Jr.,
in her dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's young,'' Brown says. ``Forever 22.''
</P>
<P>
   War widows, she says, have flashbacks, too, just like combat
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times,'' Brown says, ``when I think I see him, in
our son and daughter, and in other young people.''
</P>
<P>
   For Lucy Freeland, 59, of Fayetteville, the same thing happens
every time she sees a mailman. A glimpse of tall trees with high,
thick branches still evokes painful 55-year-old memories for Mary
Alice Giles, 84, of Avondale Estates.
</P>
<P>
   All three suffer the trauma of having lost a spouse to war. And
all three have posted remembrances of their dead husbands on a new
Web site, warwidows.org, the Widows of War Living Memorial, which
is being launched today to mark this weekend's 25th anniversary of
the end of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Call it group therapy for the high-tech age, the latest of many
Web sites that tap into people's need, amid a sometimes isolating
culture, to speak to someone about deep personal feelings. Like
sites inviting comment on, say, the death of Princess Diana or
memories of Vietnam, it's about as close as the Web comes to being
a virtual community.
</P>
<P>
   The new site's purpose is to provide women made widows in any
war a way to share their feelings. Already, remembrances also have
come in from women whose husbands died in Kosovo, Rwanda and
Afghanistan. And even one from a Vietnamese widow whose husband was
killed by American bombs.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site was the brainchild of Barbara Sonneborn, 56, of San
Francisco, an artist and filmmaker whose first husband, Jeffery
Gurvitz, was killed in action in Vietnam in 1968. She finally dealt
with her lingering grief by producing an Oscar-nominated
documentary called ``Regret to Inform,'' which aired on public
television this year. Both the Web site and documentary have been
funded by San Francisco-based Sun Fountain Productions, a nonprofit
group founded in 1998 to help women fight against war, racism and
violence.
</P>
<P>
   She compares the new site to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say that one of the most powerful impressions they have
of the wall is imagining the stories behind each of the names
etched in granite,'' says Sonneborn. ``Now, the Widows of War
Living Memorial actually lets you read these stories. As visitors
wander through the site and read the stories, they will understand
war on a personal level.''
</P>
<P>
   If the wall is any indication, the War Widows site will be
heavily visited. A cyber version of the wall, thevirtualwall.org,
was launched in November 1998, and it has posted more than 15,000
remembrances, says Jan Scruggs, the Vietnam veteran who led the
efforts to build the wall and to put the virtual wall on the Web.
The site averages 600,000 hits a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything like this that helps people record their feelings and
keeps the issue alive is good,'' Scruggs says of the war widow
site. ``It doesn't end with a body, flag and casket,'' he says.
``The pain just continues. It's a valuable lesson, and that's
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeland agrees. Her husband, Green Beret Capt. William W.
Walker, was killed in Vietnam in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you find the love of your life, and then they go
away,'' says Freeland, who, like Brown, has remarried. ``I had just
left him in Hawaii while he was on R&AMP;R. He died two weeks later. He
only had 30 days on his tour before he was coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   They wrote daily, but just before she received a ``regret to
inform'' telegram, she sensed something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part was seeing the postman pass my mailbox without
stopping,'' Freeland wrote in her remembrance. ``There had been
daily tapes and letters that passed between us and were the glue
that held us together.''
</P>
<P>
   At 84, Mary Alice Giles still sees her late husband, Harlan
Giles, in Atlanta's many trees. ``He'd always been so agile and
strong. He'd often climb to the tops of trees. I still think about
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles was mortally wounded in the Battle of the Bulge in 1945,
where a German bullet made him a paraplegic. He lived in pain until
1953.
</P>
<P>
   In her remembrance, she described their life after he came home.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband was a very brave person,'' she wrote. ``He was
always cheerful during his long illness. He never complained even
though he was in much pain at times. I loved and admired Harlan
very much. I cherish great memories of him.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Atlantan who has posted is Grace Umutesi, 43, whose
husband was killed in 1994 in the Rwandan civil war. She won't talk
about it to anyone but Sonneborn's folks, but told them she had a
message for other war widows: ``Be strong, teach your children to
grow in peace, forgive. We must be peacemakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonneborn says her Web site is ``a place for reconciliation,
healing, communication. You no longer have to hold in feelings that
are so powerful and strong.''
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, that's what war widows have been
expected to do throughout history, Sonneborn says.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has enormous potential for positive social change,'' says
Sonneborn. ``Now, even in corners of the world where women have no
power, via the Web they can communicate with other people.
</P>
<P>
   ``War has been an arena for men to speak out, not for women,''
she says. ``It was difficult to get funding at first for this
project because people didn't want to know what women thought about
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Until deciding in 1988 to start researching the Vietnam War,
Sonneborn says, ``I had met only one other woman in all those years
who was a war widow.''
</P>
<P>
   In producing her documentary, however, she learned that there
were many like her, and many who were suffering in isolation. With
Americans' distaste for the Vietnam War, she says, many widows were
not only cut off from others, but actually harassed. ``I talked to
women who had to leave their communities because they were told
their husbands were baby killers. Callers would tell some widows,
`he deserved to die.'''
</P>
<P>
   Men started veterans' organizations _ and there are many for the
Vietnam era _ but women ``had almost nowhere to go to deal with the
isolation. They were told, `You're young. You'll be fine.' But they
weren't, and a lot still aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Bourdage, 76, lost her husband Nelson Bourdage _ who'd
also fought in World War II and Korea _ in Vietnam of kidney
disease, which the Pentagon ruled was caused by Agent Orange, the
toxic defoliant widely sprayed over jungles by American forces to
clear the way for bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good thing,'' she says of the War Widows site. ``I
have heard so many say they didn't have any support. They wondered,
`What in the world am I going to do?'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt real good writing about Preston,'' Brown says. ``It
was almost like talking to him again. And I'm very grateful for
that.''

<P>
   HAVANA _ His classmates blow kisses into the camera and promise
hearty hugs when he returns. His relatives clown for the camera,
with one donning a wig to the delighted squeals of the clan. Two
cousins splash about in a swimming pool, show off karate moves _ in
slow motion as dreamy violins play _ and romp with three puppies in
an idyllic park that could be in, well, Miami.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not. It is Cuba, and it is the Elian home video, shot
in and around his hometown, Cardenas, and sent as a sort of letter
from home.
</P>
<P>
   The ostensible reason is to counteract any homesickness Elian
may feel as he and his father await court rulings to determine
whether the boy should remain in the United States, as is the wish
of the Miami relatives who had cared for the boy after his
shipwreck last November. He was forcibly removed from their home
last Saturday after they refused to turn him over to his father.
</P>
<P>
   But the indisputable message for Elian Gonzalez _ and perhaps
Cubans who saw excerpts of the 41-minute video Wednesday night and
Thursday morning _ is that, whatever impressions they may have of
Miami, life is good here, too.
</P>
<P>
   The video is part of the propaganda campaign President Fidel
Castro has waged almost since the inception of the case.
</P>
<P>
   Every night for over two hours, Cuba's two television stations,
which are state run, broadcast round-table discussions in which a
panel of six or seven people, often citing reports in the U.S.
media, dissect the latest turns in the case before a studio
audience that often includes Castro.
</P>
<P>
   One of the fixtures in the broadcasts has been Yasmani
Betancourt, Elian's 10-year-old cousin, who arrived in Washington
on Wednesday for a visit with Elian. Cuban television has broadcast
interviews with the boy, in which he talked about how much he
missed his cousin and playmate. Yasmani also was at center stage in
the video, doing the karate kicks, and speaking at a demonstration
before thousands of people last Saturday after Elian was returned
to his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demonstrations, the video, the round-table discussions all
are calculated to whip up patriotic fervor, with this boy at the
center of it all.'' a Western diplomat said of the fight over
Elian.
</P>
<P>
   To a large extent, the propaganda war is aimed at answering the
Cuban-American community in Miami, routinely referred to here as
the Miami mafia by party stalwarts. So Cuban media have taken
unusual steps, replaying interviews _ faithfully translated into
Spanish _ with Attorney General Janet Reno, the immigration
commissioner, Doris Meissner, and other officials, conducted by
CNN, NBC and CBS.
</P>
<P>
   To an unprecedented extent, Cuban television _ during the
discussions and newscasts _ has shown extensive images of Miami and
anti-Castro demonstrators, glimpses rarely seen here except by
those with the illegal satellite dishes or antennas jury-rigged to
pick up signals from Miami television stations 100 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   The images shown on Cuban television, however, seem intended
less to present the other side than to set up incendiary
commentary. The pictures are usually accompanied by analysis from
Cuban journalists ridiculing things like the weeping visage of
Marisleysis Gonzalez, Elian's cousin, who has fought for his
custody, and the ``total failure'' of demonstrators to shut down
the city on Tuesday in protest of Elian's seizure.
</P>
<P>
   Commentators on the round-table discussions have often repeated
a important criticism of Castro from the Cuban-American community,
that Elian will be brainwashed upon his return, though such remarks
have been quickly and arduously disputed by Cuban psychologists,
who often appear on the show.
</P>
<P>
   In the Cuban video, images of horses and buggies clattering by
stone bungalows on the streets of Cardenas are interspersed with
clips of neighbors and relatives in their homes wishing him a quick
return.
</P>
<P>
   After its broadcast, a beaming Cuban commentator pronounced it
``moving.''

 &HT;    Big Game fever hits Georgia with $105 million jackpot at stake
 &HT;    By Gita M. Smith
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Who wants to be a hundred-million-aire?
</P>
<P>
   The folks buying $12 million worth of Big Game tickets across
Georgia this week, that's who. Whether they are playing a variation
of the digits in Elian Gonzalez's birthday (6, 12, 93) or ``Quik
Pik'' numbers, all hope to be $105 million richer by 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   After a Thursday conference call to the other six states in the
powerball-style game, Georgia Lottery Corp. President Rebecca Paul
announced that the jackpot would rise from the $100 million mark,
with a chance of another bump up today if sales continue to soar.
</P>
<P>
   And soar they do. The record-high $197 million jackpot was won a
year ago this month and Georgians appear to hope April lightning
will strike again. The Big Game averages $2.7 million a week, but
this week's sales stand at $12 million, Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   As ticket outlets go, few in metro Atlanta can match the volume
sellers bordering Alabama and South Carolina, Paul said.
</P>
<P>
   But Salim Virani, manager of a Shell Service Station in Atlanta,
said his store's sales will ``jump after 6 p.m., with some
customers spending $100 to $200.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul says the odds of winning the Big Game are one in
76,275,360, but why dwell on the unimaginable?
</P>
<P>
   Instead, do as Scott Ryan did. Thursday, in what may be the
ultimate test of employee loyalty, the Atlanta-based Incanta.net
CEO sprang for 100 tickets as a treat for his 37 employees.

BEIJING JAILS MUSLIM WOMAN FOR SENDING NEWSPAPERS ABROAD
</HEADLINE>
  By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ A Muslim businesswoman was dealt an eight-year prison
sentence last month mainly because she tried to mail her exiled
husband back copies of local newspapers, a newly available
transcript of the court verdict confirms.
</P>
<P>
   The businesswoman, Rebiya Kadeer, 53, was convicted March 10 in
her home province of Xinjiang in western China for ``revealing
state intelligence'' abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the newspapers she had collected, the court document
says, Kadeer had marked official speeches and articles concerning
the government's fight against ethnic separatism.
</P>
<P>
   When the harsh sentence was announced in March, her case became
an international cause, and human rights groups and some Western
governments insist that there is no evidence that Kadeer committed
any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Press reports in Xinjiang said that Kadeer had tried to mail
newspapers including marked articles about ethnic separatism to her
husband, Sidik Rouzi, who since 1996 has lived in political asylum
in the United States. Rouzi, who got into trouble for his writings
on the oppression of the Uighurs, a Turkic-speaking Muslim group
that formerly dominated Xinjiang, has criticized Chinese policy on
the American-sponsored Radio Free Asia.
</P>
<P>
   The March verdict provides more details of the charges against
Kadeer and appears to confirm human rights advocates' charges that
her prosecution represents an arbitrary application of an extremely
vague law to actions that most countries would not consider a
crime. An English translation was made available by people with
close knowledge of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most outrageous use of the `state secrets'
legislation I have come across in many years,'' said Arlette
Laduguie, a China specialist with Amnesty International in London,
who has seen the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government has tried to contain a budding
nationalist spirit among the Uighurs and is battling a small but
tenacious terrorist movement of Uighur separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Kadeer's rags-to-riches story was previously touted by the
government as that of a model Uighur, and she served on high-level
government panels. But she fell from official favor after her
husband moved abroad and she was arrested last August in Urumqi,
the capital of Xinjiang, as she was driving to meet visiting staff
members from the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   According to the March 10 verdict of the Urumqi People's
Intermediate Court, Kadeer collected local newspapers for her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   She bought 27 months' worth of the Kashgar Daily, published from
1995 to 1998, the court said, and marked speeches and other news
relating to the government's fights against separatism and
terrorism. She also bought an unspecified number of copies of
another public newspaper, the Xinjiang Legal News.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1999, Kadeer tried to mail these newspapers to her
husband, the court said, but the package was intercepted by
authorities. Later, the verdict states, Kadeer also collected 10
back issues of the Ili Daily and the Ili Evening News for her
husband and gave them to a third party to hold.
</P>
<P>
   Kadeer's final transgression, according to the court, was to try
to deliver to the visiting Americans a list of 10 people who had
run afoul of authorities for their pro-Uighur activities. Her
family denies that she carried such a list.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the crime of illegally giving information across the
border, defendant Rebiya Kadeer is sentenced to eight years
fixed-term imprisonment,'' the verdict concludes.

AT&AMP;T OFFERING BRINGS COMPANY $10 BILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They did not triple, double or even jump 50 percent.
But for AT&AMP;T, Thursday's 8 percent rise for new shares that are
meant to track the company's wireless unit was victory enough.
</P>
<P>
   In the nation's biggest initial stock offering yet, AT&AMP;T agreed
Wednesday night to sell 360 million of the new wireless shares for
$29.50 each, just above the middle of the company's estimated
range. That brought in $10.6 billion (before paying more than $300
million to investment banks for underwriting the deal).
</P>
<P>
   The wireless shares opened for trading Thursday at $30.125
before rising to close at $31.6875 in torrential trading of 124.7
million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. That made for the
second-busiest trading day yet for an individual Big Board stock.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, some high-technology stocks could routinely be
expected to double in their first day of trading. By that
perhaps-unrealistic standard, AT&AMP;T's deal was disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   But because its offering was so huge and because the equity
markets are so unsettled now, AT&AMP;T could not realistically have
hoped for the shares to experience any sort of explosive first-day
gain. Even though the shares did not rise to the $32 figure that
had been the top of AT&AMP;T's estimated range for the offering, the
company's executives could still count the more than $10 billion
they had raised and point with pride to the wireless unit's new
market value of more than $73 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big vote of confidence in AT&AMP;T Wireless,'' John D.
Zeglis, the wireless unit's chief executive, said in an interview.
``This is a vote that wireless is the future and some encouragement
that we can take this to new places like mobile Internet and fixed
broadband communications to the home.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, Zeglis was up-front in conceding that the market
turmoil of recent weeks did not help the offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't have chosen this market to play into if we had our
choice,'' he said. Referring to trips that he and his team made in
recent weeks to present the offering to big institutional
investors, he added: ``Of course we had our eye on the market the
whole time, not that we could do anything about it. We were very
aware of what was going on around us and what the comparable
companies were trading at.''
</P>
<P>
   About two-thirds, or roughly 234 million, of the 360 million
shares sold directly by AT&AMP;T went to institutional investors while
about 90 million were purchased by individual investors and roughly
36 million were bought by AT&AMP;T's employees.
</P>
<P>
   After selling the deal, AT&AMP;T retained about 84.4 percent of the
new wireless tracking shares, theoretically worth about $62
billion.
</P>
<P>
   As is customary when an older, slower-growing company offers
shares in a smaller, faster-growing subsidiary, AT&AMP;T is not
receiving full financial credit for that stake. AT&AMP;T's shares fell
$2.875 Thursday, to $47.875, shaving about $10 billion in market
value from the parent company and leaving it with a market value of
about $153.3 billion.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Subtracting the value of AT&AMP;T's stake in the wireless unit would
imply that the rest of AT&AMP;T, including its big long-distance
telephone operation, is worth only about $91 billion. But it is
surely worth more than that. After all, AT&AMP;T enjoyed a market value
in the $150 billion range last fall, before it became known that
AT&AMP;T was planning to issue the new wireless shares.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T intends to distribute most (and will probably end up
distributing all) of its remaining wireless shares to the holders
of the company's common stock. But the value of that distribution
has been obscured, at least partly because the holders of those
common shares really have no way to know just what they will end up
getting.
</P>
<P>
   That is because AT&AMP;T will probably give the owners of its common
stock the option to exchange that stock for wireless shares
outright before distributing the remaining wireless shares to the
remaining owners of AT&AMP;T common stock.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T's board has not made any final decisions on such a plan,
but such exchange offers are far from obscure to AT&AMP;T's top
leaders. John C. Malone, who sits on AT&AMP;T's board, has employed
exchange offers at his Liberty Media operation. Moreover, Charles
H. Noski, AT&AMP;T's chief financial officer, held that job at General
Motors' Hughes Electronics unit last year when GM began considering
a similar sort of exchange deal.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, GM announced the final details of its Hughes-GM share
exchange.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Edward Yates came from across the country, and Felix
Ascolese came from across town.
</P>
<P>
   But the two Compaq Computer Corp. shareholders came to Houston's
J.W. Marriott hotel to see the same thing: Who is new Chief
Executive Michael Capellas, and can he turn things around?
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here to see what Capellas is like in person,'' said
Ascolese, 55, who lives in the Houston suburb of Kingswood. ``He
came out of nowhere. He was a dark horse. It's the first time I've
ever been to an annual meeting before.''
</P>
<P>
   It's only been nine months since Capellas, then a little-known
Compaq chief information officer, took over the world's biggest PC
maker. But the early reviews at Thursday's annual meeting were
mostly positive or at least optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Yates flew in from North Haven, Conn., to hear Capellas tell his
story about rebuilding Compaq's brand, cutting costs and improving
profits, and becoming the company that will be the key provider of
every computing device of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a typical turnaround story,'' Yates said. ``But it's a
story that in the middle of the process, so we don't know if it's
going to be successful yet. I think they're on the right path.''
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, Capellas must do more than just overhaul Compaq's
organizational chart and product mix, he must also change the
28-year-old company's culture and its flagging image.
</P>
<P>
   ``The energy, pride and enthusiasm is bouncing back and getting
stronger every day,'' Capellas said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Success in the eyes of investors will be judged by the company's
stock price, which has been treading water mainly in the $20s for
the past year. The stock price surged nearly 15 percent to $30.25
this week when Compaq announced first-quarter earnings Tuesday that
met analysts' relatively unambiguous estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Such reaction is less a statement about the tough times in the
PC business lately than how far Compaq had fallen under Eckhard
Pfeiffer, who was forced out a year ago. Earnings were falling,
expenses were out of control and Wall Street was angry.
</P>
<P>
   Capellas took the stage Thursday with a spring in his step and
wearing a dressed-down, open-collared shirt beneath a dark suit.
From the start, Capellas drew a sharp contrast to his buttoned-down
predecessor, German-born Pfeiffer.
</P>
<P>
   Capellas is in a difficult fight to make his mark. And he has
taken action. Since being named CEO on July 22, Capellas has
presided over a painful restructuring that will purge 6,000 to
8,000 of Compaq's 67,000 employees, including 450 people laid off
in Houston a week ago.
</P>
<P>
   Operating expenses have dropped from about $2.2 billion in the
second quarter last year to 1.8 billion in the first quarter of
2000. Gross margin is rising from about 20 percent last June to 23
percent today.
</P>
<P>
   As he acknowledged several times Thursday, ``We're not there
yet. We have a long way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Symbolic of the company's fortunes, last year it was dethroned
by Dell Computer Corp. as the No. 1 PC seller in the United States.
Although it remains No. 1 worldwide, Compaq's grip on that title _
like that of the industry generally _ is slipping.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq has been losing money on commercial desktops, although
the losses have narrowed dramatically from $179 million last
September. Profits from consumer PCs, despite runaway growth in
unit shipments, remains flat as margins continue to shrink.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will make money in the commercial personal computer
business,'' Capellas said emphatically after the meeting, adding
that the division should return to profitability in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But the big hopes around Compaq these days are pinned to the
servers that power Web sites and business networks, and new devices
that will let people access the Internet from almost anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Like Dell, IBM Corp. and others, Compaq is trying to redefine
itself as more than just a PC company by targeting back-office
systems and the so-called ``Internet infrastructure'' with server
and storage products where margins are higher than the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   ``As fate of that (enterprise) group goes, so goes the fate of
Compaq,'' said Amir Ahari, who follows the PC industry for U.S.
Bancorp Piper Jaffray. ``The commercial desktop group is not the
turnaround genie for Compaq. The days of those products being the
key for Compaq and everybody is just gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Capellas knows this and trumpets the company's
server-and-storage business as the key to its future. It has no
intention of surrendering its No. 1 position in the server market,
but the competition is getting tougher all the time.
</P>
<P>
   To compete, Compaq is introducing ultra-slim Windows/Intel
products and next month will unveil a high-end Unix server called
Wildfire designed to take the fight to Sun.
</P>
<P>
   The company is hoping for a boost from Internet-access devices,
too. It introduced the iPAQ, a stripped-down PC designed primarily
for Web access, and is launching a number of handheld devices in
May.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq also is planning a major advertising campaign to shore up
its image as a technology powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Expect to see us get just a little edgy,'' Capellas said.
``The bad news is the brand is not well known for all the things
we're in. The good news is we've got really great stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Capellas has some breathing room _ probably until the end of the
year _ to prove himself. But there are still plenty of questions
and high expectations. Wall Street is anticipating earnings of
$1.07 per share for the year, or triple 1999's results of 34 cents
per share.
</P>
<P>
   ``Capellas should have it all together by the end of the fourth
quarter,'' Ahari said. ``The fourth quarter is going to be make or
break for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Compaq stock closed up 50 cents at $29.75.

   NEW YORK _ A stranger steps off a train into an unsuspecting
little town. He looks too slick to be trusted, but what's dangerous
about him isn't inside that big suitcase he's clutching. He's
carrying a virus so contagious that it will sweep through the whole
town, making people behave as they never have before. Harold Hill's
got it, all right; Harold Hill's got rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   Thus might Jim Thompson, or some other novelist of the
all-American underbelly, describe the plot of a show that is
traditionally regarded as one of the sunniest musicals ever. But as
the bright but spotty new revival at the Neil Simon Theater makes
clear, ``The Music Man,'' Meredith Willson's Eisenhower-era
celebration of the rhythms of life in small-town America, has
always had its devious side.
</P>
<P>
   The show's intent, like that of its con artist-hero, is to make
you start thinking all cockeyed, to sense a beat in the most
ordinary, melody-free activities, a beat that might suddenly turn
them into song. This is also, it would seem, the creed of Susan
Stroman. She is the director and choreographer of the production
that opened Thursday night, with the movie actor Craig Bierko
making a studiously polished Broadway debut as Harold Hill, the
role that made Robert Preston a star.
</P>
<P>
   Stroman's ``Music Man'' is not the dream show you might have
hoped for. It makes you feel ridiculously happy one instant and
seriously sleepy the next. It certainly doesn't provide the kind of
fluid, all-encompassing rejuvenation found in Trevor Nunn's London
revival of ``Oklahoma!,'' which Stroman also choreographed.
</P>
<P>
   Here, her transforming imagination stops when the music stops.
Neither she nor her estimable production team has been able to make
the show's setting _ the proudly plain and stubborn River City,
Iowa _ seem like more than a restoration park, a historic cardboard
world in ice-cream parlor pastels. The production has two perfectly
agreeable stars in Bierko and Rebecca Luker, who plays Marian
Paroo, the frosty librarian who learns to melt.
</P>
<P>
   But you get the impression that most of the people onstage are
just pretending to live in a land of corn-fed propriety and corny
jokes, marking time until a production number comes along to let
them show their stuff. Accordingly, when the show is singing or
especially dancing, it often seems to have winged feet; when it's
just talking or clowning around, those feet are decidedly flat.
</P>
<P>
   What Stroman gets right, she gets wonderfully right, and that
goes back to the idea of what the Gershwins called ``fascinatin'
rhythm.'' It's the same principle that governs Stroman's other
current Broadway production, the blissful ``Contact,'' which
features a vignette in which a stiff, suicidal ad man (played by
Boyd Gaines) finds deliverance in the rubber-limbed animation of
swing dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Harold becomes, without even intending to, the bearer of
salvation to a group of overstarched, judgmental and generally
joyless citizens. A notorious flimflammer among traveling salesmen,
he presents himself as a professor of musicology, organizing brass
bands wherever he goes, but he doesn't have a clue about playing,
much less reading, music.
</P>
<P>
   The show's central, felicitous joke is that Harold is a natural
musician, something that's evident in every breath of his cadenced
sales spiels, and by the evening's end he has converted not only
the townspeople but also himself. In doing so, he provides a lesson
in the art of seduction that is the essence of American musicals.
It's the same lesson that is taught by another revival,
``Chicago,'' which offers a very different but equally persuasive
take on the idea of the musical as con game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Music Man'' was Willson's first musical, staged when he
was in his mid-50s, and it was the product of years of scrupulous
revisions. The result was a doozy of a debut, a show that swept the
Tonys and the critics' awards in 1957, beating out a grittier,
darker slice of American life called ``West Side Story.'' While
finger-wagging hindsight tends to make ``West Side Story'' the
breakthrough upstart, with ``The Music Man'' as a comforting
throwback, that contrast oversimplifies what Willson achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Willson, who wrote the book and lyrics as well as the score for
the show, wasn't merely hewing to the already threadbare rules of
the organic book musical. He was also refining them with sly
sophistication, creating one of the most spontaneous-seeming
organic musicals of all time.
</P>
<P>
   His trick throughout was to take a familiar sound _ the
click-clack of a train's wheels, the plodding rise and fall of a
student's piano scales _ as a taking-off point for the show's
songs. The implicit message is that music is everywhere if you know
how to look for it, an idea expressed most sweetly in the show's
famous love ballad, ``Till There Was You.''
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, Stroman is clearly Willson's soulmate. She
ingeniously begins her ``Music Man'' by putting a real band,
members of the orchestra, onstage for the overture in the railroad
car where the show's first scene takes place. (Doug Besterman's
orchestrations nicely polish the score's silvery romance as well as
the dominant brass.)
</P>
<P>
   When the musicians are replaced by the traveling salesmen who
sing the show's first number, ``Rock Island,'' which brilliantly
sets manic conversation to the rhythms of the train, it feels
seamless, the substitution of one group of music-makers for
another.
</P>
<P>
   You can feel the men who perform the patter song getting high on
those rhythms, and it's an infectious feeling. Unfortunately,
Stroman hasn't found a way to keep that sensation percolating when
the train stops.
</P>
<P>
   The show has a winning if overly artificial human metronome in
the tireless Bierko. Things definitely perk up when he's around,
and the show soars anew when Harold is conjuring an orchestra from
the air or shattering the quiet of a library. But there is a
flatness in the overall mise-en-scene.
</P>
<P>
   The impression extends to Thomas Lynch's sets, which juxtapose
the idyllic construct of River City itself (here it looks a lot
like Main Street, U.S.A., at Disneyland) with lots of painted green
flats and foliage frames. These are presumably meant to create a
sort of ``Midsummer Night's Dream'' land of verdure, but the effect
is oddly claustrophobic.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in William Ivey Long's too-pretty period costumes,
townspeople in the ensemble are a genial, easy-going lot, which is
not at all what the show asks for. You don't get the sense of
diverse idiosyncratic figures chafing against one another, which
still comes across in the 1962 film version.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There's a looseness to the key supporting performers, who
include Paul Benedict and Ruth Williamson as the blustery mayor and
his bossy wife, that creates a distracting diffuseness. Williamson,
for example, provides a sharply drawn, amusing caricature, but she
seems to belong to another show. And Max Casella, who has the plum
part of Marcellus, Harold's wily accomplice, has rakish charms that
are never brought into sharp relief here. Like so many of the
others, he gets lost in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The same cannot be said of Bierko, who steps into Preston's long
shadow with remarkable assurance. At times he seems to be
patterning his gestures and inflections too closely on his famous
predecessor. But he has a gleaming impishness of his own, never so
evident as when he is hoodwinking a group of officious councilmen
by turning them into a mellifluous barbershop quartet (charmingly
embodied by Michael-Leon Wooley, Jack Doyle, John Sloman and Blake
Hammond).
</P>
<P>
   Preston's anchoring, reassuring humanity, which always hinted at
the latent good guy beneath the scam artist, doesn't come as
naturally to Bierko, who sometimes registers as so glisteningly
smooth that you wonder if there's anyone home beneath the veneer.
Yet in the show's last scenes, in which Harold realizes his love
for Marian, something substantial, a mix of sensuality and shame,
suddenly shines through. A little more of that throughout, and
Bierko will have a first-class performance.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Luker, who is in exquisite voice, could use a shade
more sex appeal in her early scenes. Her Marian initially registers
as pinched and forbidding, a closed bud with no promise of opening.
It is a delight, however, when the bud unfolds; you can even see
the color coming into her pallid cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   Marian, for the record, is a part Luker could play with her eyes
closed. (She also did the virginal heroines of the recent revivals
of ``Showboat'' and ``The Sound of Music.'') It would be nice to
see her tap some of the glamour quotient evident in her appearance
in the Encores! concert of ``The Boys From Syracuse.''
</P>
<P>
   Luker becomes a stand-in of sorts for the audience in the
evening's high point. That's the delicious ``Marian the Librarian''
number in which Harold tries to thaw Marian in her library. The
sign on the wall says ``Quiet Please,'' and the pleasure of the
song has always been in seeing that silence violated.
</P>
<P>
   What Stroman realizes here, though, is something subtler. It's
not raucousness so much that follows; it's a gliding fantasy that
shows off the corps de ballet at its best. Heavy tomes become as
light and manipulable as straw hats and canes, and earthbound
adolescents soar skyward.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is of one of those dreams about flying in which you
suddenly find your heels leaving the ground. At that moment, you
don't doubt the magical powers of Bierko's Harold or of Stroman as
master conjurer. This ``Music Man'' may be disappointingly
earthbound for at least half of its nearly three hours, but it
still has more helium than any of the other self-described family
entertainments on Broadway.

 &HT;    Hoover's promises profit by March 2001
 &HT;    By Amy Schatz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Although Hoover's Inc. announced another year of
net losses Thursday, the company said it could be profitable by
March 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The Austin-based online business information and electronic
commerce portal said it expects to turn a profit in the fourth
quarter of its next fiscal year, which ends March 31, 2001. Faster
than expected growth in revenue and subscribers allowed the date to
be moved forward by several quarters, the company announced
Thursday afternoon when it released fourth quarter and annual
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover's shares closed up a quarter a share to $9 on Thursday.
Earnings were released after the market closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've outperformed what we thought we'd do when we went
public. It just became clear to us that it wouldn't take as long
for us to become profitable,'' said Chief Executive Officer Patrick
Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The company reported net losses of 13 cents a share for the
quarter ended March 31, beating analyst estimates by 6 cents a
share. The company's net loss for the fourth quarter was about $1.8
million, up from $347,000 last year. Revenue, however, more than
doubled to $6.6 million from $3.1 million.
</P>
<P>
   For the year, Hoover's reported a net loss of $9.5 million
compared to $2.3 million for the previous year. However, the
company also saw net revenues double to $19 million, compared to
just $9.2 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the company will focus on providing content for
wireless devices such as personal digital assistants and cell
phones, expansion of European content, and services to keep
visitors at the Hoover's site for longer periods.
</P>
<P>
   Hoover's went public in July and at one point reached a high of
$33 a share. But the company's stock quickly dropped and has
hovered in the $9 to $12 range for the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a little undervalued because we weren't sexy. Now,
people are looking for companies that are looking at becoming
profitable in the foreseeable future,'' Spain said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   With lavish consumer spending providing the stimulus, the
American economy turned in another highly robust quarter, the
government reported Thursday, as new evidence emerged that today's
prosperity is finally pushing up labor costs, raising fear of
higher inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The inflation rate, as measured by the Commerce Department,
jumped in the first three months of the year, mainly because of
higher gasoline and fuel oil prices. But Wall Street expressed the
worry that even as petroleum prices recede, labor costs will kick
in and keep the inflation rate rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either way, the economy is growing much too strongly to avoid
inflation,'' said Richard Rippe, chief economist at Prudential
Securities. ``There are too many little signs out there that the
Federal Reserve cannot ignore. It will have to continue to raise
interest rates; the increases so far have had no effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The strong pace of growth and the fresh warning signs of an
acceleration in wage and price increases raised the possibility
that the Federal Reserve could raise short-term interest rates by
as much as half a percentage point next month in its effort to curb
inflationary pressures. But most analysts expect it to stick to a
more modest quarter point rate increase at its meeting on May 16.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market, reacting to the hints of rising inflation and
the likelihood of more interest rate increases, plunged in the
first hour or so of trading. But it then bounced back as investors
focused on the prospects for higher profits from the growing
economy. The Nasdaq composite index rose a very healthy 143.94
points, or nearly 4 percent, to 3,774.03, and the Dow Jones
industrial average finished at 10,888.1, down only 57.4 points or
about 1/2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The gross domestic product, representing the value of all of the
goods and services produced in the nation from January through
March, rose at a 5.4 percent annual rate, the Commerce Department
reported. This was the quarter in which the expansion became the
longest in history, but Americans showed no signs of running out of
money or out of confidence that the good times will continue.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on a variety of sources _ savings, bonuses and raises,
stock options and market gains, the wages from new jobs, as well as
income tax refunds and more borrowing _ people piled into the
marketplace during the first three months of the year at a pace not
seen in 17 years. Showing confidence that the good times will
continue, they spent most heavily on cars and trucks, but they also
increased their purchases of clothing, appliances, furniture,
sports events, casino gambling, computers and software.
</P>
<P>
   ``The implication of all this is that people feel wealthier;
their assets are going up in value _ their stock portfolios and
their homes _ and they intend to spend more,'' said Robert Parker,
chief statistician at the Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic
Analysis, which prepares the GDP report.
</P>
<P>
   The rise exceeded the increase in spending in any quarter since
the spring of 1983. Then, the nation was just bouncing back from a
recession; now the expansion is more than nine years old. Even
politicians added to the bounty. The outlays by all the
presidential candidates added more than $235 million to the gross
domestic product from January through March _ or two-tenths of a
percentage in the growth rate of 5.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Business investment grew with equal abandon. Construction of
homes, schools, office buildings and highways rose by 12.1 percent.
Outlays for machinery and equipment, mainly computers and software,
rose a stunning 23.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Firms rushed to purchase new computers last year in the runup
to Y2K,'' said Chris Varvares, a partner at Macroeconomic Partners
in St. Louis, ``and in the first quarter they resumed the process
of upgrading their operations.''
</P>
<P>
   What most alarmed Wall Street, which is always fearful that
rising inflation will undercut the public's enthusiasm for stocks
and bonds, was a separate report issued Thursday by the Bureau of
Labor Statistics. It said that labor costs rose at an unexpectedly
fast pace during the quarter _ partly from rising wages but mostly
from greater company outlays for employee benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau's Employment Cost Index rose 1.4 percent during the
quarter, up sharply from the 1 percent increase in the fourth
quarter, much of it due to a big rise in health insurance costs,
which have gone up gradually for two years. Company outlays for
health insurance rose by 7.6 percent in the year that ended last
month, or three times faster than the 2.5 percent increase in 1998.

   ``If you are looking for where the potential upward pressure on
prices is coming from,'' said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at
the Economic Policy Institute, ``it is energy and health
insurance.''
</P>
<P>
   The broad inflation measure published with the GDP report _ a
gauge that the Fed now watches more closely than the more popular
consumer price index _ rose by 3.2 percent compared with 2.5
percent in the fourth quarter. But when energy and food are
subtracted, the index was up only 1.8 percent, down slightly from
the fourth quarter's 2 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
   Many experts argue that the economy cannot maintain a growth
rate above 3.5 percent or 4 percent without subjecting the country
to inflationary shortages. But strong economic growth is likely to
continue through the current quarter, which ends on June 30, some
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that cars and trucks were high on the shopping list
in the first quarter, but most were purchased out of back lot
inventories, which must be replenished as robust vehicle sales
continue. What's more, a strike at the Boeing Co. temporarily
interrupted production at the huge aircraft company, which
contributes significantly to the nation's output and exports.

DIPLOMATS URGE SENATE TO APPROVE AMBASSADORS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Iowa) By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ In an unusual step for the diplomatic
establishment, two major foreign service organizations are asking
the Senate to lift a politically instigated hold on two
ambassadorial appointments that have been blocked for nearly nine
months.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, in a deal that released another hold on the
nomination of Richard Holbrooke as U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee took three
``hostages'' in return. Among them was Peter Burleigh, a career
diplomat who had been designated ambassador to the Philippines, but
was filling in at the United Nations for the missing Holbrooke,
whose arrival was delayed for a year by investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Burleigh, a terrorism expert, is still waiting to go to the
Philippines, where this week a complicated series of abductions by
Islamic separatists is playing out. Among the victims are tourists
seized at a diving resort in neighboring Malaysia. Reports from the
Philippines say that the abductors are demanding the release of
Muslim prisoners in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments of Burleigh and of Carl Spielvogel to Slovakia,
another country with recent political tensions, remain locked in an
unrelated personnel dispute between Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa,
and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. The third appointment,
that of J. Richard Fredericks as ambassador to Switzerland, was
freed after President Clinton was allowed to choose one name for
release and picked his.
</P>
<P>
   Fredericks and Spielvogel were both political appointees and
contributors to the Democratic Party. The nomination of Burleigh, a
former ambassador to Sri Lanka was a career appointment.
</P>
<P>
   The American Foreign Service Association, which represents the
diplomatic corps, and the Academy of American Diplomacy, a support
organization that counts among its members all eight living former
secretaries of state, wrote two weeks ago to Grassley and Sen.
Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, to protest the continuing
hold on Burleigh's appointment.
</P>
<P>
   In his letter to Grassley, the foreign service association's
president, Marshall P. Adair, said: ``It is essential that we send
the most highly experienced and qualified people we have to promote
out interests around the world. ``Our ability to do that is
severely constrained when the nomination process becomes
irretrievably entangled in political bartering on other issues.''
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Lott, the academy's chairman, Joseph L. Sisco,
and president, L. Bruce Laingen, expressed regret that the case
``should cause further delay in providing the leadership needed in
our missions in the Philippines and Slovakia in pursuing our
interests in those two important countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The case at the heart of the dispute involves Linda Shenwick, a
former State Department diplomat at the U.S. mission here, whom
Republicans view as a whistle-blower for her reports to Congress
outside diplomatic channels of allegations of financial
mismanagement in the United Nations, a prime target of
conservatives. When Shenwick was transferred back to the State
Department after what administration officials consider a normal
tour of duty, Grassley and others charged that the move was
political and that Shenwick was being persecuted unfairly.

SPORTS COLUMN: TALE OF TWO (BIG-TIME) CITIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the next few days, men from Toronto and men from New York
will be aggressing each other with sticks, elbows and the
occasional hard slide.
</P>
<P>
   This does not necessarily signal the start of a great
Toronto-New York border war. There is too much evidence of
worldliness, maturity and tolerance _ certainly on the Toronto
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have a rivalry, both parties have to feel it,'' said Ken
Dryden, once a championship goaltender with the Montreal Canadiens,
now the general manager of the renewed Toronto Maple Leafs. ``I'm
not sure New Yorkers would buy a rivalry with Toronto.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, they could work on it. New Yorkers delight in being hated
by the John Rockers of the world, but New Yorkers must sense that
Toronto, with its own subway and Chinatown and film festivals, does
not feel a threat to its pride, its dignity and the Canadian way of
life.
</P>
<P>
   Through the vagaries of playoff pairings and regular-season
schedules, there is a trifecta of matchups this weekend between New
York and its cinematic stand-in.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays of baseball will be playing at Yankee Stadium
Friday night, tomorrow and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Knicks of basketball will be playing the Raptors
at the Air Canada Centre, which is so Canadian that it is indeed
officially spelled the British way, no matter how much it might
offend New York hubris.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday night at the aforementioned Toronto arena, the
hallowed Maple Leafs of hockey began a Stanley Cup playoff series
against the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The only trash talk emanating from Toronto came from a radio
station reviving the New Jersey stereotypes of ``swamplands,''
toxic waste and Jimmy Hoffa's alleged burial beneath Giants Stadium
_ in other words, nothing that New Yorkers do not indulge in for
our own cheap, provincial thrills.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some rumblings among the competitors themselves.
The Maple Leafs and the Devils were trading charges of viciousness,
if you can imagine such a thing in hockey, while the Raptors'
coach, Butch Carter, has been busy filing and withdrawing a lawsuit
against a former player, making unsubstantiated charges of racism
against his old college coach and sending in a rusty sub to take
the last desperation shot in Wednesday night's loss.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers may see Carter's distraction as a tribute to their
own obnoxious ways, but who is to say that Carter would not be just
as unfocused against Charlotte or some other burg?
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, there is no panic up north. John Coburn, a Toronto
artist who loves and draws New York, did not immediately join the
Yonge Street Irregulars for battles between the Devils' Czechs and
the Maple Leafs' Swedes, or the Yankees' Panamanians and the Blue
Jays' Dominicans.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Coburn was planning an imminent trip to Gotham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toronto people salivate over New York and everything it has to
offer,'' he said. ``They love the way New Yorkers will either tell
you to go to hell or say, `Let's have coffee.'''
</P>
<P>
   Coburn has lived in New York for months at a time, enough to
produce 160 pen-and-ink drawings for three books about its small
hotels, its neighborhoods and the high points of Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the quality of life is a little better in Toronto,''
he said, ``but you get back on the plane and you look down at New
York and you sigh a little.''
</P>
<P>
   These do not sound like the inflammatory charges that citizens
make when teams from small towns become involved in sports
playoffs. There are no silly mayoral wagers of local brews or
regional dishes going on.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto did not even bother to shut down the frontier last
weekend, when the Yankees were playing at the Skydome and more than
half the fans seemed to come from Buffalo, Rochester and points
downstate.
</P>
<P>
   The invasion is common. After the last game of the 1995 season,
when the Yanks clinched a wild-card berth, the last flight to La
Guardia was jammed with large and gruff New Yorkers who had been
Molson-ing their way around the ballpark all weekend. When the
flight attendant walked down the aisle with a plastic bag, asking,
``Trash?'' one of the louts shouted, ``Hey, she's talking about
us.''
</P>
<P>
   They were on relatively good behavior since there is no sporting
bad blood between any of these teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually the teams become the bitter rivals, like the Rangers
and Flyers or Knicks and Celtics,'' Dryden said. ``But I'm not sure
New York feels a rivalry with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto can afford a wry familiarity with New York since, for
some intents and purposes, it is New York.
</P>
<P>
   The cheap Canadian dollar, the eclectic architecture and the
cooperative citizenry make Toronto a viable alternative to New York
for film production, including the Brooklyn cheese shop in
``Moonstruck'' and the urban menace of Paterson, N.J., in ``The
Hurricane.'' The Ontario Film Development Corp. lists more than 50
television productions and 21 feature films in 1999 made by
foreigners, mostly Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down near the lake where I live, a guy keeps a whole fleet of
New York city cabs and police cars because he knows they're needed
all the time,'' said Allen Abel, a son of Flatbush, Brooklyn, now a
prominent journalist with the CBC and The National Post.
</P>
<P>
   The daily proximity to New York street signs and artifacts and
emblems makes Canadians comfortable with the foibles of life down
south. Canada even got over it quickly when an American singer
mangled ``O Canada'' at Yankee Stadium before a tense game in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, not all New Yorkers are self-centered, jingoistic and
isolationist. We think Chancellor Trudeau is doing a great job.

VERMONT'S TOP JUDGE SOUGHT `COMMON HUMANITY' IN GAY UNIONS RULING

<P>
   MONTPELIER, Vt. _ There is so much that Chief Justice Jeffrey L.
Amestoy of the Vermont Supreme Court cannot say.
</P>
<P>
   He can welcome a visitor into his small, paper-piled office in
the gray granite Supreme Court building here, looking a mere mortal
in brown chinos and loafers instead of black robes, and so low-key
in his manner that it almost seems normal to call the chief justice
Jeff.
</P>
<P>
   He can talk about his past as a seven-term state attorney
general, one with such stature that he was appointed chief justice
in 1997 by a Democratic governor, even though he was a Republican.
He can even talk about his idyllic childhood, fishing and playing
baseball in Rutland.
</P>
<P>
   But as a judge in an continuing case, he cannot discuss the
decision that makes him such a pivotal figure in Vermont now: His
court's ruling in December that gay couples were victims of
unconstitutional discrimination. That ruling put the onus of ending
the discrimination on the Legislature, and on Tuesday it led to the
passage of a first-in-the-nation bill creating marriage-like civil
unions for same-sex couples.
</P>
<P>
   So Amestoy (pronounced AM-eh-stoy) must apologetically decline
to answer what anyone following this case would most like to know:
Did he foresee how all this would play out, that the state would be
deeply divided over gay marriage but the Legislature would
successfully fashion such a compromise?
</P>
<P>
   Is the court satisfied that the bill to create same-sex civil
unions will end the discrimination it found, or is it contemplating
further action?
</P>
<P>
   And, ultimately, what difference did it make that it was
specifically he, Amestoy, who was head of the state's highest court
when this question came up?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for a man who must remain silent, there are plenty
of friends and colleagues who will speak for him. And what they
tend to say is that the 53-year-old chief justice, a history buff,
takes the long, broad view: that he is by nature moderate,
nondoctrinaire and deeply common-sensical, and that he loves
Vermont and would not cast it into turmoil any worse than could be
avoided, but wants to make a real difference here. All those
characteristics, his friends speculate, probably played a role in
the court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jeff has a lot of wisdom,'' said Vermont's governor,
Howard Dean, who signed the civil unions bill into law on
Wednesday. ``I appointed him as a moderate, and I think this ruling
was a moderate ruling.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, as well, Amestoy, who is married and the father of
three daughters, used to be able to talk much more freely, and
there are all kinds of hints in his speeches and professional
record about how his mind works.
</P>
<P>
   When he accepted his current post in 1997, he said in his
inauguration speech: ``I believe in `civility in public discourse
and constancy in private affection.' And I believe, with Learned
Hand, that `the spirit of liberty is the spirit that is not too
sure it is right.' ''
</P>
<P>
   (``There is much to be said about that,'' he said in an
interview, ``but I'll leave it at that.'')
</P>
<P>
   Consider: In 1993, Hawaii's Supreme Court ruled, much like its
Vermont counterpart, that barring same-sex couples from marrying
was discrimination. But it did not leave it up to the Legislature
to decide the remedy, and the backlash against the ruling was so
powerful that in 1998, opponents passed a constitutional amendment
authorizing the Legislature to restrict marriage to heterosexual
couples. As a result, the marriage case has been dismissed as moot.
</P>
<P>
   Now take Vermont: Instead of simply decreeing that gay couples
should be allowed to marry, it sent the issue back to the Vermont
Legislature to work out a remedy, and left open the option of
stopping short of official marriage if virtually all the same
benefits were provided. Debate got rough at times, but the
Legislature did pass the civil unions bill, and voted down calls
for Hawaiian-style constitutional amendments.
</P>
<P>
   A group called ``Take It to the People'' and other opponents of
gay marriage here accuse Amestoy and the court of over-the-top
judicial activism and of forcing Vermonters to accept gay couples
even though many still disapprove of homosexuality. To them, the
civil unions bill is not a compromise but a virtual legalization of
gay marriage. They have called repeatedly for a constitutional
amendment, which would require a popular vote, or at least a
nonbinding referendum.
</P>
<P>
   But the Legislature rejected that idea. And, luckily for the
court, amendments are much harder to pass here than in Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   The court also chose another politically careful tactic: It
could have based its ruling on the principle that gay couples
deserved special protections because they belong to a persecuted
class. One justice argued as much, and another said the court
should simply grant marriage licenses to gay couples.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, another group of critics of Amestoy say that clear
evidence of homophobia in Vermont, made even clearer by the debate
on the issue, demonstrates the depth of persecution and the special
protections thus needed.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of talking about special protections, the ruling
stepped onto trickier legal ground, arguing that gay couples must
be granted the same rights as heterosexuals under a clause in the
Vermont Constitution that says the state should treat everyone
equally.
</P>
<P>
   The most ringing sentence of the decision, which Amestoy wrote,
said that granting equal rights to homosexual couples ``who seek
nothing more, nor less, than legal protection and security for
their avowed commitment to an intimate and lasting relationship is
simply, when all is said and done, a recognition of our common
humanity.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some legal observers see the hand of Amestoy in that balancing
act and choice of tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he was the one who crafted the decision in a way that
would bring people together,'' said a former Maine attorney
general, James E. Tierney, a friend from the National Association
of Attorneys General, which the future chief justice led as
president in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sent it to the Legislature but he put them in a box,''
Tierney said. ``He knew the process; he's a great believer in the
process, and he knew the same process he led the court through
would then be gone through in the Legislature: You start with the
hatred and the reaction and the extremes, and you work on it and
work on it and you find your way. His bottom line is to do this
with dignity and respect. What would possibly be the sense of doing
this if you end up with a state that's divided and filled with hate
and anger?''
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders cannot know what exact process the chief justice led
the court through, but it would seem likely his leadership style
has not changed since his years as attorney general. Brian Burgess,
his deputy from 1985 to 1992 and now a Vermont district court
judge, said that the Supreme Court's decision to invite the
Legislature into the process ``reflects a recognition that the
court does not have a monopoly on right answers, which is his
approach to things.''
</P>
<P>
   Amestoy _ the name reflects his Basque heritage _ politely
deflected almost every question relating to gay marriage, including
whether any personal experience with gay couples had influenced
him. One little word did slip, however, when asked if the political
process had gone as he had expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someday,'' he said wistfully of a time in the future when he
would be able to talk freely again.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, however, the chief justice may not have all the
historical answers. In his inauguration speech, he quoted the late
Pennsylvania trial judge Curtis Bok as saying that being a judge
entailed a mystery that defied analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``A judge's cases,'' he wrote, ``take hold of him and pull
things out of him,'' and ``it is his business to be sure to keep
the proper supplies on hand, so far as he can be master of that.''

PALMEIRO HELPS YOUNG PLAYERS COPE WITH STRUGGLES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON _ Rafael Palmeiro invited Gabe Kapler to breakfast
Wednesday morning in the Rangers' clubhouse, although what he had
in mind wasn't exactly a feast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have a doughnut together,'' Palmeiro told
Kapler. ``Not a plain doughnut. A glazed doughnut. Not one of those
with cream filling or sprinkles on it, just a good, old-fashioned,
glazed doughnut.''
</P>
<P>
   Kapler, a nutritional fanatic, normally goes for the Triple Whey
shakes for breakfast, but he gladly accepted Palmeiro's invitation.
It wasn't that Kapler had a craving for a glazed doughnut; he just
wasn't going to pass up a chance to talk with one of his mentors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Raffy's awesome,'' Kapler said later. ``He such a good
person, and he's a pretty-decent ballplayer. I watch him all the
time ... not really his swing, but the way he goes about his
business and the way he handles himself. He always conducts himself
as a professional. I respect him very much.''
</P>
<P>
   This has been a tough time for some of the Rangers' younger
players, Kapler foremost among them with his 9-for-66 slump.
Palmeiro has taken it upon himself to help guide them through it.
Palmeiro may one day get 3,000 hits, 500 home runs and induction
into the Hall of Fame, but he hasn't forgotten what it's like to be
young and struggling to make it in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard when you're a young player and you're trying to
establish yourself at this level,'' Palmeiro said. ``It doesn't
happen overnight. The key is to be patient, be positive and be
focused. Just because things aren't going your way, you can't just
give up. You make adjustments. It's a learning process, and it
takes awhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best way to learn is to go out, play the game and learn
from your mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Said hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo: ``That's why it's good to
have guys like Raffy around. He has a lot of confidence as a
hitter. He trusts his skills, and he's very positive. He's a good
influence on some of these young guys.'
</P>
<P>
   Kapler said: ``It's not necessarily what he says but when he
says it. He goes out of his way to say something when you need it.
He's somebody that everybody in this clubhouse has a lot of respect
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro went through tough times in 1989, his first year with
the Rangers after being acquired from the Chicago Cubs. He actually
started hot, hitting .361 through May 28. But then the season
turned sour, as he batted .235 in the final 110 games. He had 17
runs batted in during his final 80 games, and the Rangers had
serious talks about trading him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a bad year,'' Palmeiro said. ``I was trying to
prove I belonged in this league. I pressed. ... I didn't handle it
the best way.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro eventually pulled out of it, hitting .319 the next
year. But he had to fight a reputation for being moody and
self-absorbed. He said it wasn't until he signed with Baltimore
after the 1993 season that he learned how to handle things better.
</P>
<P>
   He did so by being around such veterans in Baltimore as Cal
Ripken Jr. and Harold Baines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I sat down and talked to them all the time,''
Palmeiro said. ``I just watched them and saw how they handled
themselves, how they approached the game. They never got mad. You
never saw them throw bats, slam helmets or get down. To me that
showed a lot of class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have that the first time I was here. We had Nolan
Ryan, and he was our leader on the mound. But Nolan was quiet, and
he kept to himself. He wasn't the kind of guy you could go to and
talk hitting with. Everybody else was young; we were all just here
to learn the game and prove we belonged here. It was a hard thing
to go through.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro doesn't want Kapler, Ruben Mateo and some of the
Rangers' other young players to go through the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of players are watching me if I come back to the
dugout with a negative attitude,'' Palmeiro said. ``But no matter
how good the other pitcher is or how bad you're struggling, you
have to remain positive. There are bad times, times when you don't
feel as good at the plate or that you feel you're being as
productive as you can be for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing these guys have to realize is every at-bat is
different. All it takes is one at-bat to turn things around. You
can be 0-for-3 but come up in the ninth inning with the game on the
line and get that hit that wins the game. Now, all of a sudden,
you're feeling pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro's transformation has reached a point that ``I have
absolute confidence in my ability. There's no doubt in my mind when
I go up to the plate I can get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys will be fine. They have talent, and you can see
that they believe in themselves. As long as they keep working hard
and preparing themselves, things will turn around and they will get
better.''

RESEARCHERS TO FOCUS ON TUBERCULOSIS RATE IN HOUSTON

   HOUSTON _ Baylor College of Medicine has been awarded a $15.5
million contract by the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,
Md., to research tuberculosis in Houston, where the rate of the
disease is among the highest in the United States.
</P>

   Principal investigator Edward Graviss, Baylor assistant
professor of pathology and medicine, said he hopes to identify on a
molecular level the numerous strains of the TB bacterium found in
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should help us determine whether people who know each
other have the same type of TB bug, indicating a likelihood that
one person transmitted it to the other,'' Graviss said.
</P>
<P>
   During the next seven years, TB specimens and blood samples will
be collected from 500 patients in Harris County, which includes
most of Houston. The samples will be analyzed in labs at Baylor and
the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or
NIAID.
</P>
<P>
   Graviss said the information from his study might result in a
better test to diagnose TB, which kills 3 million people worldwide
each year, and provide insights into genetic susceptibility to TB.
</P>
<P>
   Houston's TB rate in 1998 was 19.1 cases per 100,000 population,
the same as New York City's rate and comparable to San Francisco's
rate of 18.2.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the rate was 6.8 cases per 100,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty and crowded living conditions are major contributors to
the spread of the disease, he said. People with compromised immune
systems, such as those with the human immunodeficiency virus, also
are at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Graviss said TB data collected in Houston over five years
showed: 40 percent of TB patients were black; 17 percent of
patients were HIV-positive; and 50 percent had a history of
incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the NIAID contract, Baylor will collaborate with the
City of Houston Health Department, the Harris County Hospital
District and city clinicians, who will help identify patients with
TB.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the study will answer questions about their
exposure to TB and provide four to five blood samples for one year.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to analyzing TB strains, investigators will use the
data to study how the patient's body is responding to the disease
and to treatment, which should be provided by the patient's
physician. Treatment usually consists of four drugs for nine
months. State funds cover the cost of medication for patients
without insurance.
</P>
<P>
   TB exposure is usually confirmed by symptoms, such as coughing,
fever and fatigue, a skin test and a chest X-ray.

CLINTON RETURNS HOME TO HONOR CIVIL RIGHTS HEROINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. _ President Clinton, approaching the twilight
of his presidency, returned to the warm embrace of his native
Arkansas Thursday to celebrate the life of Daisy Bates, a revered
civil rights figure who died last December.
</P>
<P>
   Before an audience of several hundred Arkansans, Clinton smiled
broadly as the Rev. Rufus T. King Jr. welcomed him back to Little
Rock by saying he was happy to see him in one piece and ``not torn
all to pieces'' by his opponents over the last 18 months in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``And one of the reasons they haven't been able to do that is
because you had so many black folks praying for you,'' King said to
loud applause to a mostly black audience. Clinton threw back his
head in a gesture of deep pleasure. ``I'm still in one piece,'' he
said, ``though grayer and a lot more jagged.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates, who died at the age of 85, was an important figure in the
battle to integrate Little Rock's Central High School in 1957. As
state president of the NAACP at the time, she helped select the
nine students to integrate the school and she counseled them and
their families throughout the ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his difficulties in Washington, Clinton has often
looked home to Arkansas for emotional replenishment. ''I've had a
good time,'' Clinton said following his prepared remarks. ``I'm
really glad I came.''
</P>
<P>
   After the memorial service for Bates, the president attended a
ceremony to name the law school at the University of Arkansas at
Little Rock after an old friend, William Bowen, who served as his
chief of staff in Arkansas in 1991, the year he ran for president.
</P>
<P>
   This time a different audience, mostly lawyers and judges and
their families, showered Clinton with similar adulation. He
remained for nearly an hour to shake hands.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the warm welcomes he received Thursday, Clinton's
relationship with Arkansas has become more complicated. The local
press reported that many of his friends have been angered by his
announcement that he intends to transfer his voter registration to
New York where he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, have bought
a home to help her establish residency for her Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   And although it was decidedly unmentioned Thursday, Clinton is
nearing the final stages of a disciplinary hearing before state
authorities that could result in the suspension or revocation of
his license to practice law. Last week was the deadline for
Clinton's lawyers to respond to a special lawyers' committee which
is considering disciplinary action against Clinton for his
testimony before a federal judge in January 1998 that he did not
have a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.

SENATE REPUBLICANS TRY TO DELAY TAIWAN VOTE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN.: Miss., Alaska, Mont.)  By JOSEPH KAHN with ERIK ECKHOLM  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Some Senate Republicans are pushing to postpone
consideration of a bill that would upgrade U.S. defense ties with
Taiwan, arguing that it makes no sense to pass it at a time when
Taiwan's government is in transition and China has acted with
relative restraint toward its neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, known as the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, has
languished in the Senate since passing the House by an overwhelming
margin. Some senators who favor the bill fear that it might not
have enough support to overcome legislative maneuvers that would
block it. They also say that Taiwanese officials prefer to delay
any action on the bill until after the island's new government
takes power in late May.
</P>
<P>
   If the bill remains in limbo, that could clear the way for a
congressional vote on whether to grant China permanent normal trade
relations, which President Clinton has called his top remaining
legislative priority. The Clinton administration strongly opposes
the Taiwan security bill. Administration officials have said they
are worried that senators may try to link the trade measure to the
Taiwan bill or try to pass both at the same time, a step they say
would damage relations with China at a sensitive time.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's president-elect, Chen Shui-bian, whose party until
recently called for the island to seek independence, signaled that
he did not want the Senate to act on the bill immediately,
according to Sen. Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska, who met with Chen
in Taipei last week. Murkowski, who said he had been inclined to
support the security bill, said Chen urged that the Senate delay
consideration of the bill at least until after he took office on
May 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging from the expected reaction from China, they would
prefer to have the inauguration done before any action is taken on
TSEA,'' Murkowski said, using the abbreviation for the security
enhancement act. ``They were unequivocal in saying that they don't
need this right now.''
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the bill is in the hands of Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott, who has put the bill on the Senate calendar but has not
scheduled a vote. A spokesman for Lott said the majority leader had
taken Murkowski's interpretation of Chen's views into
consideration, and said that was ``one of several factors'' that
would determine if and when a vote took place.
</P>
<P>
   Senate aides said the Taiwan security bill still had strong
support among Republican senators and could come up for a vote at
any time, especially if China took precipitous action against
Taiwan. Lott has remained coy about his intentions, suggesting that
he could introduce the bill if that seemed politically
advantageous, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is thought to have majority support in the Senate, but
possibly not enough backing to overcome procedural hurdles or a
threatened veto by the president. Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who has
argued that the bill will unnecessarily hurt relations with China,
has put a ``hold'' on the measure, a maneuver that under Senate
rules requires 60 votes to remove.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwanese officials described Chen's position differently than
did Murkowski. These officials, including a senior aide to Chen who
attended the meeting between the senator and Taiwan's
president-elect, said it was Murkowski who raised the prospect of
postponing the vote on the security bill, not Chen, although he
confirmed that Chen did not raise any objections to the idea.

 &HT;    Anti-gay group seek audience with Bush
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Anti-gay rights groups concerned about Gov.
George W. Bush's recent meeting with gay Republicans now want the
probable GOP presidential nominee to meet with them so they can
enlighten him about ``the homosexual political agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The homosexual agenda is incompatible with family life,'' the
groups, including the Southern Baptist Convention, told Bush in a
letter saying he should meet with them to ``demonstrate your
commitment to the family by ... meeting with those of us who
believe that homosexual activism poses a serious threat to our
marriage-based culture and to the freedoms of speech, religion and
association.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said Bush meets with pro-family
leaders ``all the time'' but no decision has been made on whether
he would sit down with the groups who sent the letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He agrees with them on the importance of families and the
sanctity of marriage,'' McClellan said, adding, ``Governor Bush is
running an inclusive campaign and he welcomes the support of all
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting request comes as Bush steps up his efforts to offer
a bipartisan and inclusive image that includes inviting support
from gay voters. After months of declining to meet with leaders of
the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay organization, Bush earlier this
month huddled privately with 12 gay Republicans hand-picked by his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Included was former U.S. Rep. Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin, who
said the session meant that ``never again will a major-party
candidate be able to run for president without addressing gay and
lesbian issues.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gunderson criticized the letter from the groups as
something less than a request for ``dialogue or honest
conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a desire for a confrontation and an ultimatum,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gunderson said the letter is indicative of how tricky the
equation is as Bush tries to put a more tolerant face on their
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the struggle within the Republican
Party is to hold together an increasingly diverse coalition,'' said
Gunderson. ``And we all need to help manage it. I would hope that
could be done in ways other than public debates through press
releases.''
</P>
<P>
   The 12 groups said they want to tell Bush ``the facts behind the
homosexual political agenda that often go unreported.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Homosexual activists are trying to use the Republican Party,
much like the Democratic Party, as a vehicle to achieve their
strategic objective of harnessing government and corporate power to
impose acceptance of homosexual behavior,'' the groups told Bush,
adding that gay groups ``seek nothing less than the ability to
mandate teaching to schoolchildren that homosexuality is normal and
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The legal attack on the Boy Scouts is the most visible example
of where this agenda will lead if it is not firmly _ and actively _
opposed,'' the groups told Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday heard arguments in a case
sparked by the Boy Scouts' expulsion of a New Jersey leader who is
gay.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's foray into gay issues also comes as some conservative
groups are angered over the Vermont Legislature's approval this
week of marriage-like ``gay unions,'' and shortly before Sunday's
``Millennium March'' in Washington that is expected to attract
300,000 supporters of gay rights. Organizers hope the rally will
highlight the issue in a presidential election year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has tried to reach out to gay voters without embracing
their positions.
</P>
<P>
   After his meeting with the gay Republicans, Bush said his
message to conservatives upset about the session would be, ``I
welcome gay Americans into my campaign. ... But I want the
conservative Republicans to understand that we judge people based
upon their heart and soul, and while we disagree on gay marriage,
for example, we agree on a lot of other issues and it's important
for people to hear that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he was a ``better person'' for having met with the gay
Republicans, and that their life stories were ``very compelling.''
Though he said he welcomed gay voters into his campaign, Bush
reiterated his opposition to initiatives of importance to that
community, including same-sex marriages, adoptions by gay couples
and expanding anti-hate crime laws to treat homosexuals in the same
manner as racial and ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting upset some conservative Republicans, including
former presidential contender Gary Bauer who said it ``elevated the
gay rights agenda to a level of recognition within the Republican
Party that contradicts our long-standing commitment to pro-family
values.''
</P>
<P>
   In their letter to Bush, the conservative groups, including the
Family Research Council, the American Family Association and
Concerned Women for America, indicated that they agree with Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will find that homosexual activists will not be satisfied
with the civil rights all Americans enjoy. They do not want
tolerance; that's what they have. They demand acceptance of their
lifestyle and protection for their practices. This will devastate
family life and wholly undermine your plans to restore the morale
of our military,'' the groups told Bush.

NORMAL LIFE SPAN EXPECTED FOR CLONED COWS, RESEARCHERS REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass.)  By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cloned cows have youthful cells and should live at least as long
as ordinary animals, say researchers at Advanced Cell Technology, a
company interested in using cloning to treat human disease and
extend life.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, reported in Friday's issue of Science, is
significant because tests of Dolly, the cloned sheep, had shown
that the tips of her chromosomes, known as telomeres, were
unusually short, suggesting a severe and possibly life-shortening
drawback in the cloning process. Telomeres get shorter each time a
cell divides, so are shorter in the body cells of older animals.
</P>
<P>
   Cells with longer telomeres can divide more often and live
longer than normal. But no one yet knows if longer telomeres will
increase lifespan in whole organisms. If they do, the cloned cows
``could be the longest lived cows on the planet,'' said Dr. Robert
P. Lanza, lead author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   Michael D. West, the chief executive of Advanced Cell
Technology, hopes to develop methods of creating replacement
tissues by cloning a patient's cells. The fear that such tissues
would have short telomeres and abbreviated lifetime now seems
dispelled by the news from the cloned cows, and makes Dolly's case
appear to be an unexplained anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   The essence of the cloning process is that the nucleus of an
adult cell is reprogrammed to its embryonic state by the cytoplasm,
or inner fluids, of an egg cell. The process is ethically fraught
because cloning a patient's cell would create an entity with the
same potential as a fertilized human egg. The patient's
reprogrammed cell would be merely cultured in glassware, however,
and used to produce replacement cells for failing organs.
</P>
<P>
   Because of problems with using human egg cells, Advanced Cell
Technology has been working with cow eggs. The company, based in
Worcester, Mass., created a stir 15 months ago when a researcher,
Dr. Jose Cibelli, produced a hybrid embryo by cloning some of his
own cells in cow eggs. The embryos were allowed to grow in
glassware for only a few cell divisions and the process was then
halted.
</P>
<P>
   The new experiment is encouraging with respect to the telomere
problem because the cow cells being cloned were old and had short
telomeres. Yet the calves seem more youthful than normal as judged
by various measures of cellular aging, and their telomeres are
longer than the usual.
</P>
<P>
   Cows live for more than 20 years, however, so the only quick way
to an answer about telomeres and lifespan will be with mice. Lanza
said that in serially-cloned mice generated by other researchers
the telomeres were getting longer at each generation.
</P>
<P>
   Xiangzhong Yang, a cloning expert at the University of
Connecticut, said that the finding of longer than normal telomeres
in the cloned cows ``is a really interesting observation'' which
would spark another wave of interest in cloning.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. Peter Mombaerts, a biologist at Rockefeller University,
noted that only one calf had been cloned for every 271 attempts,
and that the cloning process might have selected some specially
youthful class of cell.
</P>
<P>
   The inefficiency of the process is a general problem and one of
the obstacles facing Advanced Cell Technology's cloning plans. On
present evidence therapy would require hundreds of unfertilized
human egg cells, or oocytes, to successfully reprogram one skin
cell nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   The company's original idea of using cow oocytes for this task
is not as outlandish as such a cross-species hybrid might suggest,
because the human genes in the hybrid cell's nucleus would quickly
take over and generate human proteins to replace their bovine
counterparts. The major technical glitch is that cow mitochondria,
independent genetic entities that provide a cell's energy, are
probably incompatible with a human nucleus.
</P>
<P>
   Mombaerts said that a way round this roadblock would be to
isolate some of the patient's mitochondria and inject these into
the cow oocyte carrying the patient's skin cell nucleus. If the
human mitochondria survived, the hybrid cow-human cell should
become fully human as the cow proteins were replaced by natural
turnover.
</P>
<P>
   Another way round the oocyte problem would be to identify the
factors in the cytoplasm that make the skin cell's nucleus revert
to the embryonic state. Lanza said that the company was pursuing
this.
</P>
<P>
   The oocyte's factors that reset the telomere length might be of
particular interest in treating the many diseases, like cirrhosis
and AIDS, that require the body to replace stricken cells at a
furious and ultimately unsustainable rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that process is understood it could have enormous
implications for a whole class of diseases that account for
significant mortality worldwide,'' said Dr. Ronald A. DePinho, a
telomere expert at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. &QL;

STOOPS HOPES FOR IMPROVED RUNNING GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE JONES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The arrival of Oklahoma football coach Bob
Stoops and his high-octane passing offense was one of the
highlights of the 1999 Big 12 football season.
</P>
<P>
   Stoops did away with the Sooners' traditional ground game for a
lively passing game _ with good results. OU averaged 36.8 points
and 427 yards total offense per game on the way to a 7-4
regular-season record and a berth in the Independence Bowl, where
the Sooners lost to Mississippi, 27-25. But good can always be
better, as Stoops pointed out yesterday while visiting with members
of the OU Club of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Stoops said he was not concerned about the lack of a consistent
running game to complement quarterback Josh Heupel's passing. But
he conceded he would like to see the Sooners improve on last
season's last-place standing among conference rushing attacks
(105.5 yards per game).
</P>
<P>
   ``The running game is not a concern,'' Stoops said. ``You'd be
concerned if you didn't score any points. But \Rthe running game\S
is something we're continually trying to develop, an area we want
to improve in. That was a part of \Rspring training\S we worked
hard on.''
</P>
<P>
   Freshman running backs Quenton Griffin and Seth Littrell return.
But there is a great deal of anticipation regarding three backs who
will report in August _ freshmen Brian Odom, Jerald Estus and
Renaldo Works.
</P>
<P>
   Odom has attracted the most attention. A 6-foot, 195-pound back
out of Ada, Okla., Odom was regarded as the premier high school
running back in Oklahoma last season as he set school records for
career rushing (5,918 yards), total offense (6,379 yards) and
touchdowns (98).
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of anticipation about all three,'' Stoops said.
``All of them are good running backs. Strong, with good speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the defensive focus during spring training was on
replacing three starters in the secondary. But Stoops said he likes
the work he saw in that area and feels good about being able to
match next season's great expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everywhere across the board we have a chance to be better than
the year before because players have more experience in our system,
a better understanding of what we're asking them to do, Stoops
said. / nn

STATES SEEK UNANIMITY IN SUPPORT OF PROPOSED SPLIT OF MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On the eve of the filing deadline, many of the 19
state attorneys general who are part of the antitrust suit against
the Microsoft Corp. were lobbying and cajoling a handful of their
colleagues Thursday to join the majority and ask the court to break
Microsoft into two parts.
</P>
<P>
   A few attorneys general view this remedy proposal, favored by
the Justice Department and most of the states involved, as too
extreme. But the others fear that a fractured decision could harm
the government's case and give power to any Microsoft argument that
not even the plaintiffs agree on this remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Klein, an assistant attorney general in Utah, said, ``The
more the final result represents a joint view, the more influence
it has.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eliot L. Spitzer, the attorney general for New York, was
bullish, saying: ``We have a great deal of support, and though
there may be a few who disagree, I don't think it includes any of
the major states that have been involved in this case. We are
absolutely convinced that this is the right approach to the
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The joint federal-state plan calls for breaking Microsoft into
two separate and competing companies. One would own the Windows
operating system, and the other everything else _ including the
company's Web browser, word processing and spreadsheet software and
Internet properties.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal also includes a range of restrictions on conduct
that would stay in place a short time if the breakup is implemented
and a longer time if it is not. The key states behind the suit have
been New York, Connecticut, Iowa, California and Wisconsin, and
Spitzer said all of them were strongly behind the joint proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Among the possible opponents, attention is centered on Betty D.
Montgomery, the attorney general of Ohio, and the two other
Republicans among the 19: Carla J. Stovall of Kansas and Jim Ryan
of Illinois. Other state officials said the three attorneys general
had been opposed to the majority view, but that could not be
confirmed. All three offices declined to comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General J. Joseph Curran Jr. of Maryland has also
expressed public doubts about breaking up Microsoft. But his
office, too, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The judge has made it clear that he would prefer to have a
single proposal from the plaintiffs but would accept a second
opinion if the federal government and the majority of the states
could not agree. He has never expressed an interest in receiving a
minority opinion from the states.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Microsoft has made much of divisions between the
partners in the lawsuit. The company blamed disagreements between
state and federal officials for the breakdown of settlement talks
early this month _ a charge all of the government officials denied.

<P>
   In a letter to Microsoft shareholders this month, William H.
Gates, Microsoft's chairman, wrote, ``The Department of Justice and
the states could not agree among themselves on what they should
seek from Microsoft, rendering a settlement all but impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   While the negotiations with the holdout attorneys general
continued, Spitzer railed at Microsoft's leaders for recent public
statements and said they reinforced the view that remedies intended
to modify Microsoft's conduct were unlikely to work.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last week, both Gates and Steven A. Ballmer,
Microsoft's chief executive, have said in interviews that the
company ``has done absolutely nothing wrong,'' as Gates put it, and
has no intention of changing its business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer said: ``Implicit in a conduct remedy is the notion that
the individual understands the nature of his misconduct and will
abide by the structure of the remedies that are imposed. But when
you see these statements that fundamentally reject the ruling of
the court, I am hard pressed to see how a conduct remedy would
work.''
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, said: ``We believe our
responses have been consistent from Day 1 of this lawsuit to today
_ that our actions are good for consumers and good for competition.
If new rules come into play after this decision has been reviewed
by the court of appeals, we will abide by them. But in the
meantime, this decision is yet to be reviewed, and we think we have
a strong case for appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   As the plaintiffs were concluding their consultations Thursday,
four leading academic economists filed a long and detailed legal
brief with the trial judge in the case, Thomas Penfield Jackson,
arguing that remedies that simply modify Microsoft's conduct do not
make sense from an economic point of view.
</P>
<P>
   The economists have no direct connection with Microsoft or the
government in this case. They are William D. Nordhaus of Yale
University, Roger G. Noll of Stanford, F. Michael Scherer of
Harvard and Robert E. Litan of the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   They say ``this case provides an important test of how antitrust
law and remedies should be applied in the `new economy''' and add
that conduct remedies ``would be the least disruptive of all the
options'' but are also ``the least likely to remedy the core
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The economists say the proposed state-federal remedy is the
minimum that is required but add that it fails to break the Windows
monopoly. They call for ``monopoly dissolution'' by splitting the
operating system company into three competing entities.
</P>
<P>
   Litan, a former senior Justice Department official, organized
the effort to prepare the brief, and its recommendation is the one
he has been making in public for months.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Conceptual art, with its emphasis on language, ideas
and performance rather than fixed visual imagery, is nothing if not
ephemeral. Its best friend is the still or video camera, which
records and saves it for posterity. When Conceptual art came along
in the 1960s, with its idealistic aim of emphasizing art as notion
or process rather than product, Conceptual photography naturally
sprang up as its handmaiden. Both joined the more traditional
categories of painting, sculpture, printmaking and such as part of
the contemporary art repertory.
</P>
<P>
   In the show ``Postmedia: Conceptual Photography in the
Guggenheim Museum's Permanent Collection,'' the museum considers
the ways in which the cool Conceptualist radicals of the '60s and
'70s used photography to ``extend and transgress'' the boundaries
of more conventional art. The words in quotation marks are those of
Nancy Spector, curator of contemporary art at the Guggenheim, who
assembled this well-displayed show of works by 12 artists. Some are
part of the big Conceptual and Minimalist haul acquired in 1990
from the Italian collector Giuseppe Panza di Buomo; others are more
recent acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   As classified by Spector, the categories in the show include the
use of photography to record ephemeral or durational events; to
document art created outside gallery confines; to show the serial
patterns created by architecture and industry; to capture
performance and body art; and to make connections between image and
text. Like a festival of old films, the exhibition brings back some
classics of the era, from Joseph Kosuth's and Robert Barry's
explorations into the linguistic basis of art to the performer
Marina Abramovic's aggressive attacks on her own body as a kind of
spiritual purgation.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, despite the unkind views of some critics who
dismiss Conceptual art as more to be read than looked at, this is a
useful exhibition. Some of the work seems even more boring and
obsessive-compulsive today than it did back then, notably the
anti-object ``Duration'' and ``Location'' pieces of Douglas Huebler
(1924-1997), in which actions or events were mapped out in terms of
stated time frames. (In a 1970 project carried out in Paris, a
multi-part walk of one hour's duration as measured by Greenwich
Mean Time was documented by 12 photographs; each leg of the walk
was accomplished in half the time of that preceding it, starting
with a stroll of 30 minutes and ending in one lasting .0087
seconds.)
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, several works by the Dutch artist Jan Dibbets
are arrestingly visual, among them ``The Shortest Day of 1970
Photographed in My House Every Six Minutes.'' Mounted in a
filmstrip format, the photographs, taken from a fixed point through
the windows of his house, show the progress of the day in terms of
light from dawn to the descent of darkness, a majestic process that
only a camera could narrate.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Smithson (1938-1973), best known for his rugged site
piece ``Spiral Jetty'' (1970), a man-made curlicue of rocks and
earth in a remote corner of the Great Salt Lake in Utah made
viewable through film and photographs, is represented here by two
lesser endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   One that seems today to have a high quotient of so-whatness is
``Yucatan Mirror Displacement'' (1969), involving the installation
of foot-square mirrors at various sites on the Yucatan peninsula to
give different twists to the landscape, shown here in a series of
photographs that accompanied a fantastical travelogue Smithson
wrote for the magazine Artforum of that year.
</P>
<P>
   More interesting is his witty ``Hotel Palenque'' (1969), an
informal slide talk on a run-down tourist hostelry in Palenque,
Mexico, that was in a simultaneous state of decay and
rehabilitation. In his discourse, given to students at the
University of Utah in 1972 and replayed here, Smithson, in whose
art the notion of entropy played a crucial role, examines the
crumbling structure as if it were a Mayan ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural critiques were also made by Gordon Matta-Clark
(1943-1978) and Dan Graham. Operating on a grand scale, Matta-Clark
sliced up abandoned buildings as a form of social-architectural
protest. Among his several works here is ``Conical Intersect''
(1975), an attack on urban gentrification by means of a huge gaping
circle cut through two adjacent 17th-century buildings near the
Pompidou Center in Paris. This grand sculptural gesture, if you
will, is memorialized in photographs of a view of the hole and the
streetscape seen through it. But it and other photographs can only
hint at the disorienting experience of actually entering one of the
artist's deconstructions.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Graham's quarrel with architecture focused on the white
Bauhaus cube that he saw as the source of a sterile seriality in
the American landscape and its reverberations in Minimalist
sculpture. In ``Back Porches, Marin County CA/`Ziggurat' Skyscraper
N.Y.'' (1974 and 1967) he juxtaposed the cookie-cutter repetition
of contemporary row housing with that of windows on the facade of a
New York skyscraper, a comment on the conforming formalism of an
architecture increasingly less responsive to the human need for
idiosyncracy.
</P>
<P>
   In true Conceptual spirit was the work of Ana Mendieta
(1948-1985), a Cuban exile who brought Afro-Cuban and Santeria
ritual into more secular pursuits like Earthworks and performance
art. In her ``Silueta'' series (1973-1980) done in Iowa and Mexico,
Mendieta left traces of her own body on earth materials: bowers of
flowers, mud, tree branches and such, as seen in a group of
poignant photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Even more body-conscious than Mendieta was the dyed-in-the-wool
Conceptual artist Vito Acconci, whose ``Conversions II: Insistence,
Adaptation, Groundwork, Display'' (1971), documents a willful
feminization of himself by concealing his genitals between his
legs, the better to experience a genderless identity. A far cry
from these concerns is the Wordsworthian work of the English
long-distance walkers Richard Long and Hamish Fulton, two of the
most usual suspects in any Conceptual show, whose perambulations
over the globe are chronicled here in photographs.
</P>
<P>
   By no means a full-blown show of Conceptual photography, which
would have to include a much larger cast, ``Postmedia'' (not a
winner as a title) will do as an introduction to an art that still
raises questions of what art is about.

<P>
   Congress passed a bill allowing owners of some two million
American-registered cars brought illegally into Mexico to register
them in Mexico, for a fee. The bill awaits Senate consideration.
President Ernesto Zedillo criticized lawmakers who voted for the
law as pandering to owners of illegal vehicles two months before
general elections. But his government recently decreed a similar
measure legalizing American-registered pickup trucks, most owned by
governing-party supporters.

   Without promising to release her from prison, the opposition
presidential candidate Alejandro Toledo held open the possibility
of a legal appeal for Lori Berenson, the American convicted four
years ago of helping the Tupac Amaru group. In New York, Toledo
said that under judicial reforms he favors, Berenson's lawyers
would be allowed to present evidence that she was judged unfairly.
Berenson's parents say she was convicted in a sham proceeding.

COMMENTARY: GIULIANI'S NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GAIL COLLINS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was a time when politicians didn't talk about
illness. When President Grover Cleveland discovered he had cancer
of the jaw, he kept it secret by having the surgery performed in a
yacht bobbing off the coast of Massachusetts. John Kennedy always
denied he had Addison's disease.
</P>
<P>
   People in public life never acknowledged cancer. Even if they
succumbed, funeral homes tried to avoid giving the newspapers a
cause of death. People were terrified of it, and there was a
suspicion that the disease, or at least the bad luck of having
caught it, might be contagious.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's less likely to be concealed than liposuction. When Rudy
Giuliani called a press conference Thursday to report that he had
prostate cancer, City Comptroller Alan Hevesi quickly responded
with some reminiscences about his own surgery last year. A
prominent upstate Republican county executive called the mayor's
office to talk about his recent course of radiation treatment.
Giuliani said he'd already reached out to the Yankees' manager, Joe
Torre, another high-profile survivor.
</P>
<P>
   Prostate cancer, the bane of middle-aged males, is a
particularly curable, and common, affliction among public
personages. If you put all the well-known prostate cancer survivors
in one place, you'd have a celebrity golf tour. ``It's Bob Dole,
it's Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf,'' said Hevesi.
</P>
<P>
   There's every reason to hope that the mayor will be fine. He
seemed strong and in good spirits at his press conference Thursday.
``It's at a very, very early stage of the disease,'' he said, in a
very, very Giuliani comment. Lest the press corps suspect he was
softening, he took time out to denounce the Civil Rights Commission
_ a current critic of the city Police Department _ as ``an
embarrassment'' and ``a big joke.''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't follow the now-standard political route of
insisting that the disease would be nothing more than a minor
divergence in his life. He declined to vow that he would stay in
the race for the U.S. Senate. ``I think that my focus right now has
to be to figure out the best form of treatment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Most people who get cancer have a chance to deal with it in
private first. Hevesi, who intends to run for mayor himself next
year, had worked out a plan of treatment with his doctors before he
held a press conference to simultaneously announce that he was
sick, that he was going to be fine, and that his career would go on
as usual. Giuliani had no sooner gotten his diagnosis than he was
spotted by a reporter at the hospital, and it took only one news
cycle before he was forced to let the whole world in on his
condition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mayor has seemed off his game lately. He abruptly
canceled engagements with the ever-sensitive upstate Republicans in
order to go to the Yankees' home opener. He failed to visit the
family of a powerful politician whose father had died, and made
matters way, way worse by faxing a sympathy note. He seemed caught
off guard when his wife, an actress, announced she was taking a
part in ``The Vagina Monologues.'' He went over the top in his
comments on Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing like this kind of diagnosis to jolt the
subconscious, sending it careening off into new territory.
Giuliani, whose father died of prostate cancer, knew that the
results of his earlier tests had been iffy. On some level he must
have been trying to decide whether this Senate race is something he
really wants.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, despite his new standing as a no-longer-certain
candidate, the mayor seemed more intent on the campaign than he has
in weeks. He said he would be going through with a series of events
in upstate New York and a televised town hall meeting. He's going
to meet with the loopy state Independence Party, which is seeking a
candidate to endorse in November. The ad people are shooting
footage for more commercials.
</P>
<P>
   He's a feisty guy, and pushing ahead would be the typical
feisty-guy scenario. Politicians are supposed to keep moving ever
upward. As mayor, Giuliani is term-limited, and when one door
closes, you're supposed to grab for the next opening. But this bad
news may offer him an opportunity to decide if the Senate is where
he really wants to go.

COMMENTARY: I HAVE A DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Boldface `really' in 5th graf should be italicized.) 
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I had a dream that it all ended differently.
</P>
<P>
   I had a dream that Janet Reno never ordered a SWAT team to go to
the Miami home where Elian Gonzalez was being held, but instead
went by herself. She walked up to the front door, rang the
doorbell, asked for Elian and his relatives graciously handed him
over. Reno then drove to a waiting airplane and took Elian back to
his father in Washington D.C. It all ended so peacefully. And then
_ and this is where my dream turned scary _ Reno decided she wanted
to do something nice and normal for Elian, something kids and
parents like to do when they first visit Washington.
</P>
<P>
   So she took Elian to the National Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   And in my dream, just as they were walking out around 6 p.m.
Monday, Elian found himself in the middle of the shooting there.
Suddenly the poor boy found out what it really means to be
terrorized by people not just brandishing guns but firing them. He
found out what it's really like to be in the middle of a panic _
one that doesn't end with you being scooped up by a caring police
officer but ends with you cowering behind a trash can, looking out
at the bleeding bodies of seven kids sprawled across the entry of
our National Zoo, after being shot by a 16-year-old with a
9-millimeter handgun.
</P>
<P>
   In my dream, I despaired for Elian and all those kids, for they
had endured something that would  &UR; really  &LR; scar them for life. They
had gone to the zoo in a country without adequate gun control.
</P>
<P>
   When I awoke the next morning I heard Trent Lott, Tom DeLay and
Sen. Connie Mack (the king of pandering pols) all talking about how
horrified they were that guns had been brandished around children,
and I was so relieved. But then I realized that they weren't
talking about guns that were actually fired, guns that actually put
a bullet in a kid's head, guns that were in the hands of crazed
teen-agers who can buy them like candy bars thanks to Republican
opposition to gun control _ no, no, no. They were talking about
guns in the hands of U.S. marshals enforcing the laws of this land.
That's what outraged these Republicans, and they were going to hold
hearings to condemn it. Well, thanks a lot.
</P>
<P>
   You want to hold hearings about the ``horror'' of guns, Mr.
Lott? You want to hold hearings about the rights of kids, Mr. Mack?
How about holding hearings about our kids _ about the guns that
threaten their rights to visit our National Zoo in peace? That
wouldn't require expensive hearings by Lott, DeLay and Mack. That
would just require them to look in a mirror to find the solution.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the American people understand all this. God love
them. Every poll shows that two-thirds supported Reno in reuniting
Elian with his father and two-thirds see no reason for staged
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   What are those two-thirds telling us? They are telling us that
they know there is an ideological vacuum at the heart of the
Republican Party today. They know that ever since America's victory
in the Cold War _ a just crusade against an Evil Empire _ the
hard-core Republicans have been looking for a new enemy and a new
moral crusade. Unfortunately, they've decided it's the enemy within
_ the Evil Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican extremes use the same imagery against the
Clintons that they used against the Soviets _ brainwashing, black
helicopters, assassination plots and doctored photos. For them the
Elian case was a godsend, because it enabled them to hate Castro
and Clinton together _ the last Evil Empire working with the first
Evil Administration to harm a Cuban child. But most Americans don't
buy it.
</P>
<P>
   They know that if the Republican leadership really cared about
the Cuban people, they would be holding hearings about why our
40-year-old policy for ousting Castro hasn't worked. And if they
were really horrified about guns they would be holding hearings
about why our gun control laws haven't worked.
</P>
<P>
   That, though, would require real policies, some sense of
responsibility and some vision that goes beyond a dart board with
Clinton's and Castro's pictures on it. And that is precisely what
Lott, DeLay and Mack don't have. So they will turn Capitol Hill
into their own private national zoo, with their own kangaroo court,
and they will leave the real National Zoo, and those of us who
would like to visit it in peace, unprotected.

RETIREE'S BEACHFRONT HOME PLUNGES HER INTO LEGAL FIGHT AGAINST
TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>

c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ The owner of a resort house that ended up on
the public beach because of a tropical storm's erosion says she
will fight the state's efforts to make her move it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my attorney to tell them to go to hell in a bucket,''
retired real estate agent Jane Ebrom said Thursday. ``He is going
to counter their proposals. I'm not going to spend another dime on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Ebrom, who lives in nearby League City, said she can't afford to
comply with Attorney General John Cornyn's request that she move
the house off the beach within a year. It was left there because of
heavy erosion from Tropical Storm Francis in September 1998, less
than a year after she bought it.
</P>
<P>
   Ebrom said the Attorney General's Office has asked her to
reimburse the state $56,000 in legal costs. She said she already
has spent $14,000 complying with state demands that she remove a
bulkhead under the house and other materials from her property.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Brown, a spokeswoman for Cornyn, said the removal and
reimbursement are parts of a new proposal sent to Ebrom's attorney
as a possible settlement of a lawsuit. Cornyn's office sued for
removal of the house in an Austin court in October, Ebrom said.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, Cornyn said Ebrom's three-bedroom, two-bath
house in the Spanish Grant subdivision blocks public access to the
beach, Ebrom said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Gulf waters do creep all the way under her deck at high
tide, forcing people to pass under her home if they want to proceed
along the beach. Ebrom said she has had problems with people going
upstairs onto her deck.
</P>
<P>
   Ebrom's is one of more than 100 beachfront homes the Texas
General Land Office determined to be on the public beach after the
1998 storm's high tides and battering waves chewed away at the
Brazoria and Galveston county shorelines for two days. Under the
Texas Open Beaches Act, a structure is considered to be on the
public beach and subject to a state lawsuit for removal if erosion
leaves it seaward of the natural vegetation line.
</P>
<P>
   The 1959 Open Beaches Act was designed to give the public
unfettered access to Texas beaches.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said Ebrom is the only owner Cornyn's office has sued for
removal of a beach home.
</P>
<P>
   Some owners have moved other homes that were undermined by the
storm. Many homes remain partially on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   Since Francis struck, Ebrom said, the vegetation line has crept
back seaward to the point where only about half of her house is on
the public beach.
</P>
<P>
   Until Francis struck, she said, she was able to rent the house
for $1,500 a week when she and her family weren't using it.
</P>
<P>
   Ebrom said it would cost $50,000 or more to move the house and
more than that to buy another lot. Despite her experience, she said
she would want another first-row lot, which would have the greatest
exposure to erosive storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's an addiction,'' she said. ``Once you've had a
front-row lot, are you really going to be content to look at
someone else's back?''
</P>
<P>
   Ebrom said she paid $40,000 for the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought it for my grandbaby and for an eventual retirement
home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just really feel it's a true invasion,'' she said of
Cornyn's proposal. ``They say this is in the public interest.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani announced on Thursday that he
had prostate cancer in an early treatable form. He said he hoped to
continue his campaign for U.S. Senate, but would not make any
political decisions about the race until he had settled on a course
of treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said blood tests he had two weeks ago showed possible
evidence of cancer. A biopsy early Wednesday morning at Mount Sinai
Hospital confirmed that diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that there are lots of possible options,''
Giuliani said at a packed and hastily arranged morning news
conference at City Hall. The mayor, who seemed relaxed and
lighthearted throughout his 20-minute appearance said his choices
included radiation, hormone therapy, surgery or a combination of
those options. He added that he and his doctors would make a
decision about his treatment within the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Although word of Giuliani's condition began to leak out
Wednesday night, his announcement stunned many New Yorkers and set
off expressions of sympathy, including one from Hillary Rodham
Clinton, but also furious speculation about how the cancer would
affect his campaign. Giuliani did little to dispel the sudden
confusion on the political landscape by offering equivocal comments
on his desire to run for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that I'd be able to run, but the choice that I'm going
to make about treatment is going to be contingent upon the
treatment that gives me the best opportunity to have a full and
complete cure,'' he said. ``And then after I determine that, then I
will figure out, does it make sense this year, or doesn't it, or
whatever.'' He added that ``I don't think it's fair to answer
questions about the Senate race right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats and Republicans suggested that this could be an
opportunity, if the mayor wished, to withdraw from the race,
particularly since Giuliani has run a fairly relaxed campaign so
far and recently canceled a number of trips upstate, where some
polls show him running behind Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly if he wanted to, this would be an understandable way
out,'' said George Arzt, a Democratic political consultant. ``But I
strongly believe that he's going to stay in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's campaign said on Thursday that he would go as planned
to Saratoga Springs and Buffalo this weekend. One close adviser at
City Hall added that Giuliani's comments were more rooted in his
intense superstitions, and that the mayor did not want to tempt
fate by proclaiming that he would run for Senate no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke to the mayor by phone on Thursday while
campaigning in the Finger Lakes district and wished him a speedy
recovery,'' according to her press secretary, Howard Wolfson. The
mayor, who has been sharply critical of both Mrs. Clinton and the
Clinton administration in recent weeks, said, ``Thank you,''
according to Wolfson. The conversation, Wolfson said, lasted one
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made this statement earlier in the day: ``Like all New
Yorkers, my prayers and best wishes are with the mayor for a full
and speedy recovery and I hope that everyone joins me in wishing
him well.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's wife, Donna Hanover, an actress and television
personality who maintains a separate public life from the mayor,
issued this written statement on Thursday: ``I'm very optimistic
about Rudy's recovery. We have discussed this and I will be very
supportive of him in dealing with the choices he has to make. It
would be appreciated if he is given the maximum opportunity
possible to deal with this privately.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, who announced that he was feeling ``great'' and that
he had had his ``normal four hours' sleep'' the night before, said
that he had told his family about the prostate cancer and explained
it to them ``pretty much the same way I just did now.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he first learned that he had cancer from his
doctor, Alexander M. Kirschenbaum of Mount Sinai Medical Center,
when Kirschenbaum called the mayor on Wednesday afternoon and told
him that his biopsy results were positive. ``I keep getting
positive and negative mixed up,'' Giuliani said. ``I kind of think
of negative as bad and positive as good. So when he told me it was
positive, it took me a second to figure out, `Oh, gee, that's not
so good.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani also said that ``I kind of expected it, you know?''
Asked about his emotional health at the moment, he termed it simply
``O.K.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was more expansive when he was asked about his father,
Harold, who died of prostate cancer at the age of 73. ``It brings
up very painful memories,'' he said. ``And, you know, I miss my
father every day of my life. And he's a _ he's a very, very
important reason for why I'm standing here as the mayor of New York
City.'' His father's illness, the mayor added, was the reason he
made sure to have regular blood tests to screen for elevated levels
of prostate-specific antigens, or PSA. Giuliani said his last PSA
test was ``a couple of years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Giuliani's most recent PSA tests, done twice in the last
two weeks, that turned up possible evidence of cancer. Then a
biopsy of Giuliani's prostate on Wednesday, the mayor said,
``revealed that several of the samples _ thank goodness not all and
not most _ had indications of cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the diagnosis had made an impact on his values in life,
Giuliani replied, ``Absolutely, sure.'' He added that ``just the
contemplation of it for the last two weeks makes you think about
what's important in life and what are the most important things.
But you know, you should be thinking about that anyway. It just
reminds you to think about what you should be thinking about. But
do I have an answer yet? No, I don't have an answer yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani then laughed, as he did several times during his news
conference. He was also unusually warm to a reporter who frequently
incenses him, Rafael Martinez Alequin, the publisher of The Free
Press, a sporadically printed tabloid that is harshly critical of
the mayor. When Alequin, who has had gastric cancer, told the mayor
at the briefing that ``there is life after cancer,'' Giuliani
replied, ``I know that. And thank you. And thank you for saying
that.''

BELFOUR TUNES OUT TAUNTING

By CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Since his arrest March 8, Stars goalie Ed
Belfour has eight victories, 345 saves and a big hearing loss.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour has been a target in opposing arenas forever, but his
arrest on suspicion of assault and resisting arrest last month at
The Mansion on Turtle Creek has provided opposing fans with new
ammunition. He has had to deflect as many jokes as pucks since.
</P>
<P>
   Do you hear what he hears?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty focused on the game itself, and I don't pay too
much attention to what is going on in the crowds,'' Belfour said
yesterday. ``I think it's just part of being a goalie. It's always
been that way.''
</P>
<P>
   During the Western Conference quarterfinals in Edmonton, Belfour
had the last laugh with a 4-3 victory in Game 4 that allowed the
Stars to wrap up the best-of-seven series three nights later in
Dallas. Belfour gave up 11 goals and made 102 saves in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see anything worse than it was in Edmonton,'' Stars
coach Ken Hitchcock said. ``If he can get by that scene in
Edmonton, he can get by anything. The whole atmosphere was almost
at times chaotic. It was volatile. It was emotional. He handled it
with no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, San Jose could be worse.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour knows the way to San Jose. He also knows the way out of
San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour took advantage of free agency in 1997 and fled the
struggling Sharks for a chance to play for a contender. He rejected
a three-year, $10.5 million deal from the Sharks, who had
surrendered three players to acquire him at the trade deadline.
Instead, he called the Stars and offered to take $500,000 less to
play in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Sharks fans have never forgiven him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the fans in San Jose have always been really loud
there and really support their team,'' said Belfour, who was 3-9 in
his short stint with the Sharks. ``Every time I've come back there,
they've always been hard on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour is 4-6-1 against the Sharks since coming to Dallas,
including 1-3 this season. He played in only one of three games at
San Jose Arena this season, a 5-2 loss on April 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will have a challenge ahead of him to see if he can
maintain his competitive focus on the road,'' Hitchcock said. ``For
us to win in San Jose, he has to be a key player. That's a
challenge he will have to meet head on.''
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, 35, is hoping to hear only the sound of silence next
week when the series moves to San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``It definitely makes it more satisfying when you have good
games in buildings where the fans are really on you,'' he said. ``I
like challenges, and I like to play my best in those types of
games.''

HACHETTE WILL CLOSE MIRABELLA MAGAZINE WITH JUNE ISSUE  
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jack Kliger, the chief executive of Hachette
Filipacchi Magazines, announced Thursday that he would close
Mirabella magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabella is aimed at women who are no longer 24 years old and
who care passionately about literary criticism and serious articles
about, say, contemporary philosophers _ and equally as passionately
about where to buy adorable hot-pink flared leather pants.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, there may not be enough women in the world who
care about both contemporary philosophers and hot-pink leather
pants to guarantee a magazine's success.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the staff and in a statement released Thursday,
Kliger cited the continuing lack of advertiser support as the
reason for closing the magazine. The last issue will be dated
June/July.
</P>
<P>
   The demise had been long rumored at the magazine, most ardently
since early 1999, when Hachette reduced the magazine's publication
schedule from monthly to 10 times a year. Several staff members
have resigned recently, including the magazine's publisher, who was
never replaced _ a signal to staff members, several of them said
earlier this week, that the magazine would be folded. This week,
staff members lunched had lunch together and speculated about how
many weekly cycles they had left on their paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine employs about 40 people. Hachette is offering
severance packages that editorial employees described as
surprisingly generous; the company is also trying to place the
employees in other Hachette magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine's editor in chief since April 1997, Roberta Myers,
did not return a call for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabella's first issue appeared in May 1989, but the origins of
the magazine date to 1988, when Grace Mirabella _ who had been one
of the most powerful editors of women's magazines _ was dismissed
as editor in chief of Vogue. After Mirabella left Vogue, Rupert
Murdoch asked her to create a magazine. The magazine did not make
money for News Corp., nor did it turn a profit after Hachette
purchased it in 1995. Hachette is a unit of Lagardere.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabella's advertising pages and revenue have both dropped
dramatically in the last year. Ad pages have declined 48.8 percent
from 134 pages between January and March of 1999 to 68.6 pages for
the first three months of this year, according to the Publishers
Information Bureau. Revenue is down by 43 percent for the same
period, from a reported $5.5 million to $3.1 million, the bureau
said.
</P>
<P>
   It is not lack of advertising alone that led to Mirabella's
demise. The magazine has been dwarfed in the last year by the
success of other women's magazines, such as Meredith Corp.'s More
magazine, a monthly beauty and fashion title also aimed at older
women and that has a more single-minded editorial voice.
</P>
<P>
   Mirabella's newsstand sales have dropped dramatically in recent
months. For the six-month period ended Dec. 31, 1999, newsstand
sales _ often considered the best measure of a magazine's vitality
and its ability to capture consumer attention _ dropped by 39
percent, to an average of 80,790 copies a month from an average of
134,292 a month, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. The
magazine had not raised its rate base _ the circulation guaranteed
to advertisers _ since 1995, and circulation had not moved from
about 550,000 since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising executives said that the editorial mix of the
magazine was never coherent. Roberta Garfinkle, director of print
advertising at McCann-Erickson, said that she was not surprised
Hachette was closing the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``It vacillated between being a serious journalistic magazine, a
serious read, and a beauty and fashion magazine, and first it was
older, then it was younger, then it was a combination thereof,''
she said. ``For lack of desire or interest, and I do not know
which, Hachette was never able to invest the money or the time to
make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Garfinkle also added that the marketing dollars that Hachette
has invested in George ate away at Mirabella's chances for
survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hachette decided that with the money invested in George they
cannot be all things to all people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview earlier this week, Kliger said of his investing
in George magazine: ``I don't think our other children feel
neglected. Each one of them will have their time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mirabella, who still retains the title of founder on the
Mirabella masthead, said Thursday that she was disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A magazine has to have a focus and stay with it,'' she said.
``I don't think you can dilute it or water down its vision, and
that is what happened.''  &QL;

 &HT;    Encephalitis watch begins in Florida
 &HT;    By Sanjay Bhatt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ As the season for encephalitis
approaches, Florida public health workers are setting up
surveillance for the mosquito-borne West Nile encephalitis virus.
</P>
<P>
   The Palm Beach County Health Department will begin drawing blood
biweekly from ``sentinel'' chickens on May 22 and ship it to a
state laboratory for testing, said Jack Petenbrink, who coordinates
the county program. Chickens are used to monitor the prevalence of
encephalitis viruses because the mosquitoes that spread them feed
on birds.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists will examine the blood for signs of the viruses that
cause St. Louis, Eastern Equine and West Nile encephalitis _ which
often cause headache and fatigue, and in rare cases, coma and
death. St. Louis encephalitis affects people. The Eastern Equine
variety usually sickens horses, but occasionally occurs in other
animals, such as emus, and people, Petenbrink said. West Nile virus
can affect people, horses and birds.
</P>
<P>
   This year will be the first season county health workers
routinely test chicken blood for West Nile virus, he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's because West Nile virus had not been reported in the
United States until August; in the late summer and fall, 61 cases
of severe infection and seven deaths were reported in the New York
area, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials have been concerned that infected birds might
spread the West Nile virus if they migrated from New York. In
October, an infected bird was found in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have any indication it's reached Florida yet,''
Petenbrink said.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus has killed crows, some sparrows and
predatory birds such as hawks and eagles.
</P>
<P>
   People get infected most commonly through mosquito bites. After
a mosquito bites a bird, the virus moves into the bug's salivary
glands, where it stays until the mosquito bites again.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the West Nile virus has had only one impact on the
county: The U.S. Equestrian Team is moving trials to pick the
Olympic dressage team from New Jersey to nearby Loxahatchee.
Organizers feared a repeat of last year, when the European Union
closed its borders to horses from the Northeast, where at least
nine infected horses died.
</P>
<P>
   Florida typically has very few cases of St. Louis encephalitis.
But cases can number in the hundreds during an outbreak. In 1990,
223 cases and 13 deaths were reported. A 1997 outbreak resulted in
nine cases with one death.

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Ridley Scott
directing scenes from ``Gladiator.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    In a Hollywood that thrives on the assembly-line production of
standardized mediocrity, Ridley Scott takes chances.
 &HT;    His flair for stunning visual imagery and his knack for casting
has earned the director a cult following for such films as the
original ``Alien'' (l979), ``Blade Runner'' (l982) and ``Thelma and
Louise'' (l991). And at 62 he's still taking risks _ he's soon to
tackle ``Hannibal,'' the controversial sequel to ``The Silence of
the Lambs'' (l991).
 &HT;    But his current film may be his biggest gamble, as he turns back
the clock to Hollywood's toga-and-sandals era for his new, $100
million epic, ``Gladiator,'' which will open May 5.
 &HT;    At the center of this extravagant, spectacular and at times even
elegant movie is Australian actor Russell Crowe, who plays Maximus,
a Roman general sold into slavery by his enemies and forced to
become a human killing machine to survive ... and to seek revenge
on those who murdered his wife and child.
 &HT;    The British-born Scott, with a mop of untidy ginger hair and a
graying beard, sits in a suite at Los Angeles' Century Plaza Hotel,
puffing on a fat cigar and looking rumpled after a long day of
interviews. Outwardly, at least, he seems unconcerned about how
audiences will respond to his vision of the greatest empire of them
all.
 &HT;    Gladiator movies enjoy a somewhat-less-than-exalted place in
Hollywood history. It's been 35 years since the genre died a
natural death, strangled by its own grandiosity. In recent years,
Biblical and historical epics have been primarily relegated to the
less-prestigious terrain of network miniseries and cable movies.
 &HT;    But Scott says he has fond memories of a childhood spent
watching those dust-and-glory sagas in his northern-England
hometown of Northumberland.
 &HT;    ```Spartacus' was 40 years ago,'' he says, ``and `Ben-Hur'
before that. Those movies were part of my cinema-going youth, but
at the dawn of a new millennium I thought this might be the ideal
time to revisit what may have been the most important period of the
last 2,000 years, if not in all of recorded history _ the apex and
the beginning of the decline of the greatest military and political
power the world has ever known.''
 &HT;    Scott, whose dark, apocalyptic ``Blade Runner'' is, for its
fans, the definitive vision of the future, is hoping that
``Gladiator'' will do the same for the past, imposing a sense of
realistic depth on the glory that was Rome.
 &HT;    His secret weapon in that effort is Crowe, best known for his
Oscar-nominated role as the paunchy, middle-aged title character in
``The Insider'' (l999) and as a maverick Los Angeles cop in ``L.A.
Confidential'' (l997).
 &HT;    Actually, Mel Gibson was Scott's first choice _ ``I'm too old
for the part, mate,'' Gibson reportedly told him. But Crowe dropped
50 pounds to become the lean, mean Roman fighting machine Scott
needed to play Maximus. Most important, perhaps, is that the
Australian actor has the chops to play the role without the stagey
histrionics that marred so many earlier Hollywood epics.
 &HT;    Another piece of offbeat casting was Scott's choice of Joaquin
Phoenix to play the evil, foppish Emperor Commodus, who takes the
Roman throne after throttling his aged father Marcus Aurelius
(Richard Harris).
 &HT;    If neither actor is whom you'd think of first for the role _ or
whom they'd think of, since Scott reports that, ``When we offered
him the part, the most surprised person was Joaquin himself'' _
chances are it will work out. Scott has long been known for his eye
for up-and-coming actors.
 &HT;    After all, he was the one who cast Sigourney Weaver in her
career-making role as Lt. Ripley in ``Alien.'' When he was looking
for a young actor to play a raffish hitchhiker in ``Thelma and
Louise,'' he picked an new face named Brad Pitt.
 &HT;    The Oscar-nominated Crowe is hardly in the ``unknown'' category,
but Scott says he's had his eye on him ever since the Australian
actor starred in ``Romper Stomper'' (l992) as an ultra-violent,
neo-Nazi skinhead.
 &HT;    ``When I see a good performance,'' Scott says, ``I think I'll
work with that person at some point. And sometimes they go away and
sometimes they keep coming. Russell keeps coming _ he's a big star,
and this part could easily have swamped him. But it didn't. He's a
very smart man.''
 &HT;    Crowe already has a reputation for being a perfectionist who can
drive directors to distraction, and Scott admits that he and the
actor had their ups and downs during filming.
 &HT;    Which, he says, was fine with him.
 &HT;    ``We're both similar down-to-earth, no-bull guys,'' he says.
``And I don't mind the perfectionism as long as it's for all the
right reasons, which his are. The nicest thing of all is that he
loves the finished movie.''
 &HT;    The film has an extraordinary visual sumptuousness. Scott's army
of craftsmen used state-of-the-art computer graphics, while his set
designers journeyed to the island nation of Malta to re-create
Rome's legendary Colosseum for the arena scenes. The film literally
had a cast of thousands, with 2,000 extras being
computer-supplemented by another 33,000.
 &HT;    Scott's background in design _ he was among the first of a
generation of directors who came from backgrounds in the visual
arts or advertising rather than from theater or movies _ serves
this film particularly well. A graduate of London's Royal College
of Art, he began by directing television commercials before making
his movie debut with the eye-catching, stylish ``The Duellists''
(l977).
 &HT;    In l984 he returned to advertising to direct one of the most
talked-about commercials of all time, ``1984,'' a George
Orwell-inspired ad which heralded the arrival of Apple's MacIntosh
computer. Shown only once, during the Super Bowl, it remains
influential to this day.
 &HT;    Like most directors, Scott has had his spotty periods, including
the Tom Cruise fantasy ``Legend'' (l985), the Japanese cop drama
``Black Rain'' (1989), the Columbus movie ``1492: Conquest of
Paradise'' (l992) and ``G.I. Jane'' (l997), which starred Demi
Moore as the first female Navy SEAL.
 &HT;    Still, Scott is a one-of-a-kind director, and expectations are
high for ``Hannibal.'' The task of taking over from Jonathan Demme,
who directed ``The Silence of the Lambs,'' was bound to be a
thankless one _ the original won Oscars for Best Actor (Anthony
Hopkins), Best Actress (Jodie Foster), Best Picture and Best
Director _ but if anyone can do it, Hollywood insiders say, Scott
might be the one.
 &HT;    The job got even more challenging, however, when Foster decided
to pass on reprising her role as FBI Agent Clarice Starling. Though
Hopkins will be back as that attractive nasty Hannibal Lecter, the
role of Clarice will be filled instead by Julianne Moore.
 &HT;    ``I think two things happened with Jodie,'' Scott says. ``She
suddenly got a film going she had wanted to direct for some time _
or maybe she thought she didn't want to go back to where she was 10
years ago. That's fair enough, and I respect it.''
 &HT;    The Hollywood rumor mill says that Foster also disliked Thomas
Harris' novel and didn't think it would make a good movie. Scott
doesn't entirely disagree, and notes that he and the reclusive
Harris have already spent a considerable amount of time working on
the script.
 &HT;    ``We weren't quite happy with a few things,'' the director says,
``including the final act. Harris spent nine years writing this
book, so we all sat down for five days _ because his mind is a
filing cabinet of information _ until we had a script we were happy
with.
 &HT;    ``Tom was very open about everything and said, `I know it's 600
pages and must be distilled to 110 pages.' And that's what we've
done.''

 &HT;    Braves achieve The Perfect Stand
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Surely, there have been better and more critical
homestands. England in World War II, for instance. Yet in a purely
baseball sense, this was The Perfect Stand.
</P>
<P>
   Perfection that strained credulity.
</P>
<P>
   ''I would say you can't sweep a nine-game homestand,'' insisted
Braves president Stan Kasten. ''It can't be done. I don't believe
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ya gotta believe.
</P>
<P>
   Hanging on for a 6-3 victory over Los Angeles on Thursday, the
Braves completed their most successful homestand ever, sweeping
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and the Dodgers in three game sets.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Milwaukee, the Braves swept seven-game homestands in
1963 and '65. These Braves, in winning their 10th straight overall
and team record 11th in a row at home, became the first
major-league team to go unbeaten in a homestand of at least nine
games since May 1993, when the Dodgers also went 9-0.
</P>
<P>
   ''An unbelievable homestand,'' manager Bobby Cox said after a
third straight strong start from Terry Mulholland, a three-run home
run from Chipper Jones and another ninth-inning high-wire escape by
John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are unbeaten since Rocker came off the suspended list
and are three games short of the team record for consecutive
victories. Atlanta won 13 straight in 1982 and 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ''Awesome,'' said Chipper Jones, whose 444-foot, three-run homer
off Chan Ho Park in the sixth inning guaranteed an enjoyable flight
to San Diego, where the Braves open a six-game road trip tonight.
''It's so hard to put together winning streaks like this in this
day and age. You're always going to run into someone's ace who
might stick it to you. We treaded on some thin ice, but things just
seem to be working out for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta outscored the opposition 47-19 during the homestand,
hitting 11 homers and batting .286 while holding the Phillies,
Pirates and Dodgers to a collective .199. The Braves have trailed
for just 12 of 89 innings during their 10-game winning streak,
which began with Mulholland's 2-1 win April 16 in Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wish this stuff could go on forever,'' said Mulholland, who
earned his third win in the streak by working six shutout innings
before giving up a Kevin Elster homer in the seventh. After Kerry
Ligtenberg was battered in the eighth, Mulholland watched Rocker
load the bases in the ninth before striking out the side.
</P>
<P>
   ''I spent a few years with Mitch Williams in Philadelphia,''
Mulholland said. ''When he came in the game, (pitching coach)
Johnny Podres and I would look at each other and open our palms,
like, it's out of our hands. I'm not going to get any more gray
hairs over this.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry. Not during The Perfect Stand.

BLISTER PROBLEM LIMITS CHAN HO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Los Angeles Dodgers right-hander Chan Ho Park felt the
presence of his blister on every curveball he threw during a
bullpen session a few days ago and he took that memory to the mound
on Thursday against Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   And, eventually, Atlanta took it to Park in a 6-3 win at Turner
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Park said he worried how the blister on his right middle finger
would react every time he threw a curve. So he didn't throw many in
the first few innings, instead relying on a fastball and changeup.
It caused him to aim the ball, Park said, which worried him about a
new blister forming.
</P>
<P>
   Which neatly explains why Park (3-2) lasted 5 innings, getting
pulled after allowing a 444-foot three-run homer to Chipper Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're limited to two pitches, and he wasn't throwing his
curveball very sharply because (the blister) was still bothering
him, it kind of limits how you're going to attack guys,'' Dodgers
catcher Chad Kreuter said. ``He wasn't as sharp as he could be
because of the blister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a firm believer his finger is still bothering him. He was
out there battling, but you have a wounded soldier out there
battling.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't the long ball that did in Park but rather the
seven walks that tied a career high. Park threw 54 strikes and 55
balls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't throw a good curveball, but I'm not suppose to be
thinking about that,'' Park said. ``Obviously, it felt different,
which is normal with new skin.''
</P>
<P>
   Little new damage was done to the blistered area and Park is
slated to make his next start.
</P>
<P>
   __ Catching progress: Neither Todd Hundley nor Chad Kreuter have
thrown out a runner attempting to steal. All 15 were successful
against Hundley, and Kreuter is 0 for 2. But Dodgers pitchers have
picked off four, and with the numbers down markedly from last
season, manager Davey Johnson said he's pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we haven't been able to throw anybody out, in my
book we've thrown about four of them out,'' Johnson said. ``They
haven't been stealing them on the catcher. Hundley's throwing the
ball down there in 1.9 (seconds). Where that was broke, that's
fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Bad day, mate: Lefty Jeff Williams' velocity was down and he
wasn't getting the same reaction with his curveball he did last
season, and now the Dodgers know why. Williams, an Australian
native who had an 18.00 ERA in a brief stint with Dodgers this
season, has a weakness in his pitching hand.
</P>
<P>
   Williams won't be able to pitch for a minimum of two weeks
because his hand will be in a splint. It further complicates the
Dodgers' left-handed situation in the bullpen. Williams and Onan
Masaoka are the only two lefties in the picture.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Dodgers utility player F.P. Santangelo is 1
for 13 this season, but he's not ready to panic since this is a
typical start. He began last season 1 for 14 and finished with a
.260 average. . . . The Braves have a 10-game winning streak,
ending their nine-game homestand undefeated. The last NL team to go
9-0 on a homestand was the Dodgers, who did it May 1993.

CUBANS WHO DISAGREE WITH MIAMI MAINSRTEAM ON ELIAN KEEP QUIET OR
FACE HOSTILITY
</HEADLINE>
   (With CUBAN-BOY-NYT) 
 By JUAN FORERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As a playwright in Cuba, Carmen Duarte knew all too well
what state-controlled repression meant. Her work was often
censored, Duarte said, and she and the actors in her theater troupe
were once beaten by policemen incensed by the scathing social
commentary in one of her plays.
</P>
<P>
   Now living here, in the heart of the nation's largest and most
potent Cuban-American enclave, Duarte is trying once again to give
voice to a point a view that many like her say can lead to
ostracism or even threats. She believes that Elian Gonzalez should
have been reunited with his father months ago, and has said so on
her daily radio show, ``Transitions,'' broadcast on a
Spanish-language station here.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk, though, has been met by a reverse form of the anger
that Duarte encountered in Cuba, with callers to the radio station
accusing her of being an agent of Fidel Castro's government, or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always calls,'' said Duarte, 40, who came to the
United States in 1993. ``There are always insults. You always see
it with any case that inflames the people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Cuban-Americans who favor more open relations with
Havana say that advocating an end to the U.S. embargo of Cuba or
closer ties to the island have always brought scorn and threats
and, in some cases, violence.
</P>
<P>
   But many here say that the federal raid that took Elian from
Miami has impassioned people as never before, to the consternation
of Cuban-Americans who, despite their own hatred of Castro, feel
their alternative ideas regarding Cuba are rarely aired in this
politically charged city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen it so polarized,'' said Dr. Max Castro, a
senior research associate at the University of Miami who studies
the exile community. ``I've never seen such a situation where you
are accosted if you say the wrong thing. It's a very heart-rending
thing, and we can't stop talking about it, and once we get talking
about it we get very emotional and it can become ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilda Cossio Cohen, a legal assistant at a Miami law firm, found
out just how emotional people can get, a few days before Elian was
removed from the home of Miami relatives. After expressing support
for efforts to reunite Elian with his father, Cossio Cohen said, a
co-worker berated her as a Communist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to voice your opinion in Dade County
because you will be branded,'' said Cossio Cohen, who fled Cuba
with her mother and two brothers in 1960. ``I work for a law firm,
but if I owned a business or tried to go into politics, I would be
blackballed forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Cossio Cohen, who believes that ending the embargo of Cuba would
be the best course for furthering democratic change in Cuba, said
she had been disheartened by what she saw as a widespread disregard
for the free flow of ideas since the Elian case began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this thing has set us back 40 years,'' she said.
``It's driven a wedge in the Cuban community. It's turned friends
against friends, family against family. I pity my Cuban people
because I truly think that we have pain in our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Measuring the sentiments is, of course, difficult. In Miami, it
is unclear how many Cuban exiles have views divergent from those
that are most often heard on local airwaves and in newspapers.
Although some leaders of more liberal Cuban groups say they
constitute a silent majority of Cuban exiles, experts disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I'd like to see it,'' said Dr. Lisandro Perez,
director of the Cuban Research Center at Florida International
University, ``I don't think that there's any evidence to show that.
And you would expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls conducted by Florida International University to gauge
exile reaction to Cuban issues showed that, as recently as 1997, 78
percent of Cuban-Americans expressed support for the continuation
of the embargo. But at the same time, 25 percent believe it has not
worked well, and 51.6 percent said they supported a ``dialogue''
with the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   On the Elian matter, however, the exiles have appeared more
united against Cuba's government, with 83 percent of
Cuban-Americans in Dade County wanting to see the boy remain with
his Miami relatives, according to a Miami Herald poll published on
April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Many with minority views avoid nasty confrontations, they say,
by simply avoiding speaking out, even if it is at the office with
well-known co-workers or in a bar with friends. Some believe
sharing their views could hurt them professionally. Others simply
want to avoid the discomfort of angering someone they know. Some
even say they avoid voicing their opinions with relatives, fearing
a fissure with more conservative family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible,'' said E. Rodriguez, a 48-year-old educator
who asked that she not be fully identified. ``Here, I could be
labeled a Communist. I could lose my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who arrived in Miami in the 1960s, said she had long
believed that closer ties with Cuba _ an end to the economic
embargo and the unfettered movement of tourists and others to the
island _ were more productive than the hard-line stand that has
defined 41 years of U.S. policy. She also believes that Elian was
manipulated by Cuban-American exile leaders looking for a symbol to
further their own cause, not because of concerns over the boy's
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   But while she shares her views with close friends, she said, she
has been told to be careful what she says to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never made it public,'' she said. ``What is the story
here is the lack of freedom. I've been warned not to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lisandro Perez, director of the Cuban Research Center at
Florida International University said that those who took a less
hard-line stance against Castro feared being ostracized or
suffering the consequences at their workplace, a very real
possibility in a place where Cuban-Americans have influence in
everything from business to government to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want people to label you as sympathizing with the
enemy,'' Perez said. ``Anything less than a hard-line position is
seen as sympathizing with the Castro government, and the community
has a lot of institutions through which it can pressure people to
conformity.''
</P>
<P>
   Many who favor an open channel to Cuba blame much of the
unbending nature of exile dialogue on Miami's Spanish-language
stations, whose talk-show hosts often label those with softer
positions as Communists and even give out home phone numbers of
people like Duarte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, this society has been converted into a society of
fear,'' said Angel Fernandez Varela, a retired bank chairman who
served in the Cuban Congress before the revolution. ``It's the way
people are attacked. And among the worst is that radio. There are
people, many people, who feel like I do, but they're terribly quiet
because they're scared.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, several groups that have for years lobbied Congress for a
softer stand on Cuba in order to improve the lives of ordinary
Cubans who they say are suffering under the embargo. While those
leaders have made a conscious decision to speak out publicly, they
say that it has been hard to gather public support because of both
the climate of fear and because of the difficulty in getting their
views aired in Miami's conservative media.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come up to me all the time and say, `We feel exactly
the way you do, but we would never say this in public,''' said
Elena Freyre, executive director of the Cuban Committee for
Democracy, a group of Cuban-American professionals that lobbies
from Washington and Miami. ``I speak out to honor my father's
memory. My father left everything he cherished to live in a country
where his two daughters could speak out. I'll be darned if I ever
forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in well-known anti-Castro groups in Miami scoffed at
such complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Rodriguez, vice president of Brigade 2506, an organization
composed of Bay of Pigs veterans, said that in Miami ``there is
liberty to say what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Rodriguez, a former CIA operative who wrote about his
anti-Castro experiences in a book, ``Shadow Warrior,'' said some
groups advocating relations with Cuba were controlled by Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are small groups that are being run from Cuba,'' he
said. ``Cuba has several groups that they handle here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans like Elisa Greenberg, who believes Elian should
be with his father, cringe at such comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that with some people, they felt that anyone speaking
out against them was in favor of the Communist regime and was a
Castro lover or a Castro agent,'' said Greenberg, 58, who came to
the United States before Castro took power. ``If you want to call
me anything, call me a Cuba lover because I believe in democracy
and I believe, in time, if we work towards it, good things will
happen over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when she was invited to Ted Koppel's town hall meeting in
Miami earlier this month, a gathering broadcast on ABC's
``Nightline,'' she was afraid to speak up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there was apprehension on my part to speak my mind on the
matter,'' said Greenberg, noting that most of the exiles in the
audience were vocally supportive of keeping Elian in Miami. ``I was
afraid to speak up. I didn't feel comfortable and over there, I was
in the minority.''

BUSH-McCAIN MEETING ON ROCKY GROUND 
 
By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A much-touted meeting between George W. Bush and
defeated Republican rival John McCain, which could prove important
to Bush's presidential bid, is now iffy, a McCain spokesman said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bush campaign said it believes that the meeting,
initially scheduled for May 9 in Pittsburgh, can be salvaged,
despite a dispute over its focus.
</P>
<P>
   Top aides to Bush and McCain were scheduled to meet Friday in
Washington to try to work out differences between the two camps.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side would confirm or deny a report in the online news
service Salon.com that McCain had ordered the meeting scrubbed.
</P>
<P>
   McCain reportedly reacted after reading a column by political
commentator Robert Novak, in which some Bush advisers complained
that McCain would make demands on Bush before endorsing him.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former prisoner of war, was in Vietnam on Thursday to
commemorate the 25th anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   But his spokesman, Todd Harris, said the meeting was ``tenuous''
because it appeared that Bush's main reason for attending was to
discuss whether McCain was interested in being his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a senator from Arizona who fought Bush for several
months for the Republican presidential nomination, has said that he
isn't interested in being vice president. But the Texas governor
announced last week that he would ask McCain in the meeting if he
would consider being his running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that any meeting between Senator McCain and Governor
Bush ought to be a substantive one. But in order to have a
substantive meeting, you ought to have a substantive agenda in
advance,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not feel that a meeting to discuss whether Senator
McCain is interested in being vice president _ when everyone knows
that he's not _ should be considered substantive.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said that any dispute was ``just
a misunderstanding.'' He said Bush looked forward to a
``substantive discussion of the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan said the two men would discuss ``how they can work
together on the reforms they agree upon.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's strong pitch for significant changes in campaign
finance laws angered many in the Republican establishment. But his
insurgent message appealed to many independent and Democratic
voters, whose support could prove crucial to Bush, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, in the fall campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who returned to Austin from a three-day campaign swing
Thursday afternoon, said he was unaware the meeting was considered
in jeopardy. He said he was sure that, sooner or later, he and
McCain would meet and would decide for themselves what to discuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd hate to think a column could cause a meeting to be
canceled,'' he said, referring to the report about the Novak
column.
</P>
<P>
   According to The Associated Press, McCain's advisers were
preparing a list of suggested agenda items to propose to the Bush
campaign when the Novak column stirred up controversy.
</P>
<P>
   McCain reportedly wants to discuss campaign finance reform and
Social Security, issues that were dominant in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Harris, the McCain spokesman, said John Weaver, the political
director for McCain's presidential campaign, would meet with Joe
Allbaugh, Bush's campaign manager, Friday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our staff remains in close contact with Senator McCain's
staff,'' McClellan added.

ANALYSIS: GIULIANI MUST MAKE POLITICAL AND MEDICAL DECISIONS
CONCURRENTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-GIULIANI-CANCER, PROSTATE-CANCER) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The announcement by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on
Thursday that he has been struck with prostate cancer presents him
with a series of pressing medical decisions in the weeks ahead. But
the confluence of Giuliani's diagnosis and the state's election
calendar could force him to make some pivotal decisions about his
Senate candidacy rapidly, and over roughly the same difficult
period of time.
</P>
<P>
   The state's Republican Party is meeting in Buffalo on May 30 to
nominate its candidate, presumably Giuliani, to run against Hillary
Rodham Clinton. The mayor has approximately 10 days from then to
accept or decline formally the nomination. Once that is done,
Giuliani is essentially locked in place: Under state election law,
a candidate's name can be removed from the ballot if he or she
moves to another state, is nominated to run for another office, or
dies.
</P>
<P>
   What that means, Giuliani's advisers said, is that if he has any
thoughts about abandoning this race for Senate _ and at his news
conference on Thursday, he made clear that he does have such
thoughts _ he needs to act on them at almost the same time that he
is making decisions about his treatment. That, he estimated, would
take two or three weeks. Given this calendar, that is pretty much
all he has. At this late date, he does not have the luxury of
taking a few months to consider his medical options and then
returning to consider the future of his candidacy before the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And it was far from clear what Giuliani might end up doing as he
faced the difficult task of unweaving this tangle of medical and
political decisions, right in the middle of a searing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's political advisers took steps throughout the day to
battle a growing perception in city political circles that the
medical announcement presaged a decision by Giuliani to step out of
the race. His campaign issued a statement announcing that he would
not cancel any campaign appearances, at least for the next week.
His aides pointed out cases of other candidates who survived
life-threatening illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   One senior adviser volunteered the argument that the image of a
spirited and sympathetic Giuliani, fighting cancer and Clinton
simultaneously, might be the right antidote to the perception of
the mayor as bellicose. And his friends placed unsolicited calls to
reporters to declare that Giuliani was in the race to stay, no
matter how he sounded at his news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this personal challenge will only energize him even
more in his commitment to the race,'' Randy M. Mastro, a former
deputy mayor, said in one such call.
</P>
<P>
   That said, his announcement came at a time when there was
already concern among Republicans, taking note of Giuliani's
low-energy campaigning to date, that the mayor did not really have
his heart in a race that will force him to leave what he has
described as the best job he would ever have.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours after the news conference, a number of Republicans
and Democrats had similar responses: This unfortunate turn for
Giuliani could allow him to make a graceful exit from an unwanted
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been lukewarm about making the race from the get-go,''
said Nelson Warfield, former press secretary to Bob Dole, the
Republican presidential candidate who survived prostate cancer.
``Yes, it's a very treatable cancer. It wouldn't require him to
drop out. But for God's sake, the guy has two jobs already, and
fighting cancer is a third.''
</P>
<P>
   Another New York consultant, who asked not to be identified,
said the development ``may be an easy way out if he decides not to
do this without a loss of face.'' The consultant added, ``Everyone
will understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's political aides repeatedly said on Thursday night
that there was little chance the mayor would back out of this race.
``We have a very active campaign schedule for the next seven days,
and the mayor fully intends to keep up that schedule, including
travels to upstate New York,'' said Bruce J. Teitelbaum, Giuliani's
campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is a man who keeps his counsel and guards his privacy;
words of confidence from his campaign aides might, to some extent,
represent the hopeful thinking of loyal lieutenants who have been
working so hard on Giuliani's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   But the election is still a little more than six months off. And
if the mayor, like Joe Torre, the New York Yankees manager, is able
to opt for surgery alone without other treatment regimens, he could
be fully recovered within two months or so. That timetable still
leaves him months to campaign strenuously, on a shorter schedule in
late summer and fall _ one that the mayor has long preferred, given
that he has full-time duties in the city.
</P>
<P>
   If Giuliani was to decide not to make the race, several
Republicans said on Thursday, he should move as fast as possible to
assure that the Republicans can find a strong replacement to run
against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, one party leader said, it would probably be best
if the Republicans had a candidate in place for the May 30
convention.
</P>
<P>
   For another, Giuliani will not be able simply to turn over the
$9 million or so he has in campaign funds to someone else; federal
law bars him from contributing any more than $2,000. A new
candidate, should that prove necessary, would have to start raising
funds somewhat from scratch.
</P>
<P>
   The two Republicans who were most mentioned on Thursday as
possible Senate candidates _ again, should that prove necessary _
were Rick A. Lazio, the Long Island Republican who has long
threatened to challenge Giuliani in a primary, and Gov. George
Pataki, notwithstanding his remark in December in 1998 that it was
more likely that ``the Hindenburg would come back together'' than
that he would run for Senate. Both men declined to comment, beyond
offering Giuliani their best wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, Giuliani's announcement encouraged supporters in
both camps to speculate about how his cancer diagnosis might affect
a Clinton-Giuliani contest, even as they acknowledged that those
discussions were in poor taste. Would Clinton now find it more
difficult to attack Giuliani, for example? Would she be better off
running against Giuliani or Lazio?
</P>
<P>
   Would Giuliani's disease prompt upstate Republicans, who have
been increasingly critical of his absence from their parts of the
state, to give him some slack?
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the state of the field should become very clear
very quickly. One senior adviser said Giuliani should know, within
the next week, what kind of treatment would be needed for the
cancer, and whether he would just join the long list of public
figures who have undergone treatment for prostate cancer and than
proceeded with their lives. His advisers are urging Giuliani to
move ahead quickly, to dispel any notion about weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``His head has not changed any about the Senate race at all,''
one associate said. ``This has not changed anything as far as his
thoughts about pursuing the Senate race.''

 &HT;    EDS: Olympin is CQ

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ How much are your Olympic memories worth? Not as much
as Billy Payne's.
</P>
<P>
   The latest batch of Atlanta Olympic records released to the
public Thursday includes an inventory of the $1.5 million William
Porter Payne Collection, a vast assortment of Olympic memorabilia
purchased from Payne by his private foundation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Amateur Athletic Foundation paid Payne, who was its
chairman, $975,000 for the collection. Payne created the nonprofit
foundation in 1987 to bid for the 1996 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
   When the foundation bought Payne's collection, it intended to
display it in a major Olympic museum it hoped to build adjacent to
Centennial Olympic Park downtown. The foundation has significantly
scaled back its plans, and now is planning a much smaller exhibit
in a proposed addition to the Atlanta History Center in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   Payne's collection includes items collected from the early days
of the bid campaign to the 1996 Summer Games, including obvious
museum pieces such as the torch used in the lighting ceremony in
Athens, Greece, and the lantern used to transport the flame from
Athens to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   International Olympic Committee members were under fire last
year for accepting extravagant gifts. The inventory shows Payne
received his own share of gifts from many circles, including
national Olympic committees, the IOC and local sponsors and
licensees.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more valuable items, according to the appraisal, are
dozens of one-of-a-kind items presented personally to Payne. They
include the torch the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games
president used to light the cauldron in Los Angeles, valued at
$10,000; the Dream Team jersey worn by Michael Jordan, valued at
$2,500; and a Hanes Centennial Olympic Games T-shirt specially made
for Payne, valued at $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   There are also thousands of items with questionable value to
collectors, such as a huge batch of framed photographs, valued at
an eye-opening $50,000; a thousand Coke lapel pins produced for the
Tokyo vote, valued at $20,000; and Payne's personal collection of
business letters and personal correspondence, assessed at $40,000.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic collectibles experts who got their first glimpse of the
inventory Thursday generally said the individual prices are
inflated and the majority of the collection would not even sell on
the open market.
</P>
<P>
   The memorabilia market would be hard pressed to find a buyer who
would pay $500 for three leftover boxes of Payne's business cards,
they suggest.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid O'Neil, the Colorado-based Olympic and sports memorabilia
auctioneer who inventoried Payne's collection, defended her
appraisal Thursday. She praised the completeness of the collection.
``This is a unique situation in that Atlanta has the documentation
from the first idea through the completion of the Games and that
makes a difference,'' she said. ``You should look at the whole
picture. This is an outstanding collection.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the fact that Payne, the head of the organizing
committee, owned the torches, medals and stuffed Whatizits
increases the value of the individual items.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I would carry a torch, that torch would be worth the same
as if anybody else paid it,'' she said. ``If somebody like Billy
Payne carried it, that would make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, it's unclear how much those Olympic torches hanging
on walls of torch relay participants all over Atlanta are worth.
Payne's torch collection was worth $78,000, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But then, Payne had 39 of them. And that raises another
troubling issue for collectors when reviewing this deal. They ask
why many of the items in Payne's collection were his and not the
property of the non-profit group he founded.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Payne sold 25 leather-bound copies of the official
five-volume bid document presented to the IOC. The bid books were
produced by the foundation and paid for from corporate and
individual donations. Why then was Payne entitled to keep the
leftovers and sell them back to the foundation?
</P>
<P>
   Other records in the Olympic archives at the History Center
indicate Payne solicited personal samples of prototype merchandise
from all of ACOG's licensees. Those samples are represented in
volume in the inventory, stashed in cartons of bid bags, T-shirts,
watches, briefcases, Cabbage Patch dolls and jewelry. The
collection also includes a set of 10 sets of jeweled pins designed
to commemorate the countdown to the start of the Games, which were
valued at $320,000.
</P>
<P>
   The records detailing the purchase of the collection were not
released until they were reviewed by an independent law firm this
year. The attorneys concluded the deal was legitimate and violated
no tax laws, according to Ralph Jernigan, president of the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy paid a significant amount of taxes on this transaction,
and did not take any tax deductions,'' said Jernigan. Payne would
have been entitled to a $528,000 tax deduction on the portion of
the collection he donated for which he received no money. It's not
clear why he declined to take the deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Jernigan and other foundation board members generally defend the
deal as a vehicle to pay Payne back for his volunteer efforts on
behalf of the bid campaign. During that period, he quit his job as
an attorney and took out a loan to support his family. Payne's
foundation assumed $500,000 of that loan in 1993. Payne paid the
loan back with interest from the proceeds of his memorabilia sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy gave his heart and soul to the Olympics,'' Jernigan
said. ``The purchase of his collections was unanimously supported
by the GAAF board _ we had no second thoughts whatsoever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, with the development of the Olympic exhibition at the
Atlanta History Center, these collections and much more will be on
display for everyone to enjoy and cherish.''

   &UR; FILM AND VIDEO &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SHAFT-FILM (Undated) _ Gordon Park's groundbreaking detective
film ``Shaft'' in 1971 never got the respect it deserves; I
recently overheard a major filmmaker giving the picture short
shrift and claiming he could have done a much better job with the
material, given Isaac Hayes's score _ which some consider the true
star of the motion picture. In fact, the score builds a frame
around the likable cool of Parks's picture; it doesn't usurp it.
Now, with a new version of ``Shaft'' _ starring Samuel L. Jackson,
directed by John Singleton and written by Richard Price _ due for
release this summer, the original film will be scrutinized once
again. By Elvis Mitchell. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DARKSIDE-SUMMER-FILMS (Paris) _ So often in the movies, summer
is a time of flight and escape, romance and bliss; too brief in
real time but long in the memory, like all the things we love. But
films such as ``Lady in a Cage'' reveal the dark side of summer,
that season in which fights break out on the subway and lovers
sleep far apart in the bed and the heat tempts normally passive
mortals to madness. By Kristin Hohenadel. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JAWS-FILM (Undated) _ Twenty-five years ago, Steven Spielberg's
``Jaws'' created the Summer Movie as we know it: the action-heavy,
``thrill ride'' sort of picture, aimed at sensation-hungry younger
audiences, which moves into theaters around Memorial Day and
remains there, partying hard, until the school year starts up again
in September. ``Jaws'' opened on June 20, 1975, and its phenomenal
popularity _ it was the first movie to relieve American audiences
of more than $100 million of their hard-earned money _ helped turn
Hollywood into what is now largely a summer-business town, sort of
like Amity, the New England beach resort where the film's dire
events take place. By Terrence Rafferty. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ROCKY-BULLWINKLE-FILM (Undated) _ The ``Fractured Fairy Tale''
was one of the many wicked satires from ``Rocky and His Friends,''
the smartest, dumbest, simplest and most complex cartoon ever made
for television (and, yes, that includes ``The Simpsons''). On June
30, Universal Pictures will resuscitate the flying squirrel and his
pals on the big screen in ``The Adventures of Rocky and
Bullwinkle,'' what studio flacks are calling a
``live-action/animated comedy.'' By Franz Lidz. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GLADIATOR-FILM (Undated) _ On Friday, ``Gladiator,'' directed by
Ridley Scott, resumes the dig for sunken metaphors on a scale not
seen since the late 1950s and early 1960s, when audiences lined up
for two-part spectaculars like William Wyler's ``Ben-Hur,'' Joseph
L. Mankiewicz's ``Cleopatra'' and Stanley Kubrick's ``Spartacus.''
In the spirit of these legendary epics, ``Gladiator'' is an
allegory of its own time. The first Roman cinema spectacular to be
made by Hollywood since the end of the Cold War, it is a meditation
on the perplexity of the world's sole surviving superpower. Quo
vadis? Where does America go from here? After expansion, implosion
_ this is the diagnosis set forth by ``Gladiator'' in period
costume. By Herbert Muschamp. (Moved). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   BEACH-FILMS (Undated) _ Although the beach movie genre is
generally considered to have begun with ``Gidget'' (1959) _
starring Sandra Dee as an affable, late-blooming teenager reluctant
to go on her first surf-and-sun ``manhunt'' _ it wasn't until the
successful release of American International Pictures' ``Beach
Party'' (1963) that film studios began to fully exploit the
economic rewards of niche marketing. And with two-thirds of all
filmgoers being between the ages of 16 and 24 by the late 1950s,
the intended target was clear. By David Bahr. (Moved) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CRUISE-FILMS (Undated) _ The anticipated through-the-roof
success of the sequel to ``Mission Impossible,'' ``M: I-2,'' should
soothe any hurt feelings in the Tom Cruise camp over the actor's
Oscar loss for ``Magnolia.'' Generally the academy swoons over
beautiful stars who go into ugly mode to show they can act, but
Cruise's strutting, pelvis-jutting television sex guru, out to
seduce and destroy the female half of the species, was perhaps too
far off the empathy curve when compared with Michael Caine's kindly
doctor, patron of wayward women, in ``The Cider House Rules.''
While playing cocky upstarts too full of themselves to join the
team, in his best work as an actor Cruise has allowed co-stars and
supporting players to shine while his own subtler contributions
have gone relatively unheralded. Oscars have accrued, but not to
him. By Molly Haskell. (Moved).  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KISSES-FILMS (Undated) _ Let's face it, most movie kisses are
dull and predictable, about as titillating as a dental hygiene
appointment. But that makes the good ones even more memorable. I
apologize to everyone whose favorite kiss is absent here. By Lisa
Zeidner. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TRISHA-BROWN-DANCE (New York) _ Sometimes the choreographer
Trisha Brown, 63, likes to dance an answer to a question. Looking
elegant in a long, simple black dress on a late March weekend, she
rises to her feet to show how close her dancers come to one another
in ``Five Part Weather Invention,'' the first section of a new
three-part collaboration with the jazz composer Dave Douglas, the
visual artist Terry Winters and the lighting designer Jennifer
Tipton. Both this piece and ``Rapture to Leon James,'' the second
part, will have their New York premieres when her 12-member troupe
celebrates its 30th anniversary with a two-week engagement at the
Joyce Theater, beginning on Tuesday. In June, the complete trilogy
will be presented at the American Dance Festival in North Carolina,
which commissioned ``Rapture'' and the last untitled section. By
Valerie Gladstone. (Moved). &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOMASSON-DANCE (Undated) _ Fifteen years ago, Helgi Tomasson,
the celebrated dancer from Iceland, stood onstage at the New York
State Theater for the last time as a member of the New York City
Ballet, accepting flowers and a resounding ovation for his final
performance. On Wednesday, if he goes against his innately modest
and reticent nature, he should be back on that stage, this time

   BLUE-MAN-GROUP (Las Vegas) _ Blue Man Group is the three-man
performance troupe, the bald, blue-headed guys who, though
unspeaking (and occasionally unspeakable), have been wreaking havoc
on contemporary art in the intervals between playing their own
music on garbage pails and plumbing pipes at the Astor Place
Theater in Manhattan since 1991. The original Blue Men, Matt
Goldman, Phil Stanton and Chris Wink, were street performers who
established their own Club Nowhere on a sidewalk outside the
Copacabana in the late 1980s. By now, Blue Man has effected a
corporate merger with himself. Thirty other Blue Men have joined
the troupe, plus two in training. ``Blue Man: Tubes,'' the New York
show, is still going strong. In 1995 it opened in Boston; it's
still going strong there, too. In 1997 it was Chicago, where, yes,
it's still going strong. And last month, Messrs. Goldman, Stanton
and Wink opened in ``Blue Man Group: Live at Luxor'' in Las Vegas,
with a five-year contract. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved).  &QL;

   DIRTY-BLONDE-THEATER (New York) _ A Menage of muscle men and
drag queens flanked Mae West throughout her long career, both
onstage and off. They were her honor guard of sin, her ``boys,'' as
she liked to call them. In the play ``Dirty Blonde,'' a kind of
theatrical free-association on West, Kevin Chamberlin and Bob
Stillman bring a number of these ``boys'' to life. Written by
Claudia Shear, who conceived it with the director James Lapine,
``Dirty Blonde'' reopens Monday at the Helen Hayes Theater on
Broadway after a widely praised run at New York Theater Workshop.

   ART-NOUVEAU (London) _ A century after its heyday, the ornate
decorative style known as Art Nouveau remains so immediately
recognizable that debate over its merits often comes down to this:
do you love it or hate it? The Victoria and Albert Museum, however,
believes the time is ripe to revisit an earlier question: what
(italics)is(end italics) Art Nouveau? And to prove that the answer
is not obvious, it has put together ``Art Nouveau 1890-1914,'' the
largest exhibition on the subject since the last fin-de-siecle. The
premise of the show, which will travel to the National Gallery of
Art in Washington this fall after closing here on July 30, is that
Art Nouveau was not a flash-in-the-pan movement driven by press and
publicity. Rather it was a complex style, inspired by the idea of
total art, or Gesamtkunstwerk, as a political instrument, that had
roots in the mid-19th century and exercised influence well into the

well as to edge sheets, towels, tablecloths and fabrics for gift

wholesome tour of America's bric-a-brac. One of the things that's
neat about the ``Roadshow'' _ and that perhaps explains why the
show is a guilty pleasure for some (and, conversely, a must-see for

trundles into a shot, bemusedly declaiming, ``Thou shalt have no
other God before me,'' Sheen's relish in acting a scene he knows

<P>
   WEST POINT, N.Y. _ ``What Are the Lessons of Vietnam'' was
scrawled across the board, and at the end of the hour the professor
_ who had sternly told the class that ``Vietnam did not just
happen, it was the clear result of decisions made by men'' _
thumped the board and demanded:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want each of you to tell me: Who was responsible for this
debacle?''
</P>
<P>
   The 16 students shifted uneasily in their chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Westmoreland,'' said the first, naming one of the American
commanders in Vietnam, ``It was his theater and he expended a lot
of effort on search and destroy.'' Down the row it went: ``I blame
Richard Nixon for why we got out of Vietnam.'' LBJ and his
advisers; Kennedy; Nixon; LBJ; the joint chiefs of staff; even John
Foster Dulles, the Cold War secretary of state, until finally the
lone young woman ventured in a frustrated voice, ``I don't think
it's anybody in particular.''
</P>
<P>
   A common scene, perhaps, on campus these days, where the Vietnam
War and the tumultuous 1960s have become among the most popular
courses.
</P>
<P>
   But this professor, Cole Kingseed, had the eagles of a full Army
colonel on his shoulders and the students wore the uniforms of
cadets at the United States Military Academy, whose graduates
commanded, fought and bled in the war in Vietnam that ended in
defeat 25 years ago, before any of them were born.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might as well be teaching the Peloponnesian Wars,'' sighed
Kingseed, who was a junior at the University of Dayton, and an
honor cadet in its rapidly diminishing ROTC program in the spring
of 1970 when, on the other side of Ohio, Kent State erupted and
four students were killed in a volley of National Guard fire.
</P>
<P>
   The required military history survey course, the backbone of the
curriculum preparing the cadets to be Army officers, wound up its
section on Vietnam Thursday, with the students pulling out their
maps and pondering how, as Kingseed and other instructors in the
course put it bluntly, ``could the most powerful nation on the face
of the earth be defeated by a second-rate agricultural third-world
country?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a question being faced here at West Point with a critical
frankness, startling to an outsider who might expect a more
hidebound military approach. And the instructors _ soldiers first,
before they became scholars _ are constantly aware these days that
their young charges, as lieutenants and captains commanding
platoons and companies, might soon be plunged into ambiguous,
perhaps ill-conceived missions in the Balkans, Africa, the Middle
East or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``My real feeling is, I don't know how we could have won that
war,'' reflected the chairman of the history department, Col.
Robert Doughty, West Point class of `65 and an adviser to a
Vietnamese armored cavalry unit in 1968-69.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the nature of the war itself, a people's war waged by
the North Vietnamese,'' he said. `'You're fighting an enemy who is
willing to take those kind of casualties. Lord, I saw them die by
the hundreds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only begin to suggest the complexity,'' he said, hoping
the courses would spur more reading and an appreciation for
ambiguity and independent thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to be caught in something just as bad, sometime,
somewhere,'' he said of the future officers. ``When or where, I
can't predict, but they will be.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Injured infielder Frank Catalanotto and
pitcher Mike Munoz were both examined by Dr. John Conway yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto, placed on the disabled list Saturday, is still
bothered by what Conway said was a ``severe tear'' of the groin
muscle. Catalanotto is expected to miss at least two more weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Munoz, after undergoing an MRI, has been diagnosed with chronic
tendinitis and was given a cortisone shot. He was placed on the
disabled list Wednesday and is expected to miss two weeks.  &QL; 
Rangers vs. Orioles
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers open a three-game series with the Baltimore Orioles
tonight at Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were 6-6 against the Orioles last season, going 3-3
against them at Camden Yards. The Orioles scored 81 runs against
the Rangers, the most by any opponent. Rangers pitchers allowed 20
home runs, 138 hits and 45 walks, all the most against any club.
Rafael Palmeiro hit .372 against the Orioles while Royce Clayton
hit .345, his second best against any American League team.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles have considered activating right-hander Scott
Erickson off the disabled list and let him pitch Sunday against the
Rangers. But there are concerns about his velocity, and it's likely
they'll keep him on medical rehabilitation assignment for at least
one more start.

COWBOYS FOCUSING ON CORNERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ After what owner Jerry Jones recently described
as the most extensive evaluation process ever by his coaches and
scouts on an NFL Draft, there obviously is nothing left for anyone
to learn about the three cornerbacks selected earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we know these guys, talent-wise,'' Cowboys defensive
coordinator Mike Zimmer said yesterday. ``But until you get them on
the field, in front of you, \Rmixed in\S with the rest of your
guys, there's really no way to know all their strengths and
deficiencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will get their first chance during a three-day
minicamp held at Valley Ranch, beginning today, to see exactly how
cornerbacks Dwayne Goodrich of Tennessee, Kareem Larrimore of West
Texas A&AMP;M and Mario Edwards of Florida State fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from skill level, Zimmer will also be evaluating the
cornerbacks in three other areas:
</P>
<P>
   Ability to learn. ``How fast do they catch on? Although some of
them already have been sent a basic technique video, this will be
the first time that they find out what we expect of them,'' Zimmer
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ability to listen. ``How do they take to coaching? What's their
hot button?'' Zimmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Ability to relax. ``We \Rcoaches\S need to be careful that we
don't prejudge them too much at this point. This is their first
minicamp. They're going to be nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Veteran cornerback Kevin Mathis, who had been a starter when
healthy _ he missed eight games in 1999 _ was traded to the New
Orleans Saints for third-year linebacker Chris Bordano on
Wednesday. This seemed to reinforce the belief that the Cowboys are
confident that Goodrich, Larrimore and Edwards all can make the
53-man roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely don't have the team made,'' Zimmer cautioned.
``I don't think we were trying to send a message \Rto the rookie
cornerbacks\S. If anything, \Rthe Mathis trade\S should've sent a
message to the older players.''  &QL; 
Briefly
</P>
<P>
   As expected, Pro Bowl linebacker Dexter Coakley has signed the
Cowboys' one-year tender offer of $1.027 million. This represents
the second-highest tender allowed for an NFL restricted free agent.
It also set compensation at a first-round pick. Coakley did not
receive an offer sheet during the signing period from any other
team.
</P>
<P>
   Free-agent kicker Jaret Greaser of Texas Tech was waived. Four
kickers remain on the Cowboys roster: Jon Hibert of Louisville,
Rian Lindee of Washington State, Cedric Ogelsby of South Carolina
State and Tim Seder of Ashland University, all undrafted rookie
free agents.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Campo has scheduled two minicamps and two quarterbacks
schools. Only the second minicamp _ June 12-14 _ is mandatory for
all players. The first of two quarterback schools begins Monday and
runs through Thursday. Quarterback School II is May 22-25.

 WEST POINT, N.Y.: will be .'' 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Long Gray Line still marches in formation on the parade
ground called The Plain before the crenellated, fortress-like
barracks and classrooms set spectacularly above the Hudson, near
statues of Gens. George Patton `09, Douglas MacArthur `03, and
Dwight D. Eisenhower `15, and the trophy cannons captured in past
wars.
</P>
<P>
   But while the barracks are named for victorious generals and
their sally ports for their battles, the Vietnam war is marked only
by a memorial to the dead in Southeast Asia, donated by the classes
of 1960-1969, and athletic facilities named for three young
officers killed in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Much has changed since Lt. Col. Conrad Crane `74, watched on
television here as the war wound down, a time he remembers ``almost
a siege mentality'' at West Point, when cadets couldn't wear their
uniforms off-campus for fear of being spat on.
</P>
<P>
   Now a history professor, Crane recalled that, back then, cadets
were issued a 46-page pamphlet with catechism-like answers, in case
somebody asked why America had become involved in a civil war.
``The conflict in Vietnam is not a civil war,'' it instructed.
``Rather, the conflict there is between two separate international
entities _ entities which resulted both from the provisional
military demarcation line separating the two and from their
real-world separation for a substantial period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 4,079 cadets include 630 women and, for more than 15
years now, have been able to choose majors, including history,
rather than follow the traditional engineering-oriented curriculum.
Still, Crane, for one, is dubious about the notion that the 1991
Persian Gulf war erased, as President George Bush said at the time,
the ``Vietnam Syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Desert Storm was the Anti-Vietnam,'' he said. ``In Desert
Storm, we got spoiled, a war with the roads already built, the
airports built. We are very blunt with the cadets, that in the
future their experiences will be closer to Vietnam than Desert
Storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, for our policy makers, the Vietnam syndrome
is still there,'' he said. ``You can't suffer any casualties, that
is a legacy of Vietnam. It results in a kind of cruise-missile
diplomacy, a warfare so high-tech it's almost bloodless, not
risking any human life at all except where it lands.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Like others at West Point, he sees the Army as likely to be
involved in peacekeeping operations on the ground, among a
population where distinctions between friend and foe may be
difficult or shifting.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. David Toczek, `88, a lean, intense, can-do Ranger who with
Kingseed teaches a course on Korea and Vietnam that is the most
popular elective, is troubled, as a soldier, by the conclusion he
has been forced to draw from the Vietnam war. ``'Being an Army
officer, there's almost no such thing as `'can't be done',' '' he
said. ``It's not an option.'' But, he added, shaking his head after
a brief recounting of tactical debates, ``I don't know, I just
can't see a way out.
</P>
<P>
   ``. `'You can do attrition, do what you're good at _ kill a lot
of people,'' he said. ``But that doesn't solve the problem: a
corrupt government that doesn't serve the needs of the people.''
</P>
<P>
   For this younger generation of Vietnam scholars, the key to
North Vietnam's success against the United States was a concept
known as Dau Tranh, or protracted struggle. It meant waging
campaigns on both a political and military level, a willingness to
accept enormous casualties and, most importantly, flexible tactics,
shifting from guerrilla to conventional war to take advantage of
American deployments.
</P>
<P>
   In the course outline there is a quote from Douglas Pike, an
expert on Vietnam: ``Dau Tranh is a strategy for which there is no
proven counterstrategy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the reading lists here, Col. Harry G. Summers Jr.'s 1982
work, ``On Strategy: The Vietnam War in Context,'' which argued
that Americans won every battle on the ground but lost the war
through lack of political will, seems largely to have fallen out of
favor.
</P>
<P>
   More critical books are being assigned, including Philip
Caputo's ``A Rumor of War,'' a brutal account of his
disillusionment as a Marine lieutenant in Vietnam, where his
platoon, he wrote, ``carried along with our packs and rifles, the
implicit convictions that the Viet Cong would be quickly beaten and
that we were doing something altogether noble and good. We kept the
packs and rifles; the convictions we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The new scholarship perhaps most critical is ``Dereliction of
Duty'' (Harper Collins, 1997) by Col. H.R. McMillan, '84, who
taught history here and is now commanding an armored cavalry
squadron in Germany. He accuses the Army leadership of arrogance
and lying.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly the favorite book here is ``We Were Soldiers Once
and Young,'' by Lt. Gen. Harold Moore and Joseph Galloway (Harper
Perennial, 1992), which both celebrates the courage of American
soldiers in Vietnam while excoriating their top commanders and
their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In gripping detail, Moore, `45, tells the story tells of the
battle of Ia Drang in 1965, which in many ways defined the war.
</P>
<P>
   Then a lieutenant colonel and battalion commander, Moore
helicoptered his men into what turned out to be a major North
Vietnamese headquarters. Vastly outnumbered, the Americans called
in artillery, helicopter gunfire and finally all available aircraft
in Vietnam. When it was over, 634 North Vietnamese were dead and
more than 1,000 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Different lessons were drawn. For Westmoreland, it was a
validation of his ``search and destroy'' plan. To Moore and many
others, it was a warning of what a tenacious enemy they faced. To
the North Vietnamese, it was experience in how to fight the
Americans, newly arrived in force.
</P>
<P>
   Moore was here this week to speak to a packed auditorium of
cadets. Hundreds waited in line for hours at the bookstore for the
courtly old warrior to sign their books.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came a way with a real definite feeling that everybody
caused it,'' said Matt Rasmussen, a junior history major. ``There
was no way to win that war.''

Democrats, Gov. George W. Bush suddenly had to deal with new strife
within his own party Thursday as aides to his onetime rival, Sen.
John McCain, threatened to cancel a scheduled reconciliation
session.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their bitter primary battle, the two men agreed a few
weeks ago to meet in Pittsburgh on May 9 and explore ways to put
their differences aside. But Todd Harris, a spokesman for McCain's
new political action committee, said Thursday, ``The status of the
meeting is tenuous.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris said aides to McCain, who in recent days had been touring
Vietnam, where he once was held as a prisoner of war, had had
trouble nailing down a serious agenda for the talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that any meeting between the two should be a
substantive one,'' he said. ``We don't view a meeting where the
primary purpose is to go over once again whether John McCain wants
to be vice president _ when everybody knows he does not _ falls
into the substantive category.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear whether the tensions between the two camps
would last long or how much Thursday's events were about gaining
the upper hand when the two men finally meet.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Allbaugh, Bush's campaign manager, and John Weaver, McCain's
political director, have been planning for several days to meet on
Friday in the office of former Sen. Bob Dole to pave the way for
the session. And such a meeting could defuse the tension. Dole will
not be present.
</P>
<P>
   The problems between the two camps surfaced as Bush was
stressing bipartisanship in a campaign appearance here, and Bush's
staff appeared to be taken by surprise. Mindy Tucker, a spokeswoman
for Bush, said that Karl Rove, his senior strategist, was still
planning for the meeting and knew of no obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to McCain, however, said the senator wanted to have
discussions about education reform, Social Security and the
military. And he said it didn't ``help the situation'' that Sam
Wyly, a Bush backer who paid for last-minute attack ads against
McCain on the environment, had been one of the honorary
vice-chairmen of a Republican fund-raiser that featured Bush on
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   McCain apparently grew concerned that Bush was simply looking
for a meaningless photo opportunity after reading a column by
Robert Novak that said that some of Bush's advisers were dreading
the meeting but going ahead with it as a matter of ceremony.
According to a report in Salon, an Internet publication, McCain
decided to cancel the meeting for that reason.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to Bush said that several officials with Bush's
campaign had talked on the telephone Thursday with McCain's
advisers to make sure there was not any misunderstanding about
Bush's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   They said that Bush indeed wanted a substantive discussion with
McCain and that they were conveying that to the senator's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign, said, ``The
governor is looking forward to the meeting as planned.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since he defeated McCain and became virtually assured of
the Republican nomination, Bush has sought to return to the center
and put the contentious tone of the primary behind him. He
continued that effort Thursday, praising the Democratic governor of
North Carolina for his commitment to raising student performance
and for his appointment of a Republican to head North Carolina's
State Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's kind words for Gov. Jim Hunt, capped a week in which he
has repeatedly highlighted bipartisanship and reached out to
Democrats to show that he could break the gridlock in Washington.
He told his party at its $21.3 million fund-raiser Wednesday night
that ``Americans have have seen a cycle of bitterness _ an arms
race of anger'' in Washington, which he vowed to change if elected.
</P>
<P>
   The governor delivered his latest pledge to work with the
opposition party while at North Carolina's fourth annual state
conference on improving achievement of minority and disadvantaged
students, highlighting an issue he has made a hallmark of his
candidacy. ``We're part of a movement,'' Bush told a vast hall full
of teachers and principals, who gave him a polite but subdued
reception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're part of a reform agenda,'' he said, ``which is by the
way a bipartisan agenda. We need to check partisanship at the door
when it comes to the education of our children.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said that as governor he had worked closely with both parties
and noted that Democrats in Texas had helped him work to improve
student achievement. In fact, he had a Democrat at his side this
afternoon _ B. Alexander Kress, a former president of the Dallas
school board who has become an education adviser to the Bush
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had not been for cooperative Democrats in our
Legislature we wouldn't have gotten what we've gotten,'' Bush said,
telling the North Carolina audience, ``That's why it's easy for me
to say about your governor, he's an education governor. He set the
tone for other governors. He's done a fine job and he picked a
Republican at that to be the education man in this state of Texas _
I mean, North Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to Phillip J. Kirk, named by Hunt to be
chairman of North Carolina's State Board of Education. And Bush's
kind words for Hunt were particularly symbolic because the North
Carolina governor is sometimes mentioned as a possible running mate
for Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also talked at some length Thursday about his call for
bipartisanship in an interview on the News Hour with Jim Lehrer,
the PBS program. Asked about reports that some Republicans had
chafed at his remarks at the fund-raiser Wednesday night, Bush
said, ``I want to make it clear to people in the Republican Party _
there were congressmen there _ there were senators there _ there
were, you know, contributors there _ there were hangers-on there; I
wanted to make it clear to them what my intentions are, and I
didn't ask at the door when people came in, you know, here's what
I'm going to say, do you think I should say it or not?''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would take Tom DeLay, for example, aside and say,
``Cool it,'' if DeLay was being overly partisan in future, Bush
said, ``I think Tom, himself, would sometimes say, gosh, he may
have gotten a little carried away in his rhetoric. But I like Tom.
I can work with Tom, and if the situation got so bitter or it was
heading to being bitter, I'd call in members and say, `Let's tone
the rhetoric because America is more important.' ''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 30)  
 (Eds: This article is in two parts)  
 By PETER PASSELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OJAI, Calif. _ When Volkswagen introduced the New Beetle in
1998, the press and public went ga-ga. The Love Bug was back _ this
time with all the amenities that baby boomers never knew they
needed when they were young, poor and blissfully ignorant of the
risks of traveling 100 feet a second in a tin can on wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only harsh words to be heard were aimed at its limp,
2-liter, 4-cylinder power plant, which pushed the 2,800-pound coupe
from zero to 60 mph in about 10 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   This defect was fixed last summer, when Volkswagen offered the
New Beetle with an optional turbo-charged engine, a 1.8-liter,
20-valve four-cylinder borrowed from the least expensive Audi A4
and the entry-level VW Passat. Does that make the Bug the perfect
people mover?
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. I'm among the multitudes who took part in the initial
love fest, and I remain a fan. But now that the novelty of driving
a '60s icon morphed into an elegant postmodern runabout is wearing
off, the New Beetle's limitations as basic transportation and as
road performer are more apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the good stuff. The silky turbo-charged engine found
on both the GLS 1.8T and the ``loaded'' GLX 1.8T, is a winner. With
150 horsepower _ 35 more than the 2-liter, normal-breathing base
engine _ the Beetle no longer feels sluggish.
</P>
<P>
   It reaches 60 mph from a stop in about 7.6 seconds, a very
respectable number for a car that can be had for less than $20,000.
More important, the modern little engine _ it has five valves for
each cylinder _ produces maximum torque (162 foot-pounds) at a
surprisingly low 2,200 rpm. That assures zippy acceleration when
you really need it _ say, if you are passing on a two-lane road _
with little ``turbo lag.'' With the five-speed manual, it means
less shifting in traffic. I found myself noodling along at 30 in
fourth gear with plenty of response in reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention gas mileage? This engine barely sips the stuff _ a
notable virtue with California's extra-clean premium fuel running
$1.90 a gallon. I averaged 28 mpg on a real-life mix of mountain
roads, freeways and urban traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The GLS 1.8T that I drove is smooth, comfortable and quiet. The
safety systems include confidence-inspiring antilock brakes,
standard on all New Beetles, as well as a computerized traction
control that uses both the brakes and the throttle to maintain
stability in dicey situations.
</P>
<P>
   As with all New Beetles, front-seat passengers enjoy an interior
that is as practical as it is beautiful. The cabin feels roomy and
the controls (lit in a gorgeous red and blue) are easily
accessible. The very adjustable seats are complemented by a
steering wheel that both tilts and telescopes.
</P>
<P>
   The standard radio-cassette combo produces truly excellent
sound. The plastics and metal trim are a tactile delight. And the
fit-and-finish is simply the best to be found in a $20,000 car,
though Consumer Reports found the number of electrical problems on
'99 models to be way out of line.
</P>
<P>
   What else is there not to like? While the 1.8T has plenty of
engine to run with true sport coupes like the Honda Civic Si and
VW's own Golf-based GTI, it doesn't have the handling. The steering
is precise, but lacks road feel. The suspension, nicely tuned for
comfort, complains _ albeit politely _ on hard curves.
</P>
<P>
   And the modest turbo lag, which is hardly noticeable in
straight-line acceleration, makes it a bit tricky to accelerate
smoothly through a curve. A spoiler above the rear window is
supposed to pop out at 93 mph to counteract the car's tendency to
lose contact with the ground at high speed, but I never went fast
enough to see if it made a difference.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the exaggerated curves of the roof line and
trunk compartment that give the New Beetle its distinctive ``come
out and play with me'' look, undermine the car's value as practical
transportation. Thanks to wide doors and front seats that
automatically move forward as the backs are tilted, adults can
squeeze into the back seat with relatively little trouble.
</P>
<P>
   But once ensconced in the rear, head room and leg room are
grossly inadequate. And while the rear seat does fold down to
expand the modest 12-square-foot capacity of the pass-through
trunk, no one would ever buy a New Beetle for the cargo space.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the New Beetle 1.8T is the perfect car for people who
get a kick out of driving a work of art, yet can live without great
handling or a real back seat. I'm still an admirer, but the bloom
is off the rose. &QL;

   Fresh Evidence of Growth Stokes Fear of Inflation
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. economy turned in another robust quarter, the
government reported, as new evidence emerged that today's
prosperity is finally pushing up labor costs, raising fear of
higher inflation. The gross domestic product, representing the
value of all goods and services produced in the nation, rose at a
5.4 percent annual rate. The broad inflation measure published with
the G.D.P. report rose by 3.2 percent, mainly because of higher
gasoline and fuel oil prices. And a measure of labor costs, the
Employment Cost Index, rose 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The quick pace of growth and signs of an acceleration in wage
and price increases all but guarantee that the Federal Reserve will
seriously consider raising rates by half a percentage point instead
of a quarter-point.
</P>
<P>
   Technology Shares Lead a Rally
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks regained market leadership, rising sharply and
shaking off economic reports suggesting that more interest rate
increases were on the way. The Nasdaq composite index rose 143.94
points, or nearly 4 percent, to 3,774.03. The Dow Jones industrial
average fell 57.40 points, or 0.5 percent, to 10,888.10. Earlier in
the session, the Dow was down as much as 197 points. The Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index increased 3.93 points, to 1,464.92.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T Wireless Shares Rise 8 Percent
</P>
<P>
   The tracking stock for AT&AMP;T's wireless unit opened at $30.125 a
share before closing up 8 percent, at $31.6875 in trading of 124.7
million shares on the New York Stock Exchange. That made for the
second-busiest trading day yet for an individual Big Board stock.

   WPP in Talks With Young &AMP; Rubicam

   In a deal that would combine two of the world's largest
advertising companies, WPP Group of Britain, which owns Ogilvy &AMP;
Mather Worldwide and J. Walter Thompson, acknowledged that it was
in talks to buy Young &AMP; Rubicam. But Y&AMP;R is also discussing a
combination with Publicis of France.
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom Earnings Rise 80 Percent
</P>
<P>
   MCI WorldCom said that its first-quarter profit rose 80 percent,
to $1.3 billion, or 44 cents a share, just ahead of Wall Street
expectations, amid strong growth in its data, Internet and
international operations.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna Posts 16 Percent Gain in Profit
</P>
<P>
   Aetna, the nation's largest health insurance company, said that
its first-quarter operating profit rose 16 percent, helped by
reduced losses at its Prudential Health Care unit and a rebound in
international business, including financial services in Asia and
Latin America. The results strengthen the hand of William
Donaldson, the recently appointed chief executive, who was expected
to face sharp questioning by shareholders at the annual meeting
Friday in Hartford.

300 PEOPLE FOUND STRANDED ON ISLAND IN BAHAMAS

<TEXT>
<P>
   More than 300 people believed to be Haitian migrants were
discovered stranded on an uninhabited island in the southern
Bahamas on Wednesday evening, 14 of them dead and dozens severely
dehydrated and suffering from hypothermia, said a spokesman for the
U.S. Coast Guard, which sent boats and helicopters to rescue them
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The voyagers told Coast Guard officials that they had been in a
50-foot boat that ran aground near the island, Flamingo Cay, 150
miles southeast of Nassau in the Bahamas, said a Coast Guard
spokesman, Jibran Soto.
</P>
<P>
   The details of how the migrants were stranded remained sketchy
Thursday night, Soto said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know whether the vessel sank or it just dropped them
off,'' he said. ``There was no vessel nearby, and we don't know how
long they were there.''
</P>
<P>
   The group was discovered Wednesday evening by three sailboats
passing the island, which then radioed the Coast Guard at 7:30
p.m., Soto said. A doctor aboard one of the sailboats went ashore
and described for officials a scene of death and desperate illness.
</P>
<P>
   Two helicopters arrived from the Bahamas 90 minutes later to
find more than 300 people, 14 dead. That night, 48 of the sickest
people were evacuated to hospitals in the Bahamas and Miami.
Thursday morning two Coast Guard cutters, the Farallon and the
Manitou, arrived from Miami Beach and helped to evacuate 17 more.
Two more cutters also left Miami Beach Thursday morning, equipped
with food, water and medicine, to join the rescue effort.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahamian government also dispatched a cutter and planned to
take over the rescue efforts, since the island is in Bahamian
waters, between Flamingo Cay and the Ragged Island chain, said
Karen Kraushaar, a spokeswoman for the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. The Coast Guard plans to keep rescue
vessels there until Bahamian officials can take over.
</P>
<P>
   The Bahamas have become a common way station _ and their waters
a potential graveyard in recent years _ for Haitians fleeing to the
United States. Some have paid Bahamian smugglers for a spot on
dangerously overcrowded boats, which have sunk. And in 1995,
smugglers threw 100 Haitians overboard to lighten a boat headed for
the Bahamas. All those migrants were believed to have drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Political repression, violence and searing poverty have led
Haitians to flee in great numbers. Last year, the Coast Guard
intercepted 480 Haitians trying to enter the United States and
1,437 in 1998.

ROCK-SOLID VALUES AT REINVENTION'S CORE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Questions may be italicized) 
 By FRED ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David P. Pottruck, co-author of ``Clicks and Mortar,'' is
president and co-chief executive of Charles Schwab, the huge
securities firm widely recognized as a pioneer in embracing the
Internet. In a recent interview, he talked about the Internet and
corporate values. Following are excerpts from the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Does the Internet make it harder to do business? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We used to reinvent the company about every 10 years. Now it
seems like we have to reinvent our company every two years. I heard
Warren Buffett give a speech two days ago. He said: ``I reward my
managers for building a moat around our castle and then making the
moat deeper, wider and filling it with alligators. I look at our
company as a castle, the castle of capital. Other people want to
take our castle away and take our capital away. And we want this
moat around the company.''
</P>
<P>
   And somebody said to me, ``What do you do?'' I said: ``Well, we
don't have a moat. I keep trying to move the castle. As people get
closer to my castle, I've got to move my castle over here. I've got
to constantly reinvent how we serve customers better, faster, more
value, more service _ reinvent what service means.''
</P>
<P>
   But in doing all that, the values of the company don't change.
So the employees, even the customers, feel that something is
constant, that they know what Schwab stands for. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Some Wall Street houses take pride that their best
``producers'' might earn more than the chief executive. Would that
fit Schwab? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. No, no. One thing we don't have is a star system. We don't
have ``producers.'' We never use that phrase _ ever. The whole
notion of producers is that someone owns their own business and
operates within this larger context of a company, but they have
their own little customers.
</P>
<P>
   That's not how we operate at Schwab. It's much more of a
teamwork environment in which people work together. And they don't
own the customer _ the company owns the customer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. But can pay promote teamwork? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, the bonus pool is created by corporate success. So you
can be the biggest producer in the company; you can be the biggest
contributor. But if the corporation pool is zero, your bonus is
zero. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. But if 75 people or 7 people are working on a project, does
their pay depend on their overall accomplishment? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. All the above. Corporate success, team success, then
individual contributions. So corporate success defines the pool.
Team success defines the team's pool, and individual contributions
to the team determine how the pool is divided among the team.
</P>
<P>
   We have a little fund, extra money, because if it all has to net
to zero, then if I give you more, I've got to take it from him. It
becomes a zero sum game, you against him. That doesn't work. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What's new, what's constant about the Internet?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Budgeting, planning, marketing, leadership, change
management, innovation _ these things have always mattered. Great
companies always did these things well. But in an Internet world,
the speed at which we do them and the impact of constant change
make those jobs different.
</P>
<P>
   Your budgeting system today can't be the same as the budgeting
system of a few years ago. It's got to be more flexible. We are
reinventing our budget every month.
</P>
<P>
   Priorities, competitive advantage, competitive situations change
with a speed we've never seen before. Decision-making, therefore,
must change at a speed we've never seen before.
</P>
<P>
   I've had people come to me from dot-com companies and say, ``We
don't use those old systems of measurement, project budgets; we
just make a decision and go.'' Companies that do that are going to
go down the drain. You still have to have measurements. You just
can't take months and months to figure it out. But you still need a
road map to go from here to there.

ARGENTINA'S PRESIDENT WINS REFORM OF RIGID LABOR CODE
</HEADLINE>
  By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina _ The opposition-controlled Argentine
Senate has given President Fernando de la Rua a much-needed lift by
passing his labor reform bill, which is intended to lower the 14
percent unemployment rate by reducing labor costs for businesses
and curtailing the power of big labor.
</P>
<P>
   The overwhelming vote of approval on Wednesday night capped six
weeks of intense political maneuvering and sometimes violent labor
union protests that made the new de la Rua government look
increasingly inept as Cabinet ministers publicly second-guessed
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, de la Rua managed to persuade the opposition to
pass what is his most important legislative project. The law should
go a long way toward shaking up a rigid labor code that was
introduced in the 1950s by President Juan Domingo Peron. That code
invested most power in one big national labor confederation and
undercut any renegotiating of labor rules and salaries when
business conditions changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very content,'' de la Rua told reporters. ``It's a law
that will contribute to the development of small- and medium-sized
business and work in Argentina.''
</P>
<P>
   The new labor code is intended to encourage businesses to hire
more people at lower costs.
</P>
<P>
   Large companies will be allowed to increase the probationary
period for new hires to up to six months from the current 30 days
and small businesses to one year, after which workers can be
dismissed without benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Payroll taxes on new hires will be reduced to 12 percent from
17.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bill had been blocked four times in the Senate and seemed
again in jeopardy only last week. Leaders of the Peronist
opposition called off debate of the measure on April 19 after a
confrontation between federal police officers and labor union
dissidents in front of the Congress building left 35 union
supporters injured.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen police officers were arrested for brutality, and
contradictory comments by senior de la Rua aides made it appear
that the government was unable to control its own security forces.
</P>
<P>
   Hugo Moyano, a truck driver and union leader who led last week's
protests, threatened to shut down congressional debate again, but
was persuaded by political allies to hold a peaceful demonstration
instead. He has called for a national strike on May 5 to protest
the new measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only objective of this labor reform is to bring down the
salaries of the workers,'' Moyano said. He pledged that workers
would punish the senators who supported the bill by voting against
them in congressional elections next year.
</P>
<P>
   Moyano and other national labor leaders had more power under the
old labor code, which required that most labor negotiations be held
at the national level to include all workers of particular economic
sectors. That system will now be replaced by negotiations at the
local and company level and will take into consideration peculiar
regional conditions and the ability of individual firms to pay wage
increases.
</P>
<P>
   The new law will also eliminate a system known here as
``ultra-activity,'' which stipulated that an old contract stands
when a business and a union cannot successfully negotiate a new
contract. This rule gave unions a major incentive not to negotiate
when companies were pushing for lower salaries or new work rules
because of a change in economic conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Peronists in the Senate agreed to pass the bill
only after including a provision that will prohibit wages from
being lowered for two years. But that clause could still be
excluded by the lower house of Congress by a two-thirds vote when
the bill is finally enacted into law in the next few days. The
lower house, which is controlled by de la Rua's coalition, has
already overwhelmingly passed a slightly different version of the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate action was welcomed Thursday on Wall Street, where
enthusiasm for the Argentine economy and stock market have cooled
considerably because of two deep recessions in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will bring a major long-term structural benefit for the
Argentine economy,'' said Geoff Dennis, Smith Barney's Latin
American equity strategist. ``Argentina has had an extremely high
unemployment rate even when the economy was going well because of
all the costs of taking on new labor. This reform will encourage
unemployment to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Most economists say the new law will probably have only a modest
immediate impact on an economy that is fitfully emerging from a
deep two-year slump. Construction activity actually fell by 5.8
percent in March compared with the same month last year. And while
higher oil and farm prices have helped increase export earnings,
domestic spending remains in the doldrums, leaving a broad
perception that the economy is not responding to de la Rua's
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, political analysts here said, the opposition
Peronists decided to go along with the labor reform rather than
risk being blamed for high unemployment in next year's
congressional election campaign.

<P>
   DALLAS _ Sharks captain and leading goal scorer Owen Nolan did
not skate at yesterday's team practice. He's not injured. He's just
a little sore.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still got the Al MacInnis shot block,'' Sharks coach
Darryl Sutter said laughing. ``It takes more than 24 hours to get
over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nolan had six goals and eight points in helping the Sharks knock
off top-seeded St. Louis in seven games. But in the third period of
Game 7, with the Blues gaining momentum and on a power play, Nolan
went to the ice feet first to block a MacInnis `rocket.'
</P>
<P>
   MacInnis' slap shot slammed off the top of Nolan's skate. In
typical playoff form, Sutter was elusive as to what part of Nolan's
body was ailing and how badly, but he said Nolan won't miss any
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll be fine,'' Sutter said.  &QL; 
No hard feelings
</P>
<P>
   Sharks winger Todd Harvey, who played for the Stars from
1994-98, said it was disappointing not to be playing with the team
during last season's march to the Stanley Cup, but he holds no
grudges.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' he said. ``That's hockey and that's
business; that's in any professional sport. I've moved on and the
Stars have moved on. I'm happy to be in San Jose and getting the
chance to play in the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvey went from Dallas to the New York Rangers and then to San
Jose earlier this season in a three-way deal that sent Radek Dvorak
to New York and Sharks goalie Mike Vernon to Florida.
\Nsubheds:Goalie makes comeback Sharks goalie Steve Shields' clutch
performance in Game 7 against St. Louis not only quieted a lot of
critics, it also gave his teammates added confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time for me to see him react to a bad
performance \Rin the playoffs\S,'' center Vincent Damphousse said.
``He was able to put that aside and come back with a strong
performance. That says a lot for a goaltender.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Darryl Sutter said he always had faith in Shields.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big quandary was after Game 6, where they were going to
bury him in some unknown grave somewhere,'' Sutter joked. ``He was
ready for Game 7. You knew how he was going to play.''  &QL; 
No gambling here
</P>
<P>
   Even though the Stars are only 2-for-26 on the power play,
Darryl Sutter said that will not encourage his team to take
unnecessary chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``I don't want to see Sergei Zubov, Darryl
Sydor, Mike Modano, Joe Nieuwendyk and Brett Hull out on the ice
when we only have four guys.''  &QL; 
Staying put
</P>
<P>
   If Darryl Sutter keeps his lines intact from the first round,
veteran Dave Lowry will play left wing on the first line with
center Vincent Damphousse and right wing Owen Nolan. Sutter dropped
winger Jeff Friesen to the second line with center Marco Sturm and
Todd Harvey to make room for Lowry.
</P>
<P>
   Lowry's job against St. Louis: badger Chris Pronger. Get ready
Derian Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a huge part \Rof beating St. Louis\S. He really made
Chris Pronger come unglued quite a bit,'' defenseman Jeff Norton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Stern replaced Alexander Korolyuk on the fourth line to
bring a nastier edge in Games 6 and 7. He joined center Ron Sutter
and Tony Granato.Darryl Sutter was mum on how he would construct
his lines against the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we stick with it, we stick with it,'' he said. ``I don't
think we're that good a team that we can make the other team adjust
to us, we have to adjust to them.''

DIESEL FUEL IS NOT NECESSARILY A BARGAIN  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIE DUNN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prices may be dropping at the pump, but diesel fuel still isn't
the deal it used to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 2000, we've seen a huge increase in diesel prices, 40
percent in the past couple of months,'' said Bob Costello, chief
economist for the American Trucking Associations in Washington.
``We're in a situation where diesel inventories are extremely
tight. We have no room for mistakes. I think we're definitely in
for more increases.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, John Litchblau, chairman of the Petroleum
Industry Research Foundation in New York, predicted that diesel
prices would keep falling, as they have in recent weeks. ``Prices
will go down in the near future, not very drastically, but the
trend is now downward.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The national average was $1.43 a gallon last week, up 3 cents
after falling for five consecutive weeks, according to the Energy
Information Administration. That compared with $1.48 for regular
gasoline. Diesel reached a high of $1.50 in March. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the national average for diesel was $1.13, the trucking
group said.
</P>
<P>
   Diesel is more energy efficient than gasoline, and it produces
better mileage. But it concerns environmentalists because of its
high sulfur content. Sulfur levels and emissions for diesel fuel
are regulated by the Environmental Protection Agency and have
decreased by 90 percent since 1988. New regulations are about to be
proposed to reduce sulfur even more, to 30 parts per million, from
300.

DODGERS SWEPT BY BRAVES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A wonderful road trip turned horrid. An explosive
offense was rendered a dud. An energetic team is now thankful to be
heading home.
</P>
<P>
   Having mustered nothing offensively for 36 innings, the Los
Angeles Dodgers showed some life in their final three innings on
the road only to misfire at the most important time and fall to the
Atlanta Braves 6-3 Thursday at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, off to a fast 9-3 start on the road this season,
have crashed. They began this six-game trip with three straight
victories over Cincinnati, only to lose three to the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Atlanta has won 10 straight games, including a
franchise-record 9-0 homestand.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves the Dodgers, once 11-6, at 11-10 and longing for
traffic jams, smog and home-sweet-Dodger Stadium. They open a
nine-game homestand today, having matched the Chicago Cubs for most
road games played in the majors leagues at 16.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the nine road wins are tops in baseball, most of the
players admitted to feeling fatigued, particularly mentally, and
wanting to go home. No wonder: They went from Cincinnati to New
York for a day before traveling to Atlanta for three games.
</P>
<P>
   That came after L.A. opened the season with a 10-game road trip
to Montreal, New York and San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're a little drained and it definitely showed,''
Grudzielanek said. ``We lacked probably a little enthusiasm and we
were beat, I guess. The trip was a tough one and it's going to be
good to go home for a little over a week now. We were flat the last
few days and it probably started in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   However, after snoozing through a pair of 1-0 shutouts and then
scoring just one run Wednesday, the Dodgers finally got a few
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   And then wasted them. They left a season-high 14 runners on
base, including the bases loaded in three of the last four innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around baseball long enough to know if you go out
and kill somebody like we did the Reds over the weekend, you're
going to have a little lack of runs,'' Dodgers pitcher Jeff Shaw
said. ``Maybe we used them all up in Cincinnati, but it was bound
to happen. We're not going to score 12 runs a night.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers didn't get a runner past first base until the sixth
inning. By then, the Braves had built a 2-0 lead off Chan Ho Park,
who was bothered by the blister that formed on the middle finger of
his right hand in his last start.
</P>
<P>
   Park (3-2) tied a career high with seven walks and was in
trouble throughout. He was hesitant to throw his curveball until
the middle innings. The Braves broke through with four runs in the
sixth, the final three of which came on Chipper Jones' one-out
homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new skin was kind of a weak skin, so I was worried about a
new blister,'' Park said. ``I'm supposed to forget about that and
just concentrate, but I was thinking about two different things:
pitching and the blister.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers loaded the bases with two outs after Eric Karros'
two-run homer in the eighth pulled the Dodgers within 6-3, but
Grudzielanek grounded back to the pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   It was worse in the ninth. The man everybody loves to hate
outside of Atlanta, John Rocker, allowed a leadoff single to Gary
Sheffield and walked Shawn Green and Karros to load the bases with
none out.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker then struck out Adrian Beltre, Chad Kreuter and Kevin
Elster for his fourth save. Terry Mulholland (3-2) pitched seven
innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't blame it; there's no fatigue,'' Kreuter said. ``It's
just that we didn't get it done. That's the bottom line. You can't
blame it on fatigue because we had a long road trip. That's
nothing. You get the same amount of rest here as you do anywhere
else.''

SURGERY OR RADIATION: GIULIANI'S CHOICES FOR TREATING HIS PROSTATE
CANCER

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Whatever therapy Mayor Rudolph Giuliani chooses for
his early prostate cancer, it will probably interrupt his
campaigning temporarily but should not prevent him from running for
the Senate, cancer experts said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The two basic choices are surgery to remove the prostate and
radiation. Some patients choose to wait for a much longer period
while the cancer is further monitored. But Giuliani indicted at a
news conference Thursday that he was unlikely to wait a substantial
time before initiating therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Michael J. Droller, chairman of urology at Mt. Sinai
Hospital, said that Giuliani ``could resume his mayoral duties and
campaigning efforts beginning about three weeks after surgery or
during radiation treatments.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani could handle the office work, climb stairs and fly in
airplanes early on, but after surgery, physical activity like
lifting would be limited for about another month, Droller, who is
not involved in Giuliani's case, said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was two full months before Joe Torre, the manager
of the New York Yankees, returned to the dugout after undergoing
surgery for prostate cancer in St. Louis on March 18, 1999. But
experts said Thursday that, depending on circumstances, Giuliani's
recovery could be much shorter.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David G. McLeod, the chief urologist at Walter Reed Army
Medical Center who operated on former Sen. Bob Dole for prostate
cancer in 1991 and is not involved in Giuliani's case, said that if
Giuliani is treated ``this early in the campaign schedule, by
mid-summer he should be able to hit his stride.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the cancer is caught early enough, by this time next year
it will be a bad memory,'' said McLeod.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he will review his therapy options over the next
two to three weeks with his doctors and friends who have had the
disease. The delay is not significant because prostate cancer is
not an emergency like a heart attack and most such cancers are slow
growing. Many doctors advise individuals with newly diagnosed
prostate cancer to take time to weigh the risks and benefits of
each type of therapy.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 180,400 American men will be diagnosed with
prostate cancer this year, making it the second most common type of
cancer in men, following skin cancer. The prostate is a
walnut-sized gland anatomically situated behind the penis, in front
of the rectum and under the urinary bladder.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said his cancer was detected at an early stage, chiefly
the result of a blood test known as PSA for prostate specific
antigen. The diagnosis was confirmed by a biopsy performed
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of therapy depends in part on an individual's age,
general state of health, aggressiveness of the cancer and fear of
surgery. Another factor is the preference of the doctor advising a
patient; doctors tend to be biased in favor of what their specialty
does.
</P>
<P>
   For individuals in their fifties, Dr. Herbert Lepor, chief of
urology at New York University, said most urologists advise
surgical removal of the prostate because if the cancer is confined
to the gland, the problem is usually solved.
</P>
<P>
   As a white American male, Giuliani, who will be 56 on May 28,
has a life expectancy of another 23.5 years, according to the U.S.
Vital Statistics Report.
</P>
<P>
   Lepor said surgery to remove a prostate usually takes about one
and one-half hours. As part of the operation, surgeons usually
remove lymph nodes so a pathologist can look for evidence of
spread. Most individuals go home from the hospital in a few days
after removal of a cancerous prostate if there are no complications
like excessive bleeding or infection. Many can work during recovery
and resume unrestricted physical activity in about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The two main long-term complications of the operation are
urinary incontinence and impotence. To preserve sexual potency,
urologists take care to spare two vital nerves. Drugs like Viagra
help improve potency in those who have such problems after prostate
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation therapy for prostate cancer is generally given every
working day for eight weeks. The patient generally spends about an
hour in the hospital, can work the rest of the day, but needs to
stay in town unless the radiation is given in the form of seeds
that are implanted in the gland, said Dr. Silvia Formenti, the
chairman of radiation oncology at New York University. Radiation
spares the time needed for surgery and recuperation. Side effects
are usually mild, Formenti said.
</P>
<P>
   Chances of cure are high, in the 80 to 95 percent range for
early cancer, but depend on details that Giuliani and his
urologist, Alexander M. Kirschenbaum of Mt. Sinai Hospital of Mt.
Sinai NYU Health, did not disclose.
</P>
<P>
   Among such details are the specific findings of the PSA test and
the Gleason score, a standard system that pathologists use to gauge
the aggressiveness of a prostate cancer. Because no single test
provides an accurate diagnosis or prognosis, doctors use a
combination of the PSA, Gleason score and how the texture of the
prostate feels to their fingertip when they perform a rectal
examination. Suspicions of a cancer are raised if a doctor feels a
nodule in the prostate.
</P>
<P>
   The PSA level is generally considered normal when it is below 4
nanograms per mililiter. But about one in four men with prostate
cancer have a low PSA, the American Cancer Society says.
</P>
<P>
   The Gleason score is measured on a scale from 2 to 10, and it is
based on a pathologist's evaluation of the cellular patterns of two
prominent types seen under the microscope. In general, the lower
the Gleason score, the better the chance of cure.
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference Thursday, Giuliani said that his PSA
level was elevated. A source familiar with the case said that the
mayor's Gleason score was in the middle range, and the prostate
felt normal.
</P>
<P>
   In monitoring a patient's prostate, doctors are more suspicious
of cancer if the PSA level in the blood rises quickly over time.
Giuliani did not say how often he has had a PSA test and did not
specify the last previous test before two and one-half weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's Gleason score was calculated on the basis of a piece
of prostate that was removed in the biopsy and then examined by a
quick pathological technique known as a frozen section. Sometimes
the degree of aggressiveness and extent of prostate cancer differ
when the tissue is examined in a standard way after it is placed in
a chemical. Such results would be expected by the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's situation is different than when his father was
diagnosed with prostate cancer about 30 years ago and died of it at
age 73. The PSA test was not widely used in medicine until the
1990s and there has been extensive debate about its value as a
screening test.
</P>
<P>
   Because many prostate cancers are believed to have a low
probability of spreading elsewhere in the body, many experts debate
whether widespread use of PSA is leading to more aggressive
prostate therapy in men who might otherwise not need it. Until the
question is answered scientifically, many doctors and patients are
choosing to undergo surgery or radiation.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a mixed decision in the Elian Gonzalez case, a
federal appeals court Thursday put off a request by the boy's
father to serve as his sole legal representative, which would have
effectively ended the court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But, in a blow to the boy's Miami relatives, the court also
denied the family's request for regular visits with the 6-year-old
Cuban boy and dismissed their request for the appointment of a
neutral guardian.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, a psychiatrist and a social worker, both appointed by
the government, will monitor the boy and send the court regular
reports on his condition and care, an arrangement that was first
suggested by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge panel also ruled that his father, Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, had the right to intervene in the battle over whether his
son went back to Cuba or stayed here.
</P>
<P>
   By offering the twin rulings, the court made two points clear:
it did not want to dismiss the case before it had a full airing on
May 11, and it did not want the boy's Miami great-uncle Lazaro
Gonzalez to overstep his authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was obvious that Craig attempted to get into the
ballgame,'' said Richard Sharpstein, a lawyer for the Miami
relatives, referring to Gregory Craig, who represents Juan Miguel
Gonzalez. ``But he also wanted to take the ball and go home, and
the court said no. At this time, they will defer on that.''
</P>
<P>
   The greater legal question surrounding the case _ whether Elian
has a right to apply for asylum on his own or whether his father
speaks for him _ will be presented before the 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Atlanta on May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts offered mixed interpretations of Thursday's ruling
on the legal challenge brought by Lazaro Gonzalez. Some said the
ruling denying his request for a neutral guardian and regular
visitation did not bode well for his case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of the death knell for Lazaro Gonzalez for a
couple of reasons,'' said Michael Maggio, an immigration lawyer in
Washington. ``By refusing to appoint a guardian, the court is
beginning to foreshadow that there is no standing in this case for
Lazaro Gonzalez. I think this case will be thrown out on the
standing issue.''
</P>
<P>
   But others said the rulings did not bear directly on the
substance of the case, and said little about the end result.
</P>
<P>
   ``By itself, it does not answer any of the questions that are
pending,'' said Elliott Lichtman, an immigration lawyer in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In its ruling, the appellate court panel said it was
``hesitant'' to grant Juan Miguel Gonzalez the right to intervene
in the case at this late date, but agreed to the request because he
was the boy's father. One of the three judges dissented, arguing
that the request came too late and that the Immigration and
Naturalization Service ``adequately represents'' Juan Miguel
Gonzalez's interests.
</P>
<P>
   The court also said it would be ``premature'' to decide whether
the boy's father should serve as Elian's sole representative. That
motion, the judges ruled, will be wrapped into the overall case.
</P>
<P>
   With Elian cocooned at the Wye River estate on the Eastern Shore
of Maryland, about 70 miles outside Washington, along with his
father, stepmother and infant half brother, four of the boy's
kindergarten classmates arrived Thursday at Dulles International
Airport on a private plane to join him. Elian is not permitted to
leave the country until the appellate court rules on his
great-uncle's claim.
</P>
<P>
   In a gesture underscoring Havana's interest in both the case and
Elian, Cuban President Fidel Castro bade the four children goodbye
just before they climbed aboard a jet bound from Havana to
Washington, Reuters reported. A pediatrician and the mothers of
three of the children accompanied them on their voyage, and one
child's father is scheduled to follow. The entourage arrived
wearing crimson blazers and waving Cuban flags, on the heels of two
other visitors, Elian's cousin and his kindergarten teacher.
</P>
<P>
   A Cuban government communique Thursday night said that one of
the physicians traveling with the schoolchilden had medication
confiscated by customs officials, and that Cuban officials in
Washington had sent a protest letter to President Clinton and the
immigration service.
</P>
<P>
   With the Senate scheduled to hold a hearing on Wednesday on the
raid by armed federal agents who removed Elian from the house in
Little Havana where he was staying with some of his Miami
relatives, Attorney General Janet Reno again defended her decision
to order the predawn raid. The Justice Department also supplied
figures on how much the Elian case has cost the department,
something several senators wondered about this week.
</P>
<P>
   The case has cost more than $578,000 since Thanksgiving Day,
when Elian was picked up in the Atlantic off Florida. The
preliminary figures do not include costs for Elian's four-day stay
at Andrews Air Force Base.

</P>
<P>
   Reno, who grew teary-eyed during the weekly news conference,
attempted to bolster her decision by suggesting that the heavily
armed agents faced a hostile crowd.
</P>
<P>
   One immigration agent, Betty Mills, the woman who rushed Elian
into a waiting van, was nearly thrown to the ground as she
approached the house, and someone inside the house locked the front
door and then slid a couch in front of it, Reno said. The agents
had no choice but to ram through the front door, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Had she not acted on Saturday before dawn, word of the raid
would have spread, Reno said, and the opportunity would have been
lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``They thought they could ignore us, and we had tried to be very
patient with them to effect a voluntary transfer, and then the time
comes and the law must be enforced,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives in Miami, and their supporters, have provided
sharply different accounts of the raid, saying armed agents
barreled through the door without announcing themselves, sprayed
pepper gas on bystanders and held others inside the house at
gunpoint while they seized Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to sort out the various descriptions of the raid and
question its legality, the Senate Judiciary Committee is likely to
call Reno to testify, along with a group of civic leaders who were
involved in last-minute negotiations with the attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami on Thursday, Mayor Joe Carollo fired the city manager,
Donald Warshaw, who refused to dismiss the Miami police chief for
not warning the mayor about the Saturday morning raid.
</P>
<P>
   The police chief, William O'Brien, learned of the raid just
before it happened but did not inform the mayor, who had made it
clear that he sided with the boy's Miami relatives in defiance of
the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Carollo said he had lost all confidence in his police chief, but
Warshaw balked at carrying out his wishes. The mayor added,
however, that he did not fire Warshaw because of the Elian raid,
but because he had been saying bad things about him to others in
City Hall.

SHARKS SAY BLUES' DEMISE NO FLUKE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Owen Nolan said the dirtiest F-word an underdog can
hear _ ``fluke''.
</P>
<P>
   He was talking about his Game 7-winning goal. The knuckler from
near center ice buried Blues goalie Roman Turek and gave the San
Jose Sharks a 2-0 lead at the first-period siren in a 3-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a fluke, a crazy goal,'' the Sharks' winger called it.
``Another fluky goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Another fluky goal in a long line of them in a fluky series. The
seemingly annual case of the seasonlong underachiever suddenly
overachieving and knocking off the complacent top seed. A nice
story, but welcome back to reality and to the defending champion
Stars.
</P>
<P>
   A fluke? The Sharks aren't buying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't beat the best team in hockey by luck,'' Sharks
center Vincent Damphousse said yesterday after the team's practice
at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to win to prove we belonged, and now we have to do it
again,'' Sharks winger and former Stars player Todd Harvey said.
``We know we have to bring our A-game.''
</P>
<P>
   That game is the composed and disciplined, yet gritty and
abrasive style they shoved down the Blues' throats for much of that
seven-game series. It's the game plan Sharks players advertised
yesterday for tonight's Game 1 of the Western Conference
semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to frustrate them. We have to get in front of \RJoe\S
Nieuwendyk, in front of \RMike\S Modano and slow them down and clog
up that neutral zone, as they do, and play in their zone,'' Sharks
defenseman Jeff Norton said. ``We want to crash and bang and try to
rattle the \RDerian\S Hatchers and \RDarryl\S Sydors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not pretty hockey, but you know, we're capable of
frustrating and playing a real fast game out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Louis series is proof. The Sharks manhandled the Blues,
physically whipped them and got them on their heels. Grinders like
Bryan Marchment and Mike Ricci, and in Games 6 and 7, Ron Stern,
came off the bench to act like a nasty rash that badgered Blues
powerhouse defenseman Chris Pronger. And while the Sharks agitated,
Pronger and the Blues seemed to flinch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we won that series is because we played with more
composure than St. Louis,'' Sharks coach Darryl Sutter said.
</P>
<P>
   Pronger spent a playoff-leading 32 minutes in the penalty box.
He had seven points, but finished even in the plus-minus rating
after posting a mind-blowing, NHL-best plus-52 in the regular
season. The Sharks will try the same get-in-your-head routine on
Stars captain Hatcher and their top skill players.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a lot of battling along the boards,''
Hatcher said. ``They're not going to give us anything, I'll tell
you that much.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Stars forward Scott Thornton: ``They play desperate at all
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Norton: ``That's what it's all about, throwing the puck at
the net and getting ugly goals. That's when teams are successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks don't enter the series carrying any psychological
baggage against the Stars as Edmonton did. The Sharks took four of
six from the defending champs in the regular season, including two
of three at Reunion Arena, although both victories came in the
first three months of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had gone 0-for-whatever against them, then we might be
thinking, `Geez, what do we have to do?''' Norton said. ``We know
that doesn't mean anything right now unless we execute. We have to
dictate our game. If we do that, we can be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Flukier things have happened.

FEDERAL AUTHORITIES SAID TO BE PREPARING TO ROUT PROTESTERS ON
VIEQUES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prodded by the Pentagon, federal authorities are
preparing a sea-and-land law enforcement operation next week on
Vieques, a small island off Puerto Rico, to clear demonstrators
from a Navy bombing range there, government officials said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations to move a large number of federal special weapons
and tactics teams to Vieques are under way less than a week after
armed immigration officers stormed a house in which the Cuban boy
Elian Gonzalez was staying with his great-uncle in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   As the furor over the Miami operation continues, Attorney
General Janet Reno has been planning the much larger and
potentially risky operation in Vieques. She has met with the
director of the FBI, Louis Freeh, whose agents would play a central
role in the assault, and with Defense Secretary William Cohen, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vieques protesters have been demonstrating against an
agreement reached on Jan. 31 by President Clinton and Gov. Pedro
Rosello of Puerto Rico. The deal allowed the Navy to conduct
limited exercises on Vieques in exchange for an American promise to
abide by a referendum in Puerto Rico on whether to close the range.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that most days 50 to 75 protesters were
camped on the island in the path of aircraft on bombing runs. Their
ranks are expected to swell as knowledge of a pending operation
spreads. Protesters are expected to arrive by boat and congregate
at entry gates to the base.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, a Pentagon spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, said
the Pentagon had been consulting with other government
organizations but would not discuss the status of the law
enforcement operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in consultation with the Puerto Rican government,
with the Department of Justice, to work out a way to clear the
range of the trespassers,'' Quigley said. ``That process continues,
and I am just not going to go into any further detail on that
process at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Several civilian federal agencies are involved in the law
enforcement operation, the officials said. Among them are the
Treasury Department and the Transportation Department, which has
jurisdiction over the Coast Guard, which would help block the
flotillas of demonstrators expected to arrive by sea from Puerto
Rico.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that federal authorities are prepared to
clear the bombing range, but have expressed serious reservations
about the operation, which is scheduled for next week if the White
House approves it.
</P>
<P>
   They said Pentagon officials had been insistent that the Navy
needed the bombing range for training exercises, even though
Justice Department officials have said another military-style
assault would provoke another avalanche of criticism of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they feared that neither the FBI nor federal
marshals were adequately prepared for such a large-scale
enforcement action so far from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   The operation would take place over a large area in which there
would be virtually no chance for a surprise raid, on beaches and
open terrain including some areas where live munitions are thought
to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the officials said, they feared the law enforcement
operation would provoke demonstrations in other parts of Puerto
Rico, and that local authorities were unprepared for large-scale
disruptions.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tactical plan, the officials said, Marines would
arrive aboard ships to provide perimeter security, but only after
the operation, and the Puerto Rican police would be responsible for
crowd control.
</P>
<P>
   When the arrangement between the White House and Puerto Rico was
announced, Rossello said he would help federal efforts to stop
trespassing at the bombing range, but little action has been taken
against the protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Exercises on Vieques, where the Navy maintains a bombing range
that it considers essential to the training of its Atlantic fleet,
were suspended last spring after a wayward bomb killed a civilian
security guard, an accident that intensified longtime protests
against the military presence.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has been putting pressure on the Justice Department
to clear the bombing range of protesters. Earlier this year, an
aircraft carrier battle group had to conduct some training
exercises in different places, including using a bombing range in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   The next carrier group, led by the George Washington, is headed
to sea in coming months and the Navy is eager to use the range,
which officials say offers the ideal location for coordinating
air-ground-and-sea training exercises.

EDITORIAL: THE REMEDY FOR MICROSOFT  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial Friday, April 28:
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department is expected to propose to Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson Friday that he break Microsoft in two _ a dramatic
remedy for the antitrust violations that he recently ruled the
company had committed. A breakup might seem to be overkill. But the
inconvenient truth is that less drastic remedies are apt to be less
effective and might involve government or court officials taking a
permanent oversight role in the American software industry,
hampering its evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is the latest target of antitrust laws designed to
prohibit companies from conspiring by way of mergers, contracts or
other forms of cooperation to reduce consumer choice. Though the
laws do not outlaw monopolies, they do prohibit a single company
from deliberately creating or maintaining a monopoly through
anti-competitive practices rather than simply selling a product
that is better or cheaper than someone else's product. The laws,
which are generally stricter in the United States than in other
industrialized countries, have been used with uneven results to go
after industry giants like Standard Oil, Alcoa, IBM and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The federal proposal, which a majority of the 19 states suing
Microsoft are expected to endorse, raises profound questions about
the government's role in the new economy. Can, and should, laws
designed to manage the emergence of industrial and natural-resource
monopolies in the late 19th and early 20th centuries be applied to
the technology and intellectual-property giants of the 21st
century?
</P>
<P>
   No one can answer that question with absolute certainty, but in
our view American business and the nation's consumers would be ill
served if the Justice Department abandoned the broad tradition of
antitrust regulation as it has evolved over the past 100 years.
That tradition teaches that government must sketch, with as light a
hand as possible, the boundaries of fair competition. Microsoft
insists, with some defiance, that it will defeat on appeal any
attempt to restrict its marketing strategy. But it seems to us that
justice's proposal provides room for the Microsoft companies to
prosper while creating enterprise space for competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson embraced justice's argument that Microsoft illegally
entered into restrictive contracts with computer manufacturers and
Internet companies that required them to favor Microsoft's browser
over that of its chief rival, Netscape. The manufacturers were
prevented from substituting Netscape's browser for Microsoft's
browser on versions of Windows they installed on new computers.
Microsoft also wrote contracts that required Internet service
providers to steer customers to Microsoft's browser in exchange for
favored access to Windows users. Microsoft's primary goal was to
prevent Netscape's browser from serving as an alternative platform
from which computer users could run word processors and other
applications software, and thereby eviscerate the market power of
Windows. The use of a monopoly position to insulate that monopoly
from competitive challenge violates the antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the best remedy? One approach would be to regulate
Microsoft's future behavior. Under this remedy, the court would
impose rules that prohibit Microsoft from entering into illegally
exclusive contracts to box out its competitors. The problem with
such behavior constraints is that it is hard to box a wily company
like Microsoft. Justice signed a consent decree in 1994 that it
thought would prevent Microsoft from wrapping its browser into
Windows and selling the two as a bundled unit, but Microsoft found
a way to achieve the same economic effect by cleverly designing its
software. Besides, in a fast-moving industry, no one knows how to
specify today the unforeseeable violations in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Consider, for example, Jackson's finding that Microsoft punished
some computer manufacturers that cooperated with its competitors
by, for example, charging them higher prices. To prohibit that
behavior in the future would require the judge to anticipate all
the ways that Microsoft could hassle manufacturers, such as by
providing them belated or incomplete technical information. That
approach would require a permanent army of officials to adjudicate
every complaint against Microsoft, a task that justice wants no
part of.
</P>
<P>
   Structural remedies might work better. The idea is to inject
competition into the market for operating systems so that
competitive pressures, not the courts, rein in Microsoft's
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   One option is to require that Microsoft license Windows to
several other companies. Consumers could buy Windows from, say,
three separate companies, each offering slightly different versions
of Windows and its own brand of customer service. That proposal
would create instant competition, insulating computer manufacturers
from threats by Microsoft because they could always get Windows
from another source. The trouble with this idea is that it could
lead to fragmentation _ incompatible versions of Windows that would
make swapping files between computers and lots of other everyday
tasks needlessly difficult. Some experts doubt that rival companies
could find customers for a version of Windows that was not backed
by the technical experts working for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts would go further and split Microsoft into three
companies, each selling Windows and, perhaps, applications programs
as well. This would solve the core antitrust problem by breaking
apart the Windows monopoly. But this approach, like licensing,
could lead to incompatible versions of Windows, and some experts
believe the market might not accommodate more than one version of
Windows, ensuring that two of the companies might fail. This
approach would also be the most dauntingly difficult to pull off _
requiring, for example, a complicated split of Microsoft personnel
among the three offshoots.
</P>
<P>
   Justice is choosing instead a less complicated breakup strategy.
It would divide Microsoft into a company that sells an operating
system (Windows) and a company that sells application programs _
word processors, spreadsheets and browsers. The idea is that the
applications company would have financial incentive to make its
products compatible not only with Windows but with other operating
systems like Linux.
</P>
<P>
   This is a plausible solution, though experts point to problems.
The applications company might be unwilling to spend huge amounts
to rewrite Word and other programs for operating systems that are
currently used by very few people. That would still leave Windows
as the overwhelmingly dominant operating system. Moreover, the
company selling Windows could, after a transition period, engage in
all the anti-competitive practices that Microsoft has committed in
the past. But the great hope is that, by creating two powerful
companies where there is now one dominant company, each will
prosper, competition and innovation will increase, and the consumer
will ultimately benefit. Among a set of flawed alternatives, the
government's plan offers the best chance of success.

prosper, competition and innovation will increase, and the consumer
will ultimately benefit. Among a set of flawed alternatives, the
government's plan offers the best chance of success.

   Jobs: Many but Insecure &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tight labor market may have made it tougher for some
businesses to hire qualified people, but it has not stopped many
from quickly dismissing employees who do not pull their weight,
according to a recent survey. And that includes workers at the top
of the corporate ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas, an outplacement firm in Chicago
that regularly tracks layoffs, surveyed 3,000 discharged workers
last quarter and found that 21 percent spent less than 24 months
with their former employers.
</P>
<P>
   John A. Challenger, chief executive of the firm, said that was
the highest percentage of early-job loss since his company began
tracking such data in 1986. In the first quarter of 1999, 13
percent of discharged workers had less than two years in their
jobs, he said. ``Companies are taking a harder look at the work
force to determine which employees will most likely boost
productivity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Challenger survey also found that jobs are not much safer at
the top of the corporate ladder. The median income of discharged
employees was $88,000 in the first quarter, up 28 percent from the
period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   One group that may survive better is telecommuters, Challenger
said, because they are often the most productive. He cited a
separate survey by Sage Research Inc. of Natick, Mass., that found
that 63 percent of organizations thought that working from home
improved productivity. ``There's far less stress,'' he said of
telecommuting, ``in terms of balancing work and family.'' &QL;

(With CUBAN-BOY-NYT) 
 By JUAN FORERO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As a playwright in Cuba, Carmen Duarte knew all too well
what state-controlled repression meant. Her work was often
censored, Duarte said, and she and the actors in her theater troupe
were once beaten by policemen incensed by the scathing social
commentary in one of her plays.
</P>
<P>
   Now living here, in the heart of the nation's largest and most
potent Cuban-American enclave, Duarte is trying once again to give
voice to a point a view that many like her say can lead to
ostracism or even threats. She believes that Elian Gonzalez should
have been reunited with his father months ago, and has said so on
her daily radio show, ``Transitions,'' broadcast on a
Spanish-language station here.
</P>
<P>
   Such talk, though, has been met by a reverse form of the anger
that Duarte encountered in Cuba, with callers to the radio station
accusing her of being an agent of Fidel Castro's government, or
worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always calls,'' said Duarte, 40, who came to the
United States in 1993. ``There are always insults. You always see
it with any case that inflames the people.''
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, Cuban-Americans who favor more open relations with
Havana say that advocating an end to the U.S. embargo of Cuba or
closer ties to the island have always brought scorn and threats
and, in some cases, violence.
</P>
<P>
   But many here say that the federal raid that took Elian from
Miami has impassioned people as never before, to the consternation
of Cuban-Americans who, despite their own hatred of Castro, feel
their alternative ideas regarding Cuba are rarely aired in this
politically charged city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen it so polarized,'' said Dr. Max Castro, a
senior research associate at the University of Miami who studies
the exile community. ``I've never seen such a situation where you
are accosted if you say the wrong thing. It's a very heart-rending
thing, and we can't stop talking about it, and once we get talking
about it we get very emotional and it can become ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hilda Cossio Cohen, a legal assistant at a Miami law firm, found
out just how emotional people can get, a few days before Elian was
removed from the home of Miami relatives. After expressing support
for efforts to reunite Elian with his father, Cossio Cohen said, a
co-worker berated her as a Communist.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to voice your opinion in Dade County
because you will be branded,'' said Cossio Cohen, who fled Cuba
with her mother and two brothers in 1960. ``I work for a law firm,
but if I owned a business or tried to go into politics, I would be
blackballed forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Cossio Cohen, who believes that ending the embargo of Cuba would
be the best course for furthering democratic change in Cuba, said
she had been disheartened by what she saw as a widespread disregard
for the free flow of ideas since the Elian case began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this thing has set us back 40 years,'' she said.
``It's driven a wedge in the Cuban community. It's turned friends
against friends, family against family. I pity my Cuban people
because I truly think that we have pain in our hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Measuring the sentiments is, of course, difficult. In Miami, it
is unclear how many Cuban exiles have views divergent from those
that are most often heard on local airwaves and in newspapers.
Although some leaders of more liberal Cuban groups say they
constitute a silent majority of Cuban exiles, experts disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I'd like to see it,'' said Dr. Lisandro Perez,
director of the Cuban Research Center at Florida International
University, ``I don't think that there's any evidence to show that.
And you would expect that.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls conducted by Florida International University to gauge
exile reaction to Cuban issues showed that, as recently as 1997, 78
percent of Cuban-Americans expressed support for the continuation
of the embargo. But at the same time, 25 percent believe it has not
worked well, and 51.6 percent said they supported a ``dialogue''
with the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   On the Elian matter, however, the exiles have appeared more
united against Cuba's government, with 83 percent of
Cuban-Americans in Dade County wanting to see the boy remain with
his Miami relatives, according to a Miami Herald poll published on
April 9.
</P>
<P>
   Many with minority views avoid nasty confrontations, they say,
by simply avoiding speaking out, even if it is at the office with
well-known co-workers or in a bar with friends. Some believe
sharing their views could hurt them professionally. Others simply
want to avoid the discomfort of angering someone they know. Some
even say they avoid voicing their opinions with relatives, fearing
a fissure with more conservative family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's incredible,'' said E. Rodriguez, a 48-year-old educator
who asked that she not be fully identified. ``Here, I could be
labeled a Communist. I could lose my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who arrived in Miami in the 1960s, said she had long
believed that closer ties with Cuba _ an end to the economic
embargo and the unfettered movement of tourists and others to the
island _ were more productive than the hard-line stand that has
defined 41 years of U.S. policy. She also believes that Elian was
manipulated by Cuban-American exile leaders looking for a symbol to
further their own cause, not because of concerns over the boy's
well-being.
</P>
<P>
   But while she shares her views with close friends, she said, she
has been told to be careful what she says to others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never made it public,'' she said. ``What is the story
here is the lack of freedom. I've been warned not to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lisandro Perez, director of the Cuban Research Center at
Florida International University said that those who took a less
hard-line stance against Castro feared being ostracized or
suffering the consequences at their workplace, a very real
possibility in a place where Cuban-Americans have influence in
everything from business to government to the news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want people to label you as sympathizing with the
enemy,'' Perez said. ``Anything less than a hard-line position is
seen as sympathizing with the Castro government, and the community
has a lot of institutions through which it can pressure people to
conformity.''
</P>
<P>
   Many who favor an open channel to Cuba blame much of the
unbending nature of exile dialogue on Miami's Spanish-language
stations, whose talk-show hosts often label those with softer
positions as Communists and even give out home phone numbers of
people like Duarte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, this society has been converted into a society of
fear,'' said Angel Fernandez Varela, a retired bank chairman who
served in the Cuban Congress before the revolution. ``It's the way
people are attacked. And among the worst is that radio. There are
people, many people, who feel like I do, but they're terribly quiet
because they're scared.''

 &UR; MIAMI: they're scared.'' &QL; 
 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Still, several groups that have for years lobbied Congress for a
softer stand on Cuba in order to improve the lives of ordinary
Cubans who they say are suffering under the embargo. While those
leaders have made a conscious decision to speak out publicly, they
say that it has been hard to gather public support because of both
the climate of fear and because of the difficulty in getting their
views aired in Miami's conservative media.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come up to me all the time and say, `We feel exactly
the way you do, but we would never say this in public,''' said
Elena Freyre, executive director of the Cuban Committee for
Democracy, a group of Cuban-American professionals that lobbies
from Washington and Miami. ``I speak out to honor my father's
memory. My father left everything he cherished to live in a country
where his two daughters could speak out. I'll be darned if I ever
forget that.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders in well-known anti-Castro groups in Miami scoffed at
such complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Rodriguez, vice president of Brigade 2506, an organization
composed of Bay of Pigs veterans, said that in Miami ``there is
liberty to say what you want.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Rodriguez, a former CIA operative who wrote about his
anti-Castro experiences in a book, ``Shadow Warrior,'' said some
groups advocating relations with Cuba were controlled by Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are small groups that are being run from Cuba,'' he
said. ``Cuba has several groups that they handle here.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans like Elisa Greenberg, who believes Elian should
be with his father, cringe at such comments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that with some people, they felt that anyone speaking
out against them was in favor of the Communist regime and was a
Castro lover or a Castro agent,'' said Greenberg, 58, who came to
the United States before Castro took power. ``If you want to call
me anything, call me a Cuba lover because I believe in democracy
and I believe, in time, if we work towards it, good things will
happen over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, when she was invited to Ted Koppel's town hall meeting in
Miami earlier this month, a gathering broadcast on ABC's
``Nightline,'' she was afraid to speak up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there was apprehension on my part to speak my mind on the
matter,'' said Greenberg, noting that most of the exiles in the
audience were vocally supportive of keeping Elian in Miami. ``I was
afraid to speak up. I didn't feel comfortable and over there, I was
in the minority.''

`CLICKS AND MORTAR': HARD LESSONS LEARNED AT SCHWAB  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Boldface sentence in 7th graf should be italicized.) 
 By FRED ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is something endearing about a big man who confesses
fault. David S. Pottruck, the president and co-chief executive of
Charles Schwab, the huge financial services company, qualifies in
both size and professional stature.
</P>
<P>
   A star linebacker and heavyweight wrestler at the University of
Pennsylvania 30 years ago, Pottruck remains an imposing figure.
</P>
<P>
   And, wow, in ``Clicks and Mortar'' (Jossey-Bass, $26), does he
own up to some blunders: Nearing the apex of a sparkling career, he
was stunned when his boss observed that he was ``too persuasive.''
Blinded by his reflex to steamroll over any colleague who differed
with him, he was effectively suppressing any ideas but his own.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Pottruck writes that in therapy he came to
understand that he had been an inept husband, having lost two wives
to divorce through an inability to share his feelings or his life.
Following what he calls ``a good business model,'' he had treated
each spouse as if she were a colleague in another department. The
wife had her domain; he had his.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I hadn't changed, it would have sunk me,'' he writes.
``Unless I watch it, I can be overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   And change he did. Pottruck is the courageous risk-taker who
transformed Schwab into a pace-setting Internet enterprise. But he
first transformed himself into the antithesis of the dominant,
my-way-or-the-highway executive.
</P>
<P>
   Pottruck writes that he has concentrated, with evident success,
on ``listening to hear rather than to answer.'' And in three
decades of financial journalism, I have never met his equal as a
listener. The experience is like being bathed in respectful,
intelligent attention.  &UR; Why is this man so attentive to little old
me? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   His new style has become essential for managing the
self-directed employees that Information Age companies must have.
Pottruck teaches that authentic caring is the touchstone, ``the
most important aspect of being trustworthy.'' Schwab depends on its
people for constant, creative innovation. It's his job to inspire
passionate commitment to Schwab's core values and goals.
</P>
<P>
   Listening, Pottruck writes, is not so much a skill but ``an
attitude with a single focus: the more I am known by those I want
to follow me, and the more I can know them, the greater will be our
ability to do great things together.'' To earn trust, he says,
leaders must reveal their true selves to an uncomfortable extent.
</P>
<P>
   Pottruck has the generosity of spirit to tell his lessons at his
own expense. At one point, he offended female colleagues by
thoughtlessly reaching outside Schwab to fill new senior positions
with only men. Another time he ordered offices to open on Saturdays
with no consultation with the colleagues affected.
</P>
<P>
   He was skeptical of instituting no-fee individual retirement
accounts, which in fact would prove an enormous success. He got
Schwab out of the electronic payments business, a service that
Quicken has found enormously lucrative. (``Maybe this wasn't my
best recommendation!'')
</P>
<P>
   If there is a better handbook on adapting to the Internet
economy, I have yet to find it. Pottruck and his co-author, Terry
Pearce, have produced an eminently readable guide to building a
great enterprise in this era of relentless change and ephemeral
relationships. Pottruck found a calling in zealously guarding the
Schwab shrine, but his lessons are about clobbering the
competition.
</P>
<P>
   Pearce counsels Schwab on ``executive communication'' and
teaches leadership at the Haas School of Business at the University
of California at Berkeley, sometimes with Pottruck. He came to that
vocation after 17 years at IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Their account is remarkable in how deeply they seek to
understand the roots of a corporate culture and how
self-consciously they labor to shape and sustain Schwab's.
</P>
<P>
   Pottruck plays Michael Jordan to Pearce's Phil Jackson. Very
much the coach, Pearce opens each topic, from building cultural
commitment to managing technology, with a preface and closes it
with a cogent summation. In between, Pottruck reflects on his
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally Pearce steps out of his role, ruminating, for
instance, on a semiserious quip by Tom Peters that every chief
executive should look for a chief information officer who is under
15. Pearce reflects on his own sons' absolute comfort with the
Internet. ``I'm sure,'' he writes, ``that if a live cat walked out
of a video display into the living room, they would say something
like `cool!' while I was heading for the bomb shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion he draws: ``I had better find within myself the
courage and capacity to learn technology like a 15-year-old. I had
better redevelop the inquiring and `anything is possible' attitude
of a teenager.''
</P>
<P>
   An informed dabbler in anthropology, Pearce applies its
teachings to business. Cultures, including business cultures, he
says, are spread and sustained through myth, image and ritual.
Schwab pointedly honors its rituals and celebrates its heroes. When
market volume soars, all hands _ ranking executives included _ turn
out to man the phones, a ritual known as ``market storm.''
</P>
<P>
   The best ``myths'' are always true, and one true tale at Schwab
centers on an elderly couple who went bust in the 1987 market
crash, owing Schwab a substantial sum. Rather than press the couple
to the wall, Schwab settled the debt by taking title to their home
but granting them lifetime occupancy.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, after the husband died, the house burned to the
ground. Rather than pocketing the insurance proceeds, Schwab had
the house rebuilt, and the widow lived in it until her death.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Clicks and Mortar'' theme is teamwork, total teamwork: In
offering bonuses or other incentives to top performers, companies
should never limit the rewards to a certain percentage of
employees. (After all, the more who succeed, the better.)
Department budgets should be set by performance ratios, encouraging
departments to outdo themselves, rather than scrap for larger
shares of a fixed pie.
</P>
<P>
   For an easy read, the book is sophisticated and well grounded in
academic findings. It can be read for grand themes or mined for
nuggets. At one point Schwab found itself taking two weeks to
answer customer complaints that reached the chairman's office,
mostly demands for refunds.
</P>
<P>
   Executives first asked: How do we cut that to 10 days? Answer:
some streamlining. So how do we cut it to a week, they asked? That
required closer analysis, yielding the innovation of responding by
phone instead of by mail.
</P>
<P>
   And, finally, how to cut it to 48 hours? That took imagination.
Schwab dug out the average cost of pursuing a complaint _ and
decided to concede any claim for less. It accepted the cost as an
investment in keeping customers happy.

EUROPEAN CENTRAL BANK RAISES INTEREST RATES, BUT EURO PLUNGES
AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (CORRECTS figure in 2nd graf)

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ The European Central Bank raised interest
rates Thursday for the fourth time in six months but Europe's
common currency, the euro, once again defied its guardians and
plunged to another record low against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   The rate increase, from 3.5 to 3.75 percent, would normally tend
to support the euro's value. But in a display of the gloom that now
envelops the new currency, the euro sank to less than 91 cents from
92.33 cents before closing in New York at 91.01 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The euro is now in uncharted waters, and you don't know how
far it will go down,'' said Gerhard Grebe, an economist at Bank
Julius Baer in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
   Since its debut at the start of 1999, when it was worth $1.17,
the euro's value against the dollar has slid about 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While it once seemed to represent an unthinkable decline in the
euro's value, parity with the dollar now looks to many traders like
an impossibly high target, at least for the next several months.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the decline of the euro was more of a political
embarrassment than an economic problem. Indeed, the weak euro has
provided a major boost to European exporters by making their
products cheap in terms of dollars and creating windfall currency
profits from sales in dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But European officials have become increasingly concerned that
the euro's weakness will fuel inflation here by raising the prices
of imported goods.
</P>
<P>
   The euro's plight has even begun to alarm some of its most
ardent supporters. Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche
Bank, has long contended that the new currency would be a powerful
challenger to the world dominance of the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
   But this week, Walter argued that European central bankers
should intervene if the euro's value slips meaningfully below 90
cents. In an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt, Walter
went on to argue that European central bankers ought to sell off
their reserves of dollars, which now total about $250 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't they sell now?'' Walter said. ``It would
simultaneously make an impression on international speculators and
support the euro.''
</P>
<P>
   Adopted by 11 European countries at the start of 1999, the euro
is on its way toward creating a single European economy as big as
that of the United States. Though the countries will continue to
have their own national currencies until 2002, their monetary
policies are now locked together under the control of the European
Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
   But the euro has been anemic ever since its birth, and the
problem has become more acute in the last several weeks. The German
mark is worth about 46 U.S. cents, its lowest level in 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   The European Central Bank said its primary concern Thursday was
about inflation rather than exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
   But inflation is closely linked to the weakness of the euro,
which has already started to drive up import prices.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists and currency strategists had been expecting
Thursday's action, and most believe that the central bank will
raise rates at least once more in the months ahead.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Far more puzzling is why the euro continues to fall so sharply
in value.
</P>
<P>
   Economic growth in the 11-nation euro zone is expected to reach
3.4 percent this year, its fastest pace in years, and employment is
climbing rapidly for the first time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inflation is lower in Europe than in the United
States. Investment and employment are both accelerating, and Europe
has a big trade surplus while the United States has a mammoth trade
deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the United States continues to grow faster. The United
States Commerce Department reported Thursday that the U.S. gross
domestic product increased at annual rate of 5.4 percent in the
first quarter. Beyond statistics, the mystique associated with U.S.
technology has made it a magnet for foreign direct investment.
</P>
<P>
   Most economists had been forecasting that the euro would start
to climb by the second half of 1999. Then they predicted it would
appreciate in the first few months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Dannesboe, a currency strategist at the Dutch bank ABN
Amro, said part of the euro's most recent distress stems from the
grievously optimistic views of many international fund managers.
</P>
<P>
   Convinced last fall that the euro would recover after tumbling
to $1.06 from $1.17, fund managers started buying up euros and
selling dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States and the dollar both defied expectations,
as U.S. growth accelerated rather than slowed, and direct
investment continued to pour into the United States from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the fourth quarter, international fund managers
were massively overweight on the euros,'' Dannesboe said. The
result, he continued, is that investors are looking for at any
momentary rise in the euro as a chance to sell their holdings.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulties were compounded earlier this month, after the
Nasdaq market plunged as a result of fears about overpriced U.S.
technology stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors viewed the turbulence in U.S. stocks as a new
reason for believing that European assets and the euro would become
a safe haven.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not happen. When the euro barely budged against the
dollar and then the Nasdaq market bounced back, the pressure to
sell euros intensified further.
</P>
<P>
   The entire life of the euro has left economists and currency
traders bewildered. But Ralf Schneider, an economist at Dresdner
Bank, noted that the violent currency swings are hardly
unprecedented.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1980 and 1985, the dollar nearly doubled in value
against the German mark _ the currency that continues to be at the
heart of the euro. The mark plunged to $3.45 from about $1.70,
largely because the U.S. economy underwent a powerful growth spurt
between 1983 and 1985. By 1988, the dollar had slumped back to
about $1.70.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows that growth differentials are very important,''
Schneider said. ``My argument is that the euro has done better than
the D-mark would have.''

TEXAS COLLEGE FACULTY MEMBERS TO SEEK NEW MERIT RAISES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Faculty members at Texas colleges and
universities will vie for new merit raises in September from a $40
million sale of state assets, Texas Comptroller Carole Keeton
Rylander announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The money, raised from the sale of stock abandoned at financial
institutions and now in the state's possession, means university
administrators will receive 3 percent more than the Legislature
previously allocated for faculty salaries next fall, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to increase faculty salaries to help Texas' higher
education institutions attract, retain and reward the very best,
high quality instructors,`` Rylander said.
</P>
<P>
   Rylander said she is striving to help close a wage gap between
Texas faculty members and their counterparts elsewhere. With an
average salary of $53,360 in Texas, instructors of higher education
earn 10 percent less than in other large states, according to the
American Association of University Professors.
</P>
<P>
   A group representing Texas university faculty reacted with mixed
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand the tradition of the Legislature preferring merit
increases. I think our organization would prefer an
across-the-board increase, particularly in light of Texas higher
education salaries being the lowest of the 11 most populous
states,'' said Chuck Hempstead, executive director of the Texas
Association of College Teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature last year granted Rylander the authority to find
money for merit raises for higher education faculty. While public
school teachers had received automatic across-the-board pay raises
from Texas lawmakers, those in state colleges and universities were
left out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am here today to say I have found the money within my own
agency,'' Rylander said of the stock, which financial institutions
are required to turn over to the state if unclaimed for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller _ flanked by leading officials from the
University of Texas, Texas A&AMP;M, University of Houston and Texas
Tech _ emphasized that the pay raises go only to those deemed by
administrators as most worthy. Each university, college, technical
school or medical institution has total discretion over how to
distribute the money and to whom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge story for those in higher education, a huge
story for perhaps those in the business community,'' said Grover S.
Campbell, vice chancellor for government relations, University of
Houston System.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas System Chancellor William Cunningham said
that if universities can find an extra 1 percent to 2 percent in
other funding sources, it's possible the state can start to close
the disparity in faculty salaries between Texas and other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big step for higher education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   University officials attending the announcement said Texas
schools have the hardest time attracting and retaining professors
in the most competitive fields of business, law, computer science,
the sciences, information technology and engineering.
</P>
<P>
   Officials were not willing to reveal how they might distribute
the merit increases, or to whom. Campbell from UH noted that wage
disparities are quite large already, depending on specialities.
</P>
<P>
   ``A law professor in intellectual property is a pretty hot
commodity right now. If we've got him, he's probably making
$100,000 plus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the English departments, however, it's more like $35,000 to
$40,000.

LATIN AMERICA'S MAIN MARKETS MIRROR NASDAQ'S BUMPY RIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ With the Nasdaq oscillating sharply this
month, Latin America's two principal markets, the Bovespa of Brazil
and the Bolsa of Mexico, have gone along for the ride.
</P>
<P>
   Emerging markets have always been buffeted by instability in the
United States as anxious investors pull out of what are considered
high-risk positions elsewhere. But because Latin American markets
have been dominated by brick-and-mortar companies, they have
usually been linked to the Dow, not the technology-heavy Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   This new relationship has confounded investors, particularly now
that the Brazilian and Mexican economies are booming.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the Nasdaq swing, the Bovespa index has
dropped to 15,440, after rising to a high of 19,046 in March. In
Mexico, the Bolsa index has fallen to 6,844, from a high of 8,417,
also in March. Some of the current downward pressure can be
directly linked to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Nasdaq euphoria that fueled the markets in the fourth
quarter,'' said David Chon, Latin America equity strategist for
Bear, Stearns. ``After running up significantly, some of the froth
is now coming off of the telecom-media-technology sectors.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the telecommunications sector, which makes up about 50
percent of the Bovespa, has led Brazil's downward trend. The shares
of CRT Cellular, for example, which is controlled by Telefonica de
Espana, fell from a high of 899 reais ($499.20) in March, to 609
reais at Thursday's close. CRT is one of the cellular companies in
Brazil that plans to start wireless Internet services by June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The telecom companies are all earning revenue from the
Internet,'' said Julio Zeigelmann, director of equity funds at
BankBoston Asset Management in Sao Paulo. ``It makes sense that
decreasing optimism in the Internet would affect us locally.'' In
Mexico, Telefonos de Mexico has also taken a hit, closing Thursday
at 28.4 pesos (3.01), 22 percent below its 52-week high of 36.2
pesos on March 7.
</P>
<P>
   But since technology is still a nascent industry in Latin
America, most companies _ including telecommunications concerns,
which are still trying to meet demand for regular fixed-line
service _ are still squarely part of the traditional economy. That
makes for a tenuous connection between Latin American stocks and
the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   ``This correlation doesn't have much logic,'' said Octavio de
Barros, chief economist of BBV Argentaria in Sao Paulo. ``When the
market realizes that the Bovespa is not linked to the Nasdaq, we
could have a rally.''
</P>
<P>
   Many companies in Latin America, and particularly in Brazil, are
undervalued now that stock prices have fallen, with many trading
below book value, according to many analysts. They believe that the
flight to quality that normally occurs during market turbulence
should reverse once the value of Latin American stocks becomes
widely known.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterly reports released this week have also animated
investors. On Tuesday, for example, the Mexican cement company
Cemex announced that operating profit rose 22 percent in the first
quarter compared with the similar quarter of 1999, beating
analysts' expectations. The positive news follows impressive
results announced last week by the Brazilian steel company CVRD,
which increased profits 98 percent in the first quarter over the
comparable period last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The earnings reports followed positive economic news coming out
of Latin America. Since the Russian debt crisis in 1998 sent
investors running from Latin America and forced Brazil to devalue
its currency, the region has had a quick recovery. Latin America is
expected to grow 3.7 percent this year, up from 0.2 percent last
year, according to estimates from ING Barings.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation has also shown some decline this year. The region
should finish the year with inflation at 6 percent to 8 percent,
compared with 8.8 percent last year. The International Monetary
Fund recently revised its inflation target for Latin America this
year to 7.7 percent from 8.4 percent on strong economic activity
coming out of the region.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's Congress also recently passed important legislation,
the Fiscal Responsibility Law, which establishes austere spending
and indebtedness limits for the local, state and federal
governments. The Brazilian government has been battling large
deficits for years, and indebtedness was a primary cause of
investor uncertainty in the devaluation last year. The budget
deficit now stands at 3.6 percent of the country's gross domestic
product, but with the new law and the economic recovery, the
government expects the deficit to fall to about 2 percent of gross
domestic product in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, investment activity, which has been strong this year
because of ties to the United States through the North American
Free Trade Agreement, is expected to slow before the presidential
election July 2.

U.S. HANDS RUSSIA A PLAN TO REVISE '72 MISSILE TREATY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RUSSIA-U.S.-TEXT) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS and JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has presented Russia
with a draft agreement that would revise a key arms control treaty
to allow the United States to deploy a limited missile defense
system and to hold open the possibility of building a larger system
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would amend the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of
1972, long considered a linchpin of arms control, to allow the
United States to protect itself against the threat of missile
attacks from nations like North Korea, Iraq, Iran and Libya,
according to a draft given to the Russians earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The draft and accompanying documents outlining the
administration's arguments for changing the treaty provide the most
detailed and authoritative account that has yet emerged of the
American negotiating position. Officials are pressing Russia to
accept a defensive system that it considers a grave, destabilizing
threat, but which some congressional Republicans believe is not
nearly big enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. national missile defense system, which will be
limited and intended to defend against several dozen long-range
missiles launched by rogue states, will be incapable of threatening
Russia's strategic deterrence,'' said a summary of the
administration's arguments, presented to the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The administration wants to change the treaty to let the United
States build the first phase of a defensive system with 100
missiles and their launchers, as well as a sophisticated new radar
system on Shemya Island in Alaska. But the administration also
wants a second phase, to include another 100 missiles and launchers
at a second site. In its proposal, the United States calls for
negotiations on an expanded system to begin as soon as next March _
after Clinton's successor is inaugurated.
</P>
<P>
   Russia fears that any agreement to allow a limited defensive
system would open the door to demands for a further expansion that
would gut the aims of the ABM treaty, which prohibits national
defensive shields. The theory was that by limiting the nations'
defenses, the treaty takes away their compensating need to build up
their offenses, providing some stability. And if nations feel
invulnerable to attack, they might tempted to launch a first
strike.
</P>
<P>
   American negotiators have tried to assure their Russian
counterparts that the system would pose no threat to Russia's
strategic nuclear deterrence, but rather would focus on more
isolated threats of ballistic missile strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The American document went to great lengths to reassure Russia
that even if the two countries agree to reduce their warheads to
between 1,500 and 2,000 as proposed under the next phase of the
planned nuclear arms reduction treaty known as Start III, the
Russian nuclear force would have nothing to fear from the American
defensive shield.
</P>
<P>
   ``These strategic forces give each side the certain ability to
carry out an annihilating counterattack,'' the document said.
``Forces of this size can easily penetrate a limited system of the
type the United States is now developing.''
</P>
<P>
   The summary, which was presented to the Russians in January by
the senior American negotiator, John D. Holum, went on to say that
in the event of a first strike attack, Russia would still be able
``to send about a thousand warheads, together with two to three
times more decoys, accompanied by other advanced defense
penetration aids'' that would easily overwhelm the limited American
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Authoritative written Russian sources claim that the Russian
government understands that the capabilities of its defense
penetration aids are extremely high,'' the document said. ``These
same written sources, supplemented by the statements of senior
Russian military personnel and defense industry representatives,
clearly present the idea that the Russian government anticipated
that is defense penetration aides could easily overcome the U.S.
NMD system,'' referring to the national missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   The documents outlining the administration's position were
obtained by The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in Russia and
passed on to The New York Times. The bulletin plans to make them
available on its website (www.thebulletin.org). Senior
administration officials declined to comment on the documents, but
in interviews Thursday discussed the rationale behind the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   The proposals amount to the administration's opening offer in
negotiations that have barely got off the ground.
</P>
<P>
   While senior American and Russian officials have held repeated
discussions over the last year, the Russians have not yet decided
whether to even engage in negotiations on the treaty. In public _
and equally so in private, officials said _ the Russians have
adamantly opposed any changes to allow a missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very much an open question whether Russia is going to
conclude that it is in Russia's interest to do a deal with this
administration,'' a senior administration official said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the discussions have intensified with the recent
election of Vladimir V. Putin as Russia's next president and the
coming end of President Clinton's second term.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference capping of three days of talks that
centered on national missile defense, the Russian foreign minister,
Igor S. Ivanov, and Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright said
Thursday that discussions would continue when Clinton and Putin
meet in Moscow in June.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has not made a decision so far on whether
deploy a defensive system. He is not scheduled to do so until after
the Pentagon's next anti-missile test in June.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanov said that ``considerable differences'' remained, and he
repeated that Russia believed the Antiballistic Missile Treaty
should ``remain a cornerstone of strategic stability.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright responded by saying that the administration, too,
wanted to preserve the treaty but also wanted to adapt it to ``21st
century needs,'' a reference to the missile threats that
intelligence experts have warned are fast approaching.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's proposal would not directly amend the text
of the treaty, but rather revise it by adding two brief
``protocols.'' They would allow the first phase of a missile
defense and provide extensive measures for verification of the
system's missiles and radars.
</P>
<P>
   Another senior administration official said the decision to
propose protocols was simply easier than trying to revise the
wording of the treaty line by line. It could also allow Russians to
declare that the treaty itself remained unchanged. However, the
administration official said, ``It's not like cosmetics are going
to solve this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the Russians, the protocols would still face a
test in the Senate, which would have to approve them before they
took effect. More than 20 Republican senators said they would not
accept Clinton's proposed changes, contending that they would limit
a defensive system too much.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol covers only the first phase of the American missile
defense system, intended to counter an attack from North Korea,
which will be able to threaten the continental United States with
ballistic missiles by 2005, according to a classified intelligence
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The administration stopped short of asking the Russians to
approve immediately the second phase of the system, which would be
based at a still undecided location and counter threats from the
Middle East and Persian Gulf, which intelligence consider to be a
decade or more away.
</P>
<P>
   However, an article in the protocol explicitly allows either
side to reopen negotiations as soon as March 1, 2001 ``to take into
account further changes in the strategic situation'' that might
require ``deployment of more effective limited national territorial
defense systems.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to ask for only the first phase, while insisting on
the right to expand it further, was a practical one, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   They said they assumed it would be easier to get the Russians to
accept only a first phase, which American consider more urgent,
rather than a larger system. The decision also reflected the change
in administrations next January.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Russians need to understand that the next president is
going to come into office and immediately face the question about
what further is required,'' one senior official said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials emphasized that the United States only plans to
build two phases, but the proposed language does not specify that.
With Republicans in Congress pressing for a further expansion of
the system, the protocol's lack of specificity may well stoke the
Russian fears of facing a slippery slope to a larger system.
</P>
<P>
   The protocol would also allow the United States to build a radar
in Alaska and upgrade early-warning radar stations in Alaska,
Massachusetts and California for use in the missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Lisbeth Gronlund, a researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and a senior staff scientist with the Union of Concerned
Scientists, which opposes a national missile defense, said the
radar undercut a linchpin of the treaty, which limited such systems
on the theory that once they were built, anti-missile missiles
could be quickly deployed to a system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have all the radars around the world, it is
relatively easy _ and fast _ to build additional interceptor
missiles,'' she said. ``It really goes against every thing people
have thought for 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen I. Schwartz, publisher of the Bulletin of the Atomic
Scientists, said he was troubled by the assumptions underlying the
administration's reassurances to the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The documents, he said, showed that the administration was
willing to accept the continued existence of a large Russian
nuclear force ready to be launched at the first sign of a missile
attack, rather than seek bilateral reductions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States government would forsake deep reductions in
the Russian and American arsenals in favor of deploying a limited
missile defense against a threat that doesn't yet exist,'' he said.

U.S. MISSILE DEFENSE PROPOSAL: `READY TO WORK WITH RUSSIA' 
</HEADLINE>
  (With RUSSIA-U.S.-ARMS) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Following are excerpts from the document that
American negotiators have presented to the Russians with proposals
for rewriting the 1972 antiballistic missile treaty, in order to
allow the United States to build a limited national missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   Topics for Discussion
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is counting on making the decision to deploy
the national missile defense (NMD) system no earlier than mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. NMD system would not be directed against Russia and
would not weaken Russia's strategic deterrence potential.
</P>
<P>
   We recognize that this system contravenes the current provisions
of the ABM treaty.
</P>
<P>
   We are ready to work with Russia to achieve confidence in the
capabilities of a limited NMD system to counter extremist rogue
states and to develop revisions to the ABM treaty. You have our
draft protocol to the treaty, which would permit the creation of a
limited NMD system.
</P>
<P>
   Article I specifies the deployment of the limited NMD system as
an alternative to the deployment of ABM systems permitted under the
current provisions of the ABM treaty. Thus, the ban on the
development of national missile defense systems and the ban on the
development of the basis for such a system contained in Article I
of the treaty will not apply to the limited missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Article II specifies that the development of this alternative
system be permitted within the limits of one ABM system deployment
region in which it deploys no more than 100 ABM launchers and 100
ABM interceptor missiles with a radius of no more than 150
kilometers _ in full compliance with Article III of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Article II also specifies that existing long-range radar may be
enabled for use as ABM radar to support this limited NMD system and
that each party may deploy one additional ABM radar each at any
site within its national territory.
</P>
<P>
   Article III specifies that if a limited NMD system is deployed
in accordance with the provisions of the protocol, existing,
operational ABM launchers deployed in accordance with Article III
of the treaty must be dismantled or destroyed; no dismantling or
destruction of existing ABM radars is required. According to this
provision, existing launchers deployed at Grand Forks which are not
operational do not have to be dismantled.
</P>
<P>
   Article IV contains a reference to the annex, which is aimed at
building confidence and assuring compliance with the protocol and
which is an integral part of the protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Later we will provide you with more detailed information about
the annex we have proposed.
</P>
<P>
   Article V specifies that all rights and duties of the parties
stated in the treaty shall remain in force with respect to the
amendments introduced by the protocol.
</P>
<P>
   Article VI contains a requirement according to which, at the
demand of one party, the parties shall begin further negotiations
no sooner than March 1, 2001, to bring the treaty into agreement
with future changes in the strategic situation.
</P>
<P>
   Article VII specifies that the protocol shall enter into force
after the exchange of ratification instruments, which shall take
place after approval of the protocol by the procedure called for by
the constitution of each party.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we would once again like to emphasize that the protocol
will contain only those amendments to the treaty that are necessary
to reflect the structure of the limited national missile defense.
...
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA'S CONCERNS: The U.S. national missile defense system will
threaten Russia's strategic deterrence potential and thereby
disrupt strategic stability.
</P>
<P>
   RESPONSE: The U.S. national missile defense system, which will
be limited and intended to defend against several dozen long-range
missiles launched by rogue states, will be incapable of threatening
Russia's strategic deterrence at the level of Start II or Start III
(or later).
</P>
<P>
   For more than 30 years the classic argument in favor of
strategic stability and against the deployment of a large-scale
strategic missile defense system has been based on concerns that
one side might have the ability to make a surprise disarming first
strike against the enemy and then deploy a broad strategic missile
defense system to knock out the enemy's combat resources which had
survived the first strike and were being launched against the
assailant. We have clearly stated that the U.S. missile defense
system to be developed by the U.S. government is a very limited
strategic missile defense system intended to protect against a
threat from some rogue state, which may, at most, use a few dozen
warheads accompanied by advanced defense penetration aids. We also
proposed steps to ensure Russia's confidence that the U.S. system
is in fact limited and deployed within the bounds of the
agreed-upon terms of the amended ABM treaty. This classic argument
is, therefore, simply inapplicable to defense, where capabilities
are just as limited as they would have been in connection with
proposals on the U.S. NMD system. Nor could the system be upgraded
to alter this reality, except over the long term, which would
create conditions for considerable advance warning.
</P>
<P>
   First Strike Scenarios
</P>
<P>
   Both the United States of America and the Russian Federation now
possess and, as before, will possess under the terms of any
possible future arms reduction agreements, large, diversified,
viable arsenals of strategic offensive weapons consisting of
various types of ICBM's, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and
heavy bombers. Specifically, Russia's proposal for Start III would
make it possible to have 1,500-2,000 warheads and even according to
highly conservative hypotheses, Russia and the United States could
deploy more than 1,000 ICBM's and submarine-launched ballistic
missiles with nuclear warheads over the next decade and thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   These strategic offensive forces give each side the certain
ability to carry out an annihilating counterattack on the other
side regardless of the conditions under which the war began.
</P>
<P>
   Forces of this size can easily penetrate a limited NMD system of
the type that the United States is now developing.
</P>
<P>
   Russia now keeps its strategic arsenal on constant alert and
apparently will do so even at Start III levels. Russian forces
under Start III could make an annihilating counterattack even under
conditions of a surprise disarming first strike by the U.S.A. in
combination with a limited U.S. NMD system. ...
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is clear: the strategic missile defense system
for the limited U.S. NMD system which we are calling for could
protect only against a few dozen ICBM warheads accompanied by
sophisticated defense penetration aids.

 &UR; TALKING UP TALK &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tina Brown &LR;  of Talk magazine was in San Francisco on Wednesday,
April 26, for a screening of ``Takedown,'' a TalkMedia movie based
on the 1995 cross-country chase and arrest of computer hacker
 &UR; Kevin Mitnick &LR; . The movie, a product of the collaboration between
Brown's company and Miramax, has nothing to do with the magazine,
but copies were stacked everywhere, and much of the talk was about
Talk, which is what editors merrily refer to as ``buzz.''
</P>
<P>
   USA Today's  &UR; Al Neuharth &LR;  gave the magazine a lukewarm B to
Oprah's A last week, while Salon noted that sales of more than a
million copies of issue No. 1 of Talk had dropped to just over
500,000 since then. Talk hopes the figure will be up to 600,000 by
August, the magazine's first anniversary, but Salon's  &UR; Sean &LR; 
 &UR; Elder &LR;  called those numbers ``grim.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Salon co-hosted the screening, and before the movie
rolled, Brown said laughingly that she hoped their partnership on
the event would prevent the online magazine from further Talk
trashing.
</P>
<P>
   Brown had admitted to the Independent of London a few weeks ago
that there might have been some problems. ``I probably made the
mistake of putting all the good stuff in the first issue,'' she
said, ``and didn't look forward enough to the next couple.'' But
she was seamlessly optimistic when Personals asked her about Talk's
troubles. The reports, she said, are ``wrong. The numbers are
excellent. We're growing every month, in numbers and in quality.
There's a growing groundswell, and we're very well on track. It's
very strong.'' She promised ``very hot'' stories in the next two
issues, but wouldn't say what they were, except to call them
exciting.

NETWORTH: TRYING TO RAISE SUNKEN STOCK OPTIONS CAN BE A
MURKY  BUSINESS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As the ranks of dot-com paupers grow, companies
are coming under pressure to do something about their employee
stock options that have become temporarily worthless.
</P>
<P>
   But their own options are limited now that the accounting
poo-bahs and institutional investors have clamped down on the most
popular solution _ repricing options at a new lower, price.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Microsoft took a different approach. All 35,000
full-time employees will get an extra, one-time stock grant equal
to the grant they received in July _ about 70 million options in
all.
</P>
<P>
   While that may be a good alternative for many companies, it
won't be possible for all those whose stock prices have plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 159 Bay Area companies that have gone public this year or
last, 53, or one-third, are trading below their initial public
offering prices. That means people hired since the IPO _ and
possibly before _ may be sitting on options that have no immediate
value. Many newer workers at older companies are in the same boat.
</P>
<P>
   Stock options let you purchase a certain number of shares at a
fixed price, known as the strike or exercise price, during a
certain time period, usually 10 years. Generally, high-tech workers
get a passel of options when they join a company and another clump
once a year.
</P>
<P>
   The options vest, or become available, over time. Typically,
one-eighth of the options from each grant can be exercised every
six months over four years.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise price is usually the share price on the day the
options are awarded. If the share price subsequently goes up,
employees pay for stock at the exercise price, sell it at the
market price and pocket the profits.
</P>
<P>
   But if the stock price goes below the exercise price _ known as
going underwater _ the options can't be sold at a profit and
employees may become disgruntled.
</P>
<P>
   The easy solution to this morale problem is to lower the
exercise price so that the options are ``above water'' or ``in the
money.'' This is often accomplished by canceling the old options
and replacing them with new ones at a lower strike price.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, this practice usually doesn't require shareholder
approval or prior notification. And until recently, it had no
impact on a company's earnings.
</P>
<P>
   But in March, the Financial Accounting Standards Board changed
the rules. Starting July 1, companies will have to increase or
decrease their earnings for all options that have been repriced
since Dec. 16, 1998, or that are repriced in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an overly simplified example: Say a company issued
options at $10 per share but the stock tanked and the exercise
price was lowered to $5.
</P>
<P>
   Now the stock recovers and at the end of the quarter is trading
at $13. The company will have to reduce its earnings for that
quarter by the difference between the new exercise price and the
current market price _ or $8 per share _ for all repriced options.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, if the stock sinks to $2 per share, the
company would increase its earnings by $3 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Each quarter, the process is repeated with all options that have
been repriced but not yet exercised. The big danger is that there
is no limit to the charges a company would take if its stock keeps
going up.
</P>
<P>
   Another drawback is that big investors don't like repricings _
especially when they're done without a shareholder vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very strongly opposed to repricing,'' says Keith
Johnson, general counsel with the State of Wisconsin Investment
Board. ``Basically, it undermines the rationale for having put
options in place, which is creating an incentive'' for employees to
do things that will boost the share price.
</P>
<P>
   Companies often warn that without repricing they will lose
valuable employees. But Johnson believes those fears are
``overblown'' and unjustified.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're just one company, you'll do anything you can to
avoid losing talent,'' he says. ``But shareholders like SWIB have a
large and diverse portfolio of companies, many of which are
stealing employees from each other. When that happens, we still
have the same talent in the portfolio, we're just paying more for
it. We look across the board and say, `at some point, this has got
to stop.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Although institutions usually can't stop a company from
repricing, ``if a company does reprice, particularly for top
executives, it inclines us to vote against future option plans,
which is where we have some leverage,'' says Ken Bertsch, director
of corporate governance for TIAA-CREF, the giant teachers pension
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Bertsch says one problem with stock options ``is that many
employees do not recognize the value they're receiving. It's like
paying them in yen.'' If the option goes underwater, they might
think it's worthless, even though the stock could easily rebound.
``It makes us question whether this is a good way of compensating
employees,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Bertsch thinks companies will continue to reprice, but ``you're
not going to see knee-jerk repricings. These accounting charges can
be considerable, and most companies will be unwilling to put up
with open-ended charges.''
</P>
<P>
   He says corporate directors also fear that class-action lawyers
will automatically sue companies that reprice options without
shareholder approval.
</P>
<P>
   The companies most likely to reprice are those in desperate
situations and those that don't worry about the impact on earnings
because they don't have any.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few weeks, Barnesandnoble.com, CDnow and MyTurn.com
have all repriced options, and Iomega has asked shareholders to
approve a repricing plan.
</P>
<P>
   More-established companies are expected to follow Microsoft's
lead and issue additional options without canceling old ones.
Microsoft's new options will be exerciseable at Monday's stock
price _ $66.63.
</P>
<P>
   Issuing new options does not affect earnings like a repricing
would, but Microsoft was only able to do so because it had a huge
number of options in a shareholder-approved plan that had been
authorized but not yet used. Many companies, especially newer ones,
don't have that luxury, because they've already doled out most of
their approved options.
</P>
<P>
   These companies might be able to set up a new plan without
shareholder approval, but this can have negative tax implications
and raise the ire of institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you already have 20 percent of your outstanding shares in a
stock option plan, and you go up to 25 percent, it's going to get
people's attention very quickly,'' McGurn said.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Schmitt, vice president of Westward Pay Strategies in San
Francisco, says many of the companies his firm advises are
considering repricing or other alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Some are accelerating annual options grants. ``If normally
they're made during the summer, they're making them earlier so they
can capture the low (stock) price and send a message to
employees,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Others are making supplemental grants, perhaps equal to half of
what a new hire would get. Some companies are ``identifying key
talent and making targeted grants of any size to the top 25 or 30
percent of employees.'' If they have enough cash, some are raising
salaries or bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to give employees restricted stock that,
unlike stock options, does not require employees to make an
investment.
</P>
<P>
   Restricted stock, which also vests over four to five years,
``can be a stronger retention tool, especially during a crisis
situation,'' Schmitt says. But it does reduce corporate earnings by
the amount vested each year, and institutions don't like it because
it's seen as a giveaway. ``As long as you stay living and
breathing, you can have it.''
</P>
<P>
   An article about alternatives to repricing, ``After the Dot.Com
Fall,'' is on Westward's Web site ( &LR; www.westwardpay.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Schmitt wouldn't name which companies are taking action, so I
called 15 Bay Area companies whose shares have fallen significantly
below their IPO prices. Most wouldn't comment or didn't return
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Of those who did talk, none had repriced options. They all
emphasized that the decline in tech stocks is a recent phenomenon,
that many employees who came in before the IPO are still above
water and that they're trying to keep workers focused on long-term
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very early in the game,'' says Todd Hagen, CFO of
Salon.com. ``I think options are an important part of the reason
why people join Salon. But it's only one facet of why they come in
the door every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Marleen McDaniel, CEO of Women.com Networks, says ``our shares
only started falling at Christmas, so it's only people hired this
year who are affected.''
</P>
<P>
   She says she would not consider repricing options because it's
``too complicated and unnecessary.'' But she would consider
granting new options for employees who are underwater.
</P>
<P>
   Nora DePalma, a spokeswoman for ImproveNet, says options are not
an issue because her company never hyped them. ``Our CEO, Ron
Cooper, came from the home improvement industry. He was very strong
during the recruiting process that options were not to be presented
as the be-all and end-all. If options even came up early in the
interview process, (job candidates) were eliminated,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As time goes on, expect more companies to be taking that
approach.

 MICROSOFT BUYS STAKE IN DIGITAL LICENSING  &HT;     By KELLY ZITO 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chroncile 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Hoping to tap into the increasing amount of
copyrighted content bubbling up on the Internet, Microsoft and
Xerox on Thursday joined forces to sell software that protects such
material distributed online.
</P>
<P>
   The new venture, ContentGuard Inc., relies on so-called digital
rights management (DRM) technology _ software that limits the
number of times a song, poem, movie or business document can be
viewed, downloaded or printed _ developed by Xerox. Microsoft will
take a minority stake in the company and be its largest initial
customer.
</P>
<P>
   For both Xerox and Microsoft, ContentGuard is an attempt to get
their products in on the ground floor of the growing market for
digital content, which they say will reach $275 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   ContentGuard, which its backers plan to take public, expects to
make money by licensing the technology to other softwaremakers,
publishers and e-tailers, and by taking a portion of transaction
fees.
</P>
<P>
   Initially Microsoft will integrate ContentGuard into its Reader
technology, which presents text in booklike format on computer
screens and handheld devices. Eventually, the company will
integrate ContentGuard in Media Player, its viewer for online music
and video; WebTV, its Internet TV device; and its Windows operating
system.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, the companies are trying to create a de facto
standard in the increasingly crowded DRM industry as more writers,
musicians and filmmakers turn to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The highest-profile example of the demand for online books
occurred last month, when horror author Stephen King made his
16,000-word novella ``Riding the Bullet'' available only via the
Internet. A flood of about 500,000 orders over three days swamped
the servers for several e-tailers.
</P>
<P>
   That said, consumers have been leery of punching their credit
card numbers into a dialog box to read online content, and few Web
sites have succeeded with the pay-to-view model.
</P>
<P>
   ContentGuard, to be based in McLean, Va., is hoping it's a
chicken-and-egg issue. They say the consumers will come if popular
books, movies and music are online. And those will arrive only if
those distributing the content can do so securely and make a nickel
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The e-content economy is in its infancy,'' ContentGuard chief
executive Michael Miron said in an interview. ``Most of the best
stuff isn't on the Web because artists, authors and publishers
don't have the tools to manage what their work is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, ContentGuard co-Chairman Dick Brass conceded that no
copyright protection is foolproof and that ``hackers are clever.
There are workarounds for dishonest people for all kinds of
media.''
</P>
<P>
   Company officials said Napster, the software that lets people
trade MP3-format music files online, has effectively wiped out the
potential to protect a whole generation of music. But they hope
record companies will use ContentGuard to protect new music.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft stock closed at $69.81, up $1.81. Xerox closed at
$27.06, down 94 cents.

CISCO ALLEGES KICKBACK DEAL BY 2 SALESMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By TODD WALLACK 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Cisco Systems, the world's largest data
networking company, said Thursday it fired, suspended or reassigned
a half-dozen workers after learning about an embarrassing kickback
scheme involving its sales force.
</P>
<P>
   In a complicated scheme, the San Jose, Calif., company says two
of its salesmen helped arrange the sale of more than $50 million in
equipment and services to American MetroComm, a Louisiana
telecommunications firm. As part of the deal, a Cisco reseller,
Worldwide Web Systems of Miami, was supposed to provide American
MetroComm with software and help set up the networking equipment.
Cisco agreed to finance the deal and began sending the equipment
and payments to Worldwide Web Systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Cisco alleges that every time it sent a check to Worldwide
Web Systems, Worldwide immediately sent part of the money _ the
``kickback'' _ to companies controlled by the salesmen, Kevin
Bennett of Cleveland and Vincent Rotondo of Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco says it found out about the scheme in December, after
Worldwide had a falling out with Bennett and Rotondo. Worldwide
sued the salesmen in federal court in Florida, accusing them of
extorting $5 million in payments. It also claimed Rotondo made
death threats against a Worldwide executive.
</P>
<P>
   American MetroComm also complained to Cisco that Worldwide never
provided the help it promised and demanded compensation from Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   After an investigation, Cisco said it fired two workers,
including Rotondo, suspended another and reassigned three more,
including the salesmen's supervisor. Two more workers, including
Bennett, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal was first reported Thursday in the Wall Street
Journal. The matter has also sparked an FBI investigation and a
second lawsuit: Cisco sued Worldwide and American MetroComm on
Thursday in San Jose federal court, seeking repayment for its
loans. Neither Worldwide nor American MetroComm returned calls.
Cisco also filed arbitration claims against the salesmen.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI investigation is focused on the two salesmen, Cisco
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's attorney told the Journal the kickbacks ``never
happened.'' Rotondo's lawyer told the paper that the payments were
for services _ not improper commissions _ and that Cisco encouraged
his outside investments.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seemed to disregard the news. Cisco's stock jumped
$2.25, to $69, yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Cisco insists the arrangement was an isolated incident and
tightened its conflict-of-interest policies a month ago to prevent
similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Cisco had only required workers to disclose
investments in outside companies. Now it specifically bars workers
from investing in Cisco customers, partners or suppliers they deal
with on behalf of Cisco, unless they receive special permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're taking the incident very seriously,'' said spokeswoman
Lorene Arey. But Arey said she doubted the incident would tarnish
the company's image.
</P>
<P>
   Although Cisco salesmen are widely considered aggressive,
awarding steep discounts to win business or making a plane trip to
close a sale, they don't have a reputation as sleazy or unethical,
said Esmeralda Silva, an analyst with International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   She said she cannot recall hearing about any similar allegations
against Cisco workers. ``This is very extreme,'' she said. But
generally, she added that workers often invest in the industries
and companies they know best, which can sometimes lead to conflicts
of interest.

JOB SEEKERS GETTING PICKY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN SAID 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR;   &LR; A warier, tougher type of job seeker waded
out into the WorkWorld career fair in San Francisco on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After a roller-coaster month on Wall Street, plus reports of
some e-tailers running out of money, the job hunters were
determined to pick correctly in Silicon Valley's version of ``Who
Wants to Be a Millionaire?''
</P>
<P>
   Take Fernando Custodio. The San Francisco resident has already
been through one IPO meltdown. He wouldn't identify his current
employer but said its stock went public at $40 and now trades at
$11.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he's not deterred from seeking dot-com riches; it's the
only way he can fulfill his goal of retiring by age 40 _ just 16
years away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You gotta roll that dice,'' said Custodio, who came to
WorkWorld seeking a systems administrator position.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of about 2,500 job hunters cruising the booths of 132
companies at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium. The companies _
largely tech-related firms looking for everything from software
architects to XML experts _ had paid $4,500 to $10,000 for a chance
to recruit at the fair, sponsored by online job site HotJobs.com.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment in the Bay Area at record lows, the job
hunters had the upper hand. According to the California Employment
Development Department, the unemployment rate is 2.1 percent in
Santa Clara County, 2.8 percent in Alameda and Contra Costa
counties, and just 1.9 percent in San Francisco, San Mateo and
Marin counties. That compares with 5 percent statewide.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Berkett, recruiting manager at Driveway, a San Francisco
company that provides file-storage space on the Web, said filling
open slots can be a tough sell. Like many firms at WorkWorld, the
company is bulking up dramatically: It needs to add 60 workers to
its 70-person staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are getting multiple offers; they can write their own
tickets,'' she said. ``Everyone wants to see what your business
model is, and that you're going to turn a profit at some point. We
have to sell them on the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides standard trade-show gimmicks like free Frisbees, mouse
pads and candy, plenty of companies were handing out fact sheets
packed with statistics on their customers, funding and long-term
objectives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Job candidates will be much more discerning,'' said Gail
Broson, a senior analyst at IPO Monitor in Palo Alto, Calif.,
speaking before the show. ``People who have some good notches on
their gun belt won't take the kind of risks they might have taken a
year ago because the market is so volatile now.''
</P>
<P>
   Anja Plowright of Berkeley, Calif., who brought her 3-week-old,
Andrew, in a stroller, was looking for a marketing position. She
was interviewing companies _ rather than the other way around _
``to make sure they have solid (financial) backing and who it's
from, how serious they are about sticking to their business plan,
when is the IPO.''
</P>
<P>
   The dismal performance of recent IPOs was on many job seekers'
minds. A third of the 159 Bay Area companies that have gone public
since January 1999 are now trading below their offering price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leery of someone offering a lot of stock that could turn
into mush,'' said Oban Lambie, a systems administrator in Taos,
N.M., who wants to move to San Francisco by June. ``I can't eat
stock. I need money so I can afford to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Lambie stands a good chance of getting money thrown at him. At
10 p.m. Monday night, he posted his resume on Craig's List
( &LR; www.craigslist.org &LR; ), a San Francisco online bulletin board that
Forrester Research this month ranked as the most efficient
job-recruitment site. By Wednesday morning, Lambie had 70
responses. ``It's overwhelming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kristina Raines, who was seeking a systems administrator
position, scoffed at companies' attempts to lure new employees with
promises of work environments more fun than Disneyland. Internet
search firm Flyswat had employees garbed as giant flies handing out
full-color brochures touting the amenities of its South of Market
office _ a '50s diner-themed kitchen with all-you-can-eat gummy
bears and soda, a Moroccan tea room, a beach-themed meeting room
with real sand, Ping-Pong and Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   ``A foosball table isn't going to make me take a job,'' Raines
said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent rash of bad news, experts commenting before
the show said they think new companies still will be able to staff
up. ``Historically throughout the Bay Area, people will always go
to new, exciting startups,'' said venture capitalist Philip
Halperin, general partner in Weston Presidio Capital. ``That's the
gene pool that has proliferated within the Bay Area since 1849.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Haley, managing director of Redpoint Ventures in Menlo Park,
Calif., said recruiting good people has always been a challenge but
can be overcome with aggressive networking.
</P>
<P>
   Companies in the throes of stock-market woes may be having a
harder time keeping the employees they already have. Last week,
headhunter Ellen Hathaway of San Francisco's Exceptional People
Inc. hired a free-lancer to cold-call executives at dot-com firms.
Usually, she gets at most a 2 percent response rate from such
calls. This time, 15 percent of the 100 or so people called said
they were interested in looking for another job.
</P>
<P>
   One senior executive at a dot-com applauded Hathaway for her
timing: The company will soon announce that it is three months away
from bankruptcy. ``This person had enjoyed the ride but wanted to
go to safer shores _ an organization with revenue-generation
opportunities,'' Hathaway said. The executive is about to sign on
with a ``more staid company,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   How can you figure out which companies will go belly-up? Faina
Brun of San Francisco, who was at WorkWorld looking for a job as a
quality assurance tester, had a fatalistic attitude. ``Nobody
knows; only God.''

SCANDINAVIAN LEADERS PUT SEAL OF APPROVAL ON SMITHSONIAN'S VIKING
EXHIBIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif., Canada)   (ADDS ``V'' to King Harald V in 2nd graf. Lede has insert.) 
By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One thousand years after Leif Eriksson reached the
coast of North America _ apparently at Newfoundland and probably
elsewhere, too _ royalty and political leaders of Scandinavia
showed up here Thursday to put their seal of approval on what
promises to be the Year of the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Led by King Harald V and Queen Sonja of Norway, the Scandinavian
visitors inspected a new exhibition, ``Vikings: The North Atlantic
Saga,'' at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History. The
show opens to the public on Saturday and will run through Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   The more than 300 objects on exhibit include silver and bronze
inlaid swords, battle axes and silver jewelry and other loot from
the raids on Europe and the British Isles that made Viking
marauders so feared between 750 and about 1050 and fixed their
pillage-and-plunder reputation down through history. A Swedish
ninth century ``picture stone'' depicts two Vikings battling with
swords in Valhalla, the warriors' heaven. A centerpiece of the show
is a replica of a classic Viking ``ship burial.''
</P>
<P>
   Another side of the Vikings, though, is reflected in samples of
textiles and carvings, a manuscript of the Iceland Sagas _ the only
written record of the Norse explorations in the North Atlantic _
and various artifacts found in their Greenland settlement and along
the shores of Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. William W. Fitzhugh, an archaeologist and director of the
museum's Arctic Studies Center, said that previous exhibitions
``had failed to communicate the depths of Viking culture,
especially in lands west of Europe.'' Recent archaeological finds
and new interpretations of historical documents, he said, cast a
new light on the Vikings, also known as the Norse, as not just
horn-helmeted warriors but also successful boat builders and
traders, canny navigators and explorers who planted colonies across
a northern arc of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   On entering the exhibition gallery, visitors read the message
the show strives to deliver: ``Say Vikings! and images leap to
mind, yet the well-worn stereotypes hardly tell the whole story.
Behind battle axes and dragon-prowed longships lay a bustling world
of keen traders, prosperous townsmen, diligent livestock farmers
and master shipbuilders. From their ranks came extraordinary,
legendary explorers and settlers _ men and women who expanded the
horizons of their world, and ours.''
</P>
<P>
   More than once, the royal visitors and curators pointedly
remarked that these westering mariners had made it to what would be
called America 500 years before Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   An honored guest Thursday at the exhibition was Helge Ingstad,
100 years old, who was the Norwegian explorer and writer who found
at L'Anse aux Meadows in Newfoundland what has turned out to be the
first established site of a Norse settlement around 1000. Excavated
in the 1960s, the ruins of sod houses and the location itself,
scholars say, fit the descriptions in the sagas of a base camp
Eriksson erected.
</P>
<P>
   King Harald praised Ingstad for discovering ``new knowledge
about our history.'' He said the exhibition had significance for
both Scandinavians and Americans as a reminder of ``our common
Viking past.''
</P>
<P>
   Other representatives from the Viking homelands at Thursday's
event included: Olfur Ragnar Grimsson, president of Iceland; Tarja
Halonen, president of Finland; Crown Princess Victoria of Sweden,
and Prince Joachim of Denmark. Like the others, Elsebeth Gerner
Nielson, chairwoman of the Nordic Council of Ministers for Cultural
Affairs, a sponsor of the exhibition, seemed cheerfully willing to
accept both the pillaging and heroic sides of the Viking image.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we're not terrifying anyone anymore,'' she said, ``we
still like the comparison with Vikings.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other support for the $3-million exhibition was provided by
Volvo. The curators, Fitzhugh and Elizabeth I. Ward, both of the
Smithsonian Institution, obtained artifacts from museums in Canada,
Denmark, Greenland, Iceland, Norway and Scotland.
</P>
<P>
   After its Smithsonian run, the exhibition will move to the
American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan, opening there on
Oct. 20 _ which happens to be eight days after Columbus Day _ and
closing next Jan. 20. Then it is to travel to Houston, Los Angeles
and Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   The millennial anniversary of Norse explorations of North
America has inspired several other events, especially in Canada. A
Viking exhibit is to open in St. John's, Newfoundland, on June 2. A
re-enactment of the people, crafts and foods of the Viking era is
planned at L'Anse aux Meadows, the confirmed Norse settlement site.
And several replicas of Viking ships will be plying the coastal
waters of Newfoundland and Labrador, stopping at community
festivals marking the 1,000 years since Leif Eriksson passed this
way.

SAN ANTONIO MAN, 31, ARRESTED IN DEATH OF TEXAS A&AMP;M STUDENT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN MARCOS, Texas _ A 31-year-old San Antonio man was jailed on
a murder charge Thursday for the mysterious slaying of Texas A&AMP;M
University student Kerry J. Kujawa of Richmond during a meeting the
two arranged in an Internet chat room.
</P>
<P>
   A motive for the killing _ and crucial details about it _
remained unclear. Investigators said the crime was not part of a
robbery scheme, but they wouldn't say whether the male suspect was
posing as a female named Kelly who the victim told his family he
was planning to meet in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Wayne Lockwood confessed to the crime and was caught at 2
a.m. Thursday while in a San Antonio hospital, where he was being
treated for undisclosed medical problems not related to the murder,
said Hays County Sheriff Don Montague.
</P>
<P>
   Lockwood, who is unemployed, has no previous criminal record or
history of Internet-related incidents, officials said. ``There was
no indication he tried to lure others'' using a bogus cyberspace
persona, said Detective Samuel D. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Lockwood was released from the hospital a few hours after his
arrest and was taken before a Bexar County magistrate to have bond
set before being transferred to the county jail in San Marcos,
Montague said. He was being held in lieu of $500,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   Kujawa, 20, was slain with a single gunshot to the back of the
head, but where and when the shooting occurred weren't immediately
disclosed by officials who said they didn't want to jeopardize
their ongoing probe.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, investigators had speculated that the murder occurred
soon after Kujawa left College Station on April 7 to meet the
Internet acquaintance. The victim's car was found parked at the
Easterwood Airport in College Station on April 10, before he was
reported missing, but how and when it got there weren't disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Kujawa's body was hidden on a ranch in Hays County,
the victim's family received several reassuring messages,
purportedly from the victim, that were sent from the e-mail account
of ``Kelly.'' The messages said Kujawa was in San Antonio taking
care of his new friend. Texas A&AMP;M police said ``Kelly'' claimed to
be a female with boyfriend problems.
</P>
<P>
   A pending analysis of Lockwood's confiscated computer should
help establish whether Lockwood and ``Kelly'' were one and the
same, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, the arresting officer, said Lockwood was ``somewhat
cooperative'' during a six-hour interrogation that resulted in a
``full confession ... He confirmed most of our suspicions.''
Williams would not disclose whether Lockwood provided a written or
recorded statement, calling it only an ``interview.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're unwilling to comment on the motive ... There are a lot
of questions we can't answer. We owe it to the victim and the
families,'' Williams said. But he ruled out robbery or attempted
robbery as possible motives.
</P>
<P>
   Before the arrest, law enforcement officials said they believed
Kujawa, a mechanical engineering junior at A&AMP;M and National Merit
Scholar from Austin High School in Richmond, disappeared after
leaving for San Antonio to meet ``Kelly.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the suspect and victim apparently made contact
through an Internet Relay Chat network, possibly in a chat room
whose theme ``was not sexual in nature,'' Williams said. However,
Williams declined to characterize the types of chat rooms or ``chat
channels'' visited by the victim or suspect.
</P>
<P>
   On April 19, the day before he was reported missing at Texas
A&AMP;M, Kujawa's badly decomposed body was found hidden on a ranch
near Dripping Springs in northwest Hays County. Because the body
was found in his jurisdiction, the Hays County sheriff took the
lead role in the ongoing investigation that also involves Texas
Rangers in five cities and police in San Antonio, College Station
and at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hays County prosecutors have agreed to handle the case,
they have the option of turning it over to another jurisdiction if
it's determined that the killing occurred in another county or if
the body was taken through another county, Montague said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to arresting Lockwood, the sheriff said his officers
searched Lockwood's residence Wednesday night in an upscale part of
northwest San Antonio and confiscated a computer and other
evidence. Williams, calling the case ``extremely complex,'' said
there was a ``mountain of stuff that has to be sorted through.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, Texas A&AMP;M and its Association of Former
Students offered a reward of up to $10,000 for information leading
to the apprehension of the murderer, but investigators indicated
that the arrest did not result from the reward's posting.
</P>
<P>
   Kujawa was a President's Endowed Scholarship recipient at A&AMP;M.
He is survived by his parents, John and Lucille Kujawa, and his
brother, Kraig.

LEHTINEN PROGRESSING, BUT STILL NOT READY TO PLAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MAC ENGEL, JENNIFER FLOYD AND CHAREAN WILLIAMS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ While Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said
yesterday he's optimistic about injured winger Jere Lehtinen's
progress, Lehtinen will not play in Game 1 tonight against San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said that Lehtinen has skated the past two days with
other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked really good,'' said Brad Lukowich, who skated with
Lehtinen. ``Whether or not he's hurting, I couldn't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock said the next step is for Lehtinen, who missed 65
games this season because of a fractured right ankle, is to join
practice. That could happen in the next couple of days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than Lehtinen, who is really close, we are healthy,''
Hitchcock said. ``This will be a series key injuries are going to
be a factor. Hopefully we can stay healthy and get healthy right
along.'' \Nsubheds:Marshall ready and waiting After playing in two
of the five games in the first-round series against Edmonton, Stars
winger Grant Marshall is still not sure if he'll be in the lineup
against San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the wrong guy to ask,'' Marshall said. ``I am going like I
am playing. You never know until \Rtoday\S.''  &QL; 
Bryan who?
</P>
<P>
   The Stars aren't about to let Sharks defenseman Bryan Marchment
get under their skin before the series has begun. So they spent
much of yesterday's media session deflecting questions about
Marchment, who has become Public Enemy No. 1 in Dallas since he
knocked out three Stars players with knee injuries in 1997-98.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things I don't like about what he does, but
I'm not going to get in a words thing about him,'' Stars forward
Grant Marshall said. ``He's a guy who's playing really, really well
for their team right now. ... There's no question he likes to step
up and hit. But you can't just make it Stars vs. Marchment. It's
the Stars vs. San Jose. They have a very good hockey club.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars say that they haven't spent much time thinking about
Marchment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we were that worried about Marchment, then that's what San
Jose wants. We're not,'' Stars defenseman Derian Hatcher said.  &QL; 
There are other issues
</P>
<P>
   While much of talk is focusing on Bryan Marchment and the rest
of the Sharks bruisers, not as much has been said about
high-scoring forwards Owen Nolan, Vincent Damphousse and Mike
Ricci.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not worried about their defense to be honest,'' Derian
Hatcher said. ``I'm worried about their forwards.''  &QL; 
Isn't this fun?
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock appeared to be a little loose after yesterday's
practice, almost as if he can't wait for this series to begin. Is
he excited to get this thing going?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am, yeah,'' said Hitchcock, who knows Sharks coach Darryl
Sutter and Sharks assistant coach Paul Baxter. ``I've known them
for years. ... They know me. These are WHL \RWestern Hockey
League\S boys going at it. We know how to play them, and they know
how to play us.''

ROAD HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN KIND, BUT KNICKS ARE UPBEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Larry Johnson was asked whether the Knicks doubted
themselves after two narrow victories against the Toronto Raptors
at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where are you from, Toronto?'' Johnson asked. ``We won two
games. Doubt these two games? Next question.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were unconcerned that they won Game 1 by 4 points and
Game 2 by a point. The only number they care about is 15, the total
number of victories it takes to win a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``A win is a win,'' the Knicks' Allan Houston said. ``That's
what our expectations are. And if we're going to get to that point
it's not going to be easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy before the series spoke of a need to start
quickly in Game 1. The Knicks dominated the first quarter,
outscoring the Raptors by 27-12and then hung on for a 92-88 victory
that wasn't secured until the final seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Before Game 2, Van Gundy thought his players seemed
overconfident and, sure enough, the Raptors raced out to a 15-point
lead in the second quarter and held a 14-point margin early in the
fourth quarter. But the Knicks rallied, outscoring the Raptors by
29-16 to win, 84-83.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every now and then in a playoff series you have a real close
game like this,'' Marcus Camby said. ``Some team just beats on you
the whole game, but the other team finds a way to get out. I think
we kind of snuck one out. We didn't play particularly good
basketball, but we found a way to get a win.''
</P>
<P>
   The series moves to Toronto, where the Knicks have had their
troubles, dropping both regular-season meetings by lopsided scores,
91-70 on Feb. 14 and by 86-71 on April 14.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the Knicks have had trouble winning on the road this
season. They lost their last four regular-season games away from
the Garden to finish 17-24 for the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they'd have won this game, homecourt advantage would have
had nothing to do with it,'' Johnson said. ``It'd be 1-1 going to
their place and they'd have home-court advantage. Now we're up two
and we can put a little pressure on those guys. We haven't won up
their in Toronto in a while, but we're up two games. We need to go
up there and play the way we played the first quarter of the first
game.''
</P>
<P>
   But the postseason is a different time, as evidenced by the
Knicks' improbable path to the finals last season, when they were
6-2 on the road in the playoffs before dropping both games in San
Antonio. After Game 2 on Wednesday, they seemed determined to
squeeze the life out of the Raptors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be tough, but we're not going to make it easy on
them,'' said Latrell Sprewell, who hit the game-winning shot over
Vince Carter with 7.9 seconds remaining. ``To be honest, I'd like
to get it done in the next game. These guys are tough and we don't
want to give them any life.''
</P>
<P>
   Camby said after Game 2: ``It would be great for me to sweep
these guys, but that would be tough. They have a lot of veterans,
key players with pride who don't want to be swept. It will tough,
tougher than this one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors' Tracy McGrady, who shut down Houston in Game 2,
said: ``We're coming back. We've been so close in two games. We
could easily be up, 2-0, instead of down, 2-0.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Houston, if fact, has been a highly paid observer in the fourth
quarter of each game. In Game 1, he was 0 for 3 from the field
after scoring 21 points in the first three quarters. In Game 2, he
was on the bench until Johnson fouled out with 5 minutes 9 seconds
to play, and he did not hit a field goal. Houston's only points
came when he was fouled with 38.5 seconds left and converted two
free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't get in a rhythm,'' Houston said after the game.
``The bottom line is I didn't let the game come to me as much as I
did in the past. Sometimes you can be a little too aggressive.
That's what I was tonight. You learn from it. In the last minutes I
said I was going to let it come to me and take what comes and at
the same time try to be aggressive. That's what happened the last
few minutes. I think I burden myself too much with scoring and
taking shots and it kind of backfired on me because I just wanted
to be aggressive, but at the same time, relaxed a little, and let
the game come to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston still contributed in the end, driving and dishing off to
Patrick Ewing for a dunk with 1:06 left, and then hitting the free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I've learned,'' Houston said. ``It doesn't matter
what happens. If you're in the game that's when you can help your
team. I just wanted to put myself in a position where I could.'' &QL;

KEYSHAWN LIKES WHAT HE SEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Keyshawn Johnson, who's never had a problem getting the word
out, shrugs when it's suggested he could become sports' version of
the king of all media.
</P>
<P>
   But, yes, he's already having a license plate frame made for his
car that says ``Keyshawn.com'' for his soon-to-revved-up Web site.
Likewise, he's already prepared to do battle with whomever to claim
what should be his in a media world that's constantly grabbing for
his opinions and images to entertain their own readers, viewers and
listeners.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday morning, at the Interactive Sports 2000 West conference
in Santa Monica, Calif., for sports online media companies, the
newest Tampa Bay Bucs receiver, one-time New York media maven and
former USC All- American entertained hundreds of techies with his
visions of self-contained media supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   During a seminar entitled ``Web Rights and Sports Properties:
What Does the Future Hold?'' Johnson tried to build a beachhead in
defense of his right to promote himself as a property. It shows how
he could be ahead of the curve when it comes to individual athletes
rocking sports' continuing new voyage into the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``My site has only been up for a week, but mine will be more
advanced than probably a lot of sites with athletes because I want
to be involved and be more in depth,'' said Johnson, who signed
with Santa Monica-based Broadband.com to start a Web home first on
AthletesDirect.com and then his own Web venture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably have some flack with the NFL over some things I
want to tap into. It'll come down to a fine line sometimes. Things
like logos and colors. The NFL may own them, but ultimately we wear
them _ and in fact if we didn't wear them, it wouldn't be much use
to them anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   At immediate stake is control of video and audio clips, which TV
and radio pay rights fees for but don't always have exclusive
control over. Most Internet rights are owned by the leagues and
those images and sounds are, for the time being, funneled through
their official league sites. Ad revenue is being also being shared
and redistributed by the leagues to help teams they feel are most
in need.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the Web's virile nature, the rapid advances in
technology and the constant redefining of boundaries, the league
rules and bylaws don't keep up with the latest in media rights and
wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   As athletes like Johnson continue to be inundated with media
requests _ including much more from the Internet for chats and the
like _ it behooves them to take control of their own message and
direct it toward their own sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some have taken that to an extreme, blocking out TV, radio and
print reporters while ``talking'' only on their site. In the 'Net
biz, it's known as ``commodity content.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's their prerogative,'' said Johnson. ``I have fan sites
who ask me to come on and do chats, and as long as I have the time,
I'll do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll always deal with the media. I don't want to (use the Web
site to hide behind). That's not my nature.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, if I have something exclusive _ if I was about to sign
with Tampa Bay in about five hours _ then I'll have it first on my
site. My site will be for my fans instead of the media.''
</P>
<P>
   That will include links to newspaper sites that have
!ital!anything to write about Keyshawn Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   A recurring theme from the two-day conference was that the
Internet is allowing teams and athletes to become media themselves
_ owning their own media channel rather than need to rely heavily
on a partner.
</P>
<P>
   With that, someone like Johnson can have his own cameraman come
out this season at Bucs games and shoot video of him so that he can
present his own highlight package within minutes. Even before ESPN
or Fox have a chance to put it out on their TV, radio and Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``I envision my site as a highlight show, like ESPN, with live,
not just taped highlights,'' said Johnson. ``Eventually we're going
to go in that direction. We just haven't figured it out yet.''
</P>
<P>
   More reshaping empires: Shaquille O'Neal's media makeover,
without the help of Reebok commercials or monotone movie roles, has
also being shaped through Internet endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Armato, O'Neal agent and Lakers courtside seat holder,
told the New York Times this week that the soon-to-be-MVP center
will soon appear in commercials for FreeInternet.com and he has
also finished a deal with Web-hosting company Digex. This, as his
apparel-selling site, dunk.net, has been netting plenty of local
exposure through T-shirt giveaways and promotions outside the
Staple Center during Laker games.
</P>
<P>
   Armato added that Shaq won't be making any more movies ``unless
he wins'' an NBA title. Call that a conflict of emotions for Laker
fans.
</P>
<P>
   __ Stern criticism: Monday's symposium with all four of the
major pro sports commissioners hosted by the Museum of Radio and TV
allowed NBA chief David Stern to get a blast off on how TV
sportscasters too often sink to struggling lounge act when they try
to inject snappy humor into their story intros.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they need a director or a producer to tell them to get
on with their report,'' said Stern. ``I guess that if that's what
people watching ESPN want, that's what they want. But I don't know
if it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our experience is that it's all about the game. You start from
a fan base that wants to know about the game. If you want to have
in-depth reporting on athletes, that's fine. But when it becomes
about the next wisecrack, it cheapens the game. I think someone
should bring some order to the asylum.''
</P>
<P>
   Added baseball commissioner Bud Selig: ``Levity is fine once and
a while, but sports fans do tune in to see what the score is and
how their team did. They're supposed to be journalists. I think the
line has been crossed, quite candidly.''
</P>
<P>
   In answer to Stern, Fox's Keith Olbermann replied on Wednesday's
``National Sports Report'': ``If you want fewer TV jokes about the
NBA, get rid of the Clippers.''
</P>
<P>
   And as for Bud: Here's a new flash _ that line was crossed long
ago. Quite loudly, if you'd been listening. &QL;

__ Back for its sixth year, Jim Rome's annual ``Smack Off'' runs
today (9-to-noon) on AM-1150. Smack on, you wayward clones. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Who else but Vin Scully can ``remind'' viewers that ``you can
still buy four season tickets at Dodger Stadium for just sixteen
hundred and twenty dollars'' and make it sound like all you have to
do is search the cushions of your sofa and collect a few empty coke
bottles to come up with that kind of cash? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Adding to ABC's coverage of the NASCAR event from Fontana
live Sunday at 11 a.m. (with Bob Jenkins, Benny Parsons, Jerry
Punch and Bill Weber), KMPC-AM (1540) initiates radio coverage of
the event. Today's qualifying goes live on ESPN2 at 2:30 p.m., with
the Busch Series race Saturday at noon on ESPN. Sunday morning,
ESPN2 has RPM 2Day (10 a.m.) and NASCAR 2Day (10:30 a.m.) leading
into the event. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ Ed Goren, the executive producer of Fox Sports since its
inception in Jan. '94, has been named president of the company by
its former president, David Hill, currently the CEO and Chairman of
Fox Sports Television. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WHAT CHOKES &QL; 
__ In honor of the late commissioner of the league, they give out
the Walter Kennedy Trophy to the annual champion of the NBA. How
will they remember David Stern? How about with the Stern Urn _ a
big ash tray to the team that gets the biggest ratings during the
playoffs, thanks to his new, expanded format that allows the first
round to stretch longer than the final season of ``Chico and the
Man,'' post-Freddie Prinz. What a fine help it's been for everyone
else, too. While Tim Duncan gets every opportunity to get himself
healthy, the media has time to create new storylines to sustain
interest. Can't tell if it's worked or not yet. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   __ And then there's TNT's marketing slogan for the playoffs:
``Win Or Go Home.'' Sacramento lost Game 1 to the Lakers, then went
home. But they came back for Game 2. Is that how it's supposed to
work?

A TENNIS PRODIGY FROM THE PROJECTS GETS THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Ariz., Fla.)   By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Growing up in the projects of East Las Vegas, Nev.,
Claudia Meza wore black lipstick, flashed gang signs and concealed
knives and brass knuckles in her baggy pants.
</P>
<P>
   At age 12, she endured depression that led to a suicide attempt,
which failed when her cousin walked into the bathroom. At 14, she
was sent to live with a grandmother in a tough South Tucson, Ariz.,
neighborhood where she heard gunshots again, got into fewer fights
but also picked up a tennis racket and, in five years, earned a
half-scholarship and national collegiate ranking at Grand Canyon
University.
</P>
<P>
   In June, the 5-foot-10-inch Meza will take her fearless attitude
and aggressive strokes to the Rick Macci Tennis Academy in Pompano
Beach, Fla., for a summer of world-class instruction. She was
invited sight unseen, discovered over the Internet in a flurry of
e-mail messages between a caring high-school coach and a tennis
academy searching for the next Venus or Serena Williams. ``I take a
deep breath every time I think about it,'' Meza said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always believed in myself, even though I was a thug,'' she
said recently after her last home match at Grand Canyon University.
``I always felt I could be something. I just didn't know how or
when it would happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The Macci Academy is trying to hone the skills that will make it
happen someday for Meza on the international tour. ``In this
business, sometimes you've got to gamble,'' said Greg Russell, the
director of coaches and technical development for the academy,
which produced Jennifer Capriati. ``You've just got to have a gut
feeling, and seeing her background, we decided to help her.
Whatever happens, happens. At least we gave her a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Meza, a 20-year-old sophomore, recently cracked the
Intercollegiate Tennis Association Division II ranking, making her
debut at No. 17 in the West. She hopes to improve on that at a
tournament this weekend in Ojai, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unbelievable,'' Meza said of her Macci invitation. ``I'm
still shocked, I guess, that they'd want to work with me. Tennis
saved me. It gave me something to look forward to. I started a
whole new life. It was a transformation, and it happened so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Meza's choices had seemed to be jail or worse during a troubled
home life. Her mother, Maria, worked long hours as a housekeeper at
Caesars Palace to support Claudia and her younger sister, Crystal.
Her mother found it increasingly difficult to control Claudia,
whose problems eventually followed her home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would come and break our windows and slash our tires,''
Maria Meza said of the gangs in an interview from Las Vegas last
week. ``They call and say, `I'm going to kill your daughter, I'm
going to kill you.'''
</P>
<P>
   One night, a gang of about 25 young people chased Claudia to her
house and stood outside yelling threats until the police arrived.
Not long afterward, the family decided that Claudia should go to
South Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had to go,'' Maria Meza said. ``It was too much. So many
fights. I was so scared. I thought she'd end up dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia's new environment was not much different. Her
grandmother, Guillerma Meza, lives near Irvington and South 12th
Avenue, a flashpoint for violence in South Tucson. Early Easter
morning, two separate shooting incidents within six blocks of her
house left three people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Guillerma's guidance, however, worked wonders on her
granddaughter. Within one year, she got Claudia interested in
attending church. She also thought modeling classes would help the
girl's self-confidence. To help pay for those classes, Guillerma
Meza traveled to Juarez, Mexico, to buy clothes in the open markets
and sell them in Tucson for a profit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It broke my heart to see her like she was,'' Guillerma Meza
said in Spanish over Easter brunch at her home. ``I'm proud of her
because we have had a struggle together. We fight hard, and I thank
God for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Claudia, who was translating, stopped to wipe a tear from her
eye, before her grandmother continued speaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe how far she has gotten,'' Guillerma said. ``I
cry for joy, it's so unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the table sat Stacy Haines, the tennis coach at Desert
View High School, who first saw Meza's potential. Meza tried out
for the team because a friend wanted her to. Rough as Meza was _ in
her first high-school match, she threatened to beat up an opponent
who was winning points on high, deep lobs _ Haines liked the
athletic aggression she showed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have any strokes,'' Meza said. ``I'd hit balls over
the fence. I didn't know how to keep score or anything. I
stereotyped it as a wimpy game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd do it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Haines, Meza said: ``He was the first to actually believe in
me and tell me I could do things. He made me feel worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Haines eventually got Meza into the Tucson Racquet Club for
instruction. ``She didn't fit in, but she wouldn't quit,'' Haines
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in tennis has been nice to her,'' he added. ``Part of
it was probably racial, but it was also economic. Some of it was
her feeling inferior, too, but she gradually got more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Meza recalled a conversation with a member on one of her first
visits to the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked by him, and he asked, `Where are you from?' I said,
`South Tucson.' He said, `What are you doing here?' I said,
`playing tennis.' He just said, `Oh.'''
</P>
<P>
   Haines has served as Meza's coach, defender, mentor and
publicist. He initially contacted Gerry Roberts, the academy's
former director of sports science and now a Macci consultant.
Roberts passed the information about Meza to Russell, who sent the
official invitation in March via an e-mail message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not her age, it's her motivation and how hard she
works,'' Russell said, when asked whether Meza could overcome the
late start and be successful on the tour. ``The good thing about
that is you don't have to teach an old dog new tricks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids who come here with an endless amount of money, and no
matter what you do, you can't motivate them. Here's a kid with an
unbelievable background, who's fought her way this far this fast
and she really wants it. I love working with kids like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Meza, meanwhile, relishes the opportunity to break down
stereotypes. ``I have to make my people proud,'' she said. ``There
has to be somebody to step up and tell everybody they can do it.''

daily radio show ``Transitions,'' in Miami, Carmen Duarte, 40, a
Cuban-American, has said Elian Gonzalez should have been reunited
with his father months ago. Callers have since accused her of being
a Cuban agent. ``There are always calls,'' says Duarte, who came to
the United States in 1993. ``There are always insults. You always
see it with any case that inflames the people.'' (Cindy Karp/The

BENSON FINDS SUCCESS WITH NEW CREW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE RAMIREZ  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Some called it a gamble, but Johnny Benson saw
it as an opportunity. So far, no one can argue with the results.
</P>
<P>
   The former NASCAR Winston Cup Rookie of the Year, who struggled
with consistency the past two seasons driving for Jack Roush,
appears to have gotten his second wind driving for Tyler Jet
Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, who nearly won the season-opening Daytona 500 in
February, has six top-10 finishes in nine races and comes into this
weekend's NAPA Auto Parts 500 at California Speedway 18th in
points.
</P>
<P>
   This all with a second-year team that didn't acquire major
sponsorship until the Saturday of the first race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going pretty good,'' said Benson, who is also competing
in the Winston West 200 on Saturday. ``A lot of people from the
outside may have looked at it and thought it was a bad choice (to
leave Roush for Tyler Jet). But they didn't see the potential I
saw, the quality work this team did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an opportunity to walk through their shop and to meet
the guys on the team. I think what really impressed me was late
(last year), they had some successful qualifying runs and had some
good runs on race day. This is a good race team.''
</P>
<P>
   That was proven in February when Benson, who has yet to capture
his first Winston Cup victory, nearly won the Daytona 500. After
taking advantage of a two-tire pit stop, Benson led 38 laps and
looked primed to win NASCAR's version of the Super Bowl when a
crash brought out the caution with less then 10 laps remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we went to Daytona, we thought we brought a top-10 car,
with or without a sponsor,'' Benson said. ``Everybody thinks when
we got (Lycos to sponsor) the car (the Saturday before the race),
what a great story. But it didn't effect how the car ran. That's
what we had anyways.

<P>
   ``It was a good feeling to have the opportunity to win the race.
But once the yellow came out, we pretty much knew we were in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson's fears came to fruition when the track went green with
three laps remaining. Dale Jarrett, the 1999 series champion, led a
train of Ford Taurus's past his Pontiac Grand Prix, giving Jarrett
the win and dropping Benson to 12th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost hard to believe,'' Benson said. ``We came to
Daytona with an unsponsored car and we left we everyone talking
about us.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it had stayed green, would we have won? I don't know that.
But we finished 12th and that was a pretty good run for us.''
</P>
<P>
   That success has continued for Benson, who would like to finish
in the top-10 in points by season's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure what a realistic goal for this team is,'' Benson
said. ``We want to finish in the top 10. We still want to win a
race, but that's a goal we have every year. After (failing to
qualify at) Atlanta, it's going to be extremely hard to finish in
the top 10. It's reachable and we're going to try to make it
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, we've made some good runs. We were second at
Bristol and were running good before I crashed the car at Texas.
I'm hoping that with us starting off so good, much better then we
expected, that our growth continues to be on an uphill swing and we
can get better and better.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson has no harsh feelings toward his former team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is an easy answer why things didn't work
over there,'' Benson said. ``But I don't care. This team is a good
team and that's my focus right now. I don't worry about what
happened (at Roush). I can't change what happened and I can't do
anything about it. I think the situation just didn't work out the
way everybody wanted and there needed to be a change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I'm on a different team now and I'm glad we're
running good.''

EXECUTIVE CONVICTED OF LEAKING INFORMATION ABOUT BANK DEALS TO PORN
STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former Wall Street executive was convicted of stock
fraud and conspiracy Thursday for leaking confidential financial
information about a series of bank deals to an X-rated movie star.
</P>
<P>
   James J. McDermott Jr., the former chairman and chief executive
of the Manhattan investment bank Keefe, Bruyette &AMP; Woods, was
convicted after a 12-day trial. Jurors concluded that McDermott,
whose firm advised banks about mergers and acquisitions, leaked
secret information about five potential bank mergers to the
actress, Kathryn B. Gannon.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have charged that Gannon passed the
information to a New Jersey businessman, and both traded on the
inside information, illegally making thousands of dollars in
profits.
</P>
<P>
   The businessman, Anthony P. Pomponio, 45, was convicted of
conspiracy and fraud Thursday for trading on the inside
information. He was also convicted of lying to investigators for
the Securities and Exchange Commission when they questioned him
about his trades.
</P>
<P>
   Gannon, who uses the stage name Marylin Star, has also been
charged with insider trading but has not appeared for trial. She is
a Canadian citizen and is believed to be in Canada. Prosecutors are
seeking her extradition.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White announced the charges last December
in what has been one of the stranger insider-trading cases in
recent years. McDermott, 48, was a highly-respected expert on bank
stocks, and his firm had been making plans to make its own stock
offering. Prosecutors charged that he had been having an affair
with Gannon and had supplied her with the secret information over
eight months in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said McDermott was the first Wall Street chief
executive charged with insider trading. He resigned at his firm's
request.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors had wanted to include Gannon's history as a
pornographic film actress and an exotic dancer in the trial. But
after the defense lawyers objected that the information would not
prove the prosecution's case and would be unfair to their clients,
Judge Kimba M. Wood of U.S. District Court in Manhattan ruled that
prosecutors could not refer to Gannon's profession. They were only
allowed to call her an actress and a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gannon did not appear during the trial, the jury was
shown a photograph similar to a driver's license picture. In
pretrial hearings, prosecutors sought to delay the trial to secure
her extradition, but experts presented by the defense estimated
that it could take more than two years. The prosecution said a
typical extradition from Canada would take more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Gannon, who had been living in Miami, returned
to Canada after receiving a subpoena from the SEC. Her lawyers did
not respond to a telephone call seeking comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Wood scheduled sentencing for July 17. McDermott and Pomponio
each face up to five years in prison for conspiracy and up to 10
years in prison for each insider-trading charge.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Amid a record economic boom, janitors _ some of
America's lowest-paid, least-visible workers _ are taking to the
streets and the picket lines from coast to coast to demand a bigger
share of the nation's prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   More than 4,000 janitors who clean office buildings in suburban
Chicago have been on strike for more than a week, demonstrating
downtown and blocking traffic to demand health insurance and a
raise that would lift their families out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The battle spread from Los Angeles, where a three-week strike by
8,500 janitors ended on Monday after Cardinal Roger Mahony gave
them his outspoken support, helping them gain a raise of 26 percent
over three years.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego, 300 janitors have been on strike for nearly three
weeks to press their demand for health insurance. In New York,
10,000 janitors marched on Park Avenue two weeks ago to clamor for
a raise. And more than 1,000 Silicon Valley janitors have held a
series of rallies to hammer home their complaint that in cleaning
offices for some of the world's wealthiest high-tech companies,
they earn too little to afford decent housing or support their
families.
</P>
<P>
   The Service Employees International Union, which represents
185,000 janitors, most of them immigrants, has tried to make them
the poster child for the gulf between rich and poor. Is it fair,
the union demands, for suburban Chicago janitors, cleaning
buildings for people who often earn hundreds of thousands of
dollars a year, to get only $6.65 an hour, without health
insurance?
</P>
<P>
   ``Symbolically, we as a union want to open this century focusing
on the economic divide and bridging the income gap in this
country,'' said Andrew Stern, the union's president. ``That's what
all these contract disputes are about. We want to make sure these
janitors gain their fair share of a booming economy and a booming
real estate market.''
</P>
<P>
   For nearly a decade the union has maneuvered to have most
contracts covering janitors expire around the same time, enabling
it to create a single nationwide campaign on their behalf. Although
the number of strikes by U.S. labor has been declining for half a
century, the Service Employees view this as an ideal time to call
strikes: the economic boom has left building owners and cleaning
contractors well able to afford large raises, the union believes,
and brought low-paid workers public sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Garcia, president of the local in Los Angeles, said in the
aftermath of the strike there, ``With Los Angeles as the backdrop,
with its huge disparity between rich and poor, with all the
uninsured and immigrant workers, we wanted to show that a group of
workers can organize and lift themselves out of poverty if they
bring enough pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Many building owners, under criticism that wages remain low
during a soaring real estate market, say janitors' pay is not up to
them, but to the cleaning contractors. And unionized cleaning
contractors often say that if they raise wages substantially, they
will lose their profit margins and be undercut by nonunion
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The janitors of suburban Chicago began their strike on April 18,
the day after 5,500 janitors who work in downtown Chicago office
buildings had engaged in a daylong strike and won a contract that
will raise their pay to $12.50 an hour from $11.40 over three
years. Those janitors already have health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   For the suburban janitors, the main question is why the downtown
janitors have better pay and benefits. Barry White, chief
negotiator for the suburban cleaning contractors, attributed the
disparity to the competition that these contractors, unlike those
in the heavily unionized downtown, face from nonunion companies.
</P>
<P>
   The unionized suburban companies, White said, fear that the
price of family health coverage, about $1.78 an hour, might push
costs so high that nonunion competitors will underbid them for
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the full family coverage the union is seeking is far
too expensive a benefit for people earning $6.65 an hour,'' White
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those people is Rosa Pederosa, a 30-year-old Mexican
immigrant, who stood alongside hundreds of other striking janitors
blocking traffic in suburban Oak Brook on Tuesday. Pederosa was
excited, although also somewhat worried, about being part of a
strike that seeks two things she badly wants: health insurance and
higher wages. With a bugle blaring and janitors drumming on the
bottoms of plastic wastebaskets, the strikers inched forward, next
to an upscale mall, chanting, ``Si, se puede,'' (``Yes, we can do
it'') as Lexuses and BMWs backed up behind them.
</P>
<P>
   Pederosa, who has three young children, takes home $440 every
two weeks for dusting Venetian blinds at night in a luxury office
tower.
</P>
<P>
   ``We earn very little,'' she said. ``I don't feel comfortable
working near all these really rich people. The owner and the
tenants make a ton of money and dress really well, but earning
$6.65 doesn't even cover expenses for my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Pederosa was taken to a hospital last month when she had
problems breathing. Now she has two big worries: she may have
asthma and, without health insurance or any pay coming in, she has
to find a way to pay the $360 hospital bill and the $150 ambulance
bill.
</P>
<P>
   For Graciella Chagoya, things are much the same. Her 9-year-old
son needed seven stitches after being hit in the head by a baseball
bat. The hospital bill was $1,500, and the ambulance bill $470.
Together, they amount to more than two months' take-home pay; she
is trying to pay down the bill by $100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't understand why they don't want to give us better wages
or health insurance when I'm working so hard for them,'' she said.

   Health coverage is the main issue in the strike in San Diego,
where three janitors and the president of the local have been
fasting for six days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fasting,'' said Mary Grillo, the president, ``to focus
on the choices that workers have to make every single day: Do I
feed my family, or do I pay my rent, or do I take my child to the
doctor? These are not civilized choices in a country like ours.''
</P>
<P>
   In all the disputes, the Service Employees union has worked hard
to line up community support to pressure both building owners and
cleaning contractors. In Los Angeles, the janitors received an
anonymous $1 million gift to sustain them during their strike, and
whenever they marched through the streets, workers came out of
buildings, white-collar and blue-collar alike, to cheer them on.
</P>
<P>
   Mahony, archbishop of Los Angeles, symbolized community support
by presiding over a Mass for the strikers. Describing the janitors
as ``faceless, nameless, voiceless,'' the cardinal said they
deserved a share in ``the wonderful fruitfulness of our economy.''
He praised them for making ``visible in our city an invisible
problem'': the exclusion of many from the boom.
</P>
<P>
   Labor leaders are looking for the success of the Los Angeles
strike to take on symbolic importance. Their hope is that the Los
Angeles janitors, by reminding the nation about the millions of
people on the lower rungs, will galvanize hotel maids, hospital
aides and other low-wage workers to join unions and fight for
higher pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly the janitors won the hearts and souls and support of
the overall community,'' said Garcia, president of the Los Angeles
local. ``It was definitely looked at as a David-versus-Goliath
fight. We were in the right place and right time for a visible
fight.''

WITH ROUGH ROAD AHEAD, METS' OFFENSE HITS A BUMP  
 BY JUDY BATTISTA  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets entered the game against the Reds Thursday
with an opportunity to equal their most successful homestand in
history. On the cusp of a schedule-by-sadists road trip _ 13 games
in 14 days in four cities, with no travel day between games in San
Francisco and South Florida _ the Mets had won eight of nine games
at home. They had even managed to keep Ken Griffey Jr. in check
during his first appearance at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   But Thursday afternoon, the clubhouse was quiet and the quotes
were clipped. The Mets had lost, 2-1, in 12 innings to the Reds,
sending them to their chartered plane with overflowing luggage, two
difficult losses in a row and a sudden inability to score runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were demolished, 12-1, by the Reds on Wednesday, but
this loss seemed more annoying for the missed opportunities and
unexpected turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We misfired a little on offense is all,'' Mets Manager Bobby
Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   The starting pitcher, Glendon Rusch, using a revived changeup,
held the Reds at bay for seven and two-third innings, giving up
only a solo home run to Griffey in the fourth inning. That was
matched in the Mets' half of the fourth by a solo shot by Robin
Ventura off the Reds' starter, Steve Parris, who held the Mets to
four hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   In the 12-1 loss Wednesday, the Mets let the runs pile up
against pitcher Dennis Springer, so that the bullpen could have a
rest. But Thursday, the bullpen was nearly intact and kept holding
off the Reds.
</P>
<P>
   It was a good thing, since the Mets blew a chance to end the
game in the bottom of the ninth with a series of questionable
decisions and misfires: Why didn't Matt Franco bunt with no outs
and a runner on first? Why didn't Mike Piazza, who had the day off,
pinch-hit? What was the pinch-runner Rickey Henderson doing when he
was caught stealing after Franco struck out?
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had two hits in the inning but left the bases loaded.
When the closer Armando Benitez, who had five saves and a victory
in his last six appearances, made his way to the mound for the 12th
inning, the Mets seemed prepared to extend the game.
</P>
<P>
   Benitez had struck out Griffey in the first game of the series
to close out a victory. But Griffey batted in the 11th inning
Thursday, grounding out harmlessly, so Benitez would be spared that
particular matchup again. Benitez made a rare mistake, however,
walking Sean Casey to lead off the inning. Casey advanced when
Aaron Boone sacrificed. Benitez walked the pinch-hitter Hal Morris
intentionally to get to Gookie Dawkins, the shortstop who had been
called up from Class AA last Saturday to replace the injured Barry
Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   Dawkins entered the game batting .125 and he was behind in the
count, 0-1. Benitez threw Dawkins a fastball, his best pitch.
Dawkins connected, hitting a bloop single to left field. Jon
Nunnally charged the ball, but Casey was able to score from second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know this kid,'' Benitez said. ``I didn't know how to
pitch to this kid. He got me. The young guy has a good eye, can
make contact. He put the glove on and he showed he can play.
Sometimes you have to win, sometimes you have to lose. Now it's my
turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Benitez said he had felt a bit stiff when he came into the game,
as if he needed a little more rest. Even so, Benitez said, he had
to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a situation like this, he needs me,'' Benitez said,
referring to Valentine. ``I'll be there. I can't say no.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had another chance in the bottom of the 12th, when the
Reds' pitcher, Scott Sullivan walked Nunnally with one out and then
threw a wild pitch to Derek Bell that put Nunnally on second. Bell
walked to bring up Edgardo Alfonzo. Sullivan went to a full count,
but Alfonzo popped up. So did Ventura to end the game and end what
had been a superb homestand on a disquieting note.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a pretty good chance,'' Alfonzo said. ``I thought we
could tie the game. I guessed wrong.''

HERBERT WECHSLER, LEGAL GIANT, IS DEAD AT 90 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn:  N.Y., Hawaii, Mass., Ala., Kan. )  By TAMAR LEWIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Herbert Wechsler, the Columbia Law School professor
whose work on criminal and constitutional law helped shape the
nation's legal system over half a century, died Wednesday at his
home in Manhattan. He was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Wechsler's achievements were remarkably varied and included the
creation of a model penal code that helped unify the nation's
criminal laws and his successful defense of The New York Times in
the pivotal 1964 First Amendment case, The New York Times vs.
Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   Wechsler stood as a model of scholarly professionalism to
generations of law students, including Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
whom he had as a student twice, first when he was a visiting
professor at Harvard, and then again after she transferred to
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to me then, as he has ever since, to combine the
power and beauty of the Greek gods Zeus and Apollo,'' Ginsburg said
in a 1995 speech. ``He is my teacher still. Of all the books I use
in chambers, the one I consult more than any other is Hart and
Wechsler.''
</P>
<P>
   That well-regarded casebook, ``The Federal Courts and the
Federal System,'' written with Henry Melvin Hart, is now in its
fourth edition and still in wide use.
</P>
<P>
   While at Columbia, Wechsler was director of the American Law
Institute for 21 years and was chief technical adviser to the
American judges at the Nuremberg Trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Herbert Wechsler was in his prime, he stood at the top of
three separate fields, constitutional law, criminal law and federal
courts,'' said Henry P. Monaghan, who now holds Wechsler's longtime
seat as Harlan Fiske Stone professor of constitutional law at
Columbia. ``I can't think of anyone who ever had a comparable
position.''
</P>
<P>
   The case for which Wechsler is probably best known grew out of
the civil rights movement. On March 29, 1960, as sit-ins, freedom
rides and marches were spreading through the South, The New York
Times ran an advertisement headlined ``Heed Their Rising Voices,''
seeking contributions to help the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
and other civil rights leaders fight ``a wave of terror'' against
black students.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was not entirely accurate _ it wrongly told of the
padlocking of a student dining hall to starve the students into
submission, for example _ and it fed Southern officials' anger
against what they perceived as bias by Northern news organizations
against the South.
</P>
<P>
   Though he was not named in the advertisement, L.B. Sullivan, the
Montgomery, Ala., city commissioner in charge of the police, sued
The New York Times and four black ministers for libel.
</P>
<P>
   The all-white Montgomery jury agreed that Sullivan had been
defamed, and awarded him the $500,000 he sought, the highest libel
award in Alabama history.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the case came to the Supreme Court, 11 more libel
suits were pending against The Times in the South, seeking more
than $5 million in damages. Other news organizations were also
sued, making it difficult for out-of-state media to cover the civil
rights movement without fear of being bankrupted.
</P>
<P>
   In arguing the case to the high court, Wechsler reshaped the
focus of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a brilliant argument,'' Monaghan said. ``It's a libel
suit in which the jury awarded damages to a sheriff whose standing
probably went up in the community, not down, as a result of what
was in the newspaper. Most lawyers, including me, would have argued
that you could not, under the First Amendment, presume damages. But
then they would have had to deal with 200 years of precedent
permitting juries to presume damages to reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herb shifted the paradigm, and argued the case as a question
of sedition, playing on the American law's antipathy to the idea of
seditious libel'' _ language criticizing a government in a way that
could incite insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court unanimously overturned the Sullivan judgment,
finding that the press could not meet the need for vigorous debate
of issues if it had to prove the factual accuracy of every
statement about a public official.
</P>
<P>
   Public officials, the court said, could win damages only if they
showed a libelous statement had been made ``with actual malice,
that is, with knowledge that it was false, or reckless disregard of
whether it was false or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after the decision at a symposium celebrating its
principles, Floyd Abrams, the First Amendment lawyer, called the
opinion, written by Justice William J. Brennan Jr., ``one of the
most extraordinary, far-reaching and beautiful decisions in
American history.''
</P>
<P>
   Others at the symposium worried, however, that the decision
might have encouraged sloppy journalism by insulating careless
errors from liability. And just last year, Abrams cautioned the
news media to show that what he called the ``gift'' of the ruling
``is deserved and that it will be used not alone for private
benefit, but for public good.''

   Herbert Wechsler was born in New York on Dec. 4, 1909, and
entered City College of New York at 16, graduating in 1928 with a
degree in French. He applied to teach French at the college, but
was turned down because his father, Samuel, a lawyer, convinced the
head of the French department, whom he knew, that the young man
should be a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Wechsler soon proved his father right: when he graduated from
Columbia Law School in 1931, he was editor in chief of the law
review. He taught at the law school for a year before going to
Washington as a clerk to Justice Harlan Fiske Stone of the Supreme
Court, and returned to Columbia in 1933. He moved to emeritus
status in 1978.

</P>
<P>
   From 1944 to 1946, Wechsler was assistant attorney general in
charge of the War Division, overseeing internments on the West
Coast, martial law in Hawaii and, as the Allied victory neared, the
development of a legal framework around which Nazi war criminals
could be tried. When the Nuremberg Trials began, he was chief
technical adviser to the American judges.
</P>
<P>
   Wechsler's wife, Doris, a lawyer who assisted the research on
the Sullivan case, said that while the case was important, her
husband did not count it as his greatest triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, she said, he was most proud of his work on a decade-long
project to create a model penal code. The American Law Institute's
Model Penal Code, completed in 1962 and used as a guide by many
state legislatures, has been an important force in creating greater
consistency between the states' criminal codes.
</P>
<P>
   The code, she said, was ``a creative act that sprang from his
own thinking and analytical abilities.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to produce a model that could be used by all the
states at a time when most state criminal laws were a disorganized
mess,'' Wechsler said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Wechsler is survived by his
sister-in-law, Nancy Wechsler of Manhattan. Wechsler's brother,
James A. Wechsler, a columnist and former editor of The New York
Post, died in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Wechsler's most controversial writing was probably his 1959
Harvard Law Review article ``Toward Neutral Principles,'' which
helped to shape the debate that raged through the 1960s and early
1970s about how courts should balance the need for principles that
can be applied equally to all parties against the pull of social
and historic context.
</P>
<P>
   In that article, which generated intense criticism, Wechsler
questioned the Supreme Court's reasoning in Brown vs. Board of
Education, the decision declaring segregated schools
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was trying to react to the extremes of the legal
realists, the idea that everything was window-dressing for their
personal preferences,'' Ginsburg said. ``What his article did, very
effectively, is remind us of lawyers' professional obligation to
examine, unsparingly, even the ultimate triumphs of the legal
system, like Brown vs. Board of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``His point was that the way we decide things is very often _
he'd say always, I'd say often _ as important as what we decide.''

XEROX AND MICROSOFT CREATE DIGITAL SAFEGUARD COMPANY
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., Calif.)  By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Xerox Corp. and the Microsoft Corp. said
Thursday that they would create a company to produce and market
software that protects copyrighted materials like books, music and
video distributed over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, ContentGuard Inc., is being spun out of Xerox
and is based on technology developed at the Xerox Palo Alto
Research Center. A public offering is anticipated. Microsoft will
own a minority stake in ContentGuard, which will have headquarters
in McLean, Va., and operations in Palo Alto, Calif., and El
Segundo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox and Microsoft will collaborate with ContentGuard to
develop digital rights management technologies, which provide for
the distribution of digital content while protecting against
unauthorized copying. The lack of secure, reliable content
protection has hindered efforts to build an electronic market in
copyrighted materials. The challenge for the industry has been to
find a way to encode its intellectual property so that, once they
are paid for and downloaded by a buyer, music, videos or documents
can be stored and used only by the buyer without the threat of
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   G. Richard Thoman, president and chief executive at Xerox, and
Steven A. Ballmer, president and chief executive at Microsoft,
announced the formation of the company Thursday at the Xerox
research center. Though Xerox has been known to fail to capitalize
on breakthroughs developed at the research center, Thoman is taking
steps to capitalize on the center's discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the explosive growth on the Web, we had a hidden nugget
here, an asset we could monetize,'' Thoman said in a telephone
interview. ``Our intent is to IPO this company as soon as
feasible.'' Microsoft did not disclose the size of its stake in
ContentGuard, but Ballmer said the cost was in the tens of millions
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox has 17 patents on the technology underlying ContentGuard
and has already announced partnerships with a number of companies,
including Adobe Systems and Hewlett-Packard. About 40 Xerox
employees in the United States and 20 to 30 abroad have been
working in the unit, formerly the Xerox Rights Management group,
Thoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Miron, who has managed the group at Xerox, will become
co-chairman and chief executive of ContentGuard. Richard Brass,
Microsoft's vice president of technology development, will also be
co-chairman of ContentGuard.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the ties to Microsoft, ContentGuard will also work with
producers of competing software, Thoman and Ballmer said.
</P>
<P>
   ContentGuard will compete with a range of companies, including
small concerns like Sunhawk, InterTrust and Preview Systems and
large companies like IBM and AT&AMP;T. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Cynthia H. Augustine, senior vice president for human
resources at The New York Times Co., will succeed C. Frank Roberts
as president of the broadcast group, the company announced on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Until he retires at the end of the year, Roberts will become
chairman of the broadcast group, which includes eight
network-affiliated television stations and two New York City radio
stations. In her new role, Augustine, 42, will report to Roberts.
She will also retain her current title and responsibilities in
human resources.

FORGET THE HULLABALOO AND LOOK AT REAL FACTORS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Everybody in hockey has heard about what has
gone on between the Dallas Stars and San Jose Sharks. There is too
much juicy stuff not to have.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nieuwendyk's knee. Bryan Marchment's style. Ed Belfour's
departure. But take a break from your regularly scheduled rivalry
talk for a word from the players, who swear that the Stars-Sharks
second-round playoff series, which begins at 6 p.m. Friday at
Reunion Arena, will be decided by things that nobody really talks
about.
</P>
<P>
   These are the types of things that will determine whether San
Jose or Dallas is left standing on the road to the Stanley Cup: 1.
ROOMIES
</P>
<P>
   Forget Marchment and Nieuwendyk. The story is going to be
Nieuwendyk and Jamie Langenbrunner.
</P>
<P>
   Only instead of hating each other, Nieuwendyk and Langenbrunner
are best friends. Off and on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   They room together on the road. They double date with their
wives. But they weren't playing on the same line. Not since
midseason anyway. Not until Stars coach Ken Hitchcock reunited them
in Game 4 against Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk has been playing like playoff Joe since.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as you want to downplay it, I think getting back with
my buddy there helps,'' Nieuwendyk said. ``You know, as soon as we
got back together, we were in their end. We were flying around,
buzzing around.''
</P>
<P>
   Nieuwendyk had two assists in Game 5, including assisting on a
goal by Langenbrunner.
</P>
<P>
   ``That line looks like it's hopefully ready to bust /Rout/S,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Either that line busts out or the Stars' playoff hopes go bust.
2. SMOOTH SAILING
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' power play wasn't great in the first round. OK, it
wasn't even average. It was 2-for-26 bad.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov has been missed.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't played since March 29 because of a partially torn
ligament in his right knee. He's set to play Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing that he does do is drastically improve their
power play,'' Oilers assistant coach Craig MacTavish said.
</P>
<P>
   Zubov is like a wishbone quarterback. He doesn't simply pass the
puck up ice; he carries it. He likes taking the puck from behind
the net and weaving through defenders like Picabo Street on a
slalom course. Trying to pry it away is futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must like the puck a lot,'' Oilers defenseman Janne
Niinimaa quipped, ``because he doesn't give it away too often.''
</P>
<P>
   Just wait, The Stars' power play is going to look a lot better
when they're able to set up. 3. THE OTHER CHEEK
</P>
<P>
   This series is going to be nasty. OK, so what's new? The key is
who will be able to keep their cool because referees often see the
retaliation, not the instigation.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the vacationing Blues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest reason we beat St. Louis?'' Sharks coach Darryl
Sutter said. ``We played with more composure.''
</P>
<P>
   No, turning the other cheek doesn't feel as good as putting your
fist in Marchment's. But if the Stars want to advance, they better
save their nasty stuff for carefully chosen moments.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a real good penalty kill,'' Stars forward Brenden
Morrow said. ``So if it happens every once in a while, we can get
away with it.'' 4. SHIELDS' PSYCHE
</P>
<P>
   Everybody was watching Sharks goalie Steve Shields after he
allowed six goals on 13 shots before getting pulled in Game 6
against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was waiting to see what he was going to do in Game
7,'' Sharks forward Vincent Damphousse said. ``I think he showed a
lot of character by coming back and being able to forget what
happened in Game 6.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sharks have seen the best of Shields and the worst of
Shields.
</P>
<P>
   Which one the Stars will see only Shields can say. And who knows
what goes on in the heads of those goalies? nn

WHITEY FORD ADMITS THAT HE HAS CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLIE NOBLES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Whitey Ford, the Yankees Hall of Fame pitcher, who
missed spring training this year for the first time in 49 years,
acknowledged on Thursday that he has cancer, although he declined
to provide details.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been treated for it,'' Ford, 71, said by telephone from
his part-time home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ``We just hope that it
works out.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford declined to identify the type of cancer for which he has
been treated. ``We're the type of family that tries to keep these
things to ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After a pause, he noted that Nolan Ryan had undergone heart
bypass surgery in the past week and that Ryan's illness had been
covered extensively on television and in local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not like that,'' Ford said. ``I just like to keep things
within the family. I mean, a few of my friends know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford said his prescribed treatment had been completed. His next
step? ``Just to make sure it hasn't spread,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Missing spring training was a telltale sign that something was
wrong with Ford, a left-handed pitcher who became known as the
Chairman of the Board in fashioning a 236-106 record for the
Yankees in the 1950s and 1960s. Since spending the 1951 season in
the military, Ford had attended every Yankees spring training until
this year, first as a player, then as a coach, then as a uniformed
guest of the team's owners, in part to display the franchise's
great history. ``It's been great,'' he said. ``I enjoyed it very
much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford's career winning percentage of .690 is the best of any
major league pitcher in the 20th century. He led the American
League in victories three times and in earned run average and
shutouts twice each. He won the Cy Young award in 1961 and holds
World Series records for victories (10), consecutive shutout
innings (33) and strikeouts (94).
</P>
<P>
   When first asked on Thursday why he had missed spring training,
Ford attributed it to ``a little medical problem.'' Only after
further conversation did he acknowledge that the medical problem
was cancer.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a particularly difficult time for Ford and his wife,
Joan. Last August, their son, Tommy, died; Ford declined to talk
about his son's death, again citing his family's preference for
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Ford named one of the trotters that he owns Model T. Ford, after
the band in which his son once played.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being with the Yankees this spring in Tampa, Fla., he
spent some time at Pompano Park as a diversion, getting the horse
ready to race. Ford said he hoped to be there when the horse tries
to race at the Meadowlands later this year. &QL;

MIAMI KIN REBUFFED IN BID TO VISIT ELIAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A federal appeals court Thursday rejected efforts
by Elian Gonzalez's U.S. relatives to visit the Cuban boy, who was
whisked from their Miami home by armed federal agents Saturday
morning and reunited with his father.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals also denied the family's
request to have the 6-year-old placed in an outside guardian's
care. The court, instead, accepted the Justice Department's offer
to submit to the judges biweekly reports from a psychiatrist and a
social worker on Elian's well-being.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Miami relatives are extremely disappointed that they were
denied access to the child,'' said attorney Richard Sharpstein, who
is assisting Elian's U.S. family in its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But, in a move welcomed by the relatives, the 11th Circuit
rebuffed a request by Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to have
them removed from the case. Gonzalez had argued that only he, as
the boy's father and sole surviving parent, could speak for Elian.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpstein said he was glad that the Atlanta-based court also
preserved its previously stated view that federal law might allow
Elian to request political asylum in the United States against his
father's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court is recognizing the independence of the child,'' the
Miami lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th Circuit is scheduled to hear arguments May 11 on
whether Elian's great-uncle Lazaro Gonzalez of Miami can pursue in
federal court his effort to gain asylum for Elian. Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, backed by the Justice Department, argues that he should
be allowed to return to Cuba with his son.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Attorney General Janet Reno on Thursday defended as a
necessary ``show of force'' her decision to order the pre-dawn
raid. In her first detailed statement on Saturday's strike, Reno
said Elian's intransigent U.S. relatives and sympathizers outside
their house tried to lasso officers and block the front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tried to throw &UR;  &LR; (television cables) around the agents
as they went into the house and obstruct their entry into the
house,'' Reno said. ``A couch was pushed up against the door to
limit entry.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal agents used a battering ram to force open the door. The
three-minute strike included a heavily armed officer taking a
frightened Elian from the arms of Donato Dalrymple, a fisherman who
had plucked the boy from an inner tube off the Florida coast
Thanksgiving Day.
</P>
<P>
   A free-lance photographer captured the image of an agent
pointing his assault weapon in the general direction of Dalrymple.
Reno called the resulting picture, reprinted on newspaper and
magazine covers nationwide, the cost of effective law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had to be a show of force, not a use of force, to show
that we were in control,'' Reno said. ``I think that was done
carefully and thoughtfully based on the information that has been
provided to me to date.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno and other federal officials have said the photographed
agent presented no real danger as his finger was not on the
trigger, the gun's safety lock was on and he was not pointing the
weapon at either Dalrymple or Elian.
</P>
<P>
   The raid involved federal agents storming the home of Lazaro
Gonzalez, who had steadfastly refused to surrender the boy to the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. Fellow agents stood
outside, keeping at bay Cuban-American protesters, who had kept a
months-long vigil outside the home since shortly after Elian was
rescued from the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Agents then placed Elian on a government plane and flew him to
Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, about 40 miles outside of
Washington, where he was reunited with Juan Miguel Gonzalez. The
father had flown from Cuba to the United States on April 6 in hope
of the reunion and bringing his son back to the island nation.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who faced intense criticism from House Republicans this
week over her decision, defended the timing of the raid as
necessary to protect the safety of Elian, the relatives, the
protesters and the federal agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a situation where if we did not go, people were sure to
find out that we were prepared to go and the crowd would gather and
keep a vigil and make it more difficult for the future,'' Reno
said. ``This seemed to be the safest time possible to effect the
transfer.''
</P>
<P>
   About 300 Cuban-Americans descended on the White House on
Thursday to protest the raid. Demonstrators chanted ``freedom for
Elian'' and one protester raised a sign with the widely shown
photograph and the caption ``Reno's justice _ child abuse at the
point of a gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Elian, his father, stepmother, Nersy, and infant half-brother,
Hianny, were staying at a secluded Maryland retreat about 70 miles
east of Washington while they await a final court ruling on the
U.S. family's asylum request. Elian was expected soon to be
reunited at the retreat with a 10-year-old cousin and a former
kindergarten teacher, who flew to the Washington area late
Wednesday, and four Cuban classmates and their parents, who landed
near Washington on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The reunion between father and son ended a five-month separation
that began when Elian's mother, Elisabeth Bretons, attempted to
reach the United States by boat with him. The boat sank, drowning
Bretons and 10 other Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government had spent $578,000 on the Elian case
between Thanksgiving and Monday, the Justice Department reported.
</P>
<P>
   Of the federal government's expenditure on the Elian matter, the
INS had spent the most, $374,000, the Justice Department reported.
These costs went to training and housing 131 agents who
participated in the raid and paying for the government plane that
flew Elian from Florida to the base, among other expenses. The U.S.
Marshals Service, which provided 20 agents for the raid and
security for Elian's Cuban family, spent $161,000. The remaining
costs went to legal work, mediators, conciliators and psychiatric
consultants.

HOLLYWOOD PARK HOPES TO BE FAST OUT OF GATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Like a drowsy racehorse, Hollywood Park's
long, spring-summer meeting has suffered from slow starts in recent
years, the Kentucky Derby simulcast having been its only
early-season drawing card.
</P>
<P>
   But the track should be faster out of the gate for the 65-day
season that opens at 7 tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes at the 62-year-old landmark next door to the
Forum is the debut on Sunday of an event called the California Gold
Rush. It's a 10-race program exclusively for California-bred
horses, and it provides an early attraction to serve as a bookend
with the Hollywood Gold Cup on July 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``A momentum-builder,'' in the words of Hollywood Park president
Rick Baedeker.
</P>
<P>
   Up for grabs will be $1.26 million in purses for the horses
competing in the 10 stakes, and a guaranteed $1 million pick-six
pool for bettors.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park executives are careful not to compare the Gold
Rush with the California Cup, the state-breds festival presented
each fall at Santa Anita by the Oak Tree Racing Association and the
California Thoroughbred Breeders Association. ``The Cal Cup is
probably still the championship event for Cal-breds,'' said racing
secretary Martin Panza.
</P>
<P>
   But the Gold Rush is a clever idea that should work. The card is
made up of existing races that never drew much fan interest when
they were scattered throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   The main event, the $250,000 Show Chief Stakes, a 1 1/8-mile
race for 3-year-olds, could send a horse on to the Preakness Stakes
in a good year.
</P>
<P>
   A 13-horse field for Sunday's running includes Hugh Hefner and
Grey Memo, co-high weights at 119 pounds; Queenie Belle, a filly
challenging males; Wolf With Integrity, ridden by 1999 Eclipse
Award winner Jorge Chavez, and Cozy Man, with Mike Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The East Coast-based Chavez, Smith and Jerry Bailey accepted
appearance fees to take part in the Gold Rush.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Hollywood Park's first spring-summer meet under the
management of Churchill Downs Inc., which purchased it from the
R.D. Hubbard-led group for $140 million in September.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter, fall meet was a success thanks to the drama
surrounding Laffit Pincay, who broke Bill Shoemaker's career-
victories record when he rode Irish Nip to win No. 8,834 on Dec.
10, 1999, and went on to capture his first track title since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   To try to maintain its momentum, the new management has put a
reported $6 million into facility improvements, including a more
attractive entrance from Prairie Avenue, establishment of well-lit
``mini sports book'' seating areas on the main floor, and the
``Handicapping Zone,'' a talk-show-style forum in which experts and
fans can exchange analysis throughout the day on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Among other changes:
</P>
<P>
   __ Chris Kotulak is the new announcer, replacing the outstanding
Michael Wrona, who took a better deal at Lone Star Park near
Dallas. Kotulak, 37, recently of Louisiana Downs, signed a
three-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize we've had a bit of a revolving door in the
announcer's booth,'' Baedeker said. ``We want to have a true `voice
of Hollywood Park.' ''
</P>
<P>
   __ Julie Krone, the leading female jockey of all time, will
analyze weekend races on the intertrack and Fox Sports Net shows.
</P>
<P>
   __ The nightly replays show on KDOC television moves to 9 p.m.
from its customary 8 p.m. slot. KDOC was asking Hollywood Park to
match the price it can get for infomercials and ``Perry Mason''
reruns at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   __ Purses are going up at the claiming and allowance levels as
Panza tries to attract bigger fields.
</P>
<P>
   __ Concession prices are going down, with Hollywood Park
advertising the cheapest food in Los Angeles sports, including
$1.50 hot dogs and $2 beer.
</P>
<P>
   Clubhouse reserved-seat prices have been cut in half to $2.
Admission prices, which include parking and programs, remain $6 for
the grandstand and $9 for the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   The first race is scheduled for 1 p.m. on weekends and holidays,
and 1:10 p.m. on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Friday, May 5, the day
before the Kentucky Derby. All other Fridays will start at 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   __ What, Neil worry? Neil Drysdale, one of the more fastidious
trainers, claimed not to be concerned after Kentucky Derby favorite
Fusaichi Pegasus' latest antics.
</P>
<P>
   The colt reared twice, flipped and dumped his exercise rider as
he returned from a jog Thursday morning at Churchill Downs.
Drysdale was close enough to catch Fusaichi Pegasus and lead him
back to the barn. Nobody was reported injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was doing superbly, and then he felt so good he reared up
and then sat down,'' Drysdale said, casting the incident in the
best possible light. ``So far he hasn't put on a real show (in
Louisville). When he's in California, he can really do some tricks.
We may be coming up with them this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some mornings he's a real gentleman. Some mornings he's
feeling so good he doesn't know what to do with himself.''
</P>
<P>
   As hard as he can be to handle, the Wood Memorial winner has
been notably well-behaved during races. But could that change in
front of the big crowd on Derby day?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think 130,000 people may get his attention,'' Drysdale said,
again turning it into a positive. ``He's fascinated by people.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The competition: As many as 24 horses are listed as Derby
hopefuls, with the maximum field of 20 to be determined by earnings
in graded stakes.
</P>
<P>
   Recently declared out was Chief Seattle, the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile runnerup. He had a fever and didn't ship to Churchill
Downs from Lexington with fellow Dubai-based 3-year-olds China
Visit and Curule.
</P>
<P>
   Iffy are two D. Wayne Lukas-trained horses, Exchange Rate and
True Confidence. Lukas said True Confidence would have to run first
or second in the Derby Trial on Saturday to be considered.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the ``maybe'' category are Globalize, Snuck In, Ronton
and Unshaded, the Lexington Stakes winner who would have to be a
supplemental nominee at a cost of $150,000 to owner Jim Tafel.
</P>
<P>
   Other Derby probables listed as of Thursday morning included
Santa Anita Derby winner The Deputy and other recent prep winners
Fusaichi Pegasus, Graeme Hall, High Yield and Trippi; Santa Anita
Derby grads War Chant, Captain Steve and Anees; and Aptitude,
Commendable, Deputy Warlock, Hal's Hope, Harlan Traveler,

GORE HELPS PARTY, TOO; BOREDOM SETS IN; BUSH AHEAD IN OHIO
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ohio, Wash.)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after criticizing Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas for headlining a Washington fund-raiser that brought in a
record $21.3 million for the Republican Party, Vice President Al
Gore held bookend fund-raising events Thursday in Pennsylvania,
helping the Democratic National Committee raise more than $1.2
million. Over lunch in Pittsburgh and then dinner in Philadelphia,
Gore boasted about the Clinton administration's economic record and
accused Bush of advocating a ``don't worry about tomorrow'' plan of
``risky'' tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   BOREDOM SETS IN
</P>
<P>
   The drawn out, sometimes hectic system for nominating and
electing a president neither broadens the public's understanding of
campaigns nor encourages involvement in them and in the end leaves
many voters bored. That is the initial conclusion of the Vanishing
Voter Project, a study being conducted by the Joan Shorenstein
Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard
University. In weekly polls of voter perceptions last fall and this
spring, the center queried voters about what political issues they
were following each day, if any, and how much, if any, they were
discussing politics daily
</P>
<P>
   BUSH AHEAD IN OHIO
</P>
<P>
   A new presidential preference poll of Ohio voters by the
University of Cincinnati _ Ohio is considered a state that could go
to Bush or Gore _ has Bush leading Gore by 8 points, about the same
margin found by an Ohio State University poll taken a month ago.
The Cincinnati poll, conducted April 5 through 22 and covering 531
likely voters, found Bush ahead of Gore 47 percent to 39 percent.
Ralph Nader of the Green Party had 4 percent, Pat Buchanan of the
Reform Party had 3 percent, and 7 percent of the respondents said
they were undecided. The margin of sampling error for the poll was
plus or minus 4 percentage points. In Washington state, a newly
released preference poll has Bush ahead by a single point, 39
percent to 38 percent, with 18 percent of the respondents
undecided. The poll, by Elway Research, a nonpartisan firm,
surveyed 400 registered voters on April 11 and 12 and has a margin
of sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   GROUPS ALLOWED TO PROTEST
</P>
<P>
   The city of Philadelphia reached an amicable settlement Thursday
with a coalition of more than 50 groups that had said their right
to public assembly would be violated during the Republican National
Convention. The groups initially were denied demonstration permits
by the city, but Thursday it backed off. ``I applaud the city for
reaffirming the notion that dissent is critical for a healthy
democracy,'' said Stefan Presser, legal director of the American
Civil Liberties Union, in withdrawing a federal lawsuit. The
agreement, worked out through the office of the city solicitor,
Kenneth Trujillo, allows a protest march along Benjamin Franklin
Parkway on July 30, the eve of the convention, by Unity 2000, a
coalition that includes the NAACP and the National Organization for
Women. The city also approved a march on July 29 through Washington
Square by the Ad-Hoc Committee to Defend Health Care, a group of
medical professionals demanding government action on the issue.

SPREWELL VS. CARTER: LOSE AND LEARN, LEARN AND WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When you break everything down, Latrell Sprewell knew
what to do. He knew Vince Carter had five fouls and could not
afford another. He knew he was going to drive to the basket and
take a short, step-back jump shot for the victory, not shoot some
wild baseline fall-away.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's defining moment soon came, with the ball in his hands
and Game 2 in the balance. He could have taken a deep 3-pointer or,
having already gone to the free-throw line 16 times, penetrated the
middle. He passed up his chance.
</P>
<P>
   He'll learn.
</P>
<P>
   When you break everything down, Vinsanity got a dose of
Spreeality.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks won because a veteran pushing 30 showed more poise
than a 23-year-old participating in his first postseason. As the
fourth-quarter theater riveted Madison Square Garden, a recurring
playoff theme remained as contemporary as Old Man Malone: age
before aesthetics, old-school guile before young skywalkers.
</P>
<P>
   It was Sprewell, using all his savvy, desire and experience to
counter the most scintillating young player in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my first year, I remember this older, slow guard taking it
to me,'' said Doc Rivers, the former guard and now the Orlando
Magic coach. ``I was faster, quicker and stronger than the guy, but
he just kept killing me.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did he have over me? Knowledge. Just more knowledge.''
</P>
<P>
   Rivers was asked if he recalled the player's name. ``I can't
remember,'' he said. ``I want to say Kyle Macy, but my ego won't
allow me to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few years, Carter's performance at the end of Game 2
against the Knicks will most likely be a footnote, a small growing
pain toward his championship maturity.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about regrets some day, he might think back to his forced
and rushed 3-pointer with more than 10 seconds on the shot clock
and 25 seconds on the game clock. His team was up by a point, still
in control. Or he will wish he was more assertive, taking the ball
to the basket with less than seven seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Lose and learn. It is a rough lesson in the younger and more
restless National Basketball Association, where age is being served
again in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   A quick perusal of first-round box scores unearths the truth:
curmudgeons rule.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Malone, 36, scored 14 more points than his age last weekend
in a 50-point explosion against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In two tight Western Conference thrillers, Scottie Pippen, 34,
outplayed Kevin Garnett, 23, the way the veteran Portland Trail
Blazers outplayed the young Minnesota Timberwolves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scottie made all the big plays, defensively, offensively,
ball-handling, making shots,'' Portland Coach Mike Dunleavy said.
``He has been incredible these past two games.''
</P>
<P>
   John Stockton, 38, had 21 points and 11 assists on Monday, and
they did not come in a rec-league semifinal in Spokane, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Utah and Miami represent two of the oldest rosters in the
league, and both are in good first-round shape. Tim Hardaway and
Reggie Miller stagger around in the East. Jeff Hornacek and Steve
Smith ice their knees in the West. The only teams with
predominantly under-30 starters headed toward the conference
semifinals are the Lakers and the 76ers, and many of their role
players have extensive playoff experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks may have the tricks of the trade down better than any
of their aging peers. Outplayed for much of the last six quarters,
they're up by 2-0 against Toronto. Only two of their top eight
players _ Sprewell and Larry Johnson _ have played to their
potential. But they know how to win.
</P>
<P>
   Every two decades or so, an aberration rises _ Magic Johnson
jumping center in Game 6 of the finals, Larry Bird and Tim Duncan
capturing championships in their second seasons. But mostly in the
NBA, you pay your playoff dues, one possession at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Now, you are probably wondering how, in a span of two years,
Sprewell transformed himself from a freestyle Gen-X player with
much to learn into a postseason veteran.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've been in the league that long, there's a reason,''
Rivers said. ``And it's usually because you've figured it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaquille O'Neal, whose Lakers are favored to win it all, is
another example of a player who seems to have gotten it.
</P>
<P>
   In the last five minutes of Game 2, the Knicks went almost
exclusively to Sprewell on the left side as he was guarded by
Carter. He took one ill-advised jump shot, after which the Knicks
called timeout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you in that timeout, Jeff Van Gundy told him there
is no need to take jumpers,'' Rivers said. ``I got to think Jeff
said something like, `This guy is not a good defender and he has
five fouls.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``After Sprewell went to his right four straight times, I was
surprised Vince kept letting him. When the game is on the line, I
always knew a guy would go to his staple move or his strong hand.
At that time of the game, that's who you are. He might beat me, but
I always thought I had to take that side away. I was not going to
give him that.''
</P>
<P>
   Give Carter time. He'll learn. After all his teachers retire and
become TNT analysts or coaches, he'll open his own classroom.

A REFLECTIVE MAYOR FACES HIS ILLNESS WITHOUT SELF-PITY 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For columnists, reporters and assorted other pests,
there was one bright spot in the otherwise sad news from Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani on Thursday that he has prostate cancer. This bad
break, the mayor insisted, will not make him a nicer fellow.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way, no way,'' he said with a smile when asked about it at
City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Whew!
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it, Rudy Giuliani as Nice Guy would put an awful lot
of paid pundits out of work. They have been dining out for years on
his excesses of temperament. So it was particularly charitable of
the mayor to reassure them on Thursday, even in his moment of
trial, that he will continue to provide ample grist for their
mills.
</P>
<P>
   All kidding aside, one of the more striking features about the
way Giuliani announced his illness was his grace under pressure.
Not for a second during his news conference did he whine or indulge
in self-pity. He spoke in a clear voice and a straightforward
manner. When a little joke was called for, he joked. He was, in a
word, winning.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was there reason for skepticism when he said that he had no
idea what the next step would be, in either his cancer treatment or
his Senate race. He wouldn't even be talking about it now, he
acknowledged, if a reporter had not spotted him at Mount Sinai
Medical Center on Wednesday and put two and two together.
</P>
<P>
   What his performance offered was a glimpse of how differently
his mayoralty might have gone had there been more performances like
Thursday's over the last six and a half years. A Mayor Giuliani
capable of admitting to a measure of vulnerability and uncertainty
could arguably have won broader support for his policies than the
man whose tendency has been to trumpet himself as the rare honest
man battling the armies of incompetence, corruption and
intellectual bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   It matters that opinion polls consistently show that most New
Yorkers do not like him, including many who consider him a great
mayor.
</P>
<P>
   Likability may not seem terribly important in politics when
everything is going your way. But when you stumble _ as many
believe Giuliani did, badly, in episodes like the police killing of
Patrick M. Dorismond _ you need to have people willing to give you
the benefit of the doubt and to help you regain your footing.
Recent polls suggest that, because of his demeanor, the mayor is
running short of friends in his own city. Thursday's man of grace
might have fared a lot better.
</P>
<P>
   Characteristically, Giuliani stood alone on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   That is often how he likes to be seen: a Shane-like figure ready
to take on malevolent forces single-handedly. Still, there was
something sad and lonely about him as he spoke at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Other leaders in similar circumstances would have had spouses,
children and good friends at their side. That is not this mayor's
style. He has worked hard to keep his family life private, and for
the most part the press has respected his wishes. Gracie Mansion,
the mayor's home, has generally been off limits to scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   There have been breaches, though, the most recent coming with
the eyebrow-raising announcement that Giuliani's wife, Donna
Hanover, had taken a part in ``The Vagina Monologues.'' And it was
impossible not to notice that Hanover was nowhere around the mayor
on Thursday, other than on a piece of paper announcing that she
would be ``very supportive of him in dealing with the choices he
has to make.'' Her statement also noted that she and Giuliani had
discussed his cancer. That she even felt obliged to make that point
may have said something.
</P>
<P>
   But whether he is broadly liked or not, whatever his home
situation may be, a serious illness that befalls a major public
figure reminds us all how slender the threads connecting us to this
life are.
</P>
<P>
   In Giuliani's case, there will be the added component of nonstop
political speculation. Will this help him bow out of a Senate race
that does not seem to have captured his heart and soul? If he
insists on running, will his cancer bring him sympathy votes? Or
will New Yorkers instead abandon him the way they did an ailing
Sen. Jacob K. Javits 20 years ago?
</P>
<P>
   But none of that seemed very important on Thursday, a point made
by Giuliani himself as he talked briefly about how a bad turn makes
you reflect on the things that really count. That's why even his
most bitter opponents laid down their swords for the moment, heeded
the admonition of Ecclesiastes that ``all is vanity'' and wished
the mayor godspeed.

RAID LEADERS GIVE REASONING FOR USE OF AUTOMATIC WEAPONS
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Commanders of the raid that reunited Elian Gonzalez
with his father went into the home of his Miami relatives with
automatic weapons early last Saturday because intelligence reports
indicated that the house was being guarded by a shadowy network of
men who had permits to carry concealed weapons, a history of
violent crime or a record of anti-Castro violence, one of the
officers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior immigration official in charge of intelligence
gathering for the operation said it was the information suggesting
the possibility of violence that led the authorities to plan a
large military-style raid with about 140 agents, a few armed with
automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a structure and the potential of violent threats to
prevent us from recovering Elian from the house and perhaps do
serious harm to our personnel and maybe innocent people in the
area,'' the official said. ``That's really why we structured the
enforcement plan to be, by any objective standard, an overwhelming
show of force to prevent the use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said there were several reports of an unidentified
person at the house who was observed with a firearm but no reports
of weapons in the house. Attorney General Janet Reno has said there
were reports of weapons inside the house.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment on firearms Thursday night from a
spokesman for the family, though the family has always insisted it
had none in the house and none were confiscated in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence operation uncovered what the official said was
a plan to thwart any effort to remove Elian from the Gonzalez home
forcibly by rushing him to the house directly behind the Gonzalez's
if the authorities tried to break in. That house was headquarters
for the Cuban-American security operation in the Little Havana
neighborhood, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence operation relied largely on covert
surveillance, overflights of helicopters and fixed wing aircraft,
the official said, speaking on condition of not being named. The
information was cross-checked with law enforcement and commercial
databases to provide a profile of the loose network of security
personnel around the child in the days before the raid.
</P>
<P>
   The official said agents detected several layers in what he
described as a security cordon that extended around the house of
Lazaro Gonzalez, where Elian was staying after he was rescued from
the Atlantic Ocean last Thanksgiving. The security operation
extended to the streets surrounding the house, where the official
said, supporters in lawn chairs took positions at strategic
intersections and used walkie-talkies and cell phones to report law
enforcement activity.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the reports were transmitted to supporters of
the Miami relatives at a house on the same block as the Gonzalez
home. The reports, he said, were relayed to local Spanish-speaking
radio stations, which sometimes broadcasted appeals to
Cuban-Americans to crowd the streets around the house.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that agents identified five people who seemed
to operate as what he described as ``close quarters bodyguards''
who were at the Gonzalez house at varying times. Four of the five
people, the official said, were identified and all four had active
permits to carry concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Gonzalez family seemed to know and allow some
members of the security force into their home, the official said,
it was unclear whether the Miami relatives played a significant
role in organizing or managing the network of Cuban-American
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the leaders of the security force occupied the
house behind the Gonzalez home. This was what he described as a
base of operations for a larger group of 15 to 20 people who set up
roving patrols on foot, bicycles and cars.
</P>
<P>
   Among this group were nine people whom the official said had
criminal records for violent crimes including armed robbery and
assaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people had essentially taken it on their own to prevent
the removal of Elian from the Gonzalez home,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the official said, five members of the militantly
anti-Castro group Alpha 66 were seen on several occasions in the
crowd of demonstrators. He said that three of the five had taken
credit for firing from a boat into a seaside hotel in Cuba in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The operation took place shortly after 5 a.m. on Saturday after
all-night negotiations that Reno had said stalled over the
relatives' unwillingness to surrender the child unconditionally to
the authorities after months of refusing to hand over the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the relatives have complained that they were
pleading for more time to negotiate a peaceful transfer at nearly
the exact time that Reno sent the agents to the house and have
bitterly criticized her for undertaking the assault without giving
the talks more time.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress are planning hearings to review the
operation. Some lawmakers have sharply criticized Reno for sending
in agents outfitted in military-style jump suits who carried
automatic weapons in an operation that they said was likely to
provoke violence and terrorize the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers have not allowed the agents who
planned and carried out the assault to be interviewed until
Thursday, in part because they were assembling an after-action
report and reviewing each agent's account in anticipation of civil
lawsuits and congressional inquiries.

For those who got stuck in downtown traffic or in the concession
line and missed the first 10 minutes of Thursday's game, a quick
recap:
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eric Young smack!
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Gutierrez smack!
</P>
<P>
   Henry Rodriguez smack!
</P>
<P>
   Damon Buford smack!
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Cubs roughed up Jose Lima for five home runs, a
record-tying four in the first inning, en route to a 12-3 pounding
of the Astros before a sellout crowd of 42,271 at Enron Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was almost over before it began,'' Astros manager Larry
Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost?
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs tied a 70-year-old club record with four homers in an
inning. Young and Gutierrez began the game with back-to-back
homers, Rodriguez hit a two-run shot, and when Buford connected,
Chicago had a 5-0 lead just seven batters and 30 pitches into the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez sent a grand slam into the right-field upper deck off
Lima (1-4) in the fourth to make it 10-0.
</P>
<P>
   Lima tied a major-league record by allowing four homers in an
inning and set a club record by giving up five in the game.
Overall, he was tagged for 12 runs and 13 hits in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a lot of mistakes. I don't know what's wrong,'' said
Lima, who has allowed 10 home runs this season, most in the majors.
``I can't wait for April to end. This month hasn't been kind to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima, who was 21-10 last season, has lost four times since
winning his first start April 5 at Pittsburgh. He has allowed 27
runs during that span.
</P>
<P>
   The 12 runs he allowed Thursday broke the club record of 10 set
by pitching coach Vern Ruhle (1980) and tied by Bob Forsch (1989).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the ballpark. It's up here,'' Lima said pointing to
his head.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 46 home runs in 12 games at Enron Field, where
the Astros are 3-9.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs had few complaints about the quaint playing conditions
after outscoring the Astros 32-22 in taking two of three games.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez looked right at home with three home runs in the
series. He went 2-for-3 with a career-high six RBIs Thursday.
Former Astro Ricky Gutierrez went 7-for-12 with eight RBIs in three
games at Enron.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen him (Lima) like that,'' Rodriguez said. ``He
wasn't hitting his spots. He was just throwing the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Jon Lieber (2-2) pitched a five-hitter, becoming the first
pitcher to throw a complete game at Enron Field. He struck out
seven and walked none.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon showed you can get guys out if you make good pitches, no
matter where you're playing,'' Chicago manager Don Baylor said.
``Our guys really love this ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs didn't waste any time. Young opened the game by sending
a 2-0 fastball into the Crawford Boxes in left field. Gutierrez,
who had only one homer last season, drove the next pitch onto the
train tracks in left for his second homer in three days.
</P>
<P>
   Following a one-out single by Sammy Sosa, Rodriguez crushed 2-1
offering from Lima. Two batters later, Buford connected on a solo
shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to shoot myself. Five runs in the first inning? I
asked myself, `What else can go wrong?''' Lima said.
</P>
<P>
   Well in the fourth inning, Rodriguez hit his fifth career grand
slam, giving the Cubs a 10-run lead and prompting one fan in the
lower level to yell, ``Stop the bleeding!'' Mark Grace added a
two-run double in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Lieber retired the first 12 batters he faced. Ken Caminiti
reached on Grace's error to begin the fifth inning, and Daryle Ward
broke up the no-hit/shutout bid with a two-run homer to right
field.
</P>
<P>
   The game almost turned ugly in the eighth when Astros reliever
Doug Henry hit Rodriguez in the back. Lieber hit Matt Mieske in the
bottom of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   After an awful week at home, the Astros begin a 10-game road
trip today in Milwaukee. With the change of scenery, Dierker is
hoping for a change of luck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we go on the road and we get a chance to see if the
ballpark's got us psyched out or if we're just playing this
badly,'' Dierker said. ``I don't think it's the ballpark.''

ADVERTISING: CAN YOUNG &AMP; RUBICAM MAINTAIN INDEPENDENCE WHEN WPP
COMES CALLING?
</HEADLINE>
  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a deal that would combine two of the world's largest
advertising companies, WPP Group, the British conglomerate that
owns Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide and J. Walter Thompson, acknowledged
Thursday that it was in talks to buy Young &AMP; Rubicam in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations have taken place in fits and starts over the
last four months, and executives close to the talks said the
outcome was uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Y&AMP;R, meanwhile, is also talking to other possible suitors,
perhaps as a way to force WPP to make a higher bid. Over the last
several days, Y&AMP;R has intensified merger talks with Publicis SA of
France, executives close to the company said, though it is unclear
whether those talks will produce a deal either. Y&AMP;R also made
overtures to Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi, but those talks never took off, the
executives said. On the back burner, Y&AMP;R is talking with the direct
marketer Harte-Hanks Inc. about buying the company, but executives
close to the talks said a deal between the two would not proceed
until Y&AMP;R sorts out its discussions with WPP and Publicis.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to bulk up an already bulging WPP, Martin Sorell, the
company's chief executive, resumed negotiations with Y&AMP;R this week
after the talks broke down in late March. The main stumbling block
is now price, executives close to the talks said. Under the current
offer, Y&AMP;R would receive about a third of the enlarged group, or $5
billion, in an all-stock deal, the executives said. Based on WPP's
closing price Thursday, that would mean Y&AMP;R shareholders would be
paid about $69.15 for each share, a 31 percent premium over Y&AMP;R's
current stock price of $52.875. Shares of WPP fell 48 pence, to
9.73 pounds, while the company's U.S. depository receipts slumped
$1.625, to $78. Executives close to the talks said that a
Y&AMP;R-Publicis deal would be ``competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   In an industry that seems to have a voracious appetite for
consolidation, Y&AMP;R, which has a blue-chip client roster that
includes Ford, AT&AMP;T and DuPont, has remained one of the last major
independent agencies. Thomas Bell, Y&AMP;R's chairman, has been
somewhat rankled by Sorrell's overtures, according to several
executives, but they say he thinks that strategically, Y&AMP;R will
have to do a deal with another player to remain competitive.
Indeed, as clients continue to demand a wider global advertising
presence, almost all industry analysts think it is inevitable that
Y&AMP;R will have to merge or risk losing business to bigger companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is more logic for Y&AMP;R to do a deal than WPP because they
have less global reach,'' said Gareth Thomas, an analyst at
Commerzbank in London. ``I don't think it's a necessity for WPP to
do a deal.'' Nonetheless, Sorrell has publicly stated his desire to
grow, yet he is faced with having few independent agencies to
pursue. And WPP has been burned after it went hostile in past
takeovers. After WPP's hostile bid for Ogilvy, a stream of
executives left the company.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, under an interim agreement between WPP and Y&AMP;R, it
would be almost impossible for Sorrell to undertake a surprise
hostile bid. According to executives who have seen the agreement
document, WPP is allowed to make an unlimited number of
``friendly'' offers to Y&AMP;R's board, but WPP is restrained from
making a hostile bid for a certain period of time. The document
also includes a confidentiality agreement that prohibits either
side from discussing the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said hostile bids rarely succeeded in the advertising
industry because the principal assets of an advertising agency are
the people who work there. Without an extremely lucrative ``golden
handcuff'' to induce employees to stay, the value of an agency can
literally walk out the door.
</P>
<P>
   A stumbling block for any deal is the issue of client conflicts,
Thomas said. Both companies have clients that could pose conflicts
of interest, but it is possible the companies could find a way
around it.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, it seems Y&AMP;R's days as an independent shop
are numbered.

BRUINS WIND DOWN SPRING FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA concludes spring practice Saturday with its
shrinking scrimmage at remodeled Drake Stadium. A slew of minor
injuries have forced the Bruins to shorten what was a 90-play event
in recent years. They simply don't have enough healthy bodies to
survive more than 40 or 50 plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're banged up, it's the end of spring, and the guys have had
enough,'' said coach Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's festivities begin at 1 p.m. with player introductions
and a condensed practice. Next comes a ``thud'' scrimmage (no
tackling) specifically designed for quarterback Cory Paus, who had
offseason shoulder surgery and cannot scrimmage. The main event
begins at approximately 1:45 and will dissolve into an autograph
session an hour later.
</P>
<P>
   Several top players are either out or questionable.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Ryan McCann, who's battling Paus for the starting
job, injured his throwing elbow earlier this week and might not
play. In that case, third-stringer Scott McEwan will take all the
snaps in the scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's wrong,'' McCann said Thursday. ``I can't throw.
I'm going to the doctor tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   On offense, tailback DeShaun Foster (sprained knee), receiver
Freddie Mitchell (baseball), center Troy Danoff (offseason knee
surgery) and guard Brian Polak (knee surgery) are out. Receiver
Brian Poli-Dixon (hamstring) is doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, end Kenyon Coleman (mononucleosis), linebackers
Robert Thomas (broken thumb) and Ryan Nece (shoulder), cornerbacks
Jason Bell (hand laceration) and Joe Hunter (shoulder), and
safeties Audie Attar (hamstring) and Lovell Houston (shoulder) are
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have something like 18 or 19 guys on the team who can't
play,'' said defensive coordinator Bob Field.
</P>
<P>
   (Note: The scrimmage is free. Drake Stadium is 200 yards north
of Spaulding Field.)
</P>
<P>
   __ Barnes update: It's official. Basketball player Matt Barnes
will join the football team for training camp. According to NCAA
rules, he'll remain on a basketball scholarship until he appears in
a football game. At that point, he will count against the football
team's 85-scholarship limit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's talked to (basketball coach) Steve Lavin and he wants to
give it a try,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, a 6-8 junior-to-be, played receiver in high school and
certainly has the requisite physical skills. He's long, lean and
fast. But there are several questions that won't be answered until
August: Can he catch the ball in traffic? Can he take a hit? Will
he be academically eligible? (He wasn't last fall and missed five
basketball games.) And what effect will football have on his
basketball career? With forwards JaRon Rush and Jerome Moiso
seemingly headed for the NBA, Barnes is the projected starter at
power forward.
</P>
<P>
   __ Look away: Thomas, the middle linebacker, suffered the most
gruesome injury of spring practice: a compound fracture of his left
thumb that required immediate surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas was making a routine tackle on tailback Akil Harris when
his thumb jammed into Harris' thigh. Thomas looked down and saw the
top half of his thumb (above the joint) was perpendicular and had
broken through his glove. Bone was exposed. The medical staff
quickly popped the thumb into place, then Thomas headed for the
operating table. A pin was inserted to stabilize the joint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst pain I've ever been through,'' Thomas said.
``It's disappointing, because I was having a real good spring. I
was excited for the scrimmage. My parents were coming (from San
Diego).''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas said his cast will be removed in about three weeks and
he'll promptly begin his summer conditioning program.
</P>
<P>
   __ One loss, three gains: Coleman missed the entire spring
because of mononucleosis, but his absence created playing time for
three young ends (sophomore Sean Phillips and freshmen Mat and Dave
Ball) who have impressed the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   The mono took Coleman by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea,'' he said. ``At first I thought it was
tonsilitis, then strep throat. Then the day I started feeling
better, they told me it was mono. My spleen was swollen. I haven't
been tired and I don't know anybody who has it.''

EDITORIAL: MAYOR GIULIANI'S PROSTATE CANCER 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, April 28:
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's battle with
prostate cancer is successful and mercifully brief. New York's
mayor, who has generally appeared in good health, surprised the
political world on Thursday by announcing that screening tests
during his annual physical had shown signs of cancer and that a
follow-up biopsy had confirmed that finding. Fortunately, the
cancer seems to have been detected at an early stage, so the odds
for successful treatment and cure may be good. But what impact the
cancer will have on the mayor's health or his campaign for the U.S.
Senate will not be known until he and his doctors settle on a
course of treatment, which could range from surgery to radiation to
hormones.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's diagnosis is a testament to the sensitivity of early
screening tests that have revolutionized the management of prostate
cancer in this decade. Years ago patients relied on physicians to
detect prostate tumors by a gloved digital examination through the
rectum. Now the Prostate Specific Antigen, or PSA, test measures
substances that are elevated in the blood when there is a prostate
cancer, making it possible to detect tumors much earlier. The tests
have a downside, often triggering needless and risky treatment for
tiny, languid tumors that might never have grown into medical
threats. But the upside can be a timely warning of potentially
aggressive cancer in men who felt no sign of it.  &QL;

THE LEAFS GIVE THE DEVILS A TASTE OF DEFEAT IN ROUND 2
</HEADLINE>
  By JOE LAPOINTE

<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The New Jersey Devils learned again what it is like to
lose in the playoffs. Although they did not play poorly and had
more scoring chances, they fell 2-1 Thursday night to the Toronto
Maple Leafs in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals at Air
Canada Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils, who made first-round exits in 1998 and 1999, had won
all four games in the first round this spring against Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Dimitri Yushkevich scored the first goal for Toronto, and Darcy
Tucker scored the winner. Petr Sykora scored for the Devils.
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs went up by 2-1 at 1 minute 18 seconds of the third
period on a goal by Tucker, who took a pass from Wendel Clark,
battled to control the puck, cut right to left and beat a sprawling
Martin Brodeur with a forehand shot.
</P>
<P>
   Tucker and Clark were placed on the roster late in the season by
Pat Quinn, Toronto's coach and general manager, to add tenacity and
a mean streak to a roster dominated by skilled artistes.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the third period, Clark created a scoring chance
by breaking through two Devils, Scott Niedermayer and Steve Kelly,
at the blue line. Bearing in on Brodeur, he clanged a shot off one
of the goal posts.
</P>
<P>
   When play stopped soon afterward for a long television
commercial timeout, the Toronto fans jumped to their feet for a
long standing ovation while the big screen on the scoreboard
focused only on Clark, who drank water and bent over the catch his
breath at the Leafs' bench.
</P>
<P>
   At the age of 33, in his third tour with the Leafs, Clark is
extremely popular here. A native of Saskatchewan, Clark is a
Canadian archetype, the sort of player who reminds fans of the way
the NHL used to be.
</P>
<P>
   During the ovation, the people responsible for the arena
presentation did something rare and welcome: they played no
recorded music, allowing natural sound and natural emotion to fill
Air Canada Center at a special moment.
</P>
<P>
   With about three minutes left in the period, Clark again set up
Tucker, this time on a two-on-one break. But Brodeur turned aside
the shot.
</P>
<P>
   Game 2 will be played here Saturday night. The winner of this
best-of-7 series will play either Philadelphia or Pittsburgh for
the Eastern Conference championship and the right to meet the
Western Conference winner in the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   The first period was scoreless, although the Devils dictated the
pace of play and held an 11-6 edge in shots on goal. Sergei
Nemchinov was credited with only one shot on goal, but he had two
good chances on the same shift, with one of his shots passing
through the crease without making contact with Toronto goalie
Curtis Joseph. Sykora rang a hard shot off one of Joseph's goal
posts.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils had two power plays in the period, but one of them
was negated with 1:11 remaining when they were penalized for having
too many men on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   As anticipated, the Devils' captain, Scott Stevens, a veteran
defenseman, was matched against the top Toronto line of Mats
Sundin, Steve Thomas and Jonas Hoglund. When Stevens and Thomas,
close friends from Thomas' days as a Devil, came together behind
the Devils' net, Stevens greeted him with a shove of the glove that
players call a ``face wash.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto took a 1-0 lead at 1:07 of the second period on a long,
low slap shot by Yushkevich, who fired from above the right-wing
circle at the conclusion of a power play just as Niedermayer was
coming out of the penalty box. Brodeur may have been screened on
the shot. Moments later, Patrik Elias rang another of Joseph's goal
posts.
</P>
<P>
   The Devils tied the score at 1-1 at 5:54 on a long slap shot by
Sykora, who took a pass from Elias on the rush after Toronto turned
over the puck at its blue line. Along with Jason Arnott, their
center, these two wings from the Czech Republic were creating
chances frequently, usually off transitions. In the first series, a
sweep of Florida, Sykora had one goal and one assist, while Elias
had one goal and three assists. Arnott, playing with a sore right
wrist, had one assist against the Panthers.

EDITORIAL: DEATH OF A SHOWMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, April 28:
</P>
<P>
   Theatricality went to the core of David Merrick, who died
Tuesday at 88 in London. As a producer, he dominated Broadway from
1954 until 1980 with a string of hits that included ``Gypsy,''
``Hello, Dolly!'' and ``42nd Street.'' He possessed a keen
commercial and artistic sensibility and an almost hostile business
acumen, as well as a flair for publicity that will link his name
forever with the likes of P.T. Barnum. He belonged in the glare of
the footlights as much as any producer ever has.
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty of self-dramatization in Merrick, but very
little of it was autobiographical. It was his talent and his
temperament that made him famous, even infamous, not his life
story. Few people have enjoyed their prosperity less than he seems
to have done, except perhaps as self-vindication. He lived, in a
way, obscurely. He was a litigant in his own life.
</P>
<P>
   There is no formula for becoming a great theatrical producer,
and certainly no one will wish to follow Merrick's method in all
its misanthropic detail. He seems to have been determined to please
only the audience, and that he did. Tales of Merrick's acerbity are
rife, yet they are offset not only by the popularity of the shows
he produced but also by the high artistic merit of many of them. It
would be hard to make musical theater out of Merrick's life, for
the necessary vein of sentimentality is missing. If there were
indeed a play in his remarkable story, it would take Moliere to
write it. &QL;

REVIEW BOARD STAFF FAULTS POLICE ON STOP-AND-FRISK REPORTS
</HEADLINE>
  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Investigators for the Civilian Complaint Review Board
have determined that police officers routinely fail to file the
required paperwork after frisking or searching people on New York
City's streets. The board's staff has prepared a preliminary report
that raises questions about whether the widespread violation of
department policy has hampered supervisors overseeing the judgment
of officers on patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators for the board, which is charged with reviewing
civilian complaints of police misconduct, based their findings on a
study of hundreds of instances in which people had been stopped and
frisked or searched. In about half the cases investigated, the
staff found, the officers involved had failed to file a written
record of the encounter.
</P>
<P>
   The written reports, known as UF250s, are in part meant to
establish a formal record of potentially dangerous or disputed
interactions with civilians, and thus to provide a measure of
accountability for police action. An officer, for instance, is
required to record the time, location and reason for frisking or
searching any civilian, as well as the result.
</P>
<P>
   The findings are included in a draft report, a copy of which was
obtained by The New York Times. Frank H. Wohl, the board's
chairman, called the report ``extremely preliminary,'' and added
that it had been prepared by the agency's staff, and had yet to
receive input from any of the panel's 12 sitting board members.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department's aggressive stop-and-frisk tactics long
have been the subject of scrutiny and angry debate.
</P>
<P>
   The question of whether the police had been aggressive to the
point of recklessness with such tactics came up during the trial of
four police officers for their role in the shooting death of Amadou
Diallo. The officers were acquitted of all charges. And late last
year, the state attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, issued a report
saying that the city's black and Hispanic residents had been
unfairly singled out in the stop-and-frisk effort, a finding the
department dismissed as flawed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the review board staff's report suggests that even the
official Police Department statistics may have been inaccurate, and
that far more stop-and-frisk encounters may have taken place in
recent years and simply not been recorded.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department was unable to provide recent statistics on
stop-and-frisk reports, but said that 138,872 had been filed in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer's report, based on department data, found that police
officers filed 175,000 reports between January 1998 and March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department defines a frisk as patting down the
outside of a suspect's clothing, feeling for a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   A search is described as reaching inside a suspect's pockets or
other interior parts of clothing to determine if an object felt is
a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``This failure to document stop-and-frisk encounters is
disturbing for several reasons,'' the review board staff's report
said. ``First, the under-reporting of the mandated stops shows that
NYPD policy is not strictly adhered to by its own police officers.
Officers are not filling out UF250 forms according to the Patrol
Guide's instructions, and this failure to appropriately document
stop encounters undermines the NYPD's policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, several senior police officials acknowledged that
officers commonly failed to file the paperwork, which is also meant
to protect officers from accusations of misconduct stemming from
the street encounters and to gather potentially valuable criminal
intelligence on suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials defended the department, noting that no other
large police force in the state uses the forms, and that
excessive-force complaints against New York City police officers
have been dropping despite thousands of arrests and hundreds of
thousands of encounters with the public each year.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir refused to discuss the draft
report Thursday, saying through a spokesman, ``It's inappropriate
to respond to a report that we have not received.''

RAID LEADERS GIVE REASONING FOR USE OF AUTOMATIC WEAPONS
</HEADLINE>
  (ADDS grafs 16,17 begin. ``Immigration officials said...'' with
background of investigation prior to raid.)  
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Commanders of the raid that reunited Elian Gonzalez
with his father went into the home of his Miami relatives with
automatic weapons early last Saturday because intelligence reports
indicated that the house was being guarded by a shadowy network of
men who had permits to carry concealed weapons, a history of
violent crime or a record of anti-Castro violence, one of the
officers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A senior immigration official in charge of intelligence
gathering for the operation said it was the information suggesting
the possibility of violence that led the authorities to plan a
large military-style raid with about 140 agents, a few armed with
automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a structure and the potential of violent threats to
prevent us from recovering Elian from the house and perhaps do
serious harm to our personnel and maybe innocent people in the
area,'' the official said. ``That's really why we structured the
enforcement plan to be, by any objective standard, an overwhelming
show of force to prevent the use of force.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said there were several reports of an unidentified
person at the house who was observed with a firearm but no reports
of weapons in the house. Attorney General Janet Reno has said there
were reports of weapons inside the house.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate comment on firearms Thursday night from a
spokesman for the family, though the family has always insisted it
had none in the house and none were confiscated in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence operation uncovered what the official said was
a plan to thwart any effort to remove Elian from the Gonzalez home
forcibly by rushing him to the house directly behind the Gonzalez's
if the authorities tried to break in. That house was headquarters
for the Cuban-American security operation in the Little Havana
neighborhood, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The intelligence operation relied largely on covert
surveillance, overflights of helicopters and fixed wing aircraft,
the official said, speaking on condition of not being named. The
information was cross-checked with law enforcement and commercial
databases to provide a profile of the loose network of security
personnel around the child in the days before the raid.
</P>
<P>
   The official said agents detected several layers in what he
described as a security cordon that extended around the house of
Lazaro Gonzalez, where Elian was staying after he was rescued from
the Atlantic Ocean last Thanksgiving. The security operation
extended to the streets surrounding the house, where the official
said, supporters in lawn chairs took positions at strategic
intersections and used walkie-talkies and cell phones to report law
enforcement activity.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the reports were transmitted to supporters of
the Miami relatives at a house on the same block as the Gonzalez
home. The reports, he said, were relayed to local Spanish-speaking
radio stations, which sometimes broadcasted appeals to
Cuban-Americans to crowd the streets around the house.
</P>
<P>
   The official said that agents identified five people who seemed
to operate as what he described as ``close quarters bodyguards''
who were at the Gonzalez house at varying times. Four of the five
people, the official said, were identified and all four had active
permits to carry concealed weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Gonzalez family seemed to know and allow some
members of the security force into their home, the official said,
it was unclear whether the Miami relatives played a significant
role in organizing or managing the network of Cuban-American
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The official said the leaders of the security force occupied the
house behind the Gonzalez home. This was what he described as a
base of operations for a larger group of 15 to 20 people who set up
roving patrols on foot, bicycles and cars.
</P>
<P>
   Among this group were nine people whom the official said had
criminal records for violent crimes including armed robbery and
assaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people had essentially taken it on their own to prevent
the removal of Elian from the Gonzalez home,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the official said, five members of the militantly
anti-Castro group Alpha 66 were seen on several occasions in the
crowd of demonstrators. He said that three of the five had taken
credit for firing from a boat into a seaside hotel in Cuba in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials said they coordinated their intelligence
gathering with other federal agencies and with Miami police. But
the officials said they did not coordinate the raid with local
authorities who, except for a few senior commanders, did not know
how or when the operation was to take place.
</P>
<P>
   Although several Cuban citizens in the security operation were
detained in the days before the assault, the official said, the
intelligence collection effort did not result in arrests or
searches for weapons. That was because the operation to take
custody of the child was focused solely on that goal, the official
said, and was not viewed as broader law enforcement action.
</P>
<P>
   The operation took place shortly after 5 a.m. on Saturday after
all-night negotiations that Reno had said stalled over the
relatives' unwillingness to surrender the child unconditionally to
the authorities after months of refusing to hand over the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the relatives have complained that they were
pleading for more time to negotiate a peaceful transfer at nearly
the exact time that Reno sent the agents to the house and have
bitterly criticized her for undertaking the assault without giving
the talks more time.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in Congress are planning hearings to review the
operation. Some lawmakers have sharply criticized Reno for sending
in agents outfitted in military-style jump suits who carried
automatic weapons in an operation that they said was likely to
provoke violence and terrorize the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers have not allowed the agents who
planned and carried out the assault to be interviewed until
Thursday, in part because they were assembling an after-action
report and reviewing each agent's account in anticipation of civil
lawsuits and congressional inquiries.

DR. MARTIN H. STEIN, PSYCHOANALYST, IS DEAD AT 87 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Martin H. Stein, a psychoanalyst who was
president of the New York Psychoanalytic Society in the 1960s, died
on April 19 at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. He was
87 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Stein retired about a year ago from his private psychoanalytic
practice. He had practiced psychoanalysis for five decades.
</P>
<P>
   He also taught at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute in
Manhattan and was chairman of its faculty in the 1970s. He headed
the American Psychoanalytic Association's board on professional
standards in the 1960s. And he was on the editorial boards of
Psychoanalytic Quarterly and The Journal of the American
Psychoanalytic Association.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joan B. Erle, one of his colleagues, said in remarks before
a professional gathering in 1986 that Stein wrote ``lucidly on
complex and difficult analytic issues: acting out, masochism,
states of consciousness, character theory, moral issues in
psychoanalysis, mental health, the psychology of dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   Stein was born in Newark, N.Y., and grew up in Brooklyn. He
received a bachelor's degree in 1932 from the College of the City
of New York, earned his medical degree from Cornell in 1936 and was
a New York University-Bellevue Hospital research fellow in
neuropsychiatry in 1939 and 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Stein was an Army Medical Corps psychiatrist during World War II
and after three years of training at the New York Psychoanalytic
Institute, he graduated in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   His first marriage, to Jane Knoob, ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife Lucille Kuttner; two daughters,
Maurine Stein of Chicago and Nora Stein of London, and three
grandchildren.

ALASKA MECHANIC SEEKS EXPANDED WRONGFUL-TERMINATION LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRACY JOHNSON  
 and PAUL SHUKOVSKY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ A former Alaska Airlines mechanic says in a lawsuit
that the airline falsified maintenance records, pressured him to
``speed up repairs'' and ridiculed him when he asked for
maintenance manuals to fix planes in the Oakland hangar.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammad Reza Zendehnam has asked the court for permission to
add the allegations to his year-old wrongful-termination lawsuit.
If the change is allowed by a federal judge, his lawsuit will
invoke the federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization
Act, which means greater damages if he proves Alaska engaged in a
pattern of criminal behavior. His lawsuit was filed in U.S.
District Court in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Vice President Lou Cancelmi called Zendehnam's lawsuit
``offensive'' in light of the Jan. 31 crash of Alaska Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real moral and ethical issue here deals with opportunism
and a desperate hope to cash in on tragedy,'' Cancelmi said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to respond to Zendehnam's allegations, saying: ``We
won't do it in the newspaper. We will very vigorously pursue our
interests in a court of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Zendehnam, 47, contends he was told to hurry repairs even when
he believed a plane needed more work to be fit for passenger
service. He claims Alaska threatened to fire him if he was unable
to do routine repair work faster.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations echo those raised last month by 64 mechanics who
work in Alaska's hangar at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
They wrote company executives, saying they had been ``pressured,
threatened and intimidated'' by their manager to cut corners.
</P>
<P>
   But Alaska officials noted that Zendehnam, who is
Iranian-American, alleged only ethnic discrimination in his
original lawsuit, filed 18 months after he was fired in October
1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he waited three years to file these serious
charges and only did so after his lawyer was contacted by a
reporter is most curious. Most curious indeed,'' Cancelmi said.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanic's lawyer, Jonathan Preston, said his client would
not comment but provided court papers showing the allegations were
raised in early March, before he was contacted by the
Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   Amending the lawsuit to include the RICO claim reflects the fact
that new information has been shaken loose by the crash, making it
easier to prove his case, Preston said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there are other witnesses (who have) come forward,'' he
said. ``There are mechanics talking; I've got a case with mechanics
who can back my client up.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Flight 261 plummeted into the Pacific Ocean off Southern
California, killing all 88 people on board, federal investigators
have been trying to determine if any crime contributed to the
disaster. Federal agents are also probing whether Alaska encouraged
illegal maintenance practices that were either condoned or ignored
by Federal Aviation Administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Zendehnam alleges, without offering specifics, that Alaska
falsified maintenance records that let unairworthy planes to be
returned to service _ allegations that have been the subject of a
grand jury investigation in San Francisco for at least 16 months.
The grand jury has not returned any indictments, but the FAA has
recommended that three Alaska maintenance supervisors in Oakland
lose their mechanic's licenses.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska hired Zendehnam, who had 17 years' experience as an
aircraft mechanic, in June 1997. A U.S. Air Force veteran, he had
worked for 10 years as a United Airlines mechanic and inspector,
Preston said.
</P>
<P>
   Zendehnam had experience checking and repairing Boeing 727, 737
and 757 planes, and contends Alaska assigned him to work on MD-80s
without training him.
</P>
<P>
   His amended suit claims Alaska engaged in ``a pattern of
unlawful conduct by allowing non-qualified MD-80 mechanics to work
on MD-80 planes without the proper systems or cross-over training
required by the (FAA).''
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's FAA-approved training program would require a new
mechanic with such experience to take a training class, according
to FAA spokeswoman Kirsti Dunn.
</P>
<P>
   Zendehnam also contends that he was ridiculed more than once
when he asked for manuals to guide him through routine MD-80
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   He says he was never given a reason for his firing; Alaska says
none was needed because he was still in a standard, new-employee
probation period.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1998, his discrimination claim against Alaska was
dismissed in an administrative proceeding by the California
Department of Fair Employment &AMP; Housing.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting Zendehnam's claim, a state official noted that a
co-worker had said that ``despite (the co-worker's) willingness to
answer your constant questions about how to perform each function,
you were exceedingly slow.''
</P>
<P>
   If Alaska is found to have violated RICO, Zendehnam could
collect triple damages, attorneys fees and costs. The 1970 law,
often used to combat organized crime, created a new class of civil
tort in which the plaintiff must show the defendant engaged in a
pattern of racketeering _ defined as being at least two criminal
acts connected by some common thread.
</P>
<P>
   The MD-83 that crashed in January had undergone a heavy
maintenance check in the Oakland hangar on Sept. 29, 1997. The
National Transportation Safety Board is looking closely at
maintenance of the plane in its efforts to to find the cause of the
crash. The FBI is conducting its own investigation to determine if
a crime contributed to the crash.
</P>
<P>
   As the airline was still reeling from the crash in March, the 64
SeaTac mechanics fired off their letter. Company officials
interviewed those who signed it and have said no planes were
returned to flight in an unsafe or unairworthy manner.
</P>
<P>
   They also transferred the maintenance manager to a
non-supervisory job, created a team to focus on safety and started
a safety hotline for employees.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the airline was subjected to a ``white
glove'' inspection by the FAA. The agency found irregularities in
maintenance records for two planes, prompting the company to
inspect the paperwork detailing heavy maintenance inspections on
most of its fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Chronicle, citing FAA records, reported
Thursday that an Alaska Airlines plane that was found this month to
have incomplete maintenance records had hydraulic problems on four
separate flights, that in some cases forced passengers to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's records came under review during the white glove
inspection. The Chronicle reported that the aircraft was
prematurely cleared for a test flight in Oakland despite
unspecified irregularities with its paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Alaska nor the FAA will say whether the review turned up
anything unusual, but the FAA said it plans to reach some
conclusions in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Zendehnam still contends two mechanics at the Oakland hangar
made repeated ethnic slurs in the four and a half months he worked
there.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska's Cancelmi points out that 53 percent of the mechanics in
Alaska's Oakland hangar are people of color.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll let the facts of our employment statistics speak for
themselves,'' he said.

<P>
   FONTANA, Calif. _ Race car drivers have a superstition: They
want to be neither the first nor last car out during qualifying.
That didn't seem to bother NASCAR Busch driver Jeff Green after he
led off and grabbed the pole Thursday for Saturday's Auto Club 300
at California Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   The series points leader covered the 2-mile, D-shaped oval in a
track-record 40.391 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get paid to sit on poles and win races,'' said Green, one
of 30 cars to run quicker than the previous track record of 41.106,
set by Steve Park in 1997. ``So every once in a while, you have to
go out on the limb and scare yourself to death. It was pretty tough
going out first, but I knew that lap . . . if someone was going to
beat it, they would have to run a great lap. And if they did, it's
all theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup regulars Jeff Burton (177.550 mph) and Joe Nemechek
(177.519 mph) qualified second and fourth, respectively. Palmdale
native Ron Hornaday Jr., who is in his first season in the series,
qualified 16th at 176.121 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't think that lap would hold up to be No. 2,''
Burton said. ``I had a great (line in turns 1 and 2), but I did a
terrible job in 3 and 4. We made improvements on the car after
practice, and the car drove great. I just didn't drive like I
needed to in 3 and 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's problem was with the line he took going into the
tri-oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a Busch car, you drive to arch your way into the corner,
then come down the race track,'' Burton said. ''I just didn't do a
good job of driving. I came off the corner too soon and that caused
me to slow down.''
</P>
<P>
   Other notables to qualify were former CART series driver P.J.
Jones (40.865), who is 13th, and Jason Leffler (40.980), who is
24th. Leffler, who won last season's USAC Turkey Night Grand Prix
at Irwindale Speedway, also announced he will drive in the
Indianapolis 500 for Treadway Racing.
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying for the Winston West Pontiac WideTrack Grand Prix 200
was dominated by Winston Cup regulars Ken Schrader and Johnny
Benson.
</P>
<P>
   Schrader, who has won two of the past four Winston West races at
this track since its opening in 1997, took the pole with a 39.906,
or 180.424 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, who is competing in his first Winston West event, is
second at 40.001. Winston West regulars Austin Cameron (40.541) and
Brendan Gaughan (40.666) qualified fifth and seventh, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Bean is 10th at 40.930. Former NFL coach Jerry Glanville,
who runs selected events, is 20th at 41.757.

   OJAI, Calif. _ Underdogs beware.
</P>
<P>
   Everything went as expected for top-seeded Stanford in the
opening rounds of the Pac-10 divsion of the 100th Ojai Tennis
Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Kim advanced to today's quarterfinals with a 6-3, 6-1
victory over Marius Lunde of Washington and a 6-3, 4-6, 6-2 win
over Andrew Park of USC.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Granville, the Cardinal's No. 1-ranked women's player,
also is headed to the quarters with wins over Melissa Pine of
Washington State (6-1, 6-2) and Christina Fusano of California
(6-1, 6-4).
</P>
<P>
   Park, who was fighting back spasms, wasn't discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been starting to play better over the past couple of
weeks, and it was a tough matchup because this is a guy that
doesn't give you any free points,'' said Park. ``I don't really
have a game that overpowers anybody. I've never been the big guy on
the court, so I don't get intimidated too easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the best matchup for me, but I think I put up a
fight, especially in the second.''
</P>
<P>
   Stanford continued its dominance on the court with an upset
victory. UCLA's Jong-Min Lee, the No. 2 seed of the tournament,
lost to K.J. Hippensteel 4-6, 6-7(2) in a match that took just
under two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Hong trailed in the second set 5-3 and broke Hippensteel's serve
to tie it eventually at 5-5.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans also had tough loss when Nick Rainey fell to
Oregon's Guillermo Carter in three sets 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The second-ranked Bruins had better luck in other matches.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Kramer of UCLA beat Alex Brown of Arizona 6-3, 6-3 and
Matt Klinger 6-3, 7-6 (7-4). Julian Rojer also swept his matches
(6-2, 6-3 and 6-4, 6-0) to advance to the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Noel Grinda had six hard-fought sets and won both matches.
Grinda won 3-6, 6-0, 6-3 over Robert Kowalczyk of California and
6-3, 4-6, 6-4 over Matt Hanlin of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's Pac-10, the Bruins and Trojans each had one
player advance to the quarters.
</P>
<P>

BODY FOUND IN SWAMP THOUGHT TO BE THAT OF KIDNAPPED MAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ky.)   By ANDY NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A body believed to be that of a 28-year-old British computer
consultant who had been kidnapped from his Kentucky hotel room 10
days ago was found half-buried in a swamp in Ocean County, N.J., on
Thursday, the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   A New Jersey man who is suspected of posing as an FBI agent and
kidnapping the British man is being investigated in connection with
the death, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said they believed that the New Jersey man,
Gregory J. Marcinski, 23, of Brick Township in Ocean County, might
have kidnapped the consultant, Paul Jeffrey Gale, because Gale was
dating Marcinski's former girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   The body, which was awaiting positive identification on Thursday
night, was found near Marcinski's home, said Garey S. Chin, the
assistant agent in charge at the FBI's Newark, N.J., office.
</P>
<P>
   Marks on the body indicated the man had been strangled and
burned, the authorities said. It was unclear when the man had died
or how long the body had been in the swamp.
</P>
<P>
   On April 17 at 12:30 a.m., the authorities said, Marcinski,
posing as an FBI agent, went to the Holiday Inn in Florence, Ky., a
suburb of Cincinnati, where Gale was staying, woke him up and led
him to a car in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   A witness saw Gale being handcuffed and getting into the
passenger seat, the agency said. It was the last time Gale, a
programmer who was in Kentucky working as a consultant in the
merger of two pharmaceutical companies, was seen alive.
</P>
<P>
   Later that day, Marcinski returned to New Jersey, showed his
housemate, Preston C. Foray Jr., the body in the trunk of his car,
and asked for help burying it, said Special Agent Sandra Carroll, a
spokeswoman for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Foray, 22, has been charged with being an accessory after the
fact to the kidnapping, Chin said.
</P>
<P>
   Marcinski was arrested on April 19 in Red Bank, N.J., and
charged with impersonating an FBI agent and has been held at the
Monmouth County jail since then. He is also awaiting extradition to
Kentucky on kidnapping charges.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday about 2 a.m., Chin said, investigators went to a
marshy area in Brick and found a shirtless body with strangulation
marks on the neck and burn marks from a flammable liquid. Chin said
the killer might have wanted to burn the body to destroy evidence.
</P>
<P>
   If Marcinski is charged with murder, whether he is charged in
Kentucky, New Jersey or elsewhere will depend on where Gale is
determined to have been murdered.
</P>
<P>
   Chin said that the authorities believed that Marcinski killed
Gale in Kentucky and drove the 800 miles back to New Jersey with
the body in the car, his grandmother's Buick.
</P>
<P>
   Gale had recently lived in Mount Laurel, N.J., where he worked
for TRW Integrated Supply, Chin said. He was dating a former
girlfriend of Marcinski's, the authorities said, who had a
restraining order against Marcinski.

AFTER WEEKS WITHOUT LEADER, ABC NETWORK GETS PRESIDENT
</HEADLINE>
  By JIM RUTENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Walt Disney Co. has placed the president of its radio and
television stations division in charge of the ABC Television
Network, which has been without a direct leader for weeks even as
it has stood at No. 1 in the ratings.
</P>
<P>
   The executive, Robert F. Callahan, who has been ABC's president
of broadcasting since February 1999, assumed his new position as
president of the newly named ABC Broadcast Group Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan is now overseeing the ABC network's news,
entertainment, daytime and late-night divisions as well as its
affiliate relations and sales and marketing units. He will retain
his position as the executive in charge of Disney's radio and
television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan is inheriting a network that is in very good shape.
</P>
<P>
   Fueled in large part by ``Who Wants to be a Millionaire,'' the
popular game show that has Regis Philbin as its host, ABC has
become the most watched network in terms of households and viewers
after three years in third place behind CBS and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   The show's success in the ratings is estimated to have added
hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue this television season.
</P>
<P>
   As it prepares to announce a new fall television schedule next
month, the task at hand for ABC is to build on its success by
adding popular new shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got one show that is really healthy,'' said Tom
Wolzien, media analyst for Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co. ``The real
test here is to see how they're doing when you get into next
December, when you've seen how their new shows have fared and how
the shows they bring back have fared.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Callahan does not have network programming experience,
Robert A. Iger, the Walt Disney president who was chairman of ABC
until midwinter, said he did not expect Callahan to have too much
trouble learning that end of the business. Also, Iger said,
Callahan has adept programmers beneath him in ABC Entertainment's
co-chairmen, Stu Bloomberg and Lloyd Braun.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan began his association with ABC in 1981, when he was
hired as sales manager of Multichannel News, a title owned by
Fairchild Publications, a unit of ABC's former parent company,
Capital Cities. After moving up the ranks at Fairchild, Callahan
was promoted to president of ABC Radio Networks in 1990 _ doubling
its number of radio stations to 44. In February 1999, he was also
given responsibility for ABC's 10 television stations. Under his
watch, the number of owned stations that were No. 1 in their
markets rose from six to eight.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan's television station division has been in heated
negotiations over retransmission rights with Time Warner Cable. The
two sides are at an impasse that could result in the removal of
local ABC stations from Time Warner Cable systems across the
country, including in New York and Los Angeles. The current
transmission agreement is set to expire at midnight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has proposed that the current agreement be extended through
May 24, the end of the crucial May sweeps ratings period, which
began Thursday night. Executives say they believe that Federal
Communications Commission regulations will require Time Warner to
honor that proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Time Warner said its lawyers were reviewing the
regulations and had no other immediate response.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan said he would still closely monitor the situation. ABC
executives said Callahan's new job title essentially made him a
replacement for Iger.

MAYOR DENOUNCES PANEL'S REPORT ON POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIAN E. BARNES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police Commissioner Howard
Safir questioned the credibility of the United States Commission on
Civil Rights on Thursday and attacked the findings of its draft
report on the New York Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   The 250-page draft report said that evidence suggested the
Police Department engaged in racial profiling. It also recommended
that a monitor oversee how civilian complaints were investigated
and that a mechanism be created to pursue accusations of police
brutality independent of local prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of Giuliani and of the police generally praised the
report on Thursday. Some said they hoped the final report would
call for an independent monitor to oversee the entire department.
</P>
<P>
   The report has not been released to the public, but The New York
Times obtained a copy. On Thursday, Giuliani accused the commission
of leaking the report and repeated his earlier accusation that the
agency had a partisan political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The report recommended a monitor for the Civilian Complaint
Review Board. Giuliani said that while the review board could be
improved, it functioned better than the report implied.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should take a look at their own process before they
recommend a different process for the CCRB,'' Giuliani said. ``The
CCRB does not leak information before it turns it over to the
commissioner.''

U.S. DROPS EMBEZZLEMENT CASE AGAINST PROFESSOR
</HEADLINE>
  By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After charging a trailblazing anthropology professor
at John Jay College of Criminal Justice last year with embezzling
money from a $2.6 million federal grant, federal prosecutors have
abruptly moved to dismiss the charges, although they say they are
still investigating the case.
</P>
<P>
   The professor, Ansley Hamid, who is credited with discovering
and documenting trends in urban drug use, was accused of using the
money to pay for travel and other personal expenses.
</P>
<P>
   At the prosecutor's request, a federal magistrate dismissed the
case against Hamid late Wednesday afternoon. A spokesman for the
U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan declined to say why the charges
were dismissed. The charges were dismissed by the judge without
prejudice, a legal term meaning prosecutors can reinstate the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it is the end of an unjustifiable ordeal,'' Hamid, 55,
said Thursday. He declined to speak further without consulting his
lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Hamid's lawyer, Paul Shectman, said: ``The United States
attorney has told us they have not made a final decision, but we
are very pleased they are taking a hard look at this case. They
have given us a chance to present professor Hamid's side of the
story.
</P>
<P>
   In October, prosecutors charged that Hamid embezzled more than
$5,000 from the grant for a study titled ``Heroin in the 21st
Century.'' The charges did not specify an amount, but prosecutors
said he used the money to pay for trips to Florida, Hawaii and
Trinidad, to buy compact disks and electronic equipment, and to pay
two research assistants who worked mainly on his private book
projects.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for John Jay College said Thursday that the school
had not been informed that the charges were dropped and still
intended to pursue administrative disciplinary charges against the
professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had deferred our case and charges against him to let the
federal prosecution go forward,'' said Jerry Capeci, the college
spokesman. ``If they have dropped their case, ours will proceed and
there is a hearing date scheduled in June.''
</P>
<P>
   Capeci said the college was seeking to dismiss Hamid, who is
tenured. ``The federal government charged him with crimes and we
are charging him with administrative violations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The professor was suspended from the heroin project in December
1997 and removed from teaching in January 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 20 years, Hamid has been a pioneering researcher
in the study of America's drug underworld. A native of Trinidad, he
received degrees from the London School of Economics and Columbia
University. He has become known for his ability to win the
confidence of addicts he interviewed, and has documented trends and
shifts in drug use, such as the crack epidemic in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his work has been closely watched by the nation's drug
experts, and in 1996, John Jay College's research foundation was
awarded a $2.6 million grant to allow Hamid to conduct a five-year
study of heroin use in some of the city's bleakest neighborhoods.
The study proposed to establish a ``monitoring network to track the
development cycle of heroin use in New York City from 1995 to
2000.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the complaint filed last year by federal agents,
Hamid used some of the grant money for personal expenses. In one
count, the agents charged that Hamid purchased more than $2,000 in
electronic equipment and music compact disks. In the complaint,
federal agents said that an investigator from John Jay College told
them that Hamid said he felt he was entitled to listen to music
while working on his computer.
</P>
<P>
   The agents also said another witness, whom they did not
identify, told them that Hamid gave him $100 to buy 10 bags of
heroin so that the professor could compensate addicts for
participating in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal complaint also said the college investigator told
federal agents that Hamid ``admitted that he experimented with
heroin for approximately one month'' while working on the project.
</P>
<P>
   Hamid has been free on bond while the charges were pending. He
has adamantly maintained his innocence and has publicly denied the
accusations, which he has described as ``trumped-up charges.''
