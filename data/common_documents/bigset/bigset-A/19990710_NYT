DEPARTMENT MAY CHARGE POLICE OFFICER   IN SQUEEGEE CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAYSON BLAIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service     
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Police officials said Friday that they would probably
bring departmental proceedings against the officer acquitted of
criminal charges in the shooting of an unarmed ``squeegee man,''
but they said it would be difficult to establish violations of
police procedure because they would be using much of the same
evidence used in the criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Michael W. Meyer, 29, will most likely face
departmental charges of reckless endangerment and wrongful assault
of a person known to the department, and other, lesser charges,
said police officials involved in the department's inquiry into the
case. If found guilty of the charges by an administrative judge,
Meyer could face dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer was acquitted on Thursday of charges of assault and
reckless endangerment after a nonjury trial in State Supreme Court
in the Bronx. Two days earlier, the judge dismissed a charge of
attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer testified that he shot in self-defense because he feared
that the ``squeegee man,'' Antoine Reid, would kill him during a
scuffle. The judge ruled that the prosecution had the burden of
proving a different motive, and had failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials noted that there is a less stringent standard
for conviction in a departmental trial than in a criminal case,
where the prosecution must prove its case beyond a reasonable
doubt. In a noncriminal proceeding, the standard is whether the
evidence shows that a charge is more likely than not to be true.
</P>
<P>
   But officials involved with the potential case against Meyer
admitted that after an acquittal on similar criminal charges, it
could be difficult to convince an administrative judge that an
officer had committed wrongful assault or reckless endangerment in
the confrontation with Reid on June 14, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you go after people who are not found guilty on a
technicality, or, because of evidence that was excluded in a
criminal trial, we could prosecute them differently,'' said one
police official. ``But in this case, I don't know if that exists.''
</P>
<P>
   The police official said that if the department's administrative
judge agrees with the verdict in the criminal case, it would be
difficult for the department to find Meyer guilty of similar counts
without additional evidence.
</P>
<P>
   An option, the official said, would be to try to persuade Meyer
to resign or to file a series of lesser departmental charges, which
would be less likely to result in Meyer's dismissal upon
conviction.
</P>
<P>
   But the officer's lawyer, Murray Richman, said Friday that Meyer
would not consider resigning from the force.
</P>
<P>
   ``A horrible thing happened, but he simply did nothing wrong,''
Richman said of the shooting.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The internal investigation expanded Thursday, after the trial
concluded, police officials said, because the Bronx district
attorney had asked the police Internal Affairs Bureau, which has
the power to compel officers to answer questions involving
shootings by officers, not to interview Meyer until the conclusion
of the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer remains on modified duty, stripped of his badge and gun,
as he has been since the shooting on June 13 of last year. Friday,
Marilyn Mode, a spokeswoman for Commissioner Howard Safir, said
that when Meyer was first arrested and charged, the department drew
up charges that mirrored the criminal charges. ``We are currently
reviewing those charges for possible further departmental
disciplinary action,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer had been removed from patrol duty before the shooting
because he had accumulated an unusually high number of complaints
of using excessive force against civilians. Meyer was transferred
early last year from his patrol post in the 75th Precinct in East
New York, Brooklyn, and assigned to the Police Department's
building maintenance section, where he had little contact with the
public, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer, whose record also includes citations for valor, was one
of 16 officers removed from law enforcement duties under a program
to monitor potentially troubled officers who have six or more
complaints of excessive force filed against them with the Civilian
Complaint Review Board within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that when they moved Meyer off patrol they could
not take away his service weapon without placing him on modified
duty, which involves formal departmental charges and a hearing.
</P>
<P>
   The six complaints, which were filed since 1994, alleged that
Meyer pushed, shoved, punched and kicked citizens. The trial judge
ruled that evidence of the complaints was inadmissible at the
criminal trial because they had not been substantiated.

LITTON DROPS PLANS TO ACQUIRE NEWPORT NEWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Litton Industries has dropped its bid for Newport
News Shipbuilding, an action the industry had anticipated after the
government signaled its unwillingness to approve such an
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   The aerospace-defense company had sought to buy the Navy's main
supplier of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers for $1.9 billion, but
Defense Secretary William Cohen indicated last month that such a
marriage would be anti-competitive. Had the deal gone through, it
would have reduced the number of military shipbuilders to two from
three.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Litton is pushing ahead with its acquisition of
Avondale Industries, a New Orleans-based shipbuilder. The $529
billion purchase is expected to be approved by Avondale
shareholders July 27.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the year, Newport News had announced plans to buy
Avondale for $470 million, but Litton shook up the deal in May by
announcing that it wanted to acquire both Newport News and
Avondale. The board of Avondale accepted Litton's higher bid, and
Newport News didn't raise its offer.
</P>
<P>
   An industry tracker said Friday that the Pentagon's reasons for
opposing the Litton-Newport deal centered on the issue of the clout
that Litton would have carried if the merger had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the government disallowed the deal) because they
didn't want Litton to have the ability that Newport News has of
building nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers, along with
everything else they already do,'' said Paul Nisbet, an analyst at
JSA Research in Newport, R.I. ``It would put too much power in one
hand. Now they've got three strong shipyard owners.''
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Avondale pits Litton against Newport News as the
nation's second-largest military shipbuilder. If Litton had been
allowed to buy both Avondale and Virginia-based Newport News, the
combined behemoth would have had similar market share as top
shipbuilder General Dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   General Dynamics' marine group sales for the year total an
estimated $3 billion while Newport News and the Litton/Avondale
combination are both in the $1.9 billion range, Nisbet said.
Litton's shipbuilding revenues are about $1.1 billion a year, and
Avondale would add another $800 million to it.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Litton said Friday that it was disappointed by
the government's reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are certainly disappointed by the cool reception,'' said
Litton spokesman Randy Belote. ``(The acquisition) would have
created realizable cost savings for the U.S. Navy and other
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Litton didn't have a formal merger agreement with
Newport News, Belote said. However, the company had asked the
government to do a preliminary review of the proposed merger to
test the regulatory waters.
</P>
<P>
   The Avondale deal should be finalized shortly after shareholders
give approval later this month. Belote said Litton plans to save
money by improving efficiency in areas of common practice such as
materials purchasing and human resources. However, he also said
there are no plans to cut jobs.

METS DEFEAT YANKEES 5-2 AS SHEA STADIUM IS AGAIN TOUGH ON CLEMENS 
 
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Armando Benitez whipped a final strike past the New
York Yankees' Chili Davis Friday night, whirled in a full circle
and began pumping his right fist, once, twice, five times. Five
pumps, one for each of the runs the Mets scored off Roger Clemens,
five pumps for the magnificent performance of Al Leiter. Five pumps
for the Mets' badly needed big-game victory.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza's laser-beam three-run home run off Clemens in the
sixth inning broke a tie, and the Mets beat the Yankees, 5-2,
before 53,820 at Shea Stadium. Al Leiter (8-6), who saved the Mets
from a sweep at Yankee Stadium last month, limited the Yankees to
four hits in eight innings. ``Certainly it was an exciting
feeling,'' said Leiter. `` Piazza came up with the big home run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who have lost 2 of 3 games in each of the first three
series against the Yankees in interleague play, have a great
opportunity to win some bragging rights this weekend. The
struggling Andy Pettitte, who has five losses in his last seven
decisions, will pitch for the Yankees Saturday, against the Mets'
Rick Reed, and Orel Hershiser will pair off against the Yankees'
Hideki Irabu Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   After Piazza's home run, the Shea Stadium fans crooned Clemens'
first name: Roger, Roger, sung to the tune of Darryl, Darryl. This
place has never been kind to Clemens, who lost his only
regular-season start here in 1997. Of course, there was 1986.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lasting images from the World Series that year is
that of Clemens bent forward on the visitors' bench in the final
inning of Game 6, hands together in front of his face, hoping and
wishing and praying for three more outs so he could run onto the
field and celebrate the first Red Sox championship in nearly 70
years. But Shea Stadium and the Mets were not kind to Clemens that
night, and really, Shea Stadium has never been a happy place for
Clemens, who is trying to re-establish himself with the Yankees,
once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens knocked down a batter and struck out seven against
Boston May 27, and the Yankees expected him to take off after that.
But he continued to pitch inconsistently, without the dominance
expected of him. He whiffed 13 Texas Rangers June 17 and shut out
Detroit June 29, prompting Yankees manager Joe Torre to say Clemens
was getting stronger and ready to pitch the way he usually does.
</P>
<P>
   It still hasn't happened. He is making mistakes that are at odds
with his legend. When the Yankees acquired him in spring training,
they assumed he would be like David Cone, finding a way through
jams. Instead, he often pitches himself into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets' Brian McRae dumped a double down the left field line
in the second inning, and with two outs, Rey Ordonez strolled to
the plate, his batting average .327 over his last 30 games. Leiter,
among the worst-hitting pitchers in the National League stood on
deck, bearing an .074 batting average. Clemens didn't want to
necessarily concede first base to Ordonez _ if he retired the Mets'
shortstop, then Leiter would lead off the next inning, and not
Rickey Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no reason to give Ordonez anything to hit. Clemens
wanted ``to get ahead in the count, early in the game,'' threw a
first-pitch fastball, Ordonez smacked a single through the middle
and the Mets led, 1-0, after two innings. (Clemens, incidentally,
came into the game with a 6.43 ERA in the first two innings of
games, 3.50 thereafter).
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees tied the game in the top of the third, before
Clemens retired the first two batters in the bottom of the third,
jumped ahead of John Olerud no balls and two strikes. Olerud took
two balls, leveling the count, and Clemens threw a splitter or a
fastball over the middle of the plate _ whatever it was, it was a
terrible pitch. Olerud blasted the ball off the bottom of the
scoreboard beyond the right field wall.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees regained control of this game briefly in the top of
the sixth, after Paul O'Neill doubled home Derek Jeter with the
tying run; there was nobody out. But O'Neill was thrown out while
trying to steal third base, a call O'Neill disputed vociferously
(replays showed he was safe on an extremely close play).
</P>
<P>
   Leiter rebounded, and the score was 2-2 when Clemens took the
mound for the bottom of the sixth, and immediately, he was unlucky:
Edgardo Alfonzo blooped a single that barely fell over the
outstretched glove of Chuck Knoblauch. ``The jam shot set up the
whole thing,'' Clemens later lamented.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud was next, and Clemens was extraordinarily cautious,
throwing hard stuff away until Olerud walked. First and second and
nobody out, Piazza due to bat. The Mets' slugger had hit into a
double play in his first at-bat - Piazza had just seven hits in his
last 47 at-bats with runners in scoring position, to that point _
but Piazza had homered off Clemens in June, and for his career, he
was 4 for 7.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had to attack, that much Piazza knew. He fouled off a
slider, and took two fastballs out of the strike zone. Clemens
isn't the type to concede _ he wasn't going to throw a fastball
down the middle _ so he went with a slider. Posada, his catcher,
set up his glove low and away. Clemens' slider spun down and over
the middle, where Piazza often crushes the ball. ``
</P>
<P>
   Piazza crushed this slider, the baseball zooming over the
infield toward left-center, as if he had misjudged his club choice
and used a 2-iron to smash the ball out of bounds. ``The home run,
that was the backbreaker, obviously,'' said Clemens. ``That one
blow killed us.''
</P>
<P>
   Shea Stadium, the home of Clemens' Game 6 ghosts, erupted in
emotion; for once, Yankees' fans were outshouted. Piazza ambled
around the bases. Clemens kicked at the dirt around the rubber, as
if nothing had happened. That was not the case, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees put a couple of runners on in the ninth inning
against Benitez, who had replaced Leiter, and the slugger Chili
Davis pinch-hit, representing the tying run. Benitez threw a
fastball, Davis missed, and Benitez whirled and pumped his fist.

DISCOUNTER FALLS VICTIM TO CONCEPT'S POPULARITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY ENRIQUE RIVERO  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Fedco Inc. has said it filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy and will sell its outlets -- a victim of the popular
discount department store concept it pioneered 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is approved by bankruptcy court, Target would buy
Fedco's 10 general merchandise stores, three furniture and
appliance outlets, and its Santa Fe Springs headquarters and
distribution center for $120 million, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chapter 11 reorganization, Fedco expects to meet its
financial obligations, which include severance for its
approximately 3,700 employees, spokeswoman Donna Walters said.
Money left over from the sale would go toward establishing a
nonprofit foundation to assist charities in areas where Fedco
maintained stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other words, there is a possibility that if everything goes
as expected, Fedco will continue to be a positive influence in the
communities,'' Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   Target, owned by Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp., expects
to convert six of the 10 general merchandise stores into Target
outlets, and will ``sell or dispose of'' the rest of the properties
in the package, said Patty Morris, a spokeswoman for the chain.
</P>
<P>
   It was too early to say which Fedco stores would be converted to
Targets, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still evaluating the sites to determine which ones would
be most advantageous to open as Target stores,'' Morris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those locations are valuable locations in terms of potential
guest traffic,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Target operates two outlets in Northridge and one each
in Pacoima, North Hollywood, Granada Hills and Woodland Hills in
the San Fernando Valley; one in Valencia in the Santa Clarita
Valley; one each in Lancaster and Palmdale in the Antelope Valley;
and stores in Alhambra, Puente Hills, La Verne, Duarte, Pasadena,
West Covina and San Dimas in the San Gabriel Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Van Nuys and Pasadena stores, Fedco has
outlets in Los Angeles and Cerritos in Los Angeles County; Costa
Mesa and Buena Park in Orange County; San Bernardino and Ontario in
San Bernardino County; and Escondido and National City in San Diego
County.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the struggling nonprofit, membership retailer
had embarked on a remodeling program to improve its fortunes and
had completed work on two stores but lacked money for the rest,
Walters said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the discount landscape is now dominated by for-profit
chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have now is a bunch of very large for-profit
companies, and competition was very intense,'' Walters said. ``That
need (for discounters) is being filled by other companies. It's
time for Fedco to move on.''

KANSAS BOASTS MORE ZOOS THAN ALL BUT FIVE STATES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM PERRIN  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EMPORIA, Kan. _ Mayor Ray Toso knows he has a novelty here,
something few other cities of this size even dream about.
</P>
<P>
   A zoo.
</P>
<P>
   At a modest 6 acres, it isn't a big place. Until a few years ago
it was the smallest accredited zoo in the United States;
nevertheless, it's home to nearly 100 animal species and 500
specimens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until people actually see what's there, I don't think they
realize how nice a zoo a town this size can have,'' said Toso, a
nearly lifelong resident of Emporia, population 25,522. ``A lot of
people are surprised with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In most states, finding a small city with a zoo is unusual, but
not in Kansas, which has six zoos accredited by the American Zoo
and Aquarium Association. That's twice as many as Missouri and more
than all but five states, all of which are far more populous than
Kansas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a cultural phenomenon,'' said Mark Reed, director of the
Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita, the state's largest zoo.
</P>
<P>
   All six accredited zoos _ in Emporia, Garden City, Hutchinson,
Manhattan, Topeka and Wichita _ were among the 20 most-visited
attractions in Kansas last year, based on figures reported to the
state Travel and Tourism Division. (Missouri's accredited zoos are
in Kansas City, St. Louis and Springfield.)
</P>
<P>
   Four other Kansas zoos that aren't accredited _ in Clay Center,
Dodge City, Great Bend and Independence _ also attract thousands of
visitors.
</P>
<P>
   Both states have a number of federally licensed, private animal
exhibitors, some of whom bill their attractions as zoos. Some
cities, including Overland Park, have petting zoos or barnyard
animal exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Collections at some of the smaller Kansas zoos are heavy on
animals native to Kansas or common elsewhere in the United States,
but also include traditional zoo favorites such as lions, giraffes,
bears and chimpanzees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's phenomenal. I don't know why Kansas has so many really
good zoos,'' said Scott Shoemaker, director of Sunset Zoo in
Manhattan. ``I don't know if it's just the character of people that
they want to have zoos and take care of them, or if there's
something in the history of Kansas where if you wanted to be a
legitimate city, you need a zoo.''
</P>
<P>
   There really isn't a simple explanation for why Kansas has so
many zoos, or why they've thrived for so many years, other than
that the communities simply value the zoos enough to support them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it, people say there's nothing else to do, and there's
a lot of truism to that,'' said Reed, who came to Wichita in 1979
and is the leading figure in Kansas zoos.
</P>
<P>
   Annual budgets for the six accredited zoos range from $175,095
(Emporia) to $5.4 million (Sedgwick County). Local governments are
the largest money source.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the zoos trace their roots to the 1930s as projects
initiated by the Works Progress Administration. Some started with a
``monkey island,'' basically a moat surrounding a small colony of
monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   The only island still being used is at the Ralph Mitchell Zoo in
Independence, a city of about 10,000 in southeast Kansas. The
island used to have a monkey-scale jail and city hall, but only a
castle was left standing several years ago when the island was
renovated into a more natural habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Legend has it that Mickey Mantle once hit a 600-foot home run
onto the island from a nearby baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo's most unusual feature is a small canyon that has been
transformed into enclosures for a cougar and two black bears.
Visitors walk down steps into the canyon onto a boardwalk that
crosses a running stream. Both the cougar and the bears have room
to roam in natural-looking settings.
</P>
<P>
   Marlin Perkins of television's ``Wild Kingdom'' show visited
Independence in 1980 to help develop ideas to renovate the canyon
displays, which date to 1925.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the best mountain lion exhibit in the United
States,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   The Emporia Zoo has come a long way since 1973, when it
consisted of a rectangular fenced area with two bison, deer, a
longhorn steer, a goat and some birds.
</P>
<P>
   Then David Traylor took over as director, and the zoo has been
growing since. The bison and deer remain, but the zoo expanded
across a street, and its collection now includes wallabies and
lemurs.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo is participating in an American Zoo and Aquarium
Association breeding program for cinerous vultures, a bird with an
8-foot wingspan. The bird collection is one of the zoo's
highlights, along with its well-tended grounds that include 12
manmade waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people come in here, I want them to be able to escape to
wherever they want to be, whether they want to see animals or
not,'' Traylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sedgwick County Zoo opened in 1971 in west Wichita with one
exhibit, a big barn that has farm animals from Asia, Africa and the
United States. It's still a popular feature, especially with kids,
but only a fraction of what the zoo has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Sedgwick County's animal collection is the 22nd largest in the
country, Reed said. The zoo has areas devoted to animals from North
America, Asia, Africa, Australia and South America, as well as an
indoor rain forest.
</P>
<P>
   Sedgwick County is also active in efforts to breed several
endangered species. The zoo even has two Komodo dragons. Last
summer at the Kansas City Zoo, a Komodo dragon on loan from
Minnesota was a special attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their (animal) collection is pretty darn good,'' said Conrad
Schmitt, zoological curator for the Kansas City Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other Kansas zoos, Sunset in Manhattan receives praise
from peers for its chimpanzee exhibit, and Topeka for its gorillas.
Hutchinson is the most recent to receive accreditation, in 1997.
Reed thinks the Brit Spaugh Zoo in Great Bend may soon be ready to
make a run at accreditation.
</P>
<P>
   The 47-acre Lee Richardson Zoo in Garden City was the state's
second most- popular in 1998, with 262,651 visitors. There's a
drive-through fee of $3 per vehicle, but walking through is free.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the exhibits not only attempt to replicate natural
habitats, but also allow visitors to see the animals up close.
</P>
<P>
   At the rhino exhibit, signs read, ``Caution: Rhino marks
territory by urinating toward sidewalk.'' They aren't kidding.
During a recent visit, a Star reporter sprang back just in time to
avoid being splashed.
</P>
<P>
   A specialized zoo, the Rolling Hills Refuge Wildlife
Conservation Center near Salina, is scheduled to open to the public
in late summer or early fall.

`THE WHOLE WORLD SEEMED AGAINST US,' BUT AIRMAN KEPT STRIVING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jessie Scott, an unsung hero of a war within a war, raised his
head from the pillow on his nursing home bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ranks are thinning fast,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, in his early 70s, is a modest man. There is but one clue
in his room to indicate the honored ranks he once joined. It is a
small bronze plaque almost hidden behind some toiletries on his
dresser.
</P>
<P>
   It states that Scott was one of the ``original Tuskegee
Airmen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So many of the originals are gone now,'' Scott said. ``Not too
many of us are left to tell our story.''
</P>
<P>
   He can barely see the plaque now. His sight has been stolen by
diabetes and glaucoma, his mobility by other medical problems.
</P>
<P>
   But his perspective remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``That plaque is not important,'' he said. ``That's just a
little something for me. It's what we accomplished as a group
that's important. It's what we did that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   And what the Tuskegee Airmen did was glorious. With almost no
support, and confronted by the virulent racism infecting the U.S.
military establishment at the start of World War II, they created
one of the finest fighting units in American history.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew what we had to do,'' Scott said. ``So we kept going
though the whole world seemed against us.''  &LR; BRK:`Something to
prove'
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, the whole world was against them. For even as they
trained to fight fascism abroad, they confronted an Army Air Corps
filled with white officers who believed the very idea of black
combat pilots was absurd.
</P>
<P>
   That attitude had been bolstered by an Army War College report
concluding that black people lacked the intelligence and courage
for combat flying.
</P>
<P>
   That cruel and ludicrous report became near-doctrine despite the
remarkable valor demonstrated by black regiments in the Civil War,
the Spanish-American War and World War I.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the same old stuff over and over,'' Scott said. ``They
claimed our brains were too small to assimilate the knowledge
necessary to fly. And we heard all those things. But we didn't let
them get us down. We had something to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, in a pioneering effort to disprove the War Department,
the all-black Tuskegee Institute in Alabama established an aviation
program for its students.
</P>
<P>
   It was there in 1942 that Scott fell in love with flying.
</P>
<P>
   By then, under growing pressure from the nation's black leaders,
the Army had grudgingly created a separate combat flight-training
school for black men at Tuskegee Air Field.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only such facility in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there with that first group of Tuskegee Airmen, but I
was still too young to be a cadet,'' said Scott. ``I flew civilian
planes at first. I officially joined the program in 1944.''
</P>
<P>
   Between 1942 and 1944, more than 900 Tuskegee Airmen earned
their wings. Some 450 soon flew in combat.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest graduates of the Tuskegee program were organized
into the now-famed 99th Fighter Squadron. As more graduates joined
them, they later formed four squadrons.
</P>
<P>
   In all, they flew 1,578 missions, shot down 111 German aircraft,
never lost a bomber under their protection, and won 150
Distinguished Flying Crosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Tuskegee experience broke forever the myths that allowed
segregation, inequity and injustice to exist within a thin veil of
legitimacy,'' said Air Force Gen. Ronald R. Fogleman in 1995.
 &LR; BRK:Grounded
</P>
<P>
   Scott was scheduled to earn his wings in 1944, but in a twist of
near-cosmic irony he had to withdraw from the program because he
was found to be color-blind.
</P>
<P>
   Determined to serve, however, he enlisted in the Air Corps as a
flight mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jessie Scott doesn't talk about himself, but he is a special
kind of man,'' said T. Len Nevels, a colonel in the Air Force
Reserves and a past president of the Heart of America Chapter of
the Tuskegee Airmen Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't going to let anything stop him. For every Tuskegee
pilot who got the glory, there were 10 supporting crew members on
the ground. And in my mind, Jessie represents the dedication of
those men and women and what they did to make it all possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their valor and loyalty, the Tuskegee Airmen, pilots and
ground crews alike, paid a constant price.
</P>
<P>
   ``The racism? Oh yeah, it was always there,'' said Scott. ``It
was there straight through in a hundred different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Moved from field to field, black ground crews were constantly
assigned to a ``Squadron F'' suddenly created upon their arrival.
Their squadron was always fed and billeted in segregated quarters
and denied privileges granted to other enlisted men.
</P>
<P>
   In April of 1945, at Freeman Field in Indiana, 162 black pilots
and navigators, all commissioned officers, were arrested after
defying an order barring them from the officers' club.
</P>
<P>
   Three of those men were court-martialed, 13 received letters of
reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Air Force 50 years to reverse those discriminatory
proceedings.  &LR; BRK:`We were an example'
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Scott returned to Tuskegee to continue his
education. There he joined the ROTC and rose to become commandant
of cadets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still see Jessie standing proud in front of the whole
corps of cadets,'' said Jim Wheat, who served on Scott's ROTC
staff.
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, Scott received a regular commission in the Air
Force, earned his wings as a navigator, became a maintenance
officer and made the service his career.
</P>
<P>
   Until his illness slowed him, he was one of the most active
members in the Kansas City branch of the Tuskegee Airmen's
organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to know what it all meant?'' Scott said this week.
``Let me tell you a story.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Armed Forces Day in 1957, I was at Hamilton Field in San
Rafael, California. We marched in a parade that day, marched right
through the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were marching in special formation to show the roles of
different members of a cockpit crew. I was marching as a flight
leader...''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped speaking for a moment, lay back on his pillow and
wiped his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' he said. ``I kind of break up a little when I
think about this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway we came down the street, black and white officers
together, marching strong and tall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We turned a corner and passed a group of kids, some black,
some white.
</P>
<P>
   ``And a few kids pointed at me. I could hear them saying, `Look,
look, see, he's a flier, see his wings.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Those black children saw us, saw black officers wearing wings,
and they knew what it meant. Kids don't miss these things.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were an example and those kids knew it. You could see it in
their faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Tuskegee we became the first. We made it possible for kids
like those to follow us.''

CLARENCE THOMAS CRITICIZES `DISTORTED' NOMINATION PROCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK MORRIS  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Politics and the influence of special interests groups have
warped America's system of nominating and confirming federal
judges, Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas told a meeting of
lawyers and judges Friday in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have distorted the process,'' said Thomas, whose own
nomination to the high court in 1991 was contested bitterly after
allegations of sexual harassment arose during his confirmation
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas made his remarks to the annual conference of the 8th U.S.
Judicial Circuit, a meeting of judges and lawyers who work in
federal courts in Missouri and six other Midwestern states. Thomas
oversees the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   While not directly discussing his confirmation battle, Thomas
said the process President George Bush used to make his nomination
should stand as a model for other presidents in selecting
candidates for federal judgeships.
</P>
<P>
   Describing in detail the four days between the resignation of
Justice Thurgood Marshall and his own nomination, Thomas sought to
dispel speculation that Bush had made him pass an ideological
litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Marshall announced his resignation, Thomas said,
Thomas was called to the Justice Department in Washington, D.C.,
for a session with administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was asked perfunctory questions _ and I mean perfunctory _
(such as), `Has anybody every criticized you and your wife for your
biracial marriage?'' Thomas recalled. ``I won't tell you my answer,
but it was prescient.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush soon called Thomas to Maine to ``discuss that Supreme Court
thing,'' the justice said.
</P>
<P>
   At Bush's Kennebunkport home, the president asked two questions
and made a promise before offering the post, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Can you and your family survive the confirmation?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cavalierly, I said yes,'' Thomas remembered.
</P>
<P>
   If nominated to the court, could you call them as you see them?
</P>
<P>
   ``I said yes, that's the way I live,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush then pledged never to criticize him or his decisions from
the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no questions about abortion and no questions about
judicial philosophy,'' Thomas said. ``Those questions came from the
interest groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's approach showed respect for judicial independence and the
man he was considering for the post, Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To this day, he prides himself for not getting into the
substantive issues,'' Thomas said. ``In my view, if you respect the
independence prior to the appointment, it will be respected after
the process. Our federal judiciary can only benefit from this
process.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the White House and the Senate have worked to
fill a backlog of vacant judgeships. During the last presidential
election, the White House contended Republican senators were
stalling the confirmations of federal judges on political grounds.
Senators said President Clinton was slow making nominations.
</P>
<P>
   According to recent figures, that backlog has begun to clear.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, the courts reported 98 vacant judgeships with only
25 pending nominations.
</P>
<P>
   As of July 1, however, the courts reported 69 vacancies with 40
nominations pending.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the courts have declared 23 ``judicial emergencies.''
Such emergencies are called when a judgeship in a particularly busy
courthouse remains vacant for 18 months or longer.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas, one of the most conservative members of the Supreme
Court, said judges must be able to manage criticism to sit on the
federal bench. And that's made easier by the warm relations he has
with other justices, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My colleagues, to a person, have been wonderful, wonderful
people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And, occasionally, he finds humor in the criticism. He recalled
the time a newspaper editorial writer called him the ``youngest and
the cruelest'' judge on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of like that _ youngest and cruelest,'' mused Thomas,
who is 51. ``Sounds like a soap opera. I particularly like the
youngest part.''

MORE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS MEAN FEWER CONSUMER GOODIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   My descent into America's litigious maelstrom began, unknown to
me, two summers ago with the seemingly innocuous act of buying golf
balls. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The dozen Pinnacles came with the promise of a free golf glove,
which was a great deal given the reasonable cost of the brand. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many other golfers apparently felt the same way, and the company
couldn't meet the demand for the free gloves. So, it sent along a
sleeve of three balls with apologies and an explanation that due to
circumstances beyond its control, the supply of free golf gloves
had been exhausted. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No big deal. Any golfer, regardless of skill level, can always
use some extra golf balls. The golf balls that subbed for the glove
have long since met a watery grave, and life went on. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Until Thursday. That was the day another sleeve of three
Pinnacle golf balls arrived in the mail packaged with a notice from
the Cook County, Ill., Circuit Court explaining the details of a
class-action lawsuit involving the golf ball company and the suit's
proposed settlement. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The fine print offered a textbook case of how some Americans
have no qualms about abusing the legal system for fun and profit.
Inferring from the notice's particulars, it seems a couple of guys
weren't satisfied with golf balls in lieu of golf gloves. So they
apparently hired a lawyer to sue the Acushnet Co. for violating
Illinois consumer fraud laws. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The defendant denies all allegations of wrongdoing, but
``considers it desirable to enter into the settlement to avoid the
considerable expense and distraction of burdensome and protracted
litigation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Loosely translated, the company is willing to pay a reasonable
amount of blackmail to get some litigious pests off its back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What's the proposed settlement? It appears the lawyer will get
$100,000 if the court approves, and the named wisenheimers who
pushed the suit will get $2,500 apiece ``for their efforts in
litigating the case on behalf of the clients.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else apparently gets that extra sleeve of golf balls
that came with the court notice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those such as myself who don't want to be included in the class
must go to the trouble of informing the court, which is hardly
worth the hassle or the postage costs involved. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This hardly is a triumph for consumer rights or interests. The
cost of the litigation to Acushnet isn't likely to raise the price
of its golf balls because of the highly competitive nature of the
golf ball market. Then again, it's unlikely Acushnet will be
dimwitted enough to undertake another marketing initiative offering
free goodies with the purchase of its products. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Acushnet's unfortunate experience won't be lost on
other equipment producers, which means golfers can expect fewer
promotions that benefit them. Meantime, the taxpayers are footing
the costs involved in the use of county court to pursue this
exercise in wretched litigious excess. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A generation ago, this sort of tomfoolery would have been
laughed out of any bar in which it was hatched. Now it passes for
acceptable, if not respectable, behavior, which truly is
depressing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So, tell 'em in Chicago, as Casey Stengel once put it, to
include me out. &QL;

A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY ABOUT Y2K APPEARS TO BE EMERGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID HAYES and FINN BULLERS  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Y2K followers are concerned that the country is being lulled
into a false sense of security because there haven't been any
high-profile, high-impact Millennium Bug failures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the false sense of security theme would be a tough sell if
you live in New Berlin, Wis., are a passenger with Air France, a
business owner in Ohio or a widow in Japan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In New Berlin, residents were left without water this week after
a new computer system designed to sidestep Y2K problems
malfunctioned. Two main water tanks drained when computers failed
to activate pumps to fill them. Residents had to ration their
water. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the same day that the Air Transport Association of America
said 95 percent of its work was done, Air France stranded 4,000
pieces of luggage at Paris' Charles de Gaulle Airport. The culprit?
An unsuccessful attempt to upgrade the airport's baggage computer
system to squash the bug. Some travelers were luggage-less for two
days. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Ohio, a new $7 million computer system in the secretary of
state's business office has so many bugs it will never run
smoothly, the Cleveland Plain Dealer reports. New corporate filings
that once took two weeks now take two months. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And in Tokyo, stress from dealing with Y2K drove a 40-year-old
man to commit suicide, his wife said. The man routinely put in
15-hour days at the Osaka steel sales company, where he was in
charge of computer software, she said in a court filing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The man was ordered to ensure that more than 600 pieces of
software would be bug-free. The work did not go well, and he would
come home late and tell his wife ``I want to die,'' the Kyodo news
agency reported. He jumped to his death from their apartment
building in February 1998. She is seeking compensation. &QL; 
 &QL; 
xxx By the end of August, the new computer or bundle of software
you purchase at Office Depot will come with a warning: Equipment
may not be Y2K-compliant. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated when store clerks would not tell him whether their
products were Year 2000-ready, Tom Johnson, a Concord, Calif., swim
coach, filed suit last January against Office Depot of Delray
Beach, Fla., and six other retailers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleged Circuit City, Fry's Electronics, The Good Guys,
CompUSA, Staples, OfficeMax and Office Depot violated California's
Unfair Competition Law by not reporting whether merchandise would
work after Dec. 31. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Many consumers believe that the Y2K problem will only affect
older products and mainframe computers or large corporate
networks,'' said Johnson's lawyer, Rich Ergo. ``But many products
sold today are not compliant.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The suit is the first to single out retailers. Up to now, most
lawsuits have gone after big software manufacturers for allegedly
selling bug-ridden merchandise. Judges have rejected most of those
claims because no consumer has been damaged. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Court-required settlement talks with the six other companies
will begin Thursday. &QL; 
 &QL; 
xxx
</P>
<P>
   Computers that control radiation leaks at all 103 U.S. nuclear
power plants, including Wolf Creek Nuclear Operating Corp. in
Kansas, have been given a bug-free stamp of approval, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said this week. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But 35 of the country's nuclear plants still have work that must
be done to fix computers that control power generation or do
administrative work, according to July 1 reports filed by utility
officials. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission says none of those systems
affect a plant's ability to shut down safely. But if they're not
fixed by the end of September, the commission could force plant
shutdowns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Utilities powered by coal and natural gas will be scrutinized in
a readiness report to the U.S. Energy Department on July 29. &QL; 
 &QL; 
xxx
</P>
<P>
   America's largest companies are falling behind on their Year
2000 timetables, according to one leading Y2K consulting firm. At
the same time, they are more likely to organize Y2K crisis
management centers than they were six months ago. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of the country's major corporations had
expected to have half of their fixes ready by last Jan. 1. But the
current tracking poll issued by Cap Gemini America shows only 55
percent reached that goal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With efforts going more slowly than expected, Cap Gemini now
says 85 percent of the country's biggest firms plan to build crisis
centers, more than double the 40 percent planning such facilities
in December. &QL; 
 &QL; 
xxx Although nearly three-fourths of the nation's counties have
adopted plans to address Y2K, a new survey by the National
Association of Counties shows nearly 60 percent say they have no
backup strategy if those plans go awry on Dec. 31. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the 500 counties surveyed, 368 had made Y2K plans. Those
counties represent 37.2 million people, or 92 percent of the
population represented by survey participants. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some 58 percent of the counties surveyed by phone in May and
June said they have not prepared a Y2K backup plan, and 4 percent
said they're not sure they will. Nearly half said they were not
planning a countywide Y2K test. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County is planning a drill Oct. 13. Shawnee County is
planning one this month and Douglas County held a drill June 22. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Counties responding to the survey said they'll spend $225
million to bash the bug. Based on that figure, all counties in the
country are estimated to spend $1.53 billion on Y2K fixes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
xxx
</P>
<P>
   -- In a sign of things to come, First National Bank of Olathe is
going public in customer billing inserts to say ``we're ready for
the new millennium.'' An independent audit confirms bank readiness
tests, the insert states. &QL;

<P>
   -- In July, 18 states, including Kansas and Missouri, will hold
``Y2K Community Conversations'' sponsored by the President's
Council on Year 2000 Conversion. To hold a session in your

   LOS ANGELES _ In what is believed to be the largest award ever
in a personal-injury lawsuit &UR;  &LR; against an automaker, General Motors
Corp. was ordered Friday to pay $4.9 billion to six people severely
burned when the fuel tank of their 1979 Chevrolet Malibu exploded
after a rear-end collision.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict was reached by a 12-person jury in state court here
after a 10-week trial in which the accident victims had produced
some evidence purporting to show that General Motors had known the
car's design was unsafe but had not changed it because of the cost.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict, which included $107.6 million in compensatory
damages and $4.8 billion in punitive damages, is likely to raise
questions once again about whether jury verdicts in personal-injury
and product-liability cases have got out of hand. (The largest
award in any personal-injury case may have been the $5 billion a
jury in Kansas City, Mo., ordered a serial killer to pay in 1992.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an enormous, incredible windfall to whoever gets it,''
said Greg Keating, a law professor at the University of Southern
California, of the G.M. verdict. He could not recall another award
of that size. ``It turns the court system into a lottery.''
</P>
<P>
   But Keating, who said he is not a big critic of current court
procedures, said it was highly likely the verdict would be reduced
on appeal or that the parties would settle for a lesser amount. ``I
think it's true that the chance of this verdict surviving is almost
nonexistent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But if the verdict were to stand, it would be a significant
burden for GM, which reported earnings of $3 billion from
continuing operations in 1998. Brian J. Panish, the lawyer for the
plaintiffs, said there are 30 to 60 other lawsuits involving
fuel-tank fires of the Malibu and other General Motors so-called
A-body cars, including the Pontiac Grand Am, the Oldsmobile Cutlass
and the Chevrolet Monte Carlo, which have a similar fuel-tank
design. Last year, a jury in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., awarded a
family $60 million after an accident in which the fuel tank of a
Cutlass exploded, killing two people and burning four others.
 &UR;  &LR; Patricia Anderson, her four children and a family friend, Jo
Tigner, were driving home from church in Los Angeles on Christmas
Eve in 1993 when she slowed to stop at a red light and a drunken
driver plowed into their car from behind at what the plaintiffs'
lawyers said was 50 miles per hour and General Motors says was 70
miles per hour. The people in the Malibu suffered severe burns.
Mrs. Anderson's daughter Alisha Parker, now 11, was horribly
disfigured on her face and lost her right hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The jurors wanted to send a message to General Motors that
human life is more important than profits,'' Panish, the lawyers
for the accident victims, said.
</P>
<P>
   Panish said that the gas tank on the 1979 Malibu was only 11
inches from the rear bumper while in some prior year models it had
been more than 20 inches away. He said the testimony presented
during the trial showed that it would have cost General Motors
$8.59 per vehicle for a safer design but that the company had
decided it would be cheaper to settle any lawsuits that arose.
</P>
<P>
   One key piece of evidence, he said, was a memo written by an
Oldsmobile engineer named Edward Ivey in 1973 in which he estimated
that fuel tank fires were costing General Motors only $2.40 per
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors, in a statement, maintained that the car's fuel
tank was safe and met or exceeded federal standards. ``This
extremely severe crash was caused by a single factor _ drunken
driving,'' the company said. It said it would appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Richard W. Shapiro, a Phoenix attorney who represented the
automaker, said the verdict was ``shocking'' and noted that the
jury had not been allowed to hear evidence that the driver of the
other car was drunk and went to jail. He also said the company had
been barred by the judge. Ernest G. Williams of Los Angeles County
Superior Court, from presenting evidence showing the safety history
of the vehicle and also from presenting crash-test data showing
that the car's design was safer than the one the plaintiffs
advocated.
</P>
<P>
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has conducted
two safety investigations into the Malibu since the 1970s but
neither involved the fuel system, said Timothy Hurd, a spokesman
for the agency. He said the agency had recently notified automakers
that it was reviewing whether to tighten its rules on protecting
fuel systems but that this was unrelated to the Los Angeles case.
</P>
<P>
   But Joan B. Claybrook, who was the administrator of the highway
safety administration during the Carter administration, said Friday
that big verdicts in personal injury lawsuits were sometimes the
first signal to regulators that a safety problem existed. ``Could
this car be a problem and NHTSA. not know about it?'' asked Ms.
Claybrook, who is now president of Public Citizen, a consumer
advocacy group. ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Claybrook said she first learned of problems with Ford
Pinto's gas tank and ordered a federal investigation after a $128
million personal injury verdict in 1978. That award, and another
big one involving the Pinto fuel tank, was subsequently reduced
substantially. But the Pinto was later recalled because of the fuel
tank problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Hoar, an adviser to plaintiffs' lawyers in many lawsuits
against auto companies, including this case, said the verdict was
the largest ever in a personal injury case. He said the plaintiffs
might have been particularly successful because they presented
evidence that General Motors had lobbied in the early 1970s against
tougher standards for protecting fuel systems in crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers said that the size and wealth of General Motors,
the nation's largest company, were taken into account by the jurors
in deciding on the size of the punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors told reporters that that they felt the company had valued
human life too lightly. ``We're just like numbers I feel to them,
statistics,'' one juror, Carl Vangelisti, told Reuters. ``That's
something that is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anderson, the plaintiff said, ``I'm just glad that justice
was done.'' She said she was relieved, too, that the court decided
that General Motors was at fault. ``I have always blamed myself for
this,'' she said ``I couldn't give my children an explanation'' for
what happened to them.

WITH RUNNERS ON BASE, PIAZZA SWINGS LIKE A HERO AND BRINGS THEM
HOME  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A year has passed and much has changed since Mike
Piazza's first summer at Shea Stadium. Now, after signing a
seven-year deal with the Mets last fall, Piazza is no longer viewed
as a mercenary. He no longer hears the boos at home, at least not
as regularly or as loud.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing was very much the same coming into last night's
game with the Yankees: Piazza was again struggling at the plate
with men on base. For nearly three weeks, he had been struggling at
the plate, period.
</P>
<P>
   With one sixth-inning swing Friday night, however, Piazza was
able to wash away the bad taste of his season-long futility with
runners in scoring position. Piazza was 7 for his last 48 (.146) in
such situations when he stepped to the plate against Roger Clemens
with runners on first and second in a taut 2-2 ballgame. Clemens
fell behind Piazza in the count, 2 and 1. Clemens threw a slider.
Piazza looked like he knew it was coming.
</P>
<P>
   In an instant, the ball was on a line for the bleachers in left
field. The crowd of 53,820 went wild. Piazza had his 18th home run
of the season, the biggest hit of the evening, and the Mets had a
three-run lead that would hold till the end.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who was summoned for a curtain call, later legged out a
seventh-inning infield hit to finish 2 for 4 and raise his average
three points to .307.
</P>
<P>
   It was a welcome bit of heroics for Piazza. Before he hit the
home run, his frustration had been mounting. That much was evident
in the first inning when Piazza flung his bat toward the Yankees
dugout after he had grounded to short for an inning-ending double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Since rattling off a career-high 24-game hitting streak, Piazza
had entered this weekend's three-game series at Shea with only
eight hits in his last 42 times at bat (.190), and since June 23
had only one home run and five runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   The all-star catcher's numbers for the season were still
respectable: a .304 average, 17 homers, 49 runs batted in. But
Piazza was batting just .222 with runners in scoring position on
the year. With no one on base, Piazza was hitting .336. With men
on, Piazza was hitting .280. He was also struggling in games termed
close and late _ an esoteric statistic defined as a game in the
seventh inning or later in which the batting team is either leading
by one run, tied or has the potential tying run on base, at bat or
on deck. In those situations this season, Piazza is hitting .200.
</P>
<P>
   No one seemed very worried. Piazza went on a tear last August
and September, and all but carried the club offensively as it made
a run at the postseason. The Mets are expecting him to do the same
this season. Piazza finished 1998 with a .291 average with runners
in scoring position. His lifetime average with runners in scoring
position when the season began was .336.
</P>
<P>
   But as long as Piazza continued to struggle, there was always
the danger that the scowl that seemed etched into his face for much
of last summer might become a fixture at the plate again.
</P>
<P>
   That is because no one is harder on Piazza than Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike has real high expectations,'' Valentine said before
Friday night's game. ``Every at-bat seems like its either the first
or last at-bat of his career. I think he's just a little bit at a
loss right now. When a hitter doesn't feel good about his stroke,
it's like being in a rain forest without an umbrella. It's not a
real comfortable feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   For right now, at least, Piazza insists that he is fine, and
feeling at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, there was a lot of uncertainty in my situation,''
Piazza, who was traded twice, said before the game. ``That's
probably why there was some negative sentiment. A lot of people
probably thought I was going to be here for a short time only. But
I'm here. I chose to be here. The team chose for me to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a part of this organization, I'm a part of this team, and
I'm a part of this city now. That doesn't mean I'm exempt from any
criticism. And in this city, there is an edge to everything. But I
don't shy away from that.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't thrive on the negativity that goes along with playing
in New York either, though. But he can't help being critical of
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always feel like I should be playing better,'' said Piazza,
who has either been elected or selected to the National League
All-Star team in each of his seven seasons. ``But your are
undoubtedly going to go through ups and downs. As a player, you
have to try to stay off that roller-coaster. But it's not that easy
to do. Sometimes here everything seems like a season in itself. I'm
not shying away from that. I just know that's the way it is h%re.
You just have to realize there are times for atonement.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Friday night.

JURY ORDERS GM TO PAY DAMAGES TO BURN VICTIMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV AND BETH BARRETT  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- A Los Angeles jury awarded $4.9 billion to six
people Friday who were badly burned when the fuel tank of their
Chevrolet Malibu exploded Christmas Eve 1993 after a drunk driver
rear-ended them.
</P>
<P>
   The jury found General Motors Corp. knowingly failed to recall
and fix the car's fuel tank. It is believed to be the largest
product liability-personal injury verdict ever.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Anderson, one of the victims, said she was stunned by
the unanimous decision. Fighting for the right words, she said it
was almost impossible to believe the nightmare that meant more than
100 surgeries for two of her young daughters had been concluded in
such a dramatic courtroom fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't imagine this,'' she said, her hands clasped in her
lap, adding she felt blessed beyond her wildest dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, a Los Angeles homemaker, has struggled financially in
the aftermath of the crash, which occurred as she drove home from a
South Los Angeles church service with her four children and a
friend.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict has broad legal implications for GM, the victims and
for those who predict it will become the centerpiece case in the
debate over California tort reform.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors attorney Richard Shapiro said the company did
nothing wrong and will appeal the verdict, which comprised $107
million in compensatory damages and $4.8 billion in punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   The award will almost certainly be reduced either by a judge or
as a result of a settlement agreement, legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Jury foreman Coleman Thornton said every juror believed GM had
for ``years and years'' engaged in a cover-up of the fuel tank's
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
   Thornton said the jury wanted to ``send a message'' to GM.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figured that if they had no respect for the lives of people
in their cars, they should be held liable for it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro said jurors did not properly weigh exculpatory evidence
produced by GM and were also barred from hearing additional
evidence favorable to the company by Superior Court Judge Ernest
George Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Motors is sorry for the plaintiffs, but they were the
innocent victims of a drunk driver,'' said Shapiro, with the firm
Snell &AMP; Wilmer of Phoenix. ``The jurors couldn't see beyond their
natural sympathies.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it would have cost $8.59 to fix each car's tank, but
only an estimated $2.20 per auto for possible legal settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``General Motors knew they had a problem,'' Panish said. ``They
knew the gas tank was only 11 inches from the rear and could result
in an explosion. But for the $8.59 it would cost to fix it, they
decided to leave it as it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is about putting profits ahead of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro denied that any such cost-benefit analysis played a part
in GM's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is absolutely not true,'' he said. ``There was no value
analysis used in any design decision.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the documents in question, he said, was authorized by a
``junior engineer'' but was never distributed and had nothing to do
with any of the manufacturing or other decisions made regarding the
Malibu.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the document trail as more complicated than it was
portrayed by the plaintiffs, Shapiro said his case was weakened
because he wasn't allowed to tell jurors the driver of the other
car was drunk, or to introduce test results showing the Malibu
performing well in crash tests.
</P>
<P>
   The driver of the other vehicle, Daniel Moreno, then 28, of Los
Angeles, was sentenced to four years in prison for felony drunk
driving, according to Los Angeles District Attorney's Office
records.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he was going about 70 miles per hour and was
drunk is important,'' Shapiro said.
</P>
<P>
   Panish said the issue was the gas tank -- not the inebriation of
the driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defective gas tanks don't discriminate between drunk and sober
drivers,'' he said, adding that the majority of the injuries were
burn-related and that, had the car not ignited, ``there would have
been only one child with a broken leg.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of Anderson's daughters, Kiontra, now 15, and Alisha, now
11, had numerous surgeries, Panish said. Anderson's other daughter,
Kionna, now 13, and a son, Ty-shon, had less serious injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Family friend Jo Tigner also was burned on the legs.
</P>
<P>
   The case immediately drew reactions in legal circles and among
consumer groups throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., where Ralph Nader's Public Citizen won the
Ford Pinto fuel tank case in 1977, the group's president, Joan
Claybrook, said the jury used the only method available to relay
its anger to the company -- a huge award.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were extremely outraged,'' Claybrook said. ``They wanted
to send a message to the company that this is unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Claybrook also said the award would most likely be reduced. In
the Ford case, a jury's $125 million punitive award was eventually
reduced by a judge to $3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she said large punitive awards play an important role,
``in a jury asserting community values over corporate values.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side is that the case may become ``exhibit A'' for
those who insist the state's tort system is out of control, said
Stephen Barnett, professor of law at the University of California
at Berkeley's Boalt Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the last thing the California Trial Lawyers
would like to see,'' he said. ``Politically it may have a
significant impact on tort law, in favor of those who say juries
are running amok.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnett said he doubted GM's stock price would dip as a result
of the verdict. The market closed Friday before the award was
announced.
</P>
<P>
   Added Anthony Bell, a Studio City resident and executive
director of Citizens Against Lawsuit Abuse, ``From what I know,
this is an unconscionable amount of punitive damages given to an
attorney who sees a deep pocket and is using emotion to get this
outrageous verdict.''
</P>
<P>
   For Alisha Anderson, whose leathery scars linger as testimony to
the burns she suffered over nearly half her body, the verdict and
sense of vindication were something to finally smile about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't about the money,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Two nationally known black legal scholars
were separated by more than a generation but connected by a shared
view of the world. One died last winter. Now the other, in a final
tribute that is something like one man completing another's last
sentence, is finishing his friend's incomplete books and articles.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership offers a picture of one strand of modern black
legal thought. It also shows the intellectual ties forged by two
men with similar stories of personal achievement against enormous
odds.
</P>
<P>
   One of the men, the Harvard Law School professor Charles J.
Ogletree Jr., 46, is heir to a tradition of black participation in
the highest echelons of the legal system. The other, the retired
federal appeals court judge A. Leon Higginbotham Jr., who was a
legal scholar here at Harvard, was a trailblazer of that tradition
before he died at 70 in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``Judge Higginbotham is like a father figure to me,'' Ogletree
said in his office at the law school, speaking of his friend in the
present tense seven months after his death. ``I love the man and
have enormous respect for what he accomplished. I would do whatever
he asked to complete his work.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, Higginbotham died suddenly of a stroke and did
not have a chance to ask anyone to complete several projects,
including a critique of Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Ogletree has taken up the assignment, with the enthusiastic
support of Higginbotham's widow, promising to deliver the final
published works in the voice of the man who often used his own life
story as parable for both the barriers and possibilities for
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Higginbotham, the son of a laborer and a maid who grew up
in the poverty of Trenton, contended with bigotry and segregation
and became one of the country's top judges as the chief of the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, in Philadelphia. After he
retired from the court in 1993, he taught at Harvard, wrote and
served as a director of The New York Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   In a friendship spanning decades, Higginbotham and Ogletree
agreed that assaults on affirmative action and civil rights
generally had become central challenges for the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his life Higginbotham attracted wide notice with a
rare public attack on Thomas. Thomas' ``retrogressive record'' on
the Supreme Court, Higginbotham said, was helping roll back the
progress of blacks.
</P>
<P>
   In a long interview over a lunch that he never touched and in
unfinished manuscripts he provided, Ogletree made it clear that the
final works of Higginbotham would continue the theme.
</P>
<P>
   A speech by the judge that Ogletree is reworking into a law
review article said, ``Justice Thomas has done more to turn back
the clock of racial progress than has any other African-American
public official in the history of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogletree, who represented Anita Hill in Thomas' confirmation
hearings, said neither he nor Higginbotham should be thought of
solely for their work as critics of Thomas. The judge and the
professor have both taught and written broadly on the legal system
and civil rights. But for legal scholars like himself, Ogletree
said, Higginbotham's critique of Thomas has become a focal point
for deep concerns about the legal system.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Ogletree said, his preparation of
Higginbotham's final observations about Thomas is especially
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is one of a small number of people,'' Ogletree said of his
friend, ``who were so successful that he did not have to incur the
headache of getting involved in the civil rights movement, and yet
he chose this as his life's work.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It is such a contrast to Clarence Thomas, who has benefited
from the civil rights movement and has been hostile to it,'' the
professor continued. ``Judge Higginbotham thought it was important
to let the general public know that it is not necessary to stab the
people in the back after you have achieved your successes.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Arberg, the Supreme Court spokeswoman, said Thomas had no
comment. Thomas' supporters have said attacks on the justice are
the height of hypocrisy because they suggest that no black judge
could reach his conservative views in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, as Higginbotham's criticisms were widely
circulated, Thomas called criticism of him ``bilious and venomous
assaults'' and said he refused to have ``ideas assigned to me as
though I was an intellectual slave because I am black.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogletree said Thomas' appointment to the court had divided black
intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very concerned,'' Ogletree said of Thomas, ``about the
trend that he has been part of to not only re-examine but curtail
the progress of the last four decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogletree said he and Higginbotham occasionally talked about
similarities in their pasts. Ogletree, the son of a laborer in
agricultural Merced, Calif., was the first in his family to
graduate from high school. He also graduated from Stanford
University and Harvard Law School, where, as a student two decades
ago, he first heard a speech by an inspiring judge named Leon
Higginbotham.
</P>
<P>
   Ogletree said the two men sometimes talked about how far each
had come in overcoming the obstacles to black success in the United
States. The judge, Ogletree said, always said success like his was
owing in large measure to the people who had helped him before
anyone had thought of programs called affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is something that resonates with me,'' Ogletree said. ``I
will never forget the people who pulled me up.''

HEAT WAVE TOLL CLIMBS TO 27 DEAD IN NEW YORK CITY

   NEW YORK _ The number of deaths directly tied to the record heat
in New York City this week had risen to 27 through Thursday, a
spokeswoman for the city medical examiner's office said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The spokeswoman, Ellen Borakove, said the ages of the victims
ranged from 27 to 102.
</P>
<P>
   While the death count was small compared with the toll from a
1995 heat wave in Chicago that killed more than 500 people, the
heat wave was still one of the deadliest weather events here in
recent years, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Hauer, the director of the mayor's Office of Emergency
Management, said that most of those who died were elderly, and that
his office was reviewing the cases to understand how the heat
killed people and to find ways to avert such deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it's difficult to accept any deaths, we feel that the
city did all it could,'' Hauer said. ``But we're going to continue
to review each of the deaths to see what happened, to see if
there's something we could have done differently.''
</P>
<P>
   There appeared to be no clear link between the deaths and the
blackouts in upper Manhattan or on the Lower East Side, officials
said. The deaths in Manhattan were reported at hospitals throughout
the borough and by widely dispersed emergency workers. No deaths
were recorded at New York Presbyterian Hospital, the closest large
hospital to the area north of 155th Street where the most prolonged
power failures occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, 13 of the he!t-related deaths occurred in Manhattan,
12 were in Brooklyn, and two were in Queens, Ms. Borakove said.
</P>
<P>
   Hauer said the deaths illustrated the importance of keeping
track of those who are vulnerable, including elderly and
handicapped people who might not be able to leave their apartments.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the reasons we encourage New Yorkers in these
crises to check on their elderly neighbors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The deadliest heat wave recorded in New York City occurred in
July 1936, when the temperature in Central Park hit an all-time
high of 106 degrees and 76 deaths were attributed to the heat. But
21 of the deaths were from drowning, as those who could not swim
jumped into the rivers to cool off.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In 1995, when Chicago suffered its worst heat wave, 17 New York
City residents died of heat-related causes between July 17 and 31.
</P>
<P>
   When blazing heat lasts more than a couple of days, many older
buildings absorb and store solar energy and can bake for several
days after the weather breaks, according to federal studies
initiated after the 1995 heat wave in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the temperature in rooms on high floors in old masonry or
stone buildings without ceiling insulation exceeds the temperature
outside, said Dr. Evan Mills, a scientist at the Lawrence Berkeley
National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif. He used computer models to
study how heat affects buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The heat lingers most dangerously in older, uninsulated brick
and stone buildings in poor urban neighborhoods, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, city residents tend to suffer more because asphalt
and concrete in streets and other structures absorb heat and send
temperatures many degrees higher than in the suburbs, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put all that together with poor communities who don't have
air-conditioning and you've got a problem,'' Mills said.

TRUMP IS PLANNING TO DEMOLISH ONE CASINO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Donald J. Trump plans to demolish his World's Fair casino in
Atlantic City around the end of the year and may build a
4,000-room, $750 million gambling complex in its place, officials
of his development company said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Trump, who also owns the Trump Taj Mahal and the Trump Marina in
Atlantic City, has owned the casino property since 1989, when it
was run as a nongambling hotel called the Trump Regency, said
Nicholas L. Ribis, president of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling tables were added to the site in 1996, when the
building underwent a $48 million renovation and was reopened as the
World's Fair.
</P>
<P>
   Although the 21-story building has a long history in Atlantic
City, having originally been built as a Playboy casino, it has
struggled in recent years, routinely losing money, Ribis said. The
casino will be closed later this year in preparation for the
demolition, which is likely to cost between $3 million and $5
million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When the building comes down, it will leave Trump in possession
of a 15-acre site that is the largest undeveloped site on the
boardwalk, Ribis said. He added that the site is particularly
valuable because it is adjacent to Atlantic City's brand-new
Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Once the old casino comes down, Trump will decide whether to
open a new casino with a partner, sell the land or build his own
casino on the site, Ribis said.
</P>
<P>
   Construction could begin as early as 2001, he said.

THOMAS HARNETT, CAREY CABINET OFFICIAL, DIES AT 75  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Me., Conn., Canada, Pa. Va.)   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Aquinas Harnett, a lawyer specializing in insurance who
was superintendent of the State Insurance Department in the 1970s,
died on Wednesday at his home in Ridgefield, Conn. He was 75 and
had formerly lived in Manhattan and Suffern, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cardiac arrest, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Harnett retired last year from the Manhattan firm of Lane &AMP;
Mittendorf and became a founding partner of Gallagher, Harnett &AMP;
Lagalante, also in Manhattan. There he continued to deal with
commercial litigation, and with insurance regulations pending
before governmental bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Hugh L. Carey named him state superintendent of insurance,
a cabinet-level position, in June 1975. Harnett resigned after two
years to return to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   A native of the Bronx, he graduated from Fordham University
School of Education with a teacher's certificate in 1943 and
received his law degree from Fordham in 1949. In World War II, he
served with the Army Air Force in the Pacific and was awarded the
Air Medal.
</P>
<P>
   He taught product liability law as an adjunct professor at
Fordham University School of Law and had been a director of the New
York State Urban Development Corp. and a regent of the University
of Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Harnett is survived by his wife of 48 years, Doris Van Dien
Harnett; two daughters, Doris A. Harnett of Dixmont, Me., and
Kathleen H. Linger of Fairfield, Conn.; two sons, Thomas A., of
Gardiner, Me., and William A., of Toronto; two brothers, William,
of Bryn Mawr, Pa., and John, of Virginia, and four grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: THE HIGH COST OF LONG ISLAND POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 10:
</P>
<P>
   Creating a fiscal crisis in a prosperous suburban county during
one of the biggest economic booms in American history takes some
doing, but the Nassau County executive, Thomas Gulotta, has pulled
it off. The county ended 1998 with a deficit of nearly $200
million, and is wrestling with another big projected gap this year.
Its ridiculous property tax assessment system, which has turned
challenging assessments into a local industry, is costing the
county more than $100 million a year in refunds. In the latest
blow, Standard &AMP; Poor's has announced that it is reducing the
rating of the county's bonds to BBB _ near junk status.
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta has relied on costly short-term borrowing to pay the
bills, while inventing increasingly outlandish ploys to paper over
a budget that is structurally out of balance. Earlier this year the
county got a $70 million infusion of cash from the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority in return for accepting $240 million in
long-term MTA debt. Next, Gulotta hopes to borrow against
anticipated future gains from the county's share of a national
tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-control labor costs, particularly in the police
department, are one of the main causes of the county's problems.
More than half of last year's deficit was due to cost overruns in
police salaries and benefits. The county must also reform its
assessment system, under which homes are assessed on the basis of
1938 construction costs and 1964 land costs.
</P>
<P>
   The system is impossible to administer, one of the reasons the
county winds up owing so much to homeowners for refunds from
assessment appeals. Astonishingly, the county sells bonds to pay
for those refunds, and its long-term debt has now ballooned to
almost $2.7 billion. The assessment system has been decried by
everyone from the county business community to the Justice
Department, which says it discriminates against minority
neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Like New York City in the 1970s, Nassau County is being run by a
one-party political system that has become brain-dead from lack of
new blood. In this case, it is the Republican Party that has run
the government into the ground by spending money it did not have to
keep political allies happy. The Republicans do not seem capable of
reforming themselves and the Democrats do not appear to have the
capacity to challenge them. The only answer may be an outside
arbiter to put a spine in its fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
   The county could get some breathing time if the state
Legislature approves a plan to raise the tax on property transfers.
But the Democratic-dominated state Assembly is demanding a price _
giving the state comptroller, Carl McCall, authority to oversee the
county's fiscal practices. Republicans are unhappy with the idea of
giving this power to a Democrat. But McCall's office has the
expertise to do the job, and his duties would only entail forcing
officials to do what they should be doing already _ engaging in
long-term financial planning and keeping spending within the bounds
of county income.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: MEXICO'S FEW REAL VOTERS FINALLY SPEAK OUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By TINA ROSENBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since 1940, Mexico's presidents have been chosen by an
electorate of one. Each president picked the next nominee of the
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, and each nominee won
handily against largely token opposition, by fraud when necessary.
President Ernesto Zedillo has declared he will be the last
beneficiary of the ``dedazo,'' or the pointing of the finger.
Instead the PRI will have a national primary in November to choose
its candidate for the general election in July 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The primary is the system least susceptible to presidential
manipulation _ yet few doubt that it will ratify the candidate
widely believed to be Zedillo's favorite, Francisco Labastida
Ochoa. As has been the case with other PRI reforms, the question is
whether they will just cover up the continuation of authoritarian
habits.
</P>
<P>
   The need to reform the dedazo is clearer than ever to most
Mexicans since the publication of ``La Herencia'' _ the legacy _ by
the political scientist Jorge Castaneda, which will be published in
English next year. The book consists of long interviews Castaneda
conducted with all four living former presidents, as well as an
analysis that relies heavily on his conversations with dozens of
politicians who never made it to the top. It has quickly become
Mexico's best-selling political book ever.
</P>
<P>
   While it was clear to everyone in Mexico that each president
made his decision alone _ and later staged huge PRI rallies
supposedly demanding the nomination of the favorite _ the book
marks the first time the presidents have publicly said so. The book
portrays a system of serial despotism, where candidates win
near-absolute power not by wooing the public or defending their
policies in the media, but simply by fawning over the boss. It is
unlikely that any cabinet official who dreams he has a chance at
the nomination ever brought a president information that he did not
want to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda argues that the dedazo gave Mexico valuable stability
at a high political and economic cost. President Luis Echeverria,
for example, was determined to name his boyhood friend Jose Lopez
Portillo as his successor in the 1976 elections. To give Lopez
Portillo credibility and financial experience, Echeverria made him
his treasury minister. But this meant that Mexico could not carry
out a necessary devaluation of the currency or needed tax reforms,
both of which would have made Lopez Portillo unpopular. The result
was economic disaster _ Mexico's external debt tripled by the end
of Echeverria's term.
</P>
<P>
   Castaneda presents evidence that in 1981, the budget minister,
Miguel de la Madrid, hid the country's true fiscal deficit until
after Lopez Portillo had chosen him as the candidate, delaying a
needed devaluation of the peso. Some argue that de la Madrid was
himself deceived by the budget staff _ headed by Carlos Salinas,
whom he would name as Mexico's next president.
</P>
<P>
   Public officials all over the world hide bad news. But in
democracies, they are at least open to questioning by the press and
electorate. This is increasingly the case under the presidency of
Zedillo. The PRI has stopped stuffing ballot boxes. The opposition
governs in nine of 31 states and in Mexico City, and holds the
mayoralties of most big cities. The party is somewhat more
independent of the president's wishes. Mexico's press, moreover,
has grown more independent and assertive.
</P>
<P>
   But authoritarian practices persist. The gubernatorial election
on July 4 in the state of Mexico, the country's most populous,
featured widespread reports of PRI vote-buying and other kinds of
coercion. Two years ago, after the PRI lost control of the lower
house of Congress, its members attempted a boycott. Zedillo has
appointed the last two party leaders, after promising he would not.
Today as in the past, the PRI machine is rallying around the man
officials believe to be the president's candidate ( Zedillo denies
he has one), with the same ``spontaneous'' rallies by labor and the
party rank and file as in days of old. There will be a primary, but
Labastida's two main opponents _ both members of the PRI old guard
_ are given little chance.
</P>
<P>
   Labastida has become the front-runner without raising money or
building an organization. He is starting to, however, because the
real change in Mexico is that winning the PRI nomination no longer
guarantees the presidency. The nominee may well win if the two
opposition party candidates split the anti-PRI vote next summer.
But if one withdraws, then the PRI will have a real race. Zedillo's
record of democratizing his party has been excellent in one respect
_ the time when PRI candidates could count on a national victory
though Election Day fraud is over, probably forever. Even as
Castaneda underscores the costs of Mexico's elected dictatorship,
he has written the system's obituary. &QL;

EDITORIAL: SHOWING THE WAY ON GUN CONTROL  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, July 10:
</P>
<P>
   There are signs that Congress may yet approve some gun control
measures this year despite last month's debacle in the House that
saw Republican leaders and a powerful Democrat, John Dingell of
Michigan, conspire to kill a modest gun control package already
passed by the Senate. The House version was so weak that even
supporters of gun control voted against it.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, plainly aware of his party's
vulnerability on the gun control issue, told The Washington Post
that the issue was not dead and that he saw room for a compromise
on a key sticking point _ the National Rifle Association's demand
that the period for conducting criminal background checks on
prospective purchasers at gun shows be limited to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   That is not enough time for a thorough check, especially since
most gun shows occur over weekends, when state court files are
generally unavailable. But a 48-hour limit, which Hastert
apparently sees as the potential compromise, is also too short. If
the speaker want to convince Americans that his party supports
meaningful gun control, he and his colleagues will accept the
Senate's gun show provision, which allows up to three business days
for background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, meanwhile, are taking aggressive steps of their own
to keep guns away from children and criminals. A week ago, for
example, the highest court in Massachusetts affirmed the power oF
the state attorney general to impose safety requirements on gun
manufacturers. Precisely how far this power extends is not yet
clear. But this path-breaking use of the state's consumer
protection statute to mandate new childproofing features on all
handguns sold in Massachusetts could become a model for other
jurisdictions around the country with similar consumer laws on the
books.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the state legislature has approved a bill
designed to help close off the gun supply to the illegal market run
by unlicensed dealers on the streets by limiting handgun purchases
to one a month. Benjamin Daniel Smith, the white supremacist who
went on a deadly shooting rampage, obtained the gun he is believed
to have used from just such a dealer in Illinois after failing a
background check initiated by a licensed seller.
</P>
<P>
   California's governor, Gray Davis, has yet to say whether he
will sign the bill. But this should not be a hard decision for
Davis, who emphasized gun control in his campaign last year.
Indeed, with the Governor lending a strong push, there is also a
very good chance that the legislature will soon pass the strongest
assault-weapon ban in the country.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey came close to joining the honor roll with a bill that
would have forced gun manufacturers to install computer chips and
other ``smart gun'' technology to make guns inoperable by anyone
other than the weapon's registered owner. Unfortunately, Donald
DiFrancesco, president of the State Senate, substituted an
essentially toothless version at the last minute, letting the gun
makers off the hook.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the momentum building in Massachusetts and California is
bound to reverberate elsewhere, as it should. But its immediate
effect is to make Congress, which was not looking so great to start
with, look even worse.  &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ U.S. coach Tony DiCicco has devised plans for
upending China in today's Women's World Cup Final at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a ticket, you'll need a survival plan.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100,000 _ including WWC representatives, vendors,
workers, media and the sold-out crush of ticket-toting fans _
figures to pose logistics nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Crushing traffic, a hot weather forecast and the security
details regarding President Clinton's presence top the list.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare yourself by arriving early by shuttle, with cool
clothing, bottled water (sealed only) and plenty of sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   The championship game is slated for 12:50 p.m., preceded by the
Brazil-Norway matchup for third place at 10:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Pregame activities and a postgame celebration for fans are also
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``With media and Rose Bowl and World Cup PR people coming in and
out, I think we're going to have a pretty good flow (of people
arriving) during the first game,'' said Jim Granger of Contemporary
Services Corp., which staffs security manpower for numerous
Southland events.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than battle the crowds and gridlock, Rose Bowl general
manager Darryl Dunn proffers a gold-mine suggestion: ``Take the
shuttle.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuttles will be continuously departing from the Ralph M.
Parsons Corp. parking lot, located on the corner of Walnut Street
and Fair Oaks Avenue in Pasadena, near Old Town. The fee is $4 per
person. Otherwise, on-site parking is $10.
</P>
<P>
   ``From step-on to drop-off, I've been told it'll take 5 to 7
minutes,'' Dunne said of the limited-access trek.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Taking the shuttle), you have no problems with traffic,
losing your car in the jam-packed parking lots, getting boxed in by
the postgame activities. It's the best thing to do if you want to
avoid headaches.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit should pose less traffic problems than his
same-day decision to take in the U.S.-Germany quarterfinal match in
Washington D.C. on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're better prepared because we had advance notice,'' Dunn
said. ``We should be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Metal detectors may be implemented to gain stadium access.
That's only, of course, if you have a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   An additional 3,000 to 5,000 seats became available Tuesday when
WWC organizers made a venue walk-through and asked Rose Bowl
officials to remove tarp covering a row of seats close to the
field. They sold out in 82 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want the tarps off, we take them off,'' Dunn said.
``We're just the landlord.''
</P>
<P>
   Another walk-through was taken late Wednesday afternoon, but WWC
officials decided against opening very close seats with poor sight
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Water-misting ``cool zones'' also will be set up throughout the
stadium to help cope with any heat problems.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles-based Murray's Tickets reportedly had sold out of
choice seats, with behind-the-goal ducats commanding $135 apiece.
Ebay, an on-line auction company, was also taking skyrocketing bids
for tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Because of the hoopla,) I think people just want to be a part
of the event,'' said Steve Vanderpool, director of public relations
for WWC '99.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime event, at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not like a Rose Bowl game ... it's bigger,'' Dunn
said.

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. -- Soccermania overtook Old Town Pasadena on
Friday evening as hundreds of soccer fans converged on Colorado
Street in anticipation of today's women's World Cup championship
pitting the United States against China.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer moms, soccer dads, soccer kids and plain-old soccer fans
jammed a closed-off section of Colorado Street downtown, where they
had their faces painted with soccer balls and U.S. flags, bought
World Cup souvenirs and listened to the clashing cymbals and
pounding drums of a Chinese dragon procession.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the two men inside the yellow-and-red dragon
costume charged a Broomfield, Colo., family carrying American
flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought it was because of our U.S. flags,'' said
39-year-old Cheryl Brosz, who along with her daughter was waving a
flag when the dragon came at them. ``They think it will help them
win tomorrow, but it won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   A soccer tournament that relatively few people knew existed a
month ago has gained such legitimacy and buzz that scalpers are
asking four times face value or more for tickets. A sell-out crowd
of nearly 90,000 people is expected today for the Women's World Cup
final at the Rose Bowl stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's not 120 degrees out, it should be bedlam,'' said
Woodland Hills attorney Stu Steinberg.
</P>
<P>
   Vice president of Valley United Soccer Club's girls' program,
Steinberg is going to the Rose Bowl with a group of about 100
people, including his 13-year-old daughter, Jessie. They expect to
leave around 6:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids are just totally into this thing,'' he said of the
World Cup. ``I'm just as excited as they are.''
</P>
<P>
   The match will be broadcast to a national television audience by
ABC and will provide the American women a grand stage to display
their soccer skills and convince sponsors there is a need for a
professional league in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is wonderful for kids to have role models like
these women,'' said Dallas, Texas, mom Teri Marshalek, a lifelong
soccer player who brought her 12-year-old daughter to Pasadena and
paid $110 for tickets to see the game. ``We live in Dallas and the
Dallas Cowboys are a bunch of spoiled brats. You see them getting
busted and dying of drug overdoses.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have that with the women's teams. They work hard,
live together and are very conscious of helping young girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team of photogenic female athletes has fueled
mainstream American interest in international soccer. But the game
was already a crowd-pleaser on the West Coast, thanks to decades of
immigration from soccer-crazed Latin America and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go to any school field on a Saturday morning and there are
hundreds of kids playing soccer,'' said Palo Alto resident Steve
Levy, who bought tickets for himself and his 17-year-old daughter,
Jennifer, a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is focusing on this game, but it is just the tip of
iceberg of this phenomena. It's been building at a grass-roots
level for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those kicking soccer balls in inflatable soccer pens,
playing table soccer and feeling the booming beat of Asian drummers
Friday evening in Old Town Pasadena came from throughout the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Two Kansas City mothers left husbands behind and drove 1,700
miles with their daughters to see the game. They paid $110 a
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a brand new girls' sport that has really taken over,''
said Kansas City resident Lizzy Flanigan, 11, whose cheek was
freshly painted by a clown with an American flag as she mingled
with the crowds in Pasadena Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Lizzy was most excited about sneaking into a Pasadena hotel
where the U.S. women's team players were staying and getting a
picture taken with a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they first came out of the hotel they were screaming,''
soccer mom Colleen Flanigan said of her girls. ``That's when we
knew it was worth the 1,700-mile drive in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City resident Brittany Bolton, 11, said she saw a soccer
player walking down the hallway and asked for her autograph.
</P>
<P>
   When forward Mia Hamm got into the elevator, 9-year-old Molly
Flanigan rushed to the door to get inside, but it shut before she
had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told to get off the fifth floor by security,'' said
her mother, Victoria Bolton. ``We knew they didn't want us around
anymore. They are pretty focused right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Identical twins from Albuquerque, N.M., painted their
fingernails with American flags for the event and came dressed in
World Cup T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are really into soccer now,'' said Donna Mark. ``We wanted
to go all out for the U.S. team.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in Old Town on Friday evening said they expect the U.S.
women's team to win but agree it's not going to be easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They play good; they play smart,'' said Pasadena resident
Saloman Cravioto, 18, whose dad gave him a ticket to the game as a
high school graduation present. ``They are better players than the
men.''
</P>
<P>
   Allison Lee, the women's soccer coach at California State
University, Northridge, will be at the Rose Bowl with former
teammates from her college days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody seems to have caught on to this,'' Lee said. ``It's
very special. It means a lot to the die-hard soccer fan -- and
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing soccer since she was 5 and now in the national pool of
the Olympics training program, April Milado, 15, of Canoga Park is
thrilled at the widespread appeal women's soccer has suddenly
gained through today's game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone I know in the Valley is going,'' she said.

archipelago's budding recovery. Cinnamon, pepper, nutmeg and
cloves: an aromatic bounty sits packed in a jumble of cardboard
boxes on the floor. Outside on the patio, sandalwood chips are
piled into a mound on a table. For the last 30 years, Seah's small
family-run company, Chop Wee Kiat, has traded Indonesian spices and
fragrant woods, buying in places like Timor and Sumatra and selling

particular are eager to provide business progress reports and to
continue announcing deals. By Andy Wang.

<P>
   EURO-DOLLAR (Frankfurt, Germany) _ It was supposed to be a

after 11 European nations adopted the euro as a new single

surprised most economists, the euro has steadily declined against
the dollar from nearly $1.18 at its introduction on Jan. 4 to just
above $1.01 by the end of Friday. Global investors have begun
demanding a risk premium when buying euro-denominated bonds. By

ANGELS BEAT ROCKIES
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Make contact, and the runs will come.
</P>
<P>
   That was the Angels' theory heading into their three-game series
against the Colorado Rockies at hitter-friendly Coors Field, and
the strategy paid off in Friday night's 9-6 victory before 44,122.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Angels' third consecutive victory, and their fifth in
seven games. They had 15 hits, including four home runs, two
doubles and a triple.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contact is a big deal here,'' Angels manager Terry Collins
said before the game. ``You make contact, you get hits.''
</P>
<P>
   Troy Glaus hit two homers (Nos. 13 and 14), the first
multi-homer game of his career. Garret Anderson (No. 13) and Reggie
Williams (No. 1) also homered.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson and Randy Velarde had three hits apiece in support of
starter Chuck Finley, who was just good enough to earn his first
victory in his last seven starts, his previous win coming June 2
against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Finley (5-9) gave up five runs and eight hits in 51/3 innings,
and got relief help from Jarrod Washburn, Mark Petkovsek and Troy
Percival, who earned his 23rd save. It also was Percival's 19th
consecutive save, tying Lee Smith (1995) for the club record.
</P>
<P>
   Finley had been especially bad in his previous three starts,
allowing 21 earned runs in 112/3 innings. The problem was his
mechanics, but he said he made strides toward correcting the
problem Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was throwing straight to the plate tonight more,'' he said.
``I'm not pulling off my pitches, I'm staying with 'em longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to keep moving in that direction, I'm getting close.
I'm not there yet, but I'm definitely not moving backwards.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time Finley pitched here in 1997, he was struggling but
began a personal 14-game winning streak in a 4-1 victory (1 run in
71/3 innings).
</P>
<P>
   Friday's performance wasn't quite as good as the one two years
ago, but he'll take the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if five runs here is good or bad, he said.
``Everything hit in the air you just hold your breath. You just
don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to go through a psychiatric evaluation if you sign
with these guys and pitch in this park. I don't know how they do
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though he didn't dominate the game, he pitched good,
Collins said. ``You're going to give up four or five runs here,
that's the nature of the beast. Hopefully this gets him going.
</P>
<P>
   Finley was quick to say the offense won the game Friday, not
him. And Collins credited hitting coach Rod Carew for his advice to
the hitters in a pregame meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rod harped on it in the meeting -- don't ever think you have
enough runs, Collins said. ``Don't ever stop. I thought our
approach was good tonight. And we got some runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels took a liking to the ballpark right away, as Anderson
ripped a two-run homer and Glaus hit his first homer (estimated at
441 feet) to give the Angels a 3-0 lead in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus, who is hitting .333 (9 for 27) in July, homered again in
the seventh inning and now trails only Mo Vaughn for the team lead
in homers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be the only guy in this room who thinks he's doing
fine,'' Collins said of Glaus, who raised his average to .233.
``You guys (reporters) tried to get him sent to the minor leagues
for a couple weeks now. But he's fine. You're going to have ups and
downs, but that's the nature of the beast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, he's struggled at the plate, but if he hadn't save 150
runs with his glove I don't know where'd we be.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival hasn't blown a save opportunity since May 1. But this
one didn't come easy. Singles by Larry Walker and Vinny Castilla
brought Todd Helton to the plate representing the tying run with
two out in the ninth. Helton popped out to Darin Erstad in shallow
left to end it.

GRUDZIELANEK LIFTS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a dismal season when the Dodgers respond to
nothing for the long-term and the fans have nothing to embrace,
something finally happened to excite folks.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek drove in four runs _ three with a
second-inning homer _ and made a stellar defensive play at
shortstop as the Dodgers beat the Mariners 5-0 Friday in an
interleague contest at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It came after Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone addressed the
team for nearly 45 minutes in a closed-door meeting to deliver a
candid message: The season isn't over, the Dodgers aren't out of
it, and if you don't think you can win or you don't want to win,
you don't belong here.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Dodgers' third meeting in less than a week, which
equals the number of wins they've had during that span.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' first shutout win since May 3, buoyed by Ismael
Valdes' seven strong innings, also represents their second straight
win. That's something they hadn't done since June 25-26. They
haven't won three straight since a five-game streak April 27 to May
1.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, who spent 28 days on the disabled list, was a big
part of both wins. When he returned earlier this week in Colorado,
the difference in Grudzielanek's approach was noticeable.
</P>
<P>
   After missing five weeks with a broken right hand, the remnants
of punching a wall after hitting into a double play in Pittsburgh,
Grudzielanek has seven hits in 14 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to tell myself, `You have to have a plan when you come
back,' '' Grudzielanek said. ``Rick (Down, the Dodgers' hitting
coach) and I would go back to the batting cages, and I couldn't use
my right hand, so I had one of those small bats and I swung with
one hand. It helps you stay back, keep your bat back.''
</P>
<P>
   It worked in Colorado, where Grudzielanek went 5 for 10 after
being activated for Tuesday's game. A first-inning, three-run
double keyed Thursday's win against the Rockies. Friday, it was his
bat again that gave Valdes (7-7) an early lead an inning after the
Dodgers loaded the bases with none out but saw Todd Hundley, Raul
Mondesi and Devon White each struck out by Freddy Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they came back with a pair of base runners for
Grudzielanek, who batted leadoff for the second time this season.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, who's last homer came April 25 and spanned 121
at-bats, drove Garcia's pitch over the left-center field fence to
give the Dodgers a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at some old tapes and saw that I was hitting the ball
the other way,'' Grudzielanek said. ``They can put two fielders
over there and I'm still going to try that. That's what I did when
I had my (all-star) year (1996). If you do that, you'll be able to
turn on some pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek is expected to hit, and during the first stint of
his career on the disabled list, the Dodgers sorely missed his bat.
But defense was the problem, especially since he made 92 errors the
last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Although he spent most of the offseason working with Bucky Dent
on his defense, Grudzielanek has been OK at shortstop but rarely
made the sensational play. He did that in the fourth to save a run
for Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   With Dan Wilson on second and two outs, Brian Hunter hit a ball
into shallow left field. Grudzielanek ranged back, stretched his
glove back and made a back-hand catch before falling to the turf.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the fifth the Dodgers made it 4-0 on Craig
Counsell's RBI single to left, which scored Mondesi and
Grudzielanek added an RBI single in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes allowed seven hits, struck out four and hit two batters
in seven innings. Garcia (9-5) struck out 10, but he threw 123
pitches in five innings and allowed four runs on six hits. He also
walked four and hit two batters.

SPARKS' STREAK ENDS
</HEADLINE>

 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The Los Angeles Sparks' six-game winning
streak came to a sudden end as Sacramento beat Los Angeles 77-72 in
front of 5,436 at the Forum on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Yolanda Griffith had 24 points and 11 rebounds for the Monarchs
(10-4), who took over sole possession of second place in the
Western Division.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks, who dropped into third place at 9-5, started out
slowly and could never catch the Monarchs, who were playing their
second game in less than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just have to figure out a better way for us to get
started,'' Sparks coach Orlando Woolridge said. ``I'm going to do
something different with the lineup. I may not do it until after
the break. It may start Sunday. I have to do something to
jump-start us.''
</P>
<P>
   Seldom-used La'Kesiha Frett is starting to make a name for
herself and might get a starting role. After coming off the bench
to score a career-high 13 points in the Sparks' win at Phoenix on
Wednesday, she led a slow-starting squad with 11 first-half points
and finished with 15 points. But her valiant effort couldn't revive
the Sparks, who played catch-up to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks trailed 44-36 at the half and fell back 56-42 with
15:59 to play after the Monarchs opened the second half with a 12-6
run.
</P>
<P>
   But following a timeout, the Sparks responded and slowly began
to chip away at their deficit. They made a concerted effort after
Allison Feaster made back-to-back 3-pointers to reduce the deficit
to seven for the first time since early in the first half. Frett
scored a basket and then Penny Toler, Lisa Leslie (16 points) and
Frett each went to the line to convert two free throws to trim the
lead to 59-58.
</P>
<P>
   Leslie made a three-point play with 1:53 left but missed three
of four free-throw attempts over the next minute as the Sparks
trailed 73-69. Ruthie Bolton-Holifield made three of her four
attempts to secure the Monarchs' first win in three starts against
the Sparks.
</P>
<P>
   The Monarchs didn't look like a fatigued team that had played
(and defeated the defending champion Houston Comets) less than 24
hours before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're feeling good actually,'' Griffith said. ``Offensively
and defensively, we're feeling good. We kept our composure and got
this victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sparks will host the Phoenix Mercury on Sunday at 1 p.m.

ROSE BOWL GAINING BIG SOCCER REPUTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Americans know the Rose Bowl because of the
college football game played on its turf every New Year's Day. It
has also been the site of five Super Bowls.
</P>
<P>
   But the venerable stadium is fast gaining an international
reputation as the top venue for soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Today's final and third-place matches in the Women's World Cup
should cement the stadium's international reputation for some time
to come.
</P>
<P>
   It caps a 15-year period that has seen the stadium host the 1984
Olympic men's gold medal final, the title game for the 1994 men's
World Cup, and several international matches in addition to various
pro games in Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   When the U.S. team meets the Chinese in the final match of the
1999 Women's World Cup today, officials expect the game to draw the
largest crowd ever for a single women's sporting event _
90,000-plus. Even President Clinton and his wife will attend.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Tony DiCicco couldn't be happier the game will take
place at the Arroyo Seco pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Rose Bowl is such an incredible stadium to have the final
in,'' DiCicco said. ``We're just excited to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Just walking through the tunnel onto the field will be a
once-in-a-lifetime experience, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were here March 31 before we played Mexico and we said,
`Listen. Take a look around. This is where we want to be July
10,''' DiCicco said. ``And to walk back out here through the tunnel
and to kind of remember that conversation kind of gave me the
chills.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is where we want to be. We want to be here holding the
gold medal after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Tisha Venturini said there's something magical about
playing in the Rose Bowl and Pasadena, even if the game is in the
middle of summer and doesn't involve a pigskin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growing up, I used to watch the Rose Bowl games on TV all the
time,'' she said. ``It was the biggest game ever. Having the final
here is going to be outrageous. It's going to be the best place on
Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it's considered a fast field, the Rose Bowl turf is in
perfect shape, according to American Mia Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be ready, we need to be technically sharp.
Potentially, the ball's going to run out of bounds,'' Hamm said.
``I'm excited because this is a good surface to play on.''

SCURRY, GAO ARE GOAL ORIENTED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ They are international rivals and sporting
colleagues, forming a bond simply because they happen to play the
same position.
</P>
<P>
   But United States goalkeeper Briana Scurry doesn't know much
more than that about her counterpart, Gao Hong of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think in all the times we've played one another, we
would know more,'' Scurry said. ``But you know, we have different
training schedules, stay at different hotels. When we get to town,
they're leaving, so it hasn't left much time.''
</P>
<P>
   The result of today's Women's World Cup final may well hinge on
which goalkeeper plays better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the game's going to come down to the keepers,'' U.S.
forward Tiffeny Milbrett said. ``With Bri, she has kept us in games
and she has won games for us because she has stopped balls that
were probably, for sure, in the back of the net.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Tony DiCicco has had an up-close view of both
goalkeepers through the years. DiCicco works closely with the U.S.
keepers during training sessions, and last year Gao worked a summer
camp with DiCicco.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a really neat person,'' DiCicco said of Gao. ``She
speaks Japanese and we had a couple of our coaches that had played
in Japan, so that was the way we communicated (at the camp). She's
a great personality, a credit to the sport and an outstanding
goalkeeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Gao certainly makes it look easy, although she hasn't been
tested much during China's run to the final. In five matches, Gao
has faced just 21 shots, allowing only two goals for a
tournament-best 0.40 goals-against average.
</P>
<P>
   One of those goals came in the second minute of China's first
game against Sweden, a 2-1 victory and its toughest test to date.
</P>
<P>
   During Friday's practice at the Rose Bowl, Gao's instincts
seemed sharp and her athleticism was evident in making several
difficult saves appear routine.
</P>
<P>
   Whether at practice or during a game, Gao's aw-shucks approach,
with her shoulders wavering from side-to-side as she waits for a
shot to come her way, gives the scene a calming effect for the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   Following Friday's practice, no Chinese players were made
available to the media, although many in the horde of about 50
wanted to speak to Gao. She appeared almost apologetic when told by
a Chinese official to walk to the waiting team bus instead of
answering reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
   Gao waved to reporters and in a loud voice in perfect English
said: ``See you tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll see Gao sometimes just smile out there,'' DiCicco said
of game situations. ``She'll kind of smile and laugh and it's that
kind of confident body gesture.''
</P>
<P>
   Gao's unflappable, happy-go-lucky approach seems in direct
contrast to Scurry's now-famous, stone-faced appearance that grabs
the attention of her teammates during games.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm playing, I'm usually pretty serious,'' Scurry said of
what she refers to as her `Death Stare.' ``I think my play is more
my way of giving leadership on this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Scurry boasts similar numbers to Gao, having faced 24 shots in
five games and allowing three goals for a 0.60 goals against
average, ranking second in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Gao can stop some and make some crucial saves, then the
Chinese might be on top,'' Milbrett said. ``If Bri can come back
and earn her money like she's been doing this whole tournament,
then we might end up on top.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco said both keepers are fairly similar in style.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both very athletic and that's probably the key
ingredient to their games,'' DiCicco said. ``Technically, they are
not necessarily the model goalkeepers, either of them, but they
sure get to a lot of balls.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco said a key for the U.S. will be to keep its focus and
not allow Gao to establish momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has some weaknesses and we're hoping to expose those,''
DiCicco said of Gao.
</P>
<P>
   But when all is said and done, DiCicco feels more than fine with
Scurry as his last line of defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going into this event, Gao is a good goalkeeper and a lovely
lady,'' DiCicco said, ``but Briana Scurry is the best goalkeeper
here in the World Cup and, I think, the best goalkeeper in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an edge in goal.''

WAIT'LL THIS WHOLE THING GETS EVEN BIGGER

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ You'll see the best in women's soccer today.
Only not by looking at the Rose Bowl field.
</P>
<P>
   Look in the stands, at the teen-ager grinning through her
braces.
</P>
<P>
   Look in the living room, at the 6-year-old bouncing on the sofa
in front of the TV set.
</P>
<P>
   Look in the crib, at the baby girl asleep and oblivious to
United States-China and Women's World Cup '99.
</P>
<P>
   Because one of them is the best in women's soccer, or is going
to be, you just wait.
</P>
<P>
   The best in women's soccer is four years, a dozen years, or a
generation away.
</P>
<P>
   Women haven't played organized soccer for as long they've
competed in basketball, tennis or gymnastics. Compared to those
sports _ not to mention softball, golf and any number of Olympic
events _ women's soccer is behind the curve in attracting and
cultivating talent.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women's national team? It didn't exist until 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is plain to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is,'' conceded Jarl Torske, thick-bearded assistant
coach of the Norwegian team that lost in the semifinals to China,
``much room for improvement in all aspects of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   I could give this a negative spin and say a lot of what has
passed for world-class soccer in the past three weeks simply stank
_ sloppy passes, easy giveaways, porous defense, shallow rosters
and one-sided matches (5-0 China in the !ital!semis!off!).
</P>
<P>
   I prefer to take the optimistic angle: As entertaining as this
Women's World Cup has been, the soccer is only going to get better
as more girls and women _ and talented female coaches _ are drawn
to the sport.
</P>
<P>
   This is baseball in 1900, on its way to the 1950s. This is
football in 1920, on its way to the 1970s. This is basketball in
1940, on its way to the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Savor the thought. A sport whose Golden Age hasn't come and gone
but lies straight ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Women's World Cup president and CEO Marla Messing refers to the
thousands of girls she expects to register for soccer leagues this
fall because they want to ``be like Mia (Hamm).''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. midfielder Julie Foudy notes that the mere existence of
girls' soccer leagues shows how far the sport has come already.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of our older players, like Christine (Lilly) and me,''
said Foudy, in her 12th year on the national team, ``we grew up
playing on boys' teams, coached by fathers who didn't always know
what they were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. defender Kate Sobrero, in her second year on the team,
thinks she represents the improvement so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 22 and (backup defender) Lorrie Fair is 20,'' Sobrero
said. ``I think we're better than (their veteran teammates) were at
our age.''
</P>
<P>
   Sobrero thinks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``In another 20 years,'' she said, ``somebody who's really good
now will probably be average.''
</P>
<P>
   U.S. forward Cindy Parlow sees the evolution occurring even
faster than that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the game has evolved just from the '96 Olympics to the
'99 World Cup,'' said Parlow, the youngest member of the United
States' gold-medal team in Atlanta. ``And I think the game will get
faster, get better and go to a whole new level.''
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, U.S. coach Tony DiCicco pointed out, the United
States won the Women's World Cup in China with a team made up
almost entirely of college players. Of the '99 roster, only Lorrie
Fair of North Carolina still has college eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   Top players are remaining players for longer than they used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll say the men's game is a bit more sophisticated,'' DiCicco
said. ``But the level of the women's game has improved so much
tactically, and athletically, too.''
</P>
<P>
   It's fair to wonder if further improvement is exactly what
women's soccer needs. After all, if the soccer could be better,
600,000 American ticket buyers don't seem to give a damn.
</P>
<P>
   And don't the precise ball control and tight defenses of
world-class men's soccer produce exactly the kind of 0-0 games we
unsophisticates detest?
</P>
<P>
   Well, you can't stop progress. I'll take my chances on faster,
stronger, nimbler players.
</P>
<P>
   It's going to be fascinating, seeing if women's soccer can
sustain its instant popularity in the years ahead. The guess here:
Today's final is only the beginning for the U.S. and the world.
</P>
<P>
   Just wait until their feet catch up to their charisma.

CSUN'S PONCIANO CONFIDENT HE'LL BE CLEARED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Amid speculation his job was in jeopardy, Cal
State Northridge coach Ron Ponciano finally met Friday with school
administrators investigating possible NCAA violations by CSUN's
football program.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano left the five-hour meeting confident he will be
vindicated, and said he will submit a written report Monday
refuting two of the findings uncovered in the probe.
</P>
<P>
   The university is expected to conclude its investigation
Tuesday, according to Ponciano, and a final decision regarding
penalties and/or Ponciano's fate should come Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very good that the information I will provide on those
two allegations will be more than sufficient,'' said Ponciano, who
would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   University officials did not comment on the meeting or
acknowledge it even took place. A campus spokesman said late Friday
afternoon that there were no developments regarding the football
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The university has nothing to report,'' CSUN public
information officer John Chandler said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is the result of an anonymous letter that the
school received May 19 alleging a number of NCAA violations.
Ponciano has denied any wrongdoing and left Friday's meeting even
more convinced that he is not guilty of anything.
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano said he was not asked to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing that happened that surprised me,'' Ponciano
said. ``It was pretty much what I expected.''
</P>
<P>
   The probe has apparently cost one CSUN coach his job. Offensive
coordinator Rob Phenicie resigned Wednesday amid speculation he
would be forced to do so.
</P>
<P>
   School officials won't say if Phenicie was asked to step down
because of possible infractions. But considering Phenicie turned
down two other coaching jobs this offseason to stay at Northridge,
it is doubtful he suddenly decided to quit less than a month before
the opening of practice.
</P>
<P>
   Phenicie declined comment on the resignation on the advice of
his lawyer. He did say Wednesday that he felt the Matadors players
were being ``dealt a bad hand'' in the situation.
</P>
<P>
   Phenicie's departure left Ponciano wondering if his job was at
stake too. Ponciano said earlier this week he was eager to fight
for his job and confront allegations that he has termed ridiculous.

GARCIA STRONG, BUT M'S CAN'T GET TO DODGERS' VALDES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RALEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Randy Johnson trade residual was everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   On the mound, the what-might-have-been started against the
partial down payment Friday night at aging yet still functional
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Under the palm trees and flickering lights, the rejected one
upstaged the accepted one.
</P>
<P>
   Ismael Valdes was a few pitches better than Freddy Garcia, the
near-miss Mariner outdueling the real deal 5-0 before an impatient
crowd of 44,653. The Dodgers right-hander threw seven walk-free
innings before turning things over to his bullpen to complete the
shutout. He had to be at his best because Garcia was brilliant at
times.
</P>
<P>
   The prize bounty of the eventual Johnson trade struck out a
career-best 10 batters before leaving after just five innings of
duty.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome pushed the Mariners (42-43) under .500 again and
left them with their third straight defeat, while giving the
over-priced and underachieving Dodgers (37-47) a much-needed boost.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-three weeks after these same two teams failed to sign off
on their much-discussed transaction _ Johnson to the Chavez Ravine
club for Valdes and a host of others _ Valdes (7-7) showed off the
arm skills that proved so tempting to Seattle front-office execs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Valdes could have been one of us,'' Mariners third baseman
Russ Davis said. ``That's kind of weird.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican national brought heat, resilience and even a little
nastiness to the first of three interleague encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Sending an early message, Valdes plunked the Mariners' Alex
Rodriguez in the shoulder the first time he faced him. He hit
Davis, sending him out of the game with a bruised right forearm,
when Garcia retaliated against Mark Grudzielanek. He let it rest
when Garcia bounced one off Adrian Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just take your lumps and keep going,'' said Davis, who was
unable to throw after getting hit and will likely sit out the rest
of the series. ``Both guys were throwing the ball inside.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Valdes refused to give in when the Mariners
threatened with a pair of baserunners in each of the first three
innings. Easy grounder, strikeout and difficult popup were his
rally-killers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just kept everyone off balance,'' Ken Griffey Jr. said.
``He got outs when he needed them, and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia (9-5) did nothing to make the Mariners want to rescind
the Johnson trade. He just made a few ill-timed mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Garcia hit Beltre and served up a single
to Greg Counsell. One out later, the rookie right-hander grooved
one to Mark Grudzielanek, who lifted a three-run home run over the
Ron Cey commemorative sign in left-center, with a leaping Griffey
missing the ball by inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him jump up and go after it, I said, `Don't do that
to me,''' Grudzielanek said.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth Dodgers run came across in the fifth inning when
Mondesi walked, Devon White reached on a fielding error by Mariners
second baseman David Bell and Counsell socked a one-out single to
left.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia was lifted after throwing 123 pitches. He had hit that
pitch count four other times but had worked his way into the
seventh or eighth innings on each occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Garcia had his moments. He struck out the side in the
first inning in entertaining fashion after putting two runners on.
Fans booed lustily as the Dodgers flailed away at Garcia's changeup
and even a curve outside and in the dirt. He struck out Raul
Mondesi, Todd Hundley and Grudzielanek twice each.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked himself out of a heckuva mess in the first inning,
but in the second he didn't,'' Mariners manager Lou Piniella said.
``He had 61 pitches in the first two innings _ that's a complete
game. He labored out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got another run in the seventh off reliever Paul
Abbott, on Grudzielanek's single for a career-best fourth RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners came up with nothing, shut out for just the second
time this season. Four times they put two runners on. Twice they
had runners reach third. A diving catch by Grudzielanek with his
back to the plate denied a certain run in the third inning. A
botched double-steal attempt quelled another rally in the seventh,
with Tom Lampkin getting tagged out returning to third base.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes scattered seven hits before leaving when he hit his own
pitch count, 118.
</P>
<P>
   He was able to do something even Johnson has found near
impossible lately with Arizona: Earn a victory.

MONDESI'S MINDSET: HIT RESTART BUTTON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Los Angeles Dodgers are playing dismal
baseball and Raul Mondesi is performing terribly at the plate. And
the more either try to improve, the worse it gets.
</P>
<P>
   So before the Dodgers opened a three-game series with the
Seattle Mariners on Friday, Mondesi proclaimed it a new season.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi hadn't homered in 92 at-bats. He had nine RBI since May
31, and it's no coincidence the Dodgers were 10-23 since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have 300 more at-bats, so I'm going to act like
this is the beginning of that,'' said Mondesi, who homered 18 times
before June. ``I know I haven't hit a home run in 100 at-bats, but
I'm going to have so many more. That's what I'm thinking about
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of it has to do with the typical problem plaguing the
Dodgers this season. When Mondesi batted with the bases loaded and
one out in the first inning against the Mariners, instead of trying
to hit the ball the other way or just get a fly ball to score a
run, he struck out with big swings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm trying to do too much,'' Mondesi said. ``I
feel tight right now. It's never been like this before. I can get
in slumps but at least I hit the ball hard. I can't hit it hard
right now. I'm swinging like a rookie.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson has rested Mondesi a few times
lately, which Mondesi doesn't like, especially when he's not
expecting it. Johnson also has drawn raised eyebrows from Mondesi
by moving him throughout the lineup. Mondesi has batted anywhere
from leadoff to sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just getting to know Mondesi,'' Johnson said. ``I like his
attitude. He plays hard. I think sometimes, when things aren't
going his way, he forces things. He doesn't try to be a good
hitter, he tries to be aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Mondesi) or anyone else, it's good to get him a blow once in
a while. Sometimes you get that look of `Why are you picking on
me?' I'm trying to help him. But I don't worry about him. It lasts
an hour, two hours. It's just learning about players, then learning
about me.''
</P>
<P>
   Cromer update: Tripp Cromer returned to the team after
undergoing evaluation for what was diagnosed as an irregular
heartbeat and said nothing wrong was found. Cromer was examined by
Dodgers team physician Dr. Michael Mellman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor said 80 percent of the time it's not an anxiety
attack, it's arrhythmia,'' Cromer said. ``That's what he thought it
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Cromer, 31, left the Dodgers on Tuesday in Denver and returned
to L.A. to be examined after experiencing spells in which he had
trouble breathing. He said Dr. Mellman couldn't identify the
problem, which occurred five times in the past few weeks. He gave
Cromer a devise to carry around that's like the size of a credit
card and measures his heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said if it happens again, hold it up to my chest and it
will get a reading,'' Cromer said. ``Then I can give it to him and
he can read what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   In the mean time, Cromer began working out with the team again.
He's eligible to come off the disabled list July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Karros sits again: Johnson continued with his plan of not
staying status quo. A day after Eric Karros hit his 15th and 16th
homers, he sat Friday and Todd Hollandsworth started at first.
</P>
<P>
   Karros has sat two of the last four games. Also, Craig Counsell
started at second in place of Eric Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about Eric Karros,'' Johnson said. ``He's having a
good year. I'm worried about the other people. It's getting
Hollandsworth and Counsell going. It's 25 (guys). That's what I'm
trying to get across.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners start a pair of left-handers in the final two games
of the series, which figured heavily into the equation.
</P>
<P>
   FYI: Right-hander Antonio Osuna pitched 12/3 innings in his
second rehab start for Single-A San Bernardino. He walked two
struck out two and didn't allow a hit. Johnson said Osuna will most
likely be activated after the All-Star break, which would give him
one or two more rehab outings.... The Dodgers were 21-17 in
interleague games since their inception, but 3-6 this season.

   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 Editors: Nunez has tilde over second `n' 
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Friday was an emotion-filled day for the Diamondbacks. The
organization parted with two players it had nurtured and counted on
for the future.
</P>
<P>
   But the bottom line was that Arizona got the man it wanted _ the
man it needed _ if it expected to remain in the race for the
National League West Division title.
</P>
<P>
   The trade was another example of the now-rather-than-later mode
that pushed managing general partner Jerry Colangelo into signing
several veteran free agents after the club's first season in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Mantei, a right-handed closer with 10 saves, a 1-2 record,
a 2.72 ERA and 50 strikeouts in 36 innings, is expected to don No.
31 and join the Diamondbacks today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognized we had a hole to fill and we were able to come
up with an outstanding closer,'' Colangelo said. ``He's young
(Mantei turned 26 on Wednesday), not a guy in his mid-30s, not an
aging closer.''
</P>
<P>
   The main emotion in the clubhouse Friday was excitement. Players
and others in the organization were already anticipating the
arrival of Mantei, acquired in a trade with the Florida Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a sense of sadness with the departure of
right-hander Vladimir Nunez as part of the deal. He had come to the
organization as a 20-year-old Cuban refugee in February 1996, had
grown into a man and considered many on the coaching staff to be
father figures.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the question of whether right-hander Brad Penny,
the second part of the equation, would have fulfilled his potential
with Arizona. The Diamondbacks had not wanted to part with Penny,
the organizational Pitcher of the Year in 1998. The third departure
is mysterious at the moment _ a minor league player to be named
later.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of a closer became a necessity when veteran
right-hander Gregg Olson, who saved 30 games in 1998, struggled
with inconsistency and injury. The young pitchers who then
attempted to fill the role _ including Nunez and Korean
right-hander Byung-Hyun Kim _ also were inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Of the departure of Nunez and Penny, General Manager Joe
Garagiola Jr. said: ``This is why you develop young players. If you
can acquire a player that goes on your major-league roster, it is
the same as if you got that original player to the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mantei throws the ball between 95 and 99 mph, has an
above-average curveball and he wants to be out there. He wants the
ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's pursuit of Mantei was no secret. Nor was their
interest in Montreal right-hander Ugueth Urbina. Mantei, who began
his career with the Seattle Mariners and pitched for the Tempe club
of the Arizona Instructional League, had heard the talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``If something was going to happen, I didn't want to sit around
and wait (until the July 31 trading deadline),'' Mantei said. ``I'm
excited about what's going on. From what I've seen of Arizona, it's
a team that is interested in winning and winning now. It should be
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Mantei said his pitching approach focuses on ``the last three
outs of the game. That's all I think about, getting guys out and
throwing strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Damian Miller said Mantei ``has closer-type stuff. He should be
a big help for us.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Nunez ``was developing into a pretty good pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunez was developing a close relationship with Kim, who had a
neighboring locker, despite the language barrier.
</P>
<P>
   The normally happy Kim wore a long face as he walked through the
clubhouse. Asked about Nunez, he put both fists up to his face and
rubbed his eyes, as if he were crying.
</P>
<P>
   Nunez and his wife, Wendy, just bought a house in the area and
became parents for the second time. He was stunned by the news.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went in to the office (Manager Buck Showalter) and he told
me. My body stopped,'' said Nunez, who was 3-2 with one save and a
2.91 ERA in 27 games. ``I've been here for four years. It's been
like my school. This is where I learned how to pitch. The coach
(Mark Connor) was like my father. I just want to thank everybody
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Nunez will be joining fellow Cuban and friend Livan Hernandez on
the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said it was tough to tell Nunez, ``because he was
family. Mark (Connor) was all choked up. ``There are no givens, but
we think Matt Mantei has the potential to do a quality job for us
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Mantei is making $735,000 in 1999 and will be eligible for
salary arbitration at the end of the season. &QL;

EDMONDS, SALMON MAKE TRIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Anaheim Angels center fielder Jim Edmonds made the trip
to Colorado, the first time he's traveled with the team this season
since having surgery on his right shoulder April 19.
</P>
<P>
   With Tim Salmon (sprained left wrist) also on the trip, there is
reason for the Angels to look ahead to the second half of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Both are working with hitting coach Rod Carew _ Edmonds is
hitting off a tee and Salmon is hitting soft toss. Of the two,
Salmon is closer to returning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're moving up on the program,'' Salmon said. ``Between
myself, Rod and the trainer, we have some (return) dates we're
talking about, but that's between us. The only thing that will stop
us is a setback.''
</P>
<P>
   With no setbacks, Salmon probably will begin taking live batting
practice next week, begin a rehab assignment the following week and
join the team around Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Edmonds' initial target date of mid-August seems to be on
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Even without Salmon and Edmonds, the Angels' offense has been
scoring runs lately. And Salmon said the front office deserves
credit for not rushing into a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believed having patience to not make a move would pay off,''
he said. ``(The front office) believed the guys we had in spring
training would win. We lost some guys but if we get guys back we
can still win. Seven-and-a-half games out is not insurmountable.
We've just got to get us clicking as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Salmon warned that his return doesn't mean the
Angels will be instant contenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``As much as I think I can bring to the team, I'm not a
savior,'' he said. ``Once I come back, I've still got to find my
swing.''
</P>
<P>
   Coors strategy: Angels manager Terry Collins knows the ball
carries well at Coors Field and runs come fast and furious. But he
said it's not the home runs that lead to so much offense as much as
it is the expansive outfield, particularly from left-center to
right-center.
</P>
<P>
   Collins goes against the rule of thumb most managers use when
setting up their defense here. Most play all three outfielders
deep, but Collins has his outfielders play in on the corners and
deep in center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the home runs here, it's the hits down the lines and
in the gaps,'' he said. ``There's a lot of room out there. I
managed so long in Albuquerque (where the air is thin) and I
managed against Denver in the American Association, so I tried
something different. Sometimes it works, sometimes you get burned.
But for the most part I've been fairly successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Also: Pitcher Ken Hill (inflammed right elbow) is expected to
throw during the weekend. He's due to come off the disabled list
Friday.... Utility player Steve Decker has left the team and went
to Illinois for the funeral of his mother, who died earlier in the
week.... Second baseman Randy Velarde extended his hitting streak
Friday to eight games.

GM PROVES HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one's laughing at him anymore. No one's joking about his job
title, ridiculing his credentials, wondering how in the world he
landed such an important position armed only with a surname.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Joe Garagiola Jr. sealed the deal that may save the
season. The Diamondbacks acquired Matt Mantei, a flame-throwing
closer, an emphatic answer equipped with a 98 mph heater. It is a
bold stroke, a credit to an organization that recognizes the
importance of now. And it is another steal in Bazooka Joe's growing
list of heists.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a right-handed Billy Wagner, exactly what you're
looking for in the position,'' the general manager said. ``This
just proves that we're not up there eating popcorn.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you get lucky, sometimes the stars align in your
favor, and sometimes the perfect deal falls into your lap. But
there is a pattern here, and the acquisition of Mantei is stunning.
Not for what the Diamondbacks acquired, but for what they gave up
in return.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's`` Miami Herald,'' printed hours before the trade was
consummated, Florida Marlins Manager John Boles issued the company
line. They were an organization that believed Mantei was the best
young closer in baseball and he wouldn't come cheap.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wouldn't trade (Mantei) unless you are overwhelmed,''
Boles said. ``Somebody has to knock our socks off.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that Vladimir Nunez and Brad Penny are headed to Florida,
it's safe to assume Boles is still wearing his socks.
</P>
<P>
   So how does a team desperate for a closer end up soaking a team
with all the leverage? A team not compelled to trade Mantei? It is
a question only the Marlins can answer, and judging by the reaction
of one of their beat writers, a question they will face repeatedly
in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mantei is 26, and although he's had rotator cuff and elbow
problems, he's been healthy for two seasons. His strikeout ratio is
fabulous, and his curveball is wicked in contrast to his fastball.
He makes $735,000, and while basically dealing with a rebuilt arm,
he is not a short-term investment. He could be the closer well into
the next century, an All-Star in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see Mantei and (the Expos' Ugueth) Urbina as very similar
guys,'' Garagiola said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be a stretch, but the trade will significantly lift the
clubhouse spirit, a team that will no longer dread the late innings
or silently despise the bullpen. The trade gives the Diamondbacks
everything they need to win the division. And best of all, it
proves that the Diamondbacks are philosophically sound, a franchise
aware that you seize the opportunity to win championships _
whatever it takes.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, the White Sox dealt a prospect named Sammy Sosa
for a veteran slugger named George Bell. Sosa developed into a
genuine superstar, while Bell retired to his gas station in the
Dominican Republic. But even now, no one questions the trade
because it helped the Sox win a pennant. That's the way it works.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little risk here. Though Urbina would've required a
few players and the swimming pool in right field, Mantei arrives at
bargain-basement cost, as if he were a designer item somehow
labeled with the wrong price tag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always a great feeling when you get one across the finish
line,'' Garagiola said.
</P>
<P>
   Especially when it's a steal, and this is not foreign territory
for Garagiola. He hung with the Tony Womack deal until its
fruition. He peddled Karim Garcia for Luis Gonzalez ``and''
$500,000. And now this.
</P>
<P>
   Once there was a time when Bazooka Joe was a punch line, an easy
target, the subject of ill humor across the league. A man thought
to be nothing more than a figurehead keeping the seat warm, holding
a title without power or knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   It's July, and no one's laughing anymore. And no one is calling
Buck Showalter the general manager without a title.
</P>
<P>
   That job is already taken. By a man seriously underestimated in
baseball circles. A man who must apologize to no one. &QL;

MERCURY COMES UP SHORT AGAINST COMETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as the Mercury plays better and better, its WNBA playoff
chances grow dimmer and dimmer.
</P>
<P>
   The unfairness of that reality was hammered home again Friday
night as a third straight improved performance _ this time against
the highest caliber opponent _ ended in a fifth straight loss. The
Mercury slipped another notch deeper into the Western Conference
cellar.
</P>
<P>
   By turning away two shots from Jennifer Gillom in the final 18.7
seconds, the two-time champion Houston Comets held on for a 71-70
win at America West Arena. The Comets, who lost 74-63 at Sacramento
Thursday, have not lost two straight since the end of the 1997
regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Van Chancellor would never agree, but Houston (12-2) could
have absorbed the loss without any long-term effect other than hurt
pride.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury (3-9), five games out of playoff position with 20 to
play, has no such luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need a W, because we don't want to get comfortable with
losing and saying, `Next time, next time, next time,' '' Gillom
said. ``Gosh, if we play like we played tonight and just a few
things go our way, the Ws are coming.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we're playing LA (Sunday) because there is a lot of
hostility toward us in LA right now. And that's what we need, to
play with hostility, because it makes us play harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The greatest hostility in the first meeting of the 1998 WNBA
finalists this season was not between the teams _ the Comets
clearly were dragging from the travel between tip-offs 22 hours
apart _ but mutually against the officiating.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury Coach Cheryl Miller's return to the bench for the first
time since surgery on a ruptured Achilles tendon Wednesday lasted
until 5:16 remained, although she easily could have picked up her
second technical foul and second ejection of the season earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coach Howie Landa also was on the verge of his second
technical of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Comets forward Sheryl Swoopes took a T with 1:04 left after she
made a clean steal from Lisa Harrison, who tagged Swoopes only to
have the personal foul go against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Gillom made the technical free throw and Harrison both of hers,
closing the Comets' lead to 69-68. When Houston's Cynthia Cooper
then missed a 17-footer, Marlies Askamp rebounded and was fouled by
Polina Tzekova. Askamp's two free throws at the 39-second mark gave
Phoenix its first lead since 12:37 of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   But as in Games 2 and 3 of last year's league finals, Swoopes
had an answer, spinning left past Askamp for a 10-footer with 18.7
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Mercury used three timeouts thereafter to plot
perhaps a season-saving shot, Swoopes was among those coming up
with enough defense to deny Gillom, who almost manufactured a
league Most Valuable Player award out of such heroics last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have gotten the ball a little bit closer to the
basket,'' she said of the final attempt, a 17-footer from the
baseline. ``I pushed off the block and got my fadeaway shot off. It
felt good when it left my hand, and any time it hangs on the rim,
it's a good shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to get Tina (Thompson) one-on-one from
the high post (on my first attempt), but when I drove in I felt
Swoopes and I stepped back, and they both came at my shot and got a
piece of it. Same thing on the other side, the same two players,
but I got enough room to get the shot off.''
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes had 18 points and Cooper 15, but Thompson was held to
nine, the first time this season that all of Houston's Big Three
haven't achieved double figures.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury point guard Michele Timms had a 22-point game that was
most brilliant for her defense vs. two-time MVP Cooper, whom she
will team with as West starting guards at the inaugural All-Star
Game on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take positives from this game,'' Timms said.
``It was a good game, we played well in patches. They're the top
team in the league, so it was a positive for everyone tonight.'' &QL;

U.S. TEAM ROLLING UP ITS SLEEVES  
 WOMEN FACE CHINA TODAY IN CUP CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
 CUP-ADV-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM THOMAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The record crowds, presidential visits, media
hype, TV commercials and overwhelming receptions from fans and
dignitaries at every stop are nice, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. national team players appreciate all that, as do, of
course, the 1999 Women's World Cup organizers and FIFA,
international soccer's governing body.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems as if the Americans have to keep reminding everyone
</P>
<P>
   that, gosh darn it, this thing isn't over.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't come all this way _ through five matches in five
cities from coast to coast in 16 days, not to mention all the
training before and between _ to settle for being here. They didn't
go through it all to sign autographs, mug with Letterman and shake
hands with Clinton. They didn't even do it just to talk to
sportswriters about the same things, over and over and over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people think this tournament would not have
reached its full potential unless we reached the finals,'' U.S.
Coach Tony DiCicco said on the eve of today's Women's World Cup
championship match at the Rose Bowl. ``There wouldn't have been as
much excitement and sellout crowds if we'd been eliminated in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for us, this tournament won't reach its full potential
until we walk out of here with gold medals around our necks.''
</P>
<P>
   All that stands in way of the Americans' second Cup title in
three tries is a cozy little country of 1.2 billion people called
China, which, incidentally, has produced a pretty fair women's
soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the Chinese are a little _ no, a lot _ better than pretty
fair. Is ``outstanding'' too strong a word?
</P>
<P>
   ``China is an outstanding team,'' DiCicco said. ``They have
great personality players, and where they've really come on in the
past few years is in the support players. They've found and
developed some good young talent, much like we have.''
</P>
<P>
   China comes into the title match having scored the most goals
(19) and owning the top defense in terms of fewest goals allowed
(2).
</P>
<P>
   Piloting the offense is Sun Wen, who is tied for the Cup lead in
goals with seven. She may be the fastest striker to play in the Cup
and is supported by four other swift attackers in Zhao Lihong, Liu
Ailing, Liu Ying and Jin Yan. All figure to test the American
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to be ready for everything,'' said captain Carla
Overbeck, who will be joined in the back by Joy Fawcett, Kate
Sobrero and Brandi Chastain. ``China is a dangerous offensive team.
We'll have to play solid defense individually and as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans' top scorer is Tiffeny Milbrett with three goals,
but the U.S. has had scoring from nine other players. The U.S.
attackers, which also include Mia Hamm, Cindy Parlow and Michelle
Akers, appear to have an advantage in both height and speed on the
Chinese defense.
</P>
<P>
   But don't get the idea this will be a high-scoring affair.
Chances are that few goals will be scored, in part because the two
best goalkeepers in the world will be minding the nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Great Wall of China'' vs. ``The Rock.''
</P>
<P>
   Gao Hong has allowed only two goals and Briana Scurry three in
their respective teams' five matches. Scurry has been challenged
more often, particularly against Brazil in a semifinal last
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes down to it, the deciding factor might be something
other than soccer skills _ one of the intangible elements of
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been in more situations like this than they have,''
Milbrett said. ``I think our experience gives us an edge. And I
think we might be a little more competitive than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Overbeck says the memory of being ousted in the semifinals of
the 1995 Cup provides added inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was depressing; we were all crying,'' Overbeck said. ``It
was a big letdown after winning the Cup in '91 and expecting to win
it again in '95.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it also might have been the best thing that has happened
to us. We all gathered on the field after the game . . . and we all
agreed that we were going to remember this feeling and not let it
happen again.'' &QL;

BIG HONOR FOR BIG UNIT?  
 LIKELY TO BE ALL-STAR STARTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   Though it hasn't been announced officially, it appears that
Diamondbacks left-hander Randy Johnson is the choice of National
League Manager Bruce Bochy to start Tuesday's All-Star Game at
Boston's Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy, the manager of the defending NL champion San Diego
Padres, apparently has told those close to the Padres that Johnson
is his choice and that Philadelphia Phillies right-hander Curt
Schilling will follow Johnson to the mound.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling is a product of Phoenix's Shadow Mountain High School.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson knows, he wasn't saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking the wrong guy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bochy called Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter on Friday to
discuss the situation, but Showalter was not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who makes his final start before the All-Star break
today in an interleague game against Oakland, is 9-6 with a 3.03
ERA and 200 strikeouts in 145 innings. He could easily be 12-3, but
he has lost his last three starts via shutout, and his team has
only given him three hits of support.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference announcing his All-Star selection earlier
this week, Johnson said it would be an honor to start, but he also
said that there were other pitchers who had better records.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do get into the game, there might be a few lefties I've
never faced before,'' Johnson said with a laugh, referring to his
American League days with Seattle and not seeing many left-handed
hitters when he pitched.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's normal schedule would not be interrupted by the
All-Star appearance. He normally throws on the side on the third
day after he pitches in a game and has the fourth day off. So
throwing two, perhaps three innings on Tuesday would not be
unusual.
</P>
<P>
   That would allow him Wednesday off before his next scheduled
start at Texas on Thursday to start the second half of the season. &QL;

   However serious Cheryl Miller was about not coaching Friday
night as announced in the pregame notes, there she was, limping to
the bench on crutches to the cheers of 12,236.
</P>
<P>
   The 35-year-old, who had surgery Wednesday to repair a ruptured
Achilles' tendon suffered a day earlier during practice, held
little back. Wearing jeans to cover her cast, she hopped around
arguing with her usual verve at the officials.
</P>
<P>
   It was her objection to an offensive foul against Michele Timms
that rated a technical foul from Dennis DeMayo with 14:20
remaining. Lamont Simpson whistled the second T at 5:16, not long
after a three-pointer by Houston's Cynthia Cooper that instead
could have gone as a charge against Kristi Harrower.
</P>
<P>
   Miller also was ejected during an 80-76 loss at Orlando on June
21 and was ejected from one game each in 1997 and '98. &QL;

GRUDZIELANEK LIFTS DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(OPTIONAL: Adds quotes, details) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a dismal season when the Los Angeles Dodgers
respond to nothing for the long-term and fans have little to
embrace, something finally happened to excite folks.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek drove in a career-high four runs _ three with
a second-inning homer _ and made a stellar defensive play, while
Ismail Valdes pitched seven innings as the Dodgers beat the Seattle
Mariners 5-0 Friday in an interleague contest at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The outing came after Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone
addressed the team for nearly 45 minutes in a closed-door meeting
to deliver a candid message: The season isn't over, the Dodgers
aren't done, and if you think otherwise maybe you don't belong
here.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Dodgers' third meeting in less than a week, which
equals the number of wins they've had during that span.
</P>
<P>
   But the after-effect was the Dodgers' first shutout win since
May 3. They've won two straight for the first time in two weeks.
They haven't won three straight since a five-game streak April 27
to May 1.
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek, who spent 28 days on the disabled list, has seven
RBI in the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a lot of energy, gives a lot of energy. That's why I
missed him,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``He's more
patient at the plate. I thought he had a real good, solid approach
when he came back.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of that is because of extensive batting cage sessions with
hitting coach Rick Down. Unable to swing with his right hand,
Grudzielanek used a smaller bat and hit only with his left hand for
weeks in the cage during his disabled list days.
</P>
<P>
   After missing five weeks with a broken right hand, the result of
punching a wall after hitting into a double play in Pittsburgh,
Grudzielanek has seven hits in his past 14 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first part of a swing is when you go down to the ball with
(the left hand), and that's what he was doing,'' Down said. ``It's
what I told him from the get-go. I told him to look for the reason
why (the injury) happened. He worked on it, and it will make him a
better hitter in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers failed to score in the first with the bases loaded
and none out _ Todd Hundley, Raul Mondesi and Devon White each
struck out _ but unlike pervious games when the Dodgers (37-47)
would go stale, they came right back.
</P>
<P>
   They put two runners on in the second, and with one out
Grudzielanek drove a Freddy Garcia (9-5) pitch over the left-center
field fence to give the Dodgers a 3-0 lead. It was Grudzielanek's
third homer and first since April 25. He added an RBI single in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at some old tapes and saw that I was hitting the ball
the other way,'' said Grudzielanek, who batted leadoff for the
second time. ``They can put two fielders over there and I'm still
going to try that. That's what I did when I had my (All-Star) year
(1996). If you do that, you'll be able to turn on some pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Grudzielanek's offense was the show, but his catch in shallow
left field in the fourth kept the Mariners scoreless. With Dan
Wilson on second and two outs, Grudzielanek tracked down Brian
Hunter's blooper and made stretching, back-hand catch before
falling to grass.
</P>
<P>
   It helped Valdes (7-7) win for the second straight start after
losing a career-high five in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Though Valdes has given up 19 homers this season and the
Mariners lead the majors with 149, Seattle hitters were baffled.
Valdes allowed seven hits, struck out four and didn't walk a
batter.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes' performance also sent a reminder to the Mariners of what
they missed. He was nearly traded last season for a deal involving
Randy Johnson, but Seattle pulled out at the final instant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think about things like that,'' said Seattle's Ken
Griffey Jr., who went 1 for 3 with two strikeouts against Valdes.
``That's (the media's) job to come up with the creative stuff.
Randy was going to get traded. If it wasn't (Valdes), it was going
to be someone else.''

MEET THE MAN BEHIND THE WORLD CUP WOMEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM THOMAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ During the U.S. team's earth-shaking run
through the Women's World Cup, this nation has been captivated not
only by the Americans' performance, but by the personalities of the
players and the compelling stories that surround the team.
</P>
<P>
   There's megastar Mia Hamm; the struggles of Michelle Akers, who
suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome; the ``soccer moms,'' Carla
Overbeck and Joy Fawcett; the self-described ``fly in the milk,''
Black goalkeeper Briana Scurry; and many others.
</P>
<P>
   So many, in fact, that it can be difficult to stand out among
this interesting and diverse collection of young women.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, you sport a mustache.
</P>
<P>
   The bushy-lipped guy directing traffic during practices and
matches is Tony DiCicco, the full-time coach, sometimes father
figure and all-around orchestrator of the team that will play China
today for the World Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to this point has not been easy. DiCicco had a difficult
task when in 1994 he took over a team that was the reigning Cup
champion and was expected to keep that crown a year later. In
addition, he had to follow Anson Dorrance, who not only led the
national team to the first Cup title, but was the winningest
college coach ever at North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco, a graduate of Springfield College in Massachusetts and
a professional player for five years in the American Soccer League,
had no prior head coaching experience at any of the higher levels.
</P>
<P>
   He knew that unless he continued to produce a winner, the
critics would be standing on his doorstep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm well past that, but I did have that feeling when I first
took over,'' DiCicco said last week. ``The team was the world
champions. When you think that way, it takes away from your ability
to coach the best way you can.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco's ability to coach was called into question after the
U.S. team lost to Norway in the semifinals of the 1995 World Cup.
According to assistant coach Lauren Gregg, that loss was a turning
point for DiCicco and the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened in 1995 gave Tony the freedom to make changes
and go in his direction,'' Gregg said. ``He started using his
strength, which is in the tactical part of the game. He is a real
student. Every opportunity he has to get better, he takes advantage
of. No one spends more time watching tapes, analyzing and
discussing them, than Tony does.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's learned how to lead women, how to lead teams, and brought
an incredible tactical sophistication on both sides of the ball.
The results are what you see now.''
</P>
<P>
   The first result was a gold medal in the 1996 Olympics. Now,
DiCicco has led the Americans to a berth in the World Cup
championship match.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves a lot of credit,'' said Overbeck, the veteran team
captain. ``He came back after '95 and made huge changes. For one,
he went from a marking defense to a zone that has worked out really
well. As the game has evolved, he has kept up and helped to
continue the success.''
</P>
<P>
   Said DiCicco: ``I'm a much better coach now. . . . I know more
about handling people.''
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old coach, who is the father of four boys, has what
defender Lorrie Fair calls 20 daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the perfect fit for this team because he's fatherly,''
Fair said. ``But he's a coach first, which we all respect.''
</P>
<P>
   The respect, Overbeck said, is something DiCicco has earned.
</P>
<P>
   ``His personality plays a big part in it,'' she said. ``He knows
soccer, but just as important, he knows how to get the most out of
every player. He's very supportive and open-minded. He'll go to the
captains and ask for suggestions, get other input.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that has made for a great relationship between Tony and
the team, and is a huge reason for our success.'' &QL;

CUP'S IMPACT ON YOUTH MAY BE APPARENT IN THE FALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Those who wonder what impact the Women's World Cup
will have on soccer in general and women's sports in particular
should get part of their answer this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Women's World Cup President and CEO Marla Messing predicts youth
soccer leagues will be flooded with girls wanting to play this
fall. She says enrollment in youth leagues will hit record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see hundreds of thousands of girls register in the fall
that otherwise wouldn't have registered if not for this event,''
said Messing. ``They want to be like Mia Hamm and Julie Foudy and
play in a Women's World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Nelson, a regional coordinator and coach of American Youth
Soccer Organization teams in Torrance, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The girls are seeing there's an opportunity,'' said Nelson, a
father of four girls. ``My youngest knows the girl players by name
now. Where she was big on Ken Griffey Jr., it's Mia Hamm now.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 8.6 million soccer players in the United States, 2.5
million are girls, according to AYSO. About 635,000 boys and girls,
ages 5-18, play in AYSO's 1,000 leagues nationwide. Forty percent
are female.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson is projecting an enrollment of 44 percent girls in his
region's leagues this fall, up from 38 percent five years ago. The
first female players allowed in AYSO in 1971 now are mothers, and
he credits them with enrolling their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WNBA helped us be successful by showing the way as a
(professional women's) league,'' said Messing. ``Hopefully our
success will help other women's sports be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been like a cultural shift, and the way the tournament
caught fire, we've tipped into something. We think this will be a
seminal moment, that people will look back in 20 years and say,
`That event is responsible for the development of women's sports.'

HLINKA WAS NEVER THE NO. 1 CANDIDATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite media speculation that Ivan Hlinka, coach of the Czech
Republic National Team, was in line to become an assistant on the
staff of Coyotes first-year Coach Bob Francis, he was never the top
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were interested in him and we did discuss the job with him,
but we did not make him an offer for the position,'' Coyotes
General Manager Bobby Smith said. ``We thought the other guys we
hired were better suited for our situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Francis announced earlier this week that former NHL
Coach Rick Bowness and veteran assistant coach Wayne Fleming will
round out Francis' staff.
</P>
<P>
   It was thought that the Coyotes' interest in luring Hlinka to
the United States was tied to the attempt to re-sign Group II free
agent Robert Reichel, who reportedly is seeking a contract in the
$3 million-per-year range and is prepared to stay in the Czech
Republic and become a full-time player/coach for the national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it will have any effect on Robert's decision,
but you don't put together a coaching staff to appease a player,''
Smith said. ``The numbers Robert Reichel is asking for haven't
changed since before we talked to Hlinka.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not something we are going to agree to, either. We're
not close at all.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Safronov signed &QL; 
 &QL; 
The Coyotes have signed defenseman Kiril Safronov, 18, their second
first-round choice and the No. 19 pick overall, to a three-year
contract. No terms were announced.
</P>
<P>
   Safronov, a solid stay-home blueliner who at 6 feet 2 and 196
pounds is said to have a nasty streak and a physical game, played
last season for St. Petersburg in Russia and was the youngest
player on the Russian World Junior Team that captured the world
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Many scouts think Safronov could develop into a top NHL
defenseman in a couple of years. He will report to the Coyotes'
training camp in August. If he doesn't make the team, he will
either be assigned to AHL Springfield or join the Quebec Remparts ,
the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League team that drafted him on
Thursday. &QL; 
 &QL; 
No arbitration? &QL; 
 &QL; 
Of the Coyotes' six Group II free agents, those who can attract
offer sheets from other teams while Phoenix maintains the right to
match those offers, four _ Reichel, goalie Nikolai Khabibulin,
defenseman Stan Neckar and enforcer-type Sean Gagnon _ own the
right to take their case before an arbitration hearing if they
choose.
</P>
<P>
   The deadline for filing for arbitration is July 15, but Smith
said he thought the matter was moot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we will have anyone who goes to arbitration,''
Smith said. ``Some are too young, and some think that leverage-wise
they have a better chance to negotiate for what they want
throughout the summer than by going to arbitration.''
</P>
<P>
   Arbitration hearings will be held Aug. 115.
</P>
<P>
   Eligibility depends on a sliding scale determined by the age
they signed their first contract and number of years of NHL
experience. Players who signed between 18 and 20 must have five
years experience in the league. Those who signed at 21 must have
four; 2223, three years; 24, two years; 25 and older, one year.
</P>
<P>
   Wingers Shane Doan and Tavis Hansen are each one year short of
qualifying for arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Friday he has not had any discussions with his Group
II players or their agents since making mandatory qualifying offers
to maintain their rights before the July 1 NHL deadline. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Adios, Corky &QL; 
 &QL; 
Reports are that the New York Rangers are wooing checking line
center/penalty killer Bob Corkum, an unrestricted free agent, and
are willing to pay him anywhere from $1.3 million to $1.5 million
per season.
</P>
<P>
   If so, Smith said Corkum had priced himself out of the Coyotes'
interest range.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume that Bob Corkum will be playing for another team next
year,'' Smith said. ``He will end up getting an offer that we will
be unwilling to match.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, who already have spent a reported $54.4 million on
wingers Theo Fleury, Valeri Kamensky and defenseman Stephane
Quintal this week, have made a noticeable impact on the NHL salary
structure for unrestricted free agents, although Smith said he
didn't expect it to carry over for Group II free agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all Group III stuff that doesn't affect Group II players
or those going to arbitration at all,'' he said. &QL;

DIAMONDBACKS AGAIN HAVENO STING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By TIM TYERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was hard to tell which frustration was greater: Andy Benes'
failure to record victories in back-to-back starts for the first
time this season, or his teammates' failure to once again beat up
on a pitcher who has been punched around by the rest of baseball
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Like, for instance, Jose Jimenez. Or, in this case, Gil Heredia.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was pretty much a dead heat, but the net result was a
5-2 loss to the Oakland Athletics on Friday night. It was Arizona's
14th loss in its past 21 games and only the Athletics' sixth win in
their 26 road games.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Heredia, who played for the University of Arizona,
entered the game with an 5.77 earned run average and a 4-5 record
that was shakier than the numbers indicate. Of his four victories,
just one, a 3-2 win over Toronto, came against a team playing above
.500 baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But Heredia, 1-3 with a 7.77 ERA in his past nine starts, did
what veteran pitchers often do. He kept himself out of major
trouble and coming up with the big pitch when he didn't, holding
the Diamondbacks to one run on eight hits before leaving after the
sixth inning and 83 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   He escaped a first-and-third situation in the second by striking
out Benes, and a bases-loaded, one-out situation in the fourth by
getting Benes to ground into a force out at the plate and retiring
leadoff hitter Tony Womack on a meek ground out to second.
</P>
<P>
   The only run the Diamondbacks produced off Heredia and his 86
mph fastball came in the third when Womack, who had two singles and
a double, led off with a single, stole second and went to third on
catcher Ramon Hernandez's throwing error. He scored on a single to
right by Luis Gonzalez, who also doubled home Womack in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the frustration was Arizona's inability to touch
Oakland reliever Buddy Groom, who six times this season has failed
to retire a batter during an appearance. Groom had retired just 10
of the 23 batters he faced in his past 11 outings, but he pitched a
scoreless eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Benes, like Heredia, had stopped a three-game losing streak in
his last start, a 17-5 win in a sauna bath against St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   But he apparently is one who believes that statistics never lie.
The Athletics entered the game with the worst batting average in
the major leagues (.230) with runners in scoring position, and
Benes seemed intent on putting that statistic to the ultimate test.
</P>
<P>
   After breezing through the first two innings, thanks in part to
a fielding gem from third baseman Matt Williams on Hernandez's
rocket down the line, Benes committed the unpardonable sin of
walking Heredia. A single and a walk later the bases were full with
one out.
</P>
<P>
   He escaped by striking out Ben Grieve and getting Jason Giami on
a fly to shallow left that Williams handled.
</P>
<P>
   The stats were correct.
</P>
<P>
   He found himself with the bases loaded again in the fourth
thanks to a pair of walks and a throwing error by shortstop Andy
Fox, but again escaped damage by striking out leadoff hitter Tony
Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe there was something to this statistic thing.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, when one puts statistics to the test, one should
know all of them. While Oakland is anemic with runners in scoring
position, they are second in the America League in drawing walks
and rank fifth in homers.
</P>
<P>
   And Benes battle with shaky control caught up with him in the
fifth, when he got stuck in a fatal rut.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the inning by issuing his fifth walk of the game to
Miguel Tijada. His first pitch to Grieve, who was stranded in
scoring position in the first after doubling, landed in the
right-center-field bleachers after a 413-foot flight, giving the
Athletics a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern repeated itself. He walked Giambi, his sixth of the
game, and his first pitch to Matt Stairs found a home in the
right-field seats some 403 feet away. Oakland led, 4-1, but, hey,
neither time was there a runner in scoring position!
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, despite Benes' control problems in the two previous
innings, the Diamondbacks had nobody warming up in the bullpen, and
Benes escaped further damage. But not without sending center
fielder Steve Finley against the wall to retire Hernandez and then
sending him to the warning track to catch Ric Chavez's rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez gave Oakland a 5-2 lead with a two-out solo homer to
left off Greg Swindell, the first of four Diamondbacks' relief
pitchers. That also included the major league debut of rookie Erik
Sabel, who became the first Diamondback draftee (42nd pick in 1966)
to make a game appearance for the team.

ROOKIE IS `NONE OF THE ABOVE'  
 BUT STEWART IS ALL YOU'D WANT IN A DRIVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Question: With 17 of 34 NASCAR Winston Cup races in the books,
what has been the season's top story?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jeff Gordon, former world-beater, dropping to an unaccustomed
fifth place in the drivers standings.
</P>
<P>
   B: Dale Jarrett atop the points ladder.
</P>
<P>
   C: No driver punching out another driver on pit road.
</P>
<P>
   D: None of the above.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the above,'' answered car owner Robert Yates, whose
two-car stable includes Jarrett. ``Tony Stewart has been the
biggest story.''
</P>
<P>
   How big? THIS big.
</P>
<P>
   Although a rookie, Stewart has been extraordinarily productive.
</P>
<P>
   He has been as high as No. 5 in the standings and enters
Sunday's race at New Hampshire International Speedway in sixth,
only 19 points behind Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite no wins, Stewart, 28, has shown a keen resilience in the
face of potential calamity.
</P>
<P>
   After 17 races during Gordon's rookie season in 1993, he had
five DNFs.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart has one. He also has four top-five and nine top-10
finishes, which is the kind of sparkling consistency a driver needs
to penetrate the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Should Stewart remain positioned in the top 10 throughout the
remainder of the season, he will become the first rookie in nearly
20 years to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Jody Ridley finished seventh in his first NASCAR season in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, however, is quick to remind everyone there are
mitigating circumstances for the early success.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, I've probably had the better end of the deal
compared to the other rookies this season,'' Stewart said. ``I've
stepped into an established team (Joe Gibbs Racing) that finished
in the top 10 in points the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a teammate (Bobby Labonte) to reflect off of, and
(rookies Buckshot Jones and Elliott Sadler) don't have a teammate
to go to during practice and say, `My car feels like this or that.
Does your car do the same thing?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart's honesty is admirable.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one can deny his immense talents, which have prompted
some to believe he is the best seat-of-the-pants racer to come
along since A.J. Foyt.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one way, (Stewart's impact) is a surprise,'' Ernie Irvan
said. ``It's a surprise because most of the time, rookies, no
matter what, come in and they tear up a bunch of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Stewart is a great race car driver. He's right on the
playing field with a guy like Jeff Gordon. There's no way you can
just take his abilities and toss them into a pile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great race car driver, and he's been a very smart race
car driver.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe lucky, too, Stewart hinted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured at this point in the season if you went to our race
shop, you'd see (Labonte's) cars in one piece on one side of the
room, and the other side of the room would look like a salvage yard
with front and rear clips off of them,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart gives much credit to remaining mostly in one piece to
crew chief Greg Zipadelli.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it was legal to marry two people, I'd marry my fiancee and
I'd make sure Greg was tied in there somehow, so he couldn't get
away, either,'' Stewart said. ``I don't think I've found anybody
more intense than Greg.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how good a day or how bad a day we're having, Greg
is always trying to find something else to make us a little better.
That's probably the thing I like about him the most. He never
quits.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Three times this season, Stewart has qualified for the front
row, including one pole position. Stewart's top finish, however,
has been fourth, which he's done three times.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Stewart manages to poke his head along with the Home
Depot Pontiac Grand Prix into victory lane before the season ends,
however, is not something he loses sleep over.
</P>
<P>
   ``This series is all about consistency,'' said Stewart, a past

NASCAR AT THE HALFWAY MARK: HOW THEY STAND 
</HEADLINE>
  REPORT-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seventeen NASCAR Winston Cup races down, 17 to go. Before we say
adios to the first half of the season, how about one final peek
over the shoulders: &QL; 
 &QL; 
By the numbers &QL; 
Although 17 NASCAR Winston Cup races remain, don't bet against Dale
Jarrett maintaining the series lead and capturing the driving
title. The last time the leader at the midway point failed to win
the championship was 1992, when Davey Allison lost the crown to the
late Alan Kulwicki. Actually, Kulwicki edged Bill Elliott by 10
points, the closest race in NASCAR history.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Richard Petty overcame a 187.25 point deficit, the
farthest any driver has rallied to capture the driving title.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1949, when the series was founded, there have been 1,847
races.
</P>
<P>
   Nine drivers have won races this season: Jeff Gordon (four),
Jeff Burton (three), Dale Jarrett (three), Bobby Labonte (two) and
one each by John Andretti, Dale Earnhardt, Terry Labonte, Mark
Martin and Rusty Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   At this point last season, 220 points separated the top five
drivers. This year, Jarrett leads No. 5 Gordon by 394 points.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 325 lead changes this season among 36 drivers,
or an average of 19.1 lead changes per race.
</P>
<P>
   Burton has led 892 laps this season, 79 more than runner-up
Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon tops Burton in miles led, however, with 1,099.47. Burton
has led 1,046.65 miles. Jarrett (773.86 miles) has led when it
counted most . . . at the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte has completed 6,855.55 miles out of a possible
6,877.07.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-six percent of the top-five finishes have been recorded by
only five drivers: Jarrett (13), Bobby Labonte (12), Martin (11),
Gordon (10) and Burton (10).
</P>
<P>
   Lap-leader bonus points can mean the difference between winning
the championship or not. Gordon has earned 80 such points this
season, five more than Burton and Bobby Labonte. Jarrett has 55
bonus points.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Ford tough &QL; 
Ford Taurus drivers have won eight races, two more than Chevrolet
Monte Carlo drivers and five more than Pontiac Grand Prix drivers.
</P>
<P>
   After 17 races in 1998, Pontiac had only 20 top-10 finishes. The
manufacturer has 48 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ford has 43 of the 85 top-five finishing positions this season
(50.6 percent). Pontiac and Chevy each have 21 (24.7 percent).
</P>
<P>
   After 4,993 laps, Ford has led 2,699, and Chevy has led 1,386. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
First-year blues &QL; 
Aside from Tony Stewart, who is sixth in the drivers standings,
it's been a long season for other rookies. Elliott Sadler is 31st
on the ladder, followed by Buckshot Jones (44th) and Stanton
Barrett (52nd). &QL; 
Is there a doctor in the house? &QL; 
Ask Martin if he'd like to do last weekend's Pepsi 400 at Daytona
International Speedway all over again. Martin, perhaps the fittest
driver on the beer-and-burger circuit, crashed in practice and
initially was diagnosed with a fractured wrist. Despite much pain,
Martin still drove and finished 17th.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the race, Martin contemplated trying to cut the
cast off his hand. Two days after the race, it was learned Martin
also had suffered a broken rib and a broken tibia plateau in his
left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery on Martin's knee was performed Wednesday, but he doesn't
plan on sitting out Sunday's race at New Hampshire International
Speedway. Martin also must undergo lower-back surgery on Nov. 23,
two days after the season finale. Do they give purple hearts in
NASCAR? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Psst, can you spare a dime? &QL; 
Chief mechanic Scott Eggleston was fined $50,000 for an illegal
insert in the intake manifold, which was discovered during prerace
inspection last Saturday. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Tidbits &QL; 
Jarrett has a 5.94 finishing average.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Hamilton is one of four drivers to start all 17 races and
not lead a lap.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 12 sweeps in 118 chances since 1990. Gordon was
the only driver to do it last season, sweeping the two races at
Rockingham.
</P>
<P>
   It pays to belong to a multicar stable. Of the 85 top-five
finishes, 81 (95 percent) have been recorded by multicar teams.
Roush Racing leads with 21, followed by Joe Gibbs Racing (16),
Robert Yates Racing (14) and Hendrick Motorsports (11).
</P>
<P>
   Poor Michael Waltrip. He is winless in 411 career starts,
including 17 this season. Rick Mast is next at 292.
</P>
<P>
   Several drivers have gone more than 50 races without a win. For
good guy Dave Marcus, it's been a 457-race winless drought. Brett
Bodine last won 282 starts ago. Other notables include Ken Schrader
(252), Darrell Waltrip (211) and Elliott (144).
</P>
<P>
   Several drivers also have gone many races without a top-five
finish. Brett Bodine last did so in the 1994 Brickyard 400, 154
starts ago. Has it really been nearly two years for Kyle Petty and
Elliott, who last recorded top-five finishes in September 1997? &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
WHO'S HOT/WHO`S NOT &QC; 
HOT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some examples of the good, the bad and the ugly:
</P>
<P>
   One reason Dale Jarrett has moved into the series lead is 14
straight top-10 finishes. Jarrett began the season in 36th after
finishing 37th in the season-opening Daytona 500. He hasn't
finished worse than 11th since Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte has 13 top-10 finishes, including two wins.
</P>
<P>
   Do you think rookie Tony Stewart has greatly benefited from
having Labonte as a teammate? Stewart has posted nine straight
top-15 finishes. &QL; 
NOT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ted Musgrave has only one top-10 finish this season.
</P>
<P>
   Two drivers with famous last names are struggling. Kyle Petty
has finished 27th or worse in four of the past six races, and
Michael Waltrip has finished 37th or worse in four of the past six
races. Ugh.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone at Roush Racing is a success story. Johnny Benson
only has two top-10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   Has anyone seen Ricky Rudd? In 17 starts this season, Rudd, who
has won at least one race in 16 consecutive seasons, is still
seeking his first top-10 finish. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ON SECOND THOUGHT . . . &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly five months ago, staff writer Mark Armijo attempted to
predict which NASCAR Winston Cup drivers would finish in the top 10
and therefore receive invitations to ``sit on the stage'' at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York City, the site of the
season-ending awards banquet. The following are Armijo's
predictions, current standings, analysis and adjusted predictions. &QL;

BAY STATE GOVERNOR SEES BENEFIT TO FLEET-BANKBOSTON MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Bucking the tide of political protest against New
England's largest bank merger, Governor Paul Cellucci said Friday
that the Fleet-BankBoston combination was good for the region.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, speaking for the first time about the deal, set
himself against an array of Democratic officials from Massachusetts
and Connecticut who have forcefully criticized the $16 billion
transaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``For Boston and Massachusetts to have a financial institution
like this is a huge plus for our economy and the economy of New
England,'' Cellucci, a Republican, said in an interview Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But he suggested that industry regulators might take the unusual
step of forcing the new bank to make concrete promises to carry out
its multibillion-dollar community investment proposal.
</P>
<P>
   An unusually large number of elected and appointed officials
have criticized or opposed Fleet's acquisition of its former rival,
which is expected to gain regulatory approval later this year. The
officials have been joined by hundreds of community activists, who
are worried about the merger's impact on competition.
</P>
<P>
   Critics include US Representatives Barney Frank of Newton and
Michael E. Capuano of Somerville, State Senator Dianne Wilkerson of
Roxbury, attorneys general in Massachusetts and Connecticut, and
Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino. They say the combined bank's plan to
provide $14.6 billion for affordable housing, small business loans,
and urban revitalization projects may not be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Community groups that channel Fleet housing loans to low-income
borrowers are upset that the new Fleet has said it will not sign
any concrete agreements to work with specific groups. Activists
groups worry that without agreements, some of the $14.6 billion
will go unspent.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci said regulators might move ``to attach a condition
to the merger that ensures that commitments are fulfilled.'' He did
not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   While Cellucci said his principal concern about the merger was
the 5,000 jobs that the combined company will eliminate, he said
the booming economy would absorb laid off workers.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci joined opponents to the deal on one point. He urged the
combined bank to sell some of the $14 billion in assets it is
divesting to meet antitrust rules to community banks. ``We need to
continue to have competition and small banks,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fleet took a drubbing at a public hearing held earlier this week
by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, whose parent, the Federal
Reserve Board, must approve the merger.
</P>
<P>
   A second public hearing, at the State House, is set for Tuesday.
At that session, Cellucci will join state banking commissioner
Thomas Curry, Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien, and Department of
Revenue Commissioner Frederick Laskey in discussing the
Fleet-BankBoston merger's impact on the community. The session,
which is open to all, is organized by the Board of Bank
Incorporation, a state agency that must approve the combination.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Leonard, the board's secretary, said board members
``would likely ask a lot of questions on a variety of topics,''
ranging from capital investment in the community to urban
investment proposals.

   It was the midseason strike year of 1981 and the All-Star Game
was delayed until August. But if the fans were angry at the
players, it didn't show at the box office at Cleveland's Municipal
Stadium, where an All-Star-record crowd of 72,000-plus showed up to
see the Nationals win for the 10th consecutive time (5-4). The
Mets' Gary Carter stroked a pair of homers, the second of which
brought the National League back to within a run, and then the
Phillies' Mike Schmidt erased a 4-2 AL lead when he hit a two-run
shot in the eighth off Rollie Fingers of the Brewers. Fifty-six
players got into the game, an All-Star record.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>

   There was also some history made by former Red Sox outfielder
Fred Lynn at Comiskey Park in Chicago, when the All-Star Game
celebrated its 50th anniversary in the park where it all began. On
July 6, 1983, Lynn, then a member of the California Angels, cranked
out his fourth All-Star Game home run _ and the first grand slam in
history. It came in the bottom of the third off San Francisco's
Atlee Hammaker, capping a seven-run inning that gave the AL a 9-1
lead en route to a 13-3 victory. It was just the second win in 21
All-Star Games for the AL, which got three perfect innings and four
strikeouts from starter Dave Stieb of Toronto. The AL's six hits
and seven runs in one inning was an All-Star record and also
included a homer by Boston's Jim Rice. All of which led to another
record _ the biggest margin of victory in the game's history.

   Hall of Famer Lefty Gomez was a familiar face on All-Star Game
programs from 1933-38 when he started for the American League five
times (he didn't appear in 1936 in Boston) and wound up with two
wins (the first game in 1933 in Chicago and in 1937 in Washington)
and a loss (1938 in Cincinnati). The Yankee Hall of Famer pitched
18 All-Star innings, giving up only 11 hits and five earned runs,
while striking out nine and walking three. Gomez's streak of
consecutive starts was interrupted by another ``lefty,'' Boston's
Lefty Grove, the starter and loser in the '36 game in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His name was Max West, an outfielder for the National League's
Boston Bees and the starting right fielder for the senior circuit
in the 1940 All-Star Game at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis, home of
the long-since-gone St. Louis Browns of the American League. West,
who would hit a team-best 12 homers for the sorry, 65-87
seventh-place (out of eight teams) Bees, managed by Casey Stengel,
had just one at-bat in an All-Star game, but it was a memorable
one.
</P>
<P>
   West homered off the Yankees' Red Ruffing before an out was made
in the first inning of the '40 game. The three-run blast was all
the Nationals needed en route to a 4-0 victory. West's appearance
was brief. In the second inning, he crashed into the right-field
wall trying to field Luke Appling's line drive and had to leave the
game. His injury was not serious. Not bad _ one All-Star at-bat,
one game-winning homer for the native of Dexter, Mo., who hit just
.254 in seven major league seasons with 77 homers.
</P>

<P>
   The outbreak of World War II and the weather had an impact on
the 1942 All-Star Game, originally scheduled for Ebbets Field in
Brooklyn, but moved to the more spacious Polo Grounds in New York
City because the game's proceeds were to go to war charities. The 6
p.m. game had problems even before the first pitch thrown by the
Cardinals' Mort Cooper, who wound up the loser in the 3-1 AL
victory. There were rain showers in the afternoon and then a more
torrential downpour came just before game time, holding attendance
down to 34,178. It was a strange day in the Big Apple: The only run
by the home team came off the bat of Dodgers catcher Mickey Owen,
who came up as a pinch hitter in the eighth and hit a home run.
Ironically, he didn't hit a home run in 133 regular-season games
that year.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, you don't need a lot of hits to win an All-Star Game.
The National League had just three in 1993 at Texas, the biggest an
eighth-inning homer by the Marlins' Jeff Conine off loser Steve
Ontiveros of Oakland that broke a 2-2 tie and gave the Nationals a
3-2 victory. It was a frustrating defeat for the American League,
which took a 2-0 lead, only to see all the NL hits leave the park.
The others were by the Dodgers' Mike Piazza and the Astros' Craig
Biggio, making a winner of Phillies pitcher Heathcliff Slocumb, who
struck out two batters in an inning of work.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes you need a lot of time to finish the job: While
1967 may be remembered by New Englanders as the year of the
Impossible Dream Red Sox team, it's also the year it took 15
innings for the National League to dispatch the American League,
2-1, at Anaheim, setting an All-Star Game record for most innings.
Home runs accounted for all the scoring as Philadelphia's Dick
Allen hit one in the second, Baltimore's Brooks Robinson lauched
one in the sixth, and then, finally, Cincinnati's Tony Perez made a
loser of KC hurler Catfish Hunter when he turned on an 0-1
fastball. Twelve pitchers accounted for 30 strikeouts, with the
Cubs' Ferguson Jenkins leading all hurlers with 6 K's. Carl
Yastrzemski, on his way to an MVP and Triple Crown season with the
Red Sox, had three hits and reached base five times.

1955: MUSIAL WINS IT WITH 12TH-INNING SHOT INTO BLEACHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Everyone knows that Stan ``The Man'' Musial has always
been a nice guy who has been eager to please teammates, fans, and
managers.
</P>
<P>
   And in addition to being a nice guy, he was a great hitter who
sometimes seemed so good he appeared to be able to hit on cue. So
when St. Louis manager Harry ``The Hat'' Walker, a coach for the
1955 National League All-Star team, begged Musial to get the game
over with as he went to the plate to open the bottom half of the
12th inning, The Hat was sure his wish would be granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's end this now,'' said The Hat. ``I'm getting hungry.''
</P>
<P>
   It only took one pitch. Catcher Yogi Berra wanted a fastball in.
The 6-foot-7-inch Red Sox righthander, starting his fourth full
inning of work, threw a fastball, but it wasn't in. ``It wasn't
what Yogi called,'' Frank Sullivan would later say. ``It was a
lousy pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   It was, in fact, right down Broadway, and The Man deposited it
in the right-field bleachers to give the comebacking National
League a 6-5 victory in a game it had once trailed, 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth of Musial's six All-Star Game homers, and it
is the one everyone remembers. It also made a surprising winner out
of Gene Conley, Mr. Happy Go Lucky himself. The 6-8 Milwaukee
righthander, then in between stints with the Boston Celtics, had
picked up the victory after striking out Al Kaline, Mickey Vernon,
and Al Rosen on 14 pitches in the top half of the 12th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just throwing mostly curveballs and trying to keep the
ball low,'' shrugged Conley, who had been the hard-luck loser in
Cleveland the year before when Nellie Fox hit a bloop two-run
single to give the AL an 11-9 victory.
</P>
<P>
   This was Milwaukee's first All-Star Game, and the baseball-mad
residents of Wisconsin were very proud to have it. The game start
was delayed by a half-hour in order that baseball dignitaries could
attend the funeral of Arch Ward, the editor of the Chicago Tribune.
Ward had conceived the idea of the All-Star Game 22 years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The delay was well worth the show of respect. The fans were
treated to a dramatic comeback victory by the home team, which
found itself down by a 5-0 count after the American League had
abused Philadelphia ace Robin Roberts, whose selection as the
starter struck many as a curious deviation from the Leo Durocher
norm.
</P>
<P>
   On any list of the most sentimental 100 million people drawing a
breath on the planet at any given time, Durocher would have ranked
no higher than 99,999,999. But the acerbic Giants mentor explained
his choice of 13-7 Roberts over the 14-1 Don Newcombe by saying
that he wanted Roberts to tie Lefty Gomez for the most All-Star
Game starts with five. He also said he thought everyone should
play, and he came within one man (St. Louis pitcher Luis Arroyo) of
fulfilling his pledge.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts always had a great propensity for dispensing home run
balls, and so it should not have come as any great shock when
Mantle jumped on a Roberts offering and hammered it into downtown
Oshkosh for a three-run homer that gave the AL a 4-0 lead in the
first. ``This sort of thing has happened to me before,'' reminded
the genial Philadelphia righthander.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by a 5-0 score entering the seventh, the Nationals
pecked away at Yankee standout Whitey Ford for a pair. In the top
of the eighth, AL manager Al Lopez did a very curious thing. With
his team leading by a 5-2 score, with the bases loaded and two
away, with five panting pitchers in the bullpen and with a
reasonable roster of available pinch hitters (this was, after all,
an All-Star Game), he allowed Ford to hit for himself, and against
a lefty?
</P>
<P>
   There were worse-hitting pitchers than Ford (.173 lifetime, with
three homers), but who could explain this? Lopez would soon regret
the decision. A grateful Joe Nuxhall, in the midst of some stellar
long relief, fanned Ford and the Nationals promptly tied the game
with three in the eighth off the Yankee lefthander, who had retired
the first two men in the inning. But singles by Willie Mays, Ted
Kluszewski, Randy Jackson, and Hank Aaron, mixed in with a disputed
Al Rosen error (he claimed that a throw from Kaline had hit
Jackson), produced the three runs.
</P>
<P>
   Mays had already made his presence deeply felt. Ted Williams
thought he'd be making the home run trot when he smashed a ball to
deep right-center in the seventh. But Mays, having entered the game
as a replacement for starter Duke Snider, made a leaping catch of a
ball that had already carried over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   As for Musial, prior to the 12th inning he had done nothing. The
game had begun with The Man on the bench. Musial was a first
baseman that year, and the starter was Cincinnati's hulking
Kluszewski, who would drive in 113 that year while leading the
league in hits. Durocher got around that by sending Musial up to
hit for left-field starter Del Ennis in the fourth and then leaving
him there for the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
   For seven innings, Musial did nothing to justify the tribute,
striking out his first time up before grounding out twice.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan had relieved Ford in the eighth, and skipper Lopez must
have liked what he was seeing because he never came out. He was
even allowed to hit for himself off Nuxhall with a man on first in
the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Nuxhall was a pretty good story himself. He will always have a
place in baseball history as the youngest player ever to perform in
a big league game (he was 15 years 10 months old when he pitched
two-thirds of an inning for the 1944 Reds), but after that he faded
out of sight, not resurfacing in a big league uniform until 1952
and then performing in the relative anonymity of Cincinnati, an
out-of-sight-out-of-mind franchise in the early '50s. But he had a
major breakthrough in 1955, earning his way onto the squad at age
27 en route to a 17-12 season.
</P>
<P>
   But he was an unknown in the American League, so much so that
this very newspaper ran a follow-up story to his 3 1/3 innings of
scoreless ball with the headline, ``WHO IS JOE NUXHALL?''
</P>
<P>
   The American League thought it had broken through in the 11th.
There were two out and two on when Berra bounced one over second.
Red Schoendienst made the play, throwing across his body to get
Berra at first as the speedy Bobby Avila was scoring from second.
Or did he? Berra sure didn't think so. But National League umpire
Dusty Boggess did, and nothing else mattered.
</P>
<P>
   With the crowd still buzzing from that bit of excitement, Musial
digested Harry The Hat's orders as he walked to the plate. Billy
Hoeft, Bob Turley, Jim Wilson, Dick Donovan (pride of Wollaston,
Mass.), and Lopez's own rookie fireballing sensation, Herb Score,
were all available to pitch, but Frank Sullivan was still out
there. No one will ever know why.
</P>
<P>
   Musial exchanged pleasantries with the notoriously chatty Berra,
telling Yogi that he was tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' replied Berra, ``ain't it tough, trying to see with
all them shadows?''
</P>
<P>
   Yogi wagged his index finger. Sullivan threw the pitch. Musial
swung. There was no suspense. It was gone the instant it left the
bat. The tired man could jog around the bases.

1949: NEWCOMBE, CAMPANELLA, ROBINSON, DOBY BREAK COLOR BARRIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The New York Sun enticed its drama critic, Ward
Morehouse, to meander off Broadway and head out to Brooklyn to
write a review of the 1949 All-Star Game at Ebbetts Field.
Morehouse came back with these words, ``It was all very poky, all
very slow and occasionally embarrassing . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. And a gloomy, rainy day in Brooklyn did not aid the
stage effects.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, even a half-century later, Don Newcombe still turns in his
office to look at a photo _ one of those stock, staged photos that
newspaper photographers took in those days _ and grins. The photo
was taken before that game, a photo of four players lined up in
front of the dugout, each with one foot on the top step. The four
are Newcombe, Brooklyn teammates Jackie Robinson and Roy
Campanella, and Larry Doby of the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper stories of the day paid scant attention to a
historic barrier tumbling, many more consumed with the controversy
that ensued when American League manager Lou Boudreau chose to
start Joe DiMaggio in center instead of the Red Sox' Dom DiMaggio,
forcing one of the fans' outfield choices _ New York's Tommy
Henrich _ out of the lineup. Joe DiMaggio, recovering from an
injury, had not played regularly that season until two weeks
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year's All-Star Game marked the first time in history
that a Negro player performed in the Classic,'' was the caption in
The Sporting News to that photo that still warms Newcombe's soul.
``Four Negroes were chosen and all appeared in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   For so, so many reasons, Newcombe was proud. For one, ``I had
been in the league only six weeks and here I was in the All-Star
Game,'' recalled Newcombe, who still works for the Los Angeles
Dodgers. ``I had been called up from the minors and didn't get to
Brooklyn until May 17th and (Boston Braves and National League
manager) Billy Southworth still selected me for the squad. I had
pitched pretty good once I was called up _ I think I was 8 and 2 _
but I never expected to be in the All-Star Game. But Southworth
took me and was I proud to be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more, ``to be there with Jackie and Campy and Larry made me
even prouder. I remember when that picture was taken of us, all of
us knew it was historic. And I remember Campy saying to the three
of us when we were on those dugout steps, `Guys, we've certainly
made it . . . Here we are . . . Now, let's make the most of it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As Newcombe recalled those days, the racial taunts from other
players had grown less frequent. but the same could not be said of
the fans. ``The guys playing were veterans and they were also
veterans of the war and they were tired of that racism crap,''
recalled Newcombe. ``(Brooklyn teammate) Pee Wee Reese would say,
`Who are these guys but Americans playing in the All-Star Game of
America's sport, baseball.' ''
</P>
<P>
   And if some fans weren't as open-minded as Reese, those four
``Negroes'' on the dugout steps at Ebbetts Field in Brooklyn were
more concerned about putting on an All-Star-caliber performance, to
prove they truly were All-Stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing before the Brooklyn fans and they were seeing
a first with us playing,'' said Newcombe, ``and now this was
another first for the Brooklyn fans. They had seen a first two
years earlier when Jackie was called up from Montreal and now this.
It was important for us to prove we were All-Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1949 All-Star Game was baseball's 16th and by then it had
developed into a minuscule version of what it is now _ a convention
of baseball people talking baseball issues. Players had few rights
then _ baseball owners turned down a player's request that day in
Brooklyn that would have allowed players to bring their wives and
families to spring training, for instance _ and the Boston and New
York players had to endure a most grueling two days so owners could
make extra money.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1949 version of ``interleague play,'' the Red Sox and
Braves had played Monday night before 36,607 fans at Fenway Park
(the Red Sox won, 6-2, pummeling Boston Braves rookie pitcher
Johnny Antonelli), while the Yankees, New York Giants, and Dodgers
played in a series of round-robin games for the bragging rights to
New York City that same night at Yankee Stadium. The next
afternoon, of course, the All-Stars had to be in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The grueling two days took its toll on the Game's starting
pitchers, both from Boston _ Mel Parnell of the Red Sox and Warren
Spahn of the Braves. ``Spahn had nothing,'' recalled Newcombe, and
Parnell was little better.
</P>
<P>
   Only four batters into the first inning, Southworth had Newcombe
warming up in the bullpen after Joe DiMaggio singled in Detroit's
George Kell, as the American League piled up four runs. In the
bottom of the first, the National League answered with two runs off
Parnell, the rally started by a Robinson double to left-center in
his first All-Star at-bat. The Cardinals' Stan Musial followed with
a blast high over the right-field screen onto Flatbush Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I got the loss in that game,'' said Newcombe. ``But
I thought I pitched well. If it wasn't for that guy Williams . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Williams, the outfielder, that is, not Ted Williams the
batter. Newcombe had been waved in from the bullpen in the second
inning after Spahn had walked Williams _ playing with a broken rib
_ on four pitches. ``I was nervous,'' said Newcombe, but the righty
got Joe DiMaggio to pop out to Pittsburgh's Ralph Kiner in left and
the Philadelphia A's Eddie Joost on another pop-up to end the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the bottom half of the inning that still rankles
Newcombe. ``If if wasn't for all that controversy about Williams,
all that controversy about his fielding and how he couldn't play
the field, then maybe he doesn't get to the ball,'' said Newcombe
of the game's turning point.
</P>
<P>
   When Parnell hit Phillies catcher Andy Seminick on the arm, the
bases had been loaded with no outs. Newcombe was the next batter,
``and I don't know if they knew in the other league that I could
hit,'' he recalled. Boudreau removed Parnell and brought in Detroit
righty Virgil ``Fire'' Trucks.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Fire' Trucks threw me a fastball and I hit it pretty good to
left . . . and I thought it might be a home run, a lot of people
did,'' recalled Newcombe. But Williams _ broken rib and all _
``raced over and he made a great running catch at the wall. If Ted
doesn't catch the ball, the bases are cleared and we're ahead. All
I know is if Ted was as bad an outfielder as they were saying, he
would have missed that ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The baseball world would love to go the videotape on this
because Williams apparently made a Willie Mays-style catch, but one
sportswriter's description suggests Williams's catch was brilliant:
``Williams made a spectacular gloved hand running catch of
Newcombe's drive, snaring the ball several feet in front of the
leftfield wall with his back to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of at least three runs, the NL only scored one. By the
fourth inning, though, it had a 5-4 lead, ``when Eddie Joost hit
this little squibbler off me, right off the end of his bat, to Gil
Hodges at first.'' Kell had singled and Williams had walked, and
both runners had moved up, ``and then the ball took a crazy hop
just as it got to Hodges and it got by him.''
</P>
<P>
   Two runs for the American League. One loss for Newcombe.
</P>
<P>
   But Newcombe still glances at the photo of the four ``Negroes''
who played in that game and the loss takes little of the luster
from the day. ``We had talked about it, that maybe one of us or
some of us had a chance to be selected to the All- Star Game,''said
Newcombe. ``It meant so much. It made us so very happy and so proud
and here we were . . . All-Stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe paused for an instant. ``You know, it wasn't just us,''
he said. ``A lot of people were very happy and a lot of people were
very proud that we were All-Stars.''

1971: TOWERING SHOT BY REGGIE SHAPES HIS LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- After 28 years it still ranks among the most famous
home runs ever hit in an All-Star Game. Purists remind you that
Reggie Jackson's 523-foot blast in the 1971 classic actually never
left Tiger Stadium. But does it really matter?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it was a blow that helped shape Jackson's legacy.
With Jackson's help, the American League broke an eight-game losing
steak and scored a 6-4 victory over the National League before
53,559. The teams combined for six home runs in the 42d midsummer
classic. But it was Jackson's blast that went down in history.
</P>
<P>
   The ball seemed headed toward downtown Detroit. Instead, the
ball _ still on the rise _ struck a light tower transformer at a
point around 60 feet above the roof, which stands 82 feet above the
playing field. Jackson, who was pinch-hitting for his Oakland A's
teammate Vida Blue, stopped only a few feet out of the batter's
box, as if to salute his achievement.
</P>
<P>
   The victim was Pittsburgh Pirates righthander Dock Ellis. With a
3-and-2 count, he threw Jackson a high slider over the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Stadium had mystified hitters for years, which only added
to the shock of Jackson's home run. There had been 13 balls hit
over the roof. Jackson was credited with No. 14. (To date, there
only have been 35 home runs to leave Tiger Stadium on the fly.
Thirty-one have cleared the roof in right. Only four have gone out
over the roof in left.)
</P>
<P>
   Designed as a 23,000-seat, open-end stadium, Navin Field grew
into a double-deck stadium that by 1936 seated 36,000. Two years
later, the park was enclosed and renamed Briggs Stadium after owner
Walter Briggs. Once the improvements were complete, the park was as
inviting as Fenway Park and just as difficult to master. Hitters
mostly took aim at the short porches down each line, 340 feet in
left and 325 in right.
</P>
<P>
   The fences were difficult to reach in the power alleys (365 and
375, respectively), and an impossible 440 feet away in straightaway
center field. To lift the ball out of the Stadium required a stroke
that encouraged fly balls. A fly ball to anywhere but down the line
was like a missile heading for Death Valley. Tigers pitchers lived
off such an advantage. Most deep fly balls were caught. Jackson
knew this, and he had the strength to pull a power pitch and lift
it.
</P>
<P>
   On this day in 1971, the National League All-Star team was
loaded with Hall of Fame sluggers: Hank Aaron, Willie Mays, Johnny
Bench, Roberto Clemente, and Willie McCovey. Aaron, Bench, and
Clemente all hit opposite-field home runs to right, but only
Bench's came with a man on base. There were three two-run homers
hit by the American Leaguers, one each by Jackson, Frank Robinson,
and Harmon Killebrew. Only Robinson's homer went to the opposite
field. The other two challenged the park and won.
</P>
<P>
   Although he had made the All-Star team in 1969, Jackson wasn't
even supposed to be on the '71 team. The fans preferred to see
Robinson, Carl Yastrzemski, and Bobby Murcer. Manager Earl Weaver
added Killebrew, and hometown hero Al Kaline was playing his final
All-Star Game. Only when Tony Oliva of Minnesota came up lame did
Weaver elect to add Jackson to the team.
</P>
<P>
   The NL was leading in the third inning, 3-0, when Jackson got
the call. Blue had thrown only seven pitches in the first inning.
But in the second, he hit Stargell with a pitch. Bench followed
with a two-run homer to right-center, and the Nationals had a 2-0
lead. Then Aaron homered in the third. ``They said this guy (Blue)
throws as hard as Sandy Koufax,'' said Aaron. ``I've just got to
say that's just not true.''
</P>
<P>
   But Blue turned out to be an afterthought after what happened in
the bottom of the third. Ellis, a surprise starter, gave up a
leadoff single to Red Sox veteran shortstop Luis Aparicio. Jackson
was announced as the pinch hitter for Blue, which started the crowd
buzzing. Jackson had led the AL in 1969 with 47 home runs and was
as dangerous as any NL slugger. He also led the league in
strikeouts his first three seasons. The fans expected fireworks,
but nothing like what transpired.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis ran the count full and geared for the ultimate
confrontation _ fastball pitcher vs. fastball hitter. Instead,
Ellis threw a high slider. Jackson did not get cheated. He circled
the bases with that home run strut that would become his trademark.
After the game, Jackson dedicated the home run to Robinson, who was
named the game's most valuable player. Robinson's two-run homer off
Ellis later in the inning had put his team ahead to stay, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Killebrew hit his two-run homer off Ferguson Jenkins of the Cubs
in the sixth inning. But it was the rocket hit by Jackson that will
always be remembered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the longest home run I've ever seen,'' recalled Kaline.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson agreed. ``I feel my home run picked us up,'' he said.
``I went up there with the idea of just doing the job. I just
wanted to meet the ball. He's right. That's probably the longest
ball I've ever hit. It's a good thing the tower was in the way. I
couldn't have hit it any farther if I'd used a fungo bat.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Jackson's warm feeling toward Robinson
extended beyond the All-Star Game. Robinson, a Baltimore Oriole,
had been his manager and mentor in Puerto Rico the previous winter.
He learned as much about life as he did about baseball, and this
was a great time to repay him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He straightened me out,'' said Jackson. ``He got me to control
my temper. He made me believe in myself. Don't throw your bat, he
told me. Don't get mad. You're a star. Give your ability a chance.
That's what I did.''

MEMORIES FOR EVERYONE IN BASEBALL'S ANNUAL CLASSIC 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARVIN PAVE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Moments historical and hysterical.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game has provided some of both, and the latter
brings to mind the Big Unit, Randy Johnson, who formed part of two
impromptu comedy acts, the first with John Kruk in 1993, and the
second with Larry Walker four years later.
</P>
<P>
   Act 1 took place at Baltimore's Camden Yards, where Seattle ace
Johnson threw two hitless innings during a 9-3 American League
victory. But it was the Johnson-Kruk act that stole the show after
the 6-foot-10-inch Johnson's first pitch to the Phillies first
baseman sailed over the batter's head to the backstop.
</P>
<P>
   Kruk had no stomach for any more 100 mile-per-hour fastballs
anywhere near the batter's box. He swung weakly at the next three
pitches and after the third futile swing, he never looked back.
Kruk took one big stride as he swung and missed and continued
walking to the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   In Act 2, the Johnson-Walker duo at Jacobs Field brought back
memories of Johnson-Kruk. In a game in which the American League
was again victorious, 3-1, Johnson, the AL starter, threw two
hitless innings. And when he faced Rockies right fielder and former
teammate Walker, it was deja vu _ his first pitch in the
lefty-vs.-lefty confrontation went right over Walker's head.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for Walker.
</P>
<P>
   He then put his batting helmet on backward and stepped across
the plate to bat righthanded. He took another pitch (a ball) before
returning to the left side and drawing a walk without taking the
bat off his shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Being blown away by a pitcher is one thing, but a pitcher being
blown off the mound?
</P>
<P>
   It happened at the 1961 classic at Candlestick Park in San
Francisco, and it enabled the Americans to tie the game in the
ninth inning before losing to the Nationals in the 10th, 5-4. The
AL trailed, 3-1, in the ninth and had a rally going. Stu Miller, a
hometown hero, was called in from the bullpen to stem the tide.
That's when the gale force winds actually caused Miller to lose his
balance, fall away from the mound, and balk, which advanced two
runners to second and third. The next batter, Cleveland's Rocky
Colavito, hit a ground ball that scored the tying run. One could
say it was the first blown save in All-Star history.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Washington Senators pitcher Dean Stone was credited with the
easiest All-Star Game victory ever. He did it without throwing a
pitch in 1954 at Cleveland's Municipal Stadium. Stone came into the
game in the eighth inning after a two-run homer by Reds pinch
hitter Gus Bell had given the NL a 9-8 lead. There were two outs
and the Cardinals' Red Schoendienst on third base when Stone walked
to the mound in relief of the White Sox' Bob Keegan. But before
Stone threw his first pitch, Schoendienst broke for home and was
tagged out. The AL came back to win, 11-9, and Stone, who played
one uneventful season with the Red Sox three years later, got the
W.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Former Red Sox two-time ``Fireman of the Year'' Dick Radatz may
be remembered by some as the man who gave up a two-out, three-run
homer to the Phillies' Johnny Callison in the bottom of the ninth
at Shea Stadium in 1964 that enabled the NL to win, 7-4, but in
both the 1963 and '64 All-Star Games, Radatz still showed the
National Leaguers why he was affectionately called ``The Monster''
by Boston fans.
</P>
<P>
   Radatz struck out 10 batters, five in each game, in just 4 2/3
total innings. In the '63 game, his strikeout victims included
Willie Mays and Duke Snider. During his brief Red Sox career
(1962-66), the 6-foot-6-inch, 250-pound reliever had a 49-34 record
with a league-leading 62 appearances and 24 saves in his rookie
season and a league-best 29 saves in 1964. Radatz's Boston numbers
also included 286 relief appearances, 556 innings pitched, and 617
strikeouts. His 16 relief victories in 1964 is a Red Sox record and
his 79 appearances in 1964 is second best (to Greg Harris's 80) on
Boston's all-time list.

   Radatz may have stuffed a few fastballs by some future Hall of
Famers, but it was stuffing of another kind, at the All-Star ballot
box by Cincinnati Reds fans in 1956 and 1957 that temporarily took
the All-Star Game voting out of the hands of the fans. In '56, the
National League starting lineup included the Reds' Johnny Temple
(2B), Frank Robinson (LF), Gus Bell (CF), Ed Bailey (C) and Roy
McMillan (SS). Bell was selected as a starter over Giants great
Mays while Bailey got the nod over Dodgers slugger Roy Campanella.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, there were five Reds in the starting lineup again
_ Temple, Bailey, Robinson, McMillan, and Don Hoak (3B), who was
chosen over the Braves' Eddie Mathews. In fact, the ballot box
stuffing resulted in Reds players voted in as starters at every
position but first base, which so incensed commissioner Ford Frick
that he removed two Cincinnati players from the starting lineup. Oh
yes, the next year, in the 1958 game at Baltimore's Memorial
Stadium, not a single Cincinnati player appeared in the box score.

   Was there ever a better All-Star debut by a pitcher than that of
the Red Sox' Roger Clemens at the Astrodome in 1986? Nine batters
faced starter Clemens in three innings and it was nine up, nine
down. Clemens threw 21 strikes and just three balls, was named the
game's MVP and got the win in a 3-2 American League victory in his
home state. But the '86 game was a historic occasion as well for
the Dodgers' Fernando Valenzuela, who tied Carl Hubbell's record
with five consecutive strikeouts in the fourth and fifth innings
(New York's Don Mattingly, Baltimore's Cal Ripken, Toronto's Jesse
Barfield, Detroit's Lou Whitaker, and Milwaukee's Teddy Higuera).

   Two years earlier, Valenzuela and the Mets' Dwight Gooden _ who,
at 19, was the youngest player in All-Star history, set a
multi-pitcher record with six straight All-Star K's. In the fourth,
Valenzuela punched out sluggers Dave Winfield (New York), Reggie
Jackson (California), and George Brett (Kansas City). Gooden, in
the fifth, then struck out Lance Parrish (Detroit), Chet Lemon
(Detroit), and fellow rookie Alvin Davis (Seattle). It was a game
of memorable pitching as Oakland's Bill Caudill also struck out
three batters in a row, Tim Raines (Montreal), National League MVP
Ryne Sandberg (Chicago), and Keith Hernandez (New York).

1934: RUTH, GEHRIG, FOXX, SIMMONS, CRONIN GO DOWN SWINGING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- There were six doubles, two triples, and two home
runs. There were 26 runs scored. There was a six-run inning. There
was even the classic exhibition game circumstance of a man (Billy
Herman) pinch hitting in the third inning, retiring back to the
bench, and then being allowed back into the game four innings later
in time to lash out a double.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from direct descendants and particularly obsessed members
of The Society for American Baseball Research (SABR), no one
remembers any of that. There is only one thing people recall about
the 1934 All-Star Game, and that is Carl Hubbell and his
unforgettable run of strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Classic baseball folklore includes Bobby Thomson's home run, The
Babe calling his shot, Mickey Owen missing the third strike, and
Pudge Fisk whacking one off the foul pole. It includes Don Larsen's
perfect game and Bill Mazeroski's homer. In the All-Star Game, it
most certainly includes Ted Williams's homer off Claude Passeau and
Pete Rose bowling over Ray Fosse at home plate.
</P>
<P>
   But in terms of All-Star Game pitching feats, there is one
standing far, far apart from all others. On July 10, 1934, in the
Polo Grounds, the National League's Carl Hubbell wrote himself some
baseball history by striking out the final three men of the first
inning and the first two of the second. Any self-respecting
baseball historian knows the names by heart, and almost invariably
rattles them off so quickly it's as if the five men had one name:
</P>
<P>
   Ruthgehrigfoxxsimmonscronin.
</P>
<P>
   OK, if you insist. Babe Ruth. Lou Gehrig. Jimmie Foxx. Al
Simmons. Joe Cronin.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest player of all. The two greatest first basemen. A
truly punishing slugger of an outfielder. One of the all-time great
shortstops. Five Hall of Famers. Punch out, punch out, punch out,
punch out, punch out. Whiff, whiff, whiff, whiff, whiff. All
swinging. Take a seat, fellas.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Grantland Rice, himself a charter member of any
writer's Hall of Fame, was on the scene, and once again Grantland
Rice was at his hyperbolic best as he informed a baseball-loving
nation just what had taken place in this pre-television age
ballgame before the charmed spectators in Carl Hubbell's own home
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main glory went to the Carthage Catapault . . . It was
Carl Owen Hubbell, of Carthage, Missouri, who rode the skyline and
earned the vocalistic uprising of about 50,000 fans,'' said Rice.
``This great crowd paid its tribute to a stout heart, a keen brain,
and a great left arm when Carl Hubbell struck out Babe Ruth, Lou
Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons, and Joe Cronin in succession
through the first and second innings with a baffling assortment of
curves, screwballs and zigzags that stood five of baseball's
greatest hitters on their well-known heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five years later, who recalls the fact that Simmons would
subsequently bang out a pair of doubles and that both Foxx and
Cronin would each rip a double? Who recalls that Cleveland's Mel
Harder would pitch five heroic innings of one-hit baseball to pick
up the win? Who recalls that Earl Averill, one of the American
League's great players of the '30s, entered the game as a pinch
hitter for starter Lefty Gomez in the fifth and stayed around long
enough to smash a triple and double, good for three runs batted in?
Who even remembers that the American League won the game, 9-7?
</P>
<P>
   No, the only thing people remember about the 1934 All-Star Game
is that once and future Most Valuable Player Carl Hubbell struck
out Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx, Al Simmons, and Joe Cronin
in succession.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Hubbell was 31 years old and he was in his prime. The '34
season was the second of what would be five consecutive 20-win
seasons for the Giants, who had signed him as a minor league free
agent six years earlier following his release by the Detroit
organization.
</P>
<P>
   It was a career Ty Cobb had almost crushed. For it was the
crusty Detroit skipper who had forbidden Carl Hubbell from throwing
his favorite pitch. The Tigers had purchased Hubbell from Oklahoma
City for the hefty sum of $20,000, but when Cobb checked out his
organization's newest acquisition, he didn't like what he saw. For
Hubbell's best pitch was a screwball, and Cobb didn't like
screwballs. He told Hubbell that the screwball, which is thrown
with a violent counter-clockwise twist of the wrist, would hurt his
arm, and he forbade the young Missourian from throwing it. The
problem was that Hubbell was lost without it, and his performance
proved it.
</P>
<P>
   But a Giants scout recommended Hubbell to the legendary John
McGraw, and McGraw was one manager who had nothing against
screwballs. He had once managed a pretty fair exponent of the
screwball, and he knew how effective a pitch it could be. The
pitcher in question was Christy Mathewson, and the great
righthander called it a fadeaway, but it was six of one and a half
dozen of the other to Mr. McGraw. All he knew was that people
couldn't hit it.
</P>
<P>
   After an 18-win season in 1932, Hubbell had it all figured out.
He was 23-12 with a league-leading 1.66 ERA for the pennant-winning
Giants in '33, and now in '34 he was en route to a 21-win season.
His screwball was now baseball's most famous pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbell was ahead, 1-0, as the American League came to bat in
the first. Charlie Gehringer, one of the great All-Star Game
performers ever, led off with a single. Heinie Manush walked. The
heart of the order was coming up.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth was 39 and he had the belly, but he was still Babe Ruth and
he was going to finish with 22 homers. He went down swinging on a
2-2 pitch. Gehrig carried no asterisk. In 1934 he would hit a
league-leading .363, swat a league-leading 46 homers, and slug a
league-leading .706. He fanned on a 1-2 pitch as Gehringer and
Manush excuted a double steal. Hubbell was unfazed. He got the
menacing Foxx (.311, 44, 130 that year) on three straight
screwballs.
</P>
<P>
   Simmons led off in the second. The famed man with the
foot-in-the-bucket stance, a .334 career hitter, became the fourth
straight K victim. You could hear King Carl yelling ``Next!'' as
Cronin, the AL's player/manager, stepped into the plate. Cronin
would drive in 101 that year, but on this ocassion he would take
his three-strike medicine and sit down.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Dickey broke the spell with a single, but there wasn't much
doubt what would happen next, because the No. 9 man was Gomez.
Boom, boom, boom. Six strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the game featured a little bit of everything. ``A
great scene,'' declared Rice, ``full of thrills and drab moments,
brilliant spots and bonehead plays.'' Only one thing has survived
in memory from that game. What Carl Hubbell did was so spectacular
it even drew a rare whimsical remark from laconic NL manager Bill
Terry, his own New York Giants skipper.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like you've been holding out on me,'' cracked Terry,
normally the most serious of men.
</P>
<P>
   Not holding out. Just warming up. Hubbell would win as many as
26 for Terry in 1936 and would construct a record 24 straight wins.
Until the '34 All-Star Game, Carl Hubbell was known as a very good
pitcher. After Ruthgehrigfoxxsimmonscronin he became a Star.

1941: WILLIAMS HOMER IN NINTH CAPS RALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- He was born in 1918, in the dying days of one world
war, and broke into the big leagues in 1939, as German tanks rolled
across Europe in the first days of a second global conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1941, Ted Williams was 22 years old. Within a
year, he would be in the Marines, training to be a fighter pilot.
</P>
<P>
   But first the skinny kid from San Diego would give an entire
nation a reason to turn its worried eyes from the dark dispatches
crawling across the front pages to follow his hitting exploits on
the sports pages.
</P>
<P>
   This was the summer Ted Williams hit .406. No one has hit over
.400 since.
</P>
<P>
   And in the middle of that summer, on July 8, 1941, in Briggs
Stadium in Detroit, Williams would crystallize the magnificence of
that season into a single swing, delivering what is still
considered the most dramatic moment in All-Star history.
</P>
<P>
   With the American League trailing, 5-4, with two outs in the
bottom of the ninth, Williams hit a walkoff three-run home run off
Chicago Cubs pitcher Claude Passeau, a drive that struck the
football press box high in the right-field stands. It was the first
All-Star Game to be won in the last inning.
</P>
<P>
   There since have been others, including Johnny Callison's home
run off Red Sox pitcher Dick Radatz in the 1964 game. But the home
run struck by Teddy Ballgame still ranks No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   And if Williams ever expressed more joy than he did during that
crazy chicken dance he did while spinning around the bases, Dom
DiMaggio hasn't seen it. ``I've never seen him happier,'' DiMaggio
said. ``I was in the on-deck circle when Ted hit the home run. He
was so excited. He was extremely jubilant, jumping up and down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Feller, the Indians' Hall of Famer, was the American
League's starting pitcher that day. ``I gave up a hit to the first
guy (Stan Hack), retired the next nine, and took a shower,'' he
said. ``I was in street clothes, sitting on the bench next to Ted,
in the ninth inning. We were just passing the time of day. He was
anxious to get up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams almost didn't get the chance. The National Leaguers had
taken a 5-2 lead when Arky Vaughan, the Pittsburgh Pirates' Hall of
Fame shortstop who would hit just six home runs all season, hit his
second homer of the afternoon, a two-run shot in the eighth. His
first, also with a man aboard, had come an inning earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arky Vaughan, he was the star of the game until Ted,'' said
Bobby Doerr, Boston's Hall of Fame second baseman who was playing
in his first All-Star Game and had taken the train to Detroit with
Williams, his close friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a very unusual stance, a real, real open stance,''
Doerr said of Vaughan. ``He was a lefthanded hitter who could fly.
But that day he hit two balls for home runs, and they weren't
cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, who entered the game as a replacement for rightfielder
Jeff Heath, came to bat in the bottom of the eighth with his
brother Joe on board with a double. Dominic scored his brother with
a single, making the score 5-3. ``That's the only time I can ever
remember driving in Joe,'' DiMaggio said. ``Even when we went to
the (West) Coast to play exhibitions, I always batted leadoff and
Joe hit third or fourth.''
</P>
<P>
   The AL Stars were still down two runs at the start of the ninth
against Passeau, who five years later would start for the National
League in the 1946 All-Star Game in Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passeau's a good friend of mine, a guy I knew in Des Moines,
Iowa,'' Feller said. ``The Indians wanted to sign him, and were
supposed to scout him one afternoon, but they came to see me that
morning and missed him. They never signed him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a sinkerball pitcher, a control pitcher. He didn't
throw hard. He wasn't overpowering, but he had a great motion, like
Eddie Lopat or Whitey Ford.''
</P>
<P>
   Passeau, who had entered the game at the start of the seventh,
struck out Williams in the eighth. But with one out in the ninth,
Ken Keltner, the Indians third baseman whose flashing glove would
help end Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak nine days later,
pinch hit and bounced a single off the glove of shortstop Eddie
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees second baseman Joe Gordon, who had replaced Doerr, also
singled, and Cecil Travis of the Washington Senators walked to load
the bases. The next two batters? Joe DiMaggio and Ted Williams.
</P>
<P>
   National League manager Bill McKechnie stayed with Passeau, and
he appeared to have been rewarded for his faith when DiMaggio
struck a double-play ball to Miller. But the relay throw by
Brooklyn second baseman Billy Herman pulled first baseman Frank
McCormick off the bag, and DiMaggio was safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe really hustled down the line,'' Dominic DiMaggio said.
``He wasn't known as a good runner, but he ran like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Feller wouldn't hear of it. ``It was a bad throw,'' he said.
``What was he supposed to do, jog down the line?''
</P>
<P>
   First and third, one run in, two outs, Williams at the plate.
Dom DiMaggio, watching from the on-deck circle, saw the National
League infield gather around Passeau. He figured they were planning
to walk Williams, even if that meant putting the winning run on
second base, and pitch to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a big powwow for the longest time,'' said DiMaggio.
``Maybe they were talking about having Ted go after a bad pitch. I
was surprised they didn't walk Ted. But if they felt there was a
bigger risk in loading the bases and pitching to me, then that
makes me feel better.''
</P>
<P>
   Here, in Williams's own words to biographer John Underwood, is
what happened next:
</P>
<P>
   ``Passeau was always tough. He helped pitch the Cubs to the
pennant in 1945. He had a fast tailing ball that he'd jam a
lefthand hitter with, right into your fists, and if you weren't
quick he'd get it past you.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a competitor, and I knew he wasn't going to walk me if
he could help it, because in the eighth inning he had struck me
out. I was late on that one, and as I came up in the ninth I said
to myself, `Damn it, you've got to be quicker, you've got to get
more in front of this guy. You've got to be quicker.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked the count to 2 and 1, then he came in with that
sliding fastball around my bat, and I swung. No cutdown protection
swing, an all-out home run swing, probably with my eyes shut. My
first thought was that I was late again . . . But gee, it just kept
going, up, up, way up into the right-field stands.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates, including Feller in street clothes, gathered at
the plate to greet him. ``Our manager, Del Baker, kissed him in the
clubhouse,'' Doerr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just so happy,'' Williams told Underwood, ``I laughed
out loud.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-eight years later, the echoes of that laughter can still
be heard.

STARS NOT SHINING ON THE AIRWAVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The 1950 All-Star Game is remembered as the one in
which Ted Williams broke his elbow running into the wall at
Comiskey Park while catching a Ralph Kiner smash. It also is
remembered as the first to go into extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   The '50 midsummer classic, however, was historic for an entirely
different reason: NBC made it the first All-Star Game to reach a
national audience. The country had only about 400,000 televison
sets, half of them in New York. But the telecast, with Hall of Fame
broadcaster Jack Brickhouse on play-by-play, was seen by an
estimated 10 million viewers _ a rating of 16.5. Of all the
television sets turned on, 65 percent were tuned to the game, with
numerous viewers sitting in front of many of those sets.
</P>
<P>
   These remarkable numbers made believers out of baseball's team
owners. They had fought against televising games, arguing that the
money in baseball was at the gate, not in TV, and that the new
technology would cause fans to stay home. When a television
executive proposed using a center field camera at Yankee Stadium to
give viewers a better view of the pitch, owners balked because they
believed it would cut into attendance at the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   For its first All-Star Game telecast, NBC used all of three
black-and-white cameras.
</P>
<P>
   How, then, did NBC draw such huge numbers? The presence of eight
members of the dominant New York Yankees _ including future Hall of
Famers Joe DiMaggio, Yogi Berra, and Phil Rizzuto _ in the American
league lineup helped attract a national audience.
</P>
<P>
   The 1951 All-Star Game did even better: NBC earned a 27.3 rating
and a whopping 89 percent share.
</P>
<P>
   Those days are long gone. The television landscape has grown
exponentially, while expansion has had the unintended effect of
regionalizing what was once the national pastime. More than
anything else, the dip in All-Star Game ratings has symbolized the
decline in the game's mass appeal.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, television helped build the popularity of
baseball in the '50s and '60s. Ratings hovered in the mid-teens
before skyrocketing in 1967. The average rating for the 10 All-Star
Games in the '70s was 24.9, the highest occuring in 1970 when Curt
Gowdy, Tony Kubek, and Mickey Mantle called the 12-inning game from
Riverfront Stadium in Cincinnati. That game was made memorable by
Pete Rose running over catcher Ray Fosse to score the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   Since the '70s, however, television audiences for All-Star Games
have steadily declined. The '80s saw an average rating of 21.3,
while in the '90s ratings have nose-dived to a 14.1 average. Last
year's game, for instance, pulled a 13.3 rating. The 1997 game was
slightly worse, at 13.2.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials blame cable for the erosion of viewership. In
the '80s, viewers had a choice of about eight cable stations. By
the early '90s, that number had grown to about 30. And now the
number is about 70 _ and that is not counting Internet sites with
video.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has tried to improve its strike-damaged image by
introducing interleague games and wild-card playoffs. And last
year's home run race between Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa appeared
to give the sport a jolt of excitement. But none of this has
translated into increased viewership. Red Sox games are earning
about the same ratings as they did last season, even with their
surprising success.
</P>
<P>
   The All-Star Game has its supporters, of course. One of them is
Charley Steiner, who is will call Tuesday's game for ESPN Radio and
is unashamed to say he is excited. ``This is the one all-star game
that matters,'' he said. ``The difference is that there's a pride
between the National and American leagues. There's legitimate
interest among the fans to see the great matchups _ the great
pitchers against the great hitters; the great baserunners against
the great catchers. No one asks who the matchups are in the hockey
all-star game. And while basketball is a wonderful exhibition, no
one plays defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The big advantage baseball has is that its all-star game has no
competition from another major sport. ``It's become the cliched
midsummer night's classic,'' Steiner said. ``If you are any sort of
sports fan, the All-Star Game is it for the night.''
</P>
<P>
   Steiner is right. The All-Star Game, with its unique blend of
new stars and legends, is a classic game, a once-in a-lifetime
chance to see Pedro Martinez pitch against a lineup in which
McGwire is a just another big bat.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's problem is that it has not been able to move beyond
its core audience, and in today's television landscape it's all
about the causal fan, not the hardcore junky. At the rate of the
All-Star Game ratings decline, total viewership may be back to a
1950 level not too far into the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   And while Fox plans to use about 24 cameras to televise the
extravaganza at Fenway _ eight times the number NBC used in 1950 _
nothing will reverse the slide.

1970: ROSE SEALS REPUTATION; CLEVELAND CATCHER NEVER THE SAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE FAINARU  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The day before the 1970 All-Star Game, Pete Rose
invited Indians pitcher Sam McDowell for a night out in Cincinnati.
McDowell asked if he could bring along his young teammate, catcher
Ray Fosse, and the three players, along with their wives, spent a
cheerful evening eating, drinking, and talking baseball until about
1 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Rose and Fosse came together the next night under different
circumstances: the most memorable collision in the history of the
game. In the bottom of the 12th, Rose scored from second by
essentially turning himself into a projectile, running over Fosse a
split-second before the catcher received a throw from center
fielder Amos Otis. The National League won, 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   The concussive play, which in its time was replayed as much as
the Rodney King beatings, set off a brief national controversy and
changed the lives of both men. Fosse, who was 23 and, to many, as
promising as Johnny Bench, was never the same, and his 11-year
career is still remembered for a single moment in which he was
flattened before 60 million people. Rose used the play to burnish
his hard-nosed reputation, but the raw violence of it seemed to
hint at a dark side to his competitiveness that few had previously
seen.
</P>
<P>
   John Dowd, the investigator who later helped drive Rose out of
baseball on gambling charges, was once asked about Rose the player.
``I did not care for the hurting of Ray Fosse,'' Dowd said. ``I
thought it was completely unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Fosse suffered a fractured and separated left shoulder that went
undetected until the following spring. For years, he believed the
play had been clean. Rose, he thought, had started to go into a
head-first slide. But Fosse was straddling the third-base line and
Rose had nowhere else to go. Fosse believed that Rose's momentum as
he tried to pull himself out of the slide had led to the collision
_ a hard play, but a fair one.
</P>
<P>
   But later, Rose was quoted as saying that he couldn't have
looked his father in the eye if he had done it any other way.
``Besides, nobody told me they changed it to girls' softball
between third and home,'' he said in his 1989 autobiography with
Roger Kahn. Rose also embellished the story of his night out with
Fosse, conveniently forgetting to mention that he actually had
invited McDowell and that the players' wives had been present.
</P>
<P>
   Fosse came to believe that Rose had gone after him with malice.
Reading Rose's comments about not wanting to let his father down,
he said, ``probably was the worst day of my life, to read a
statement where a guy said he intentionally tried to do that,
without me being able to see him coming. He essentially blindsided
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't set well with me,'' said Fosse, a longtime Oakland
A's broadcaster. ``I'll be honest with you: I don't have anything
to do with Pete. All I know is my left shoulder continues to bother
me; I have a constant reminder of the play because of my left
shoulder. I'm not to the point where I see him and don't say hello,
but you have to be honest about what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   McDowell, a licensed psychologist who serves as a consultant to
Major League Baseball, said he still thinks Fosse believes the play
was clean. ``I'm speaking as a therapist, and knowing and
understanding Pete Rose, I think the water has been muddied solely
because of Pete's false bravado. Pete never had a very healthy ego.
And when he started making statements that can only be described as
bravado, it soured everybody's view of Pete. Once the false bravado
started the (expletive) hit the fan and people started taking
sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The setting for the play hardly could have been more dramatic.
Riverfront Stadium was two weeks old, President Nixon was in
attendance, and the rosters were filled with the giants of the era.
The National League boasted four members of The Big Red Machine _
Rose, Bench, Tony Perez, and Joe Morgan _ as well as Willie Mays,
Roberto Clemente, and Hank Aaron. Tom Seaver was the starting
pitcher. The American League had Frank and Brooks Robinson, Harmon
Killebrew, and Carl Yastrzemski, who was the game's MVP. Jim Palmer
was the AL starter.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was a natural choice to make the NL squad: a hometown kid
who had won two straight batting titles and hit .323 in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   Fosse was less obvious. It was his first full season, and he was
blossoming into a star despite the Tribe's ineptitude. Cleveland
sportswriters had to lobby for him by writing open letters to the
AL manager, Earl Weaver. He entered the All-Star break hitting .313
with 16 homers and 45 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Fosse had replaced starting catcher Bill Freehan in the fourth
inning and was still in the game when the American League took a
4-1 lead into the bottom of the ninth. Giants catcher Dick Dietz
who, like Fosse, was nicknamed Mule, came to the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Mule, I'll see you next spring,'' Fosse told him.
</P>
<P>
   Dietz promptly homered off Catfish Hunter and the NL scored two
more runs to tie the game before Rose struck to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``unfortunate 12th,'' as Fosse now calls it, Rose started
the rally with a single to center off Angels lefthander Clyde
Wright. He moved to second on a grounder up the middle by Dodgers
third baseman Bill Grabarkewitz. With the count 1-0, the Cubs' Jim
Hickman drilled another single to center, and Rose, followed down
the line by screaming third base coach Leo Durocher, tore for the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   In the replay, Rose is out of control, careening, stumbling as
he prepares to dive. ``I saw Fosse's shinguards; if I slid head
first, I woulda broken both collarbones,'' he said later. At the
last moment, realizing that Fosse stands solid in his path, Rose
pulls out of his slide, lowers his shoulder, and plows into the
catcher, who tumbles backward. For an instant, Rose stands over the
fallen man in apparent concern, but he is swept up by his
victorious teammates.
</P>
<P>
   McDowell was standing in the dugout runway, where he had been
asked to wait in case he was named MVP. ``You could literally hear
it, even down the runway where I was,'' he said. ``It was just like
you hear on TV in the NFL, only there were no pads.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose declined through his agent to be interviewed for this
article. In his autobiography, he said: ``I only play baseball one
way. The way my father taught me. I play hurt, I play tired, I play
hard as hell. Don't tell me it's an exhibition or it's spring
training. Don't tell me to take it easy between the lines. That's
not me. That's not my dad. If I play a charity softball game, for
nothing, not a dime, I go all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Fosse said he had expected Rose to slide around him. ``My job as
catcher was to position myself where the ball was coming,'' he
said. ``The ball started to tail up the line. I moved up a couple
feet and was not trying to do anything other than catch the ball,
find the runner and make the tag. As I was stretching for it I was
smoked.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose missed the first three games of the second half because of
a deep thigh bruise _ three of just 10 games he missed the entire
decade. Fosse missed none. When he went out to take batting
practice before his first game back, he found he could not lift his
left arm above his head. Tentatively, he told manager Alvin Dark
about the injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's OK, just handle the pitchers,'' Dark told him.
</P>
<P>
   Fosse stubbornly played two more months before breaking his
index finger on a foul ball. He hit just two more home runs that
season and only 39 over the next 7 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   In ensuing years, his career took on a tragic quality. He broke
the index finger on his throwing hand three straight seasons. In
Yankee Stadium one afternoon, someone hurled an M-80 from the
stands and it exploded next to his spikes, burning a hole in his
foot ``the size of a dime.'' In 1974, after he was traded to the
A's, he shattered a vertebrae trying to break up a fight between
Reggie Jackson and Billy North. He needed surgery when the injury
was misdiagnosed.
</P>
<P>
   He remains one of the most respected men in the game. His only
regret, he said, is not knowing the answer to the question: ``Would
I have been a 25-30 home run a year hitter? But that's the only
thing.'' He is grateful for winning two Gold Gloves, for playing in
two All-Star Games, for winning two world championships with the
A's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy to have had the opportunity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Fosse grew up in Marion, Ill., a small town in Southern
Illinois. His father left home when he was 8, and he was raised by
his hard-working mother, Pauline, who still distributes pies out of
their home.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when Rose was convicted of tax evasion, he was sent to
the minimum security prison at Marion, a stone's throw from the Ray
Fosse Softball Field.

 &HT;    SENATE OPENING BATTLE OVER 'PATIENTS' BILL OF RIGHTS'

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With control over the delivery of medical care at
stake, Congress this week takes up legislation aimed at curtailing
the power of the health insurance industry and managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   The battle over a ``patients' bill of rights'' pits some of the
most influential special interest groups against each another, and
both political parties are mindful of how the issue could play in
the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   On one side are doctors and consumers. They want to see the
managed care industry reined in, with doctors gaining more control
over treating patients and patients gaining more access to care.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are insurers, health maintenance
organizations, and business interests. The insurers and HMOs worry
they'll lose control of managed care, causing medical costs to
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Business groups worry that more federal regulation will increase
premiums and mean more Americans without health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   When debate starts this week in the Senate, the biggest fights
are likely to be over:
</P>
<P>
   _ Who is covered by the bill.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether it will guarantee access to physicians outside of
managed care plans.
</P>
<P>
   _ To what extent patients will be able to appeal decisions
regarding their coverage, such as whether to pay for a specific
procedure or whether to be treated in or out of a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   _ Whether patients will be able to sue if such decisions result
in injury or death.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican position, basically, is to limit the number of
people covered by the bill, curb the use of physicians outside of
managed care organizations, make it difficult for patients to
appeal if they're denied coverage or specific treatments, and
prohibit patients from suing over medical decisions _ whether those
decisions are made by an insurance company, an HMO or a business
which is self-insured.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic position is just the opposite: broaden the bill
to include all 160 million people covered by private insurance;
give patients and doctors wide latitude over medical treatment; and
allow patients to sue if a coverage decision causes harm.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Clinton told a rally at Harbor-UCLA Medical
Center in Torrance, Calif., that the Republican plan is far too
limited. The choice between the two parties plans is one between
``whether some people live or some people die,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, Democrats see themselves as benefitting most from
the issue. With polls showing public unease with HMOs, Democrats
have given passage of a patients' bill of rights top priority.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have sought to avoid a showdown. One reason is that
they know whatever position they take will offend at least one of
their usual constituencies: doctors, insurers or the business
community.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate, the first chamber to take up the issue, plans a
final vote on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the battleground was expected to be a series of
Democratic amendments aimed at strengthening a Republican bill
adopted on a party-line vote in March by the Senate Health,
Education and Labor Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But in a surprise move, GOP leaders decided last week to use a
Democratic bill as a starting point, with the final amendment being
offered by the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Senate could adopt all of the Democratic
provisions early in the week, and then sweep them away by adopting
the weaker GOP version of the bill as a final substitute amendment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's that final vote that counts,'' said Dr. Nancy W. Dickey,
immediate past president of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   In his California speech, Clinton chided the GOP tactic as a
cynical move to quietly kill the Democratic plan. ``They're not for
it, but they know they can't afford to be caught being against
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The AMA last week launched a $200,000-plus advertising and
lobbying campaign targeting key senators.
</P>
<P>
   Substituting the GOP version of the bill for the stronger bill
``falls short'' of what the doctors' want, Dickey said. ``We would
not consider that an acceptable bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, AMA officials said they are concerned that the GOP
tactic may confuse the public by allowing senators to vote for
popular patient protections, but then tell their constituents that
those provisions just weren't included in the final bill.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers, who also have a series of targeted ads circulating the
country, are mounting their strongest effort to defeat legislation
since they defeated President Clinton's health reform proposal in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Their message is that the Democratic bill is another
big-government power play whose winners would be bureaucrats and
trial lawyers. The losers, they say, would be businesses and
workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These so-called 'patients rights' would add new federal
government regulations costing billions of dollars that would be
passed on to families and businesses who simply can't afford it,''
said David Lack, president of the Council for Affordable Health
Insurance, an insurance industry group.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Kahn, president of the Health Insurance Association of
America, pointed to an April study by the Congressional Budget
Office that predicted that the Democratic bill would increase
insurance premiums about 6.1 percent when fully implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Each percentage point increase could mean another 200,000
Americans would be uninsured, the CBO estimated.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what happens in the Senate, the House also is
gearing up for a battle over a patients' bill of rights. The
political landscape there is even more complicated, because three
sets of bills are competing.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican leadership is backing a series of eight bills,
which together resemble the GOP Senate version, that have passed a
labor subcommittee. But competition for GOP support is coming from
a tougher bipartisan proposal sponsored by Rep. Charles Norwood, a
Georgia Republican. A key provision of the Norwood bill would be
the right of patients to sue insurers over treatment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Democratic alternative _ a companion to the
Democratic Senate version _ has been offered by Rep. John Dingell
of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Commerce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., has indicated he hopes the
House will consider a bill before the August recess.

   MIDEAST-ASSESS (Jerusalem) _ As Prime Minister Ehud Barak sets
off on an ambitious course to forge a comprehensive peace in the
Mideast, he heads out into a region of several aging leaders weary
of the logjam of Israeli-Arab hostilities. By Deborah Sontag.
</P>
<P>
   BELGRADE-MILOSEVIC (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ During his 12 years
in power, whenever Slobodan Milosevic has been on the ropes most of
the punches have been thrown here in the Serbian capital. But
Belgrade, so far, has been a conspicuous wallflower in the growing
anti-Milosevic movement that has found expression across the
country in the last two weeks. This city has about a fifth of the
Serbian republic's population and about 40 percent of its educated
middle-class, yet all the action has been in the boondocks. By
Blaine Harden.
</P>
<P>
   CONGO (Lusaka, Zambia) _ The signing of a cease-fire agreement
meant to end the war in Congo stalled for hours Saturday as two
factions within one of the rebel groups contested which one of them
would sign the document. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-DEMONSTRATION (Beijing) _ Nearly 1,000 members of a
spiritual movement known as Falun Gong held a two-day demonstration
inside government headquarters in a southern Chinese city this
week, a human rights organization reported Saturday. Undeterred by
a recent crackdown on Falun Gong in Beijing, where China's leaders
appear alarmed by the size, organization and secretive nature of
the movement, the demonstrators entered the inner courtyard of
Communist Party headquarters in Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi
Province, on July 6 and 7. By Seth Faison.
</P>
<P>
   U.N.-AID-CUTS (United Nations) _ Mark Malloch Brown, the new
chief of the U.N. Development Program, had barely moved into his
spacious office with its panoramic views of the East River and the
United Nations when he got some bad news. Denmark and Germany,
mainstays of his agency's $2 billion dollar budget, were slashing
their annual contributions. By Judith Miller/

   KOSOVO-GYPSIES (Kosovo Polje, Yugoslavia) _ Crammed into a
schoolhouse, 30 to a room, or living in pitched tents on the school
grounds, their horses tethered nearby, the Gypsies of Kosovo are
living in a precarious state. Always at the bottom of the social
pile in this sectarian society, they have now hit their nadir. By
Carlotta Gall.

   HISPANIOLA-DIVIDE (Dajabon, Dominican Republic) _ Despite market
days and a new political will to forge a closer relationship, Haiti
and the Dominican Republic remain nations living side by side yet
worlds apart. By Mireya Navarro. (With a map.)
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-PAST-ABUSES (Rio de Janeiro) _ Nearly a decade and a half
of democracy have erased the abuses of military rule from the
memory of most Brazilians. But two cases dating from that
unpleasant 21-year period have suddenly been thrust into the
national spotlight, creating embarrassment and discomfort for the
current civilian government, which had no involvement in the
original events. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   DRUG-ERADICATION _ When Pino Arlacchi, the director of the U.N.
International Drug Control Program, addressed the General Assembly
13 months ago and proposed eliminating opium poppy and coca leaf
cultivation in 10 years, his strategy was greeted with polite
skepticism. But Arlacchi says that his timetable for eradicating
the raw ingredients for heroin and cocaine around the world is, if
anything, running ahead of schedule in some countries, though he
acknowledged difficulties in others. By Christopher S. Wren.

States as its newest patriot. By Francis X. Clines. (With a photo.)

<P>
   IOWA-STRAWPOLL (Des Moines, Iowa) _ Six years ago, when he first
started running for president, Lamar Alexander never figured the
toughest test he would face in his grinding quest would be a straw
poll. But it has come down to that for the former Tennessee
governor, as well as for half a dozen other hopefuls seeking the
Republican nomination in 2000. As Alexander put it, when 10,000
Iowa Republicans gather in Ames next month for the party's
traditional presidential straw poll, the results will add up to
more than ``just another straw in the wind.'' By B. Drummond Ayres
Jr.

   ELDERLY-DRUGS (Philadelphia) _ Not just paying for all their
medications, which Clinton wants Medicare to help with, but keeping
all the pills straight, defines the lives of many older people. We

AS CAMPAIGN STARTS SWIFTLY, BOTH PARTIES ARE SCRAMBLING

   WASHINGTON _ Major candidates in the 2000 presidential campaign,
their assumptions turned upside down in the early going, are
scrambling to revise their strategies and retool their political
machines for a contest that has opened far more swiftly than either
the Democrats or the Republicans foresaw.
</P>
<P>
   The crowded Republican field has produced a breakaway front
runner and the Democratic incumbent who seemed like a shoo-in for
nomination no longer seems quite so assured.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Vice President Al Gore has abandoned his intended Rose
Garden strategy. Texas Gov. George W. Bush has amassed enough cash
to abandon the system of federal campaign financing, and Sen. Bob
Smith of New Hampshire plans to abandon the Republican Party this
week, fully seven months before his home state's primary.
</P>
<P>
   At the start of the year, advisers to Gore boasted that they had
discouraged other Democrats from entering the race. Many predicted
that the candidacy of former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey would
be only a trifling obstruction on an unimpeded course to the
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   But because Bradley has collected an impressive campaign
treasury of $11 million (Gore has $18.5 million) and is viewed as a
credible contender by the political establishment, the Gore
campaign has shifted from its preoccupation with gearing up for a
general election and is putting more emphasis on trying to knock
out Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Republican officials say they are surprised that
Bush has become so popular and has piled up so much money that he
seems to have practically smothered the Republican field. Many
Republicans had predicted that the contest would be the most
vigorous free-for-all their party had endured in decades. Instead,
many of Bush's 11 rivals are struggling to see whether they can
stay afloat past the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conventional wisdom has been totally thrown out the
door,'' said Scott Reed, who ran Bob Dole's losing race for
president in 1996. ``The Republican race started out as the first
open nomination fight in over 40 years. Now Bush is dictating the
timing and agenda of the whole race. He's smoking. Gore, on the
other hand, had bluffed everyone else out of the race and finds
himself in a very competitive two-man race.''
</P>
<P>
   Tad Devine, a Democratic strategist who is a veteran of decades
of campaigns, said: ``This is a level of engagement that I've never
seen in the presidential nominating process. We're in uncharted
waters because we've never seen a race this engaged so early in a
calendar cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns, of course, are notoriously unpredictable. With seven
months before the first votes are cast in a primary or caucus,
today's front-runner could easily be tomorrow's loser.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the perception _ fueled by polls, fund-raising figures and
pundits _ that Bush is dictating the Republican race and that Gore
faces a spirited contest is already, in significant ways, affecting
how they and their rivals are battling for the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Buffeted by Bradley and the political potency of Bush, Gore has
shelved his plans to devote much of this year to a strategy in
which he had intended to stay above politics, devote himself to
official duties and not even formally announce his candidacy until
the fall. Instead, Gore has already announced and moved much faster
than planned to lay out his positions and distance himself from
President Clinton. And he already has shaken up his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who had expected to battle other Democrats before
emerging as the chief alternative to Gore, has also adjusted his
game plan. Instead of attacking Gore and struggling to get
television coverage, Bradley has opted to lie low because the
one-on-one dynamic has guaranteed that he will be taken seriously.
</P>
<P>
   The changed dynamic has also accelerated Bush's strategy.
Because he has emerged so quickly, he has hired staff members and
put his campaign in gear far ahead of schedule. He had initially
planned to decide in the fall whether to reject federal subsidies,
allowing his campaign to spend beyond federal limits. Now his
campaign is set to announce this month that it will not accept
public money. And Bush has felt less pressure to appeal to specific
constituencies of the party and has embarked on a general-election
approach, to appeal to a broad swath of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has also upended the strategies of his rivals. Several
contenders have laid out specific policy initiatives earlier than
they had planned in an effort, as yet unsuccessful, to gain a
toehold in the polls. Several campaigns said they no longer felt
they had to raise table stakes of $20 million this year to be
competitive. They say that because Bush has already collected $36
million, he has already won the money race, and they feel less
pressure to solicit money.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamic has driven Bush's rivals to concentrate even more on
pivotal early states like Iowa and New Hampshire because they do
not have the resources to compete with Bush and Steve Forbes, the
multimillionaire publisher, in California, which has moved up its
primary date.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're liberated,'' said Ronald Kaufman, a Republican
national committeeman from Massachusetts who supports Bush. ``But
the trouble for them is it's one less opportunity to show that
you're relevant to the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Many political strategists and academics said they had never
seen the contours of a presidential season shift so early and so
rapidly. They said it was partly because of a compressed calendar
of primaries that virtually guarantees that party nominees will
emerge by mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conventional wisdom in primary seasons is almost always turned
on its head,'' said Larry M. Bartels, a professor of politics and
public affairs at Princeton University. ``But there's a feeling of
desperation among the minor candidates that if they can't get some
traction in the next couple of months, it's going to be impossible
for them to carry on.''
</P>
<P>
   One contender who is feeling the heat is former Tennessee Gov.
Lamar Alexander, who has not stopped campaigning since he lost the
Republican nomination in 1996 but thus far shows no signs that he
is gaining steam.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to feel for the guy,'' said Charles E. Cook Jr.,
editor of a nonpartisan political report. ``He's done everything
anyone ever told him to do'' to capture the nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain his predicament, Alexander gently excoriated
the press for excessively focusing on the purported triumph of Bush
_ and the woes of Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``TV now overdoses on everything, whether it's Michael Jordan
and Wayne Gretzky's retirement or climbing all over everyone to
conclude a race eight months before anybody votes,'' Alexander
said. ``If all you do is cover the front-runner and take a poll
about what you've just reported, then you very quickly make a
front-runner rather than follow a front-runner. The other side of
it is it can change equally fast. Whether it will correct itself, I
don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A vivid demonstration of the dynamic on the Republican side was
on display at the summer convention of the Republican National
Committee, which ended Saturday in Philadelphia. In interviews,
delegates said they had to stay neutral because they represented
the national party. But then, one after another, they admitted
privately that they were on the Bush team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Barring some major bombshell about George W., there's a lot of
pressure to try to complete the coronation early,'' said Dwight
Sutherland, a Republican national committeeman from Kansas.
``Bush's people here are putting the arm on us: `Will you formally
endorse? Will you come out tomorrow?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has gathered so much momentum that Georgette Mosbacher,
co-chairwoman of the campaign of Sen. John McCain of Arizona,
sounded practically like a convert. ``When you see that bandwagon
shipping out, you want to be on it,'' she said. ``It's amazing how
quickly wallets open up.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Bush the talk of the meeting, but signs of his
dominance were unmistakable. For example, no campaigns opened up
hospitality suites, a ritual at party gatherings. The session was
so controlled by Bush's operatives that Thomas Rath, a committeeman
from New Hampshire who backs Alexander, said, ``This is Austin
north.''
</P>
<P>
   Some campaigns explained that Bush was so beloved among the
party establishment that they did not bother to come to
Philadelphia. One long-shot contender who did, Alan Keyes, a former
State Department official who barely registers in the polls,
implored party members not to anoint a nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was talk among some Republican conservatives of
mounting third-party challenges as a protest against Bush. Smith is
expected to announce such an effort this week.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the shape of the race seems so clear, many experts
cautioned that people should not be fooled. After all, polls show
that most of America is not paying attention to the presidential
contest right now. Eleven Republicans are still counting on the
Bush balloon to burst.
</P>
<P>
   And it is only a matter of time, many Democrats say, before Gore
rebounds. Despite many signs of stumbling in his campaign, he is
still trouncing Bradley in virtually every poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how Gore loses,'' said Robert M. Teeter, a
Republican pollster in Michigan. ``Doesn't he have a lock on the
Democratic machinery?''
</P>
<P>
   Kaufman put it this way: ``Never in history has a sitting vice
president lost the nomination.'' Referring to the party's national
convention in California, he added: ``Bill Clinton isn't going to
let his VP not get the nomination, even if it means flying every
delegate to Los Angeles on Air Force One and Air Force Two. Because
his legacy is shaky enough as it is.''

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ During his 12 years in power, whenever
Slobodan Milosevic has been on the ropes, most of the punches have
been thrown here in the Serbian capital.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Serbian leader called out Yugoslav army tanks
and used tear gas eight years ago to put down a violent
demonstration against state-controlled television, the key lever in
his control of public opinion. It was here that the depth of urban
middle-class revulsion with Milosevic's rule was shown to the world
in three solid months of daily street demonstrations in the winter
of 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   But Belgrade, so far, has been a conspicuous wallflower in the
growing anti-Milosevic movement that has found expression across
Serbia in the last two weeks. This city has about a fifth of
Serbia's population and about 40 percent of its educated
middle-class, yet all the action has been in the boondocks.
</P>
<P>
   With rallies in smaller cities across Serbia, the opposition
movement has tapped frustration among restive army reservists who
are home from the lost war in Kosovo and, for most part, unpaid for
their trouble. It also has plugged into discontent among Serbs who
say they fear for their future in the collapsed postwar economy,
are weary of international isolation and are shamed by crimes
committed in their name in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While Belgrade's city council argued itself into paralysis last
week over the question of Milosevic's resignation, city leaders in
three cities _ Serbia's second and third largest cities of Novi Sad
and Nis, and the northern city of Sombor _ quickly approved
resolutions demanding that he step down.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in Belgrade's involvement in this season's round of
anti-Milosevic demonstrations does not derive from any lack of
ambient animus toward the Yugoslav president, who has been indicted
as a war criminal and has lost four straight wars while turning
once-prosperous Serbia into the basket-case economy of Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets here on Friday night, it was difficult to find a
citizen of Belgrade, young or old, middle-class or poor, who did
not believe the time had come for Milosevic to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see him strung up and hanging in the center of
town,'' said Ivan Tarla, 23, a film student at the University of
Belgrade. ``We are ready to go out into the street, but we need
very clear goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The fractured opposition movement in Serbia is not planning
demonstrations in Belgrade until late August precisely because it
does not yet have a unified set of goals. Milosevic, meanwhile, is
attending to his main instrument of control _ the same
state-controlled television that Belgraders demonstrated against en
masse in 1991. He will rebuild the bombed television headquarters
in the capital, officials say, before the bridges that NATO smashed
all over Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the largest single opposition party _ the only one that
can guarantee the daily presence of tens of thousands of
demonstrators on the streets of the capital for weeks on end _ has
not yet joined the Alliance for Change, the coalition of smaller
opposition parties that is organizing rallies against Milosevic
outside Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Renewal Movement, led by Vuk Draskovic, the
self-proclaimed ``king of the streets'' and an on-again, off-again
critic of the Milosevic regime, is sitting on its hands for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, who briefly served as a deputy minister in
Milosevic's government before being fired in the middle of the
Kosovo war, has said the time is not yet ripe for demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that in the aftermath of the Kosovo war,
Draskovic's party gained strength and won the support of about 15
percent of Serbia's population, far more than any other opposition
group. His party leads a coalition that runs city hall in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Probably more important, he controls a Belgrade television
station, Studio B, a widely watched alternative to state television
in the capital. Leaders of smaller opposition parties say they must
gain better access to Studio B to whip up mass enthusiasm for
demonstrations in Belgrade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Draskovic's personal political ambitions seem to be keeping his
party out of the streets. He holds a grudge against Zoran Djindjic,
the key leader of the Alliance for Change. The bad blood grows out
of Djindjic's boycott of an election two years ago, when Draskovic
ran for president of Serbia. Badly needing those opposition votes,
he finished a poor third.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers say Draskovic has decided that the only way to
force Milosevic from power is for a strong individual politician to
rise above a decade of confused infighting among multiple small and
ineffectual opposition parties and give Serbs one clear
alternative. That alternative, in their view, is none other than
Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Alliance for Change, while resentful of what they
say is Draskovic's self-involved brand of politics, do not dismiss
his importance _ especially in street demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Mr. Draskovic's support,'' said Slobodan Vuksanovic, a
senior strategist in the Alliance for Change. ``We need him because
of the number of people he can deliver and because of Studio B.
Belgrade is the heart of Serbia in a political sense. Everything
depends on the success of the demonstrations there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vuksanovic said that in Belgrade, unlike most of the rest of
Serbia, the organizational structure of the ruling and opposition
parties is strong and relatively well disciplined. To pull off a
series of major demonstrations that is big enough not to be
disrupted by Milosevic's police or by supporters of the
ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, he said, the Alliance for
Change has no choice but to try to ally itself with Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   Successful rallies in the boondocks, then, are a way of
convincing Draskovic and members of his Serbian Renewal Movement
that if they stand on the sidelines for too long they may be left
out altogether in divvying up power in a post-Milosevic Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   There were signals last week that the strategy is beginning to
work, as a surprisingly passionate anti-Milosevic movement bubbled
up in the least likely of Serbian towns. In the southern city of
Leskovac, long dominated by Milosevic's supporters, more than
20,000 people filled the streets on Monday. The protest was
followed by smaller demonstrations, one of them violent, throughout
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Startled and anxious to cash in on popular sentiment, the
Serbian Renewal Movement decided on Wednesday to help locals in
Leskovac organize their demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public-address speakers are ours, but the microphone is
theirs,'' said Bojana Ristic, head of the Serbian Renewal Movement
in Leskovac.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Draskovic's party conceded in Belgrade last week that
they had underestimated grass-roots anger at the Milosevic regime.
As for future rallies, they seemed to be opening a door that
Draskovic, just two weeks ago, slammed shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vuk knows when the time comes,'' said Ognjen Pribicevic, a
senior political adviser to Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, it seems many people are ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be the first in the streets because I have had
enough,'' said Mira Angelic, 50, a lawyer. ``Right now, there is no
spark to start the fire. But I think it is a question of days and
weeks. The spark eventually has to come from Belgrade.''

MIDEAST'S RIPE MOMENT: LEADERS TIRED OF LOGJAM
</HEADLINE>

 By DEBORAH SONTAG    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ As Prime Minister Ehud Barak sets off on an
ambitious course to forge a comprehensive peace in the Mideast, he
heads out into a region of several aging leaders weary of the
logjam of Israeli-Arab hostilities.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem that the moment is particularly ripe for
successful negotiations, after hopes were dashed, expectations
lowered and relations soured during the tenure of Barak's
predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Even Syrian President Hafez Assad is making cooing noises in
Barak's direction. Assad, 69, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat,
also 69, are said to be eager because of their ages and health
problems to hammer out deals sooner rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, too, having invested so much time in
assisting Middle East peacemaking, is determined to see significant
progress during his final year in office.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this confluence of interests translates into the dawn of
a new peacemaking era, erupts into violence or fizzles into a new
stalemate of intransigence remains to be seen. Many who believe in
peace see this as a moment of positive expectations, but history
also teaches that skepticism or wariness is in order.
</P>
<P>
   ``This minuet of peace is by no means a foregone conclusion,''
Abraham H. Foxman, director of the Anti-Defamation League, said
this week during one of his frequent trips to the region to see
Israeli and Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Barak, 57, a highly decorated former general who won a
resounding mandate at the polls, is certainly diving straight into
the maelstrom. He set off on a whirlwind diplomatic tour two days
after moving into the prime minister's office on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday in Alexandria, he saw Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, who effusively praised the new prime minister as a man of
peace. On Sunday afternoon, Barak is scheduled to hold his first
meeting with Arafat at the Erez checkpoint between Gaza and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday night, he is supposed to see King Abdullah of
Jordan in Aqaba, Jordan. On Wednesday in Jerusalem, Barak ends his
regional meetings by seeing Turkish President Suleyman Demirel. And
on Thursday, he starts a weeklong trip to the United States with a
visit to President Clinton at the White House, and then concludes
his journey with visits to England and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   From the day he was elected, Barak has made it clear that he
views his most significant mission as being a
warrior-turned-peacemaker, ending, as he often says, ``100 years of
bloody conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   He made it clear by the composition of his coalition that peace,
rather than domestic social issues, was his priority. And by the
very fact of assembling such a broad coalition _ representing
nearly two-thirds of the parliament _ he communicated that he
envisioned making difficult decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason to put together a coalition that large and
unwieldy is so as to be able to absorb blows and defections and
still presumably be stable enough to move ahead with territorial
concessions,'' said Joseph Alpher, Mideast director for the
American Jewish Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In his inaugural address early last week, Barak personally
addressed Arafat and Assad, informing them in a televised address
that he wanted to start a new chapter. He spoke a language of
empathy rare for an Israeli leader and in stark contrast to the
hostility of the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not only cognizant of the sufferings of my own people,''
Barak said, ``but I also recognize the sufferings of the
Palestinian people.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak has now entered an exploratory phase. A very disciplined
strategist, he tends to collect information and review it carefully
before devising a plan. No concrete results are expected out of his
diplomatic visits, although there could be the announcement in
Washington of the scheduling of a meeting with Assad.
</P>
<P>
   But there are no advance teams and Barak, who is serving as his
own defense minister, will not be traveling with a broad entourage
of advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skepticism could derive from the fact that Barak, who is an
unknown quantity, is also very much a one-man show,'' Alpher said.
</P>
<P>
   In the next week, Barak, who says he is seeking to restore trust
on all sides, will be feeling out his new peace partners as he
tries to compose a plan of action.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are expectations of huge progress, but Barak is quite a
cautious guy,'' said Efraim Inbar, a professor at the Begin-Sadat
Center for Strategic Studies at Bar-Ilan University. ``My theory is
that the peace process is very robust. There are great social
forces pushing all sides toward minimizing the conflicts. Everyone
is tired, and everyone knows he can't realize his dream. The idea
of a greater Israel is gone, the idea of a greater Palestine is
over, the idea of a pan-Arab nationalism is dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other hand, I think everyone is very pragmatic. This
liberal notion of trust is pure nonsense. I imagine Barak's aiming
for an armed peace at best.''
</P>
<P>
   While Barak has said publicly that he plans to move forward
simultaneously on the Palestinian and Syrian tracks, there is a
question of pacing. It would be difficult to pursue both at the
same time with the same intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts have predicted that Syria, which represents more
of a military threat than the Palestinians, could take priority.
Barak has pledged to withdraw Israeli troops from southern Lebanon
within a year and he sees that in the context of a peace agreement
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a certain neatness to making a deal with Syria that
has fascinated several Israeli leaders,'' said Itamar Rabinovich,
president of Tel Aviv University and a former diplomat who headed
Israel's delegation to Syria from 1992 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syria is a state,'' he continued. ``It's always easier to deal
with a state than a society or community like the Palestinians.
Also, it has an authoritative government that may be hard to
negotiate with, but insures good implementation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rabinovich and other analysts say they believe that Syria has
been sending out signals of readiness just as Barak has indicated
that he is prepared to withdraw from most of the Golan Heights in
exchange for peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``A different type of music is coming out of Damascus,''
Rabinovich said. ``It is much more inviting, much more positive and
much more forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Assad apparently regrets giving up the opportunity to negotiate
a peace deal in the early 1990s by taking too hard a line. He held
several secret talks with the Israelis during Netanyahu's
government _ through an intermediary, Ronald Lauder, the American
cosmetics businessman. Now he supposedly sees Barak's government as
a second window of opportunity, and one opening up at a time when
Syria's economy is failing and when he is considering passing the
reins of authority to his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``Syria is partner to the hope of Prime Minister Ehud Barak to
put an end to war,'' the Syrian Foreign Ministry said in a
statement last week.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is unclear how far Assad is willing to bend. To date,
he has been unwilling to make any public gestures to the Israeli
people that would send a message of reconciliation. He has been
unwilling to open discreet channels of communications that would
allow high-level Syrians and Americans, for instance, to take a
walk in the woods and establish the parameters of negotiations. And
he has been adamant that an Israeli promise to withdraw from the
Golan Heights is not something to negotiate but rather the
necessary prelude to dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, while formally Assad's position remains the same,
there have been signs that he is willing to be more flexible. The
Syrians have said, for instance, that the redeployment of the
Syrian army is a Syrian decision, which indicates that this is a
negotiable subject.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with the Palestinians are likely to be far messier
and more complex. Barak committed what the Palestinians consider to
be a diplomatic faux-pas by waiting weeks after his election to
call Arafat, who is notoriously sensitive and given to such
formalities .
</P>
<P>
   Also, Barak has unnerved the Palestinians by suggesting that
they consider skipping over the final two phases of the Wye
agreement, which was negotiated early last fall in Wye, Md., and
suspended late last fall by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to Barak have said that he will propose to Arafat that
the two sides go straight into expedited final status negotiations
and look broadly at all remaining issues. The final status
negotiations are supposed to conclude the peace process, resolving
the most sensitive issues, like Jerusalem, borders and refugees.
Israeli analysts have said that Barak might pledge future
recognition of a Palestinian state in exchange.
</P>
<P>
   If Arafat objects, though, Barak has said he will move forward
on the Wye agreement, and army officials are reportedly making
preparations for a handover of more land in the West Bank this
summer.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Palestinians view the idea of postponing the execution of
the Wye agreement with great trepidation, as a sign of
foot-dragging.
</P>
<P>
   ``We absolutely, totally and utterly reject even the idea, or
the mere thinking about it, and we urge Mr. Barak not even to
suggest if he means and intends to build trust,'' said Saeb Erekat,
the chief Palestinian negotiator.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat said the Palestinians were impatient and want to see
Barak take quick action. They expect a quick handover of land, a
return of Palestinian prisoners and a total change in atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to wait anymore,'' he said. ``We are tired of
waiting.''

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. _ Four decades after his father, Nikita
Khrushchev, provocatively vowed from the Kremlin, ``We will bury
you,'' Sergei Khrushchev awaits American citizenship, happily
prepared to pledge allegiance to the United States as its newest
patriot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' said Sergei Khrushchev with a wisp of merriment in his
blue eyes that recalled no one so much as his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a great country and it's an honor to live here,'' the
64-year-old son of the late Soviet premier declared last week.
``They will tell me what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do everything as they say,'' he added with a patient
smile, speaking of the citizenship ceremony and the universal ways
of bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   Now a scholar of the Cold War whose lectures at Brown University
here are driven by eyewitness memories, Khrushchev had been a
rocket and computer scientist in his father's heyday and a firm
believer in communism. But on Monday, in a red-white-and-blue
ceremony off Cathedral Square here, Khrushchev will stand and be
sworn in with other new Americans, including his wife, Valentina
Garlenka, in a most personal postscript to the Cold War years of
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Nikita Khrushchev had barnstormed America with his son at his
side at the height of the Cold War 40 years ago. ``An impression of
a great country, but nothing shocking,'' Sergei Khrushchev said of
the nation he would come to adopt. ``More friendly than expected.
You smile more than others.''
</P>
<P>
   The son, an ardent collector of butterflies, journeyed to such
exotic places as Brooklyn in adding to his collection, while the
father hammered away _ literally and famously at the United Nations
_ at the message that capitalism would some day be defeated by
communism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you use only that expression about `bury,' '' said
the son with a smile, talking from a perspective somewhere between
Moscow and Washington about how his father had referred to
economic, not thermonuclear, burial. But the distinction was often
lost in fear and outrage on the American side of the Iron Curtain.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then, and now Sergei Khrushchev can enjoy the
liberating aftermath as he edits family journals, lectures and
writes about the Cold War at the university's Thomas J. Watson Jr.
Institute for International Studies. ``Time does its inevitable
work,'' he wrote in his own memoir a decade ago before he ever
imagined becoming an American.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   More playful than solemn about his citizenship decision, he
keeps a Soviet spy-satellite photograph of Rhode Island pinned to
the wall as a symbol of his double-faceted fate, near a cartoon of
a grizzled beggar labeled ``Expert on Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside his tiny faculty office, where he was interviewed, a
poster offers the image and hopeful prediction of his father that
after a person's death ``the good things will outweigh the bad.''
Inside, the son tests that hope in his scholarship about the long
and at times frighteningly checkered career of premier Khrushchev.
The son dismisses the question of what his father, celebrated for
his barnyard candor, might have said about having an American for a
son. ``It is impossible to move a political figure from one era to
another,'' the scholar said of the dictator. ``We only create such
fiction in movies.''
</P>
<P>
   He came by his scholarly role accidentally, he explained, when
someone was needed to edit his father's dictated memoirs. ``Then I
was interested in missiles and gyroscopes,'' he said. ``But I
decided I would work with the society,'' he added, summarizing a
journey that included his father's daring to denounce the horrific
abuses of Stalin, his predecessor, and his father's eventual fall
in 1964 as he attempted gradual changes in the Soviet system.
</P>
<P>
   When the liberating era of Mikhail Gorbachev arrived, Sergei
Khrushchev was already more independent minded in investigating the
Cold War in detail and he became fascinated by its ``mutual
misperceptions.'' By then, his father had come to be viewed as
something of a foreshadowing of Gorbachev for having tried to ease
the absolutism of the Soviet system.
</P>
<P>
   The son began teaching here in 1991 and last year decided that,
with travel to Russia no longer restricted, he would base his life
here. ``We thought that if you decide to work and live here you
have an obligation to be a citizen,'' Khrushchev said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our children told us it's your decision,'' he said of the
three adult sons (and three grandchildren) in Moscow. They
regularly visit the Khrushchevs in Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   The Khrushchevs have American Dream trappings, living in
Cranston, a 15-minute commute from the university, in a house they
were able to buy with the profits from Khrushchev's writing and
lecturing.
</P>
<P>
   Lately he is bemused by questions from Americans about whether
there is any sense of betrayal in Russia at his change in
citizenship. ``People over there, really much more than here, they
are are less under the pressure of old ideology,'' he said. ``They
can like America, they can dislike America, but they are not living
in the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I heard one of the old apparatchiks call me an
`enemy of the people,' '' he added, charmed by the notion.
</P>
<P>
   While his father took long, garrulous walks with his son after
his Kremlin work days, he never talked of the raw daily fear of the
Stalin terror until after he took power and began denouncing before
party leaders the murderous abuses of the masses, Sergei Khrushchev
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very close,'' the son said. ``He liked to talk and
tell these stories. But not everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Nina Petrovna, Sergei's mother, who died in 1984, had learned
and taught English to her children, so she was able to read her
husband's memoir when it was originally published in English. ``Now
I'm editing my mother's diary,'' Sergei Khrushchev said. ``And
she's often saying, `So many interesting things that my husband
never told me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Nikita Khrushchev exemplified the triumphs, sorrows and lethal
politics of the Kremlin regime. His first wife died in the
harrowing famine of 1921. His son, Leonid, died as a combat pilot
in World War II. Sergei was born of the second marriage, along with
two sisters, Rada and Yelena.
</P>
<P>
   ``No `golden youth' for me,'' Sergei Khrushchev said of his
upbringing, referring to the pampered children of Kremlin leaders.
``No playboy. No pocket money. No cars. I went by subway to the
university and I hung on the side of crowded trams like everyone
else in Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   He seems particularly proud of these memories as he becomes an
American. ``Parents warned, `If you do this or don't do that, you
will be like Stalin's son _ the worst example for our family,' ''
he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Khrushchev found his 15 minutes of infamy was over
after his father died in 1971. ``They stopped bugging my phone and
I told friends I'm not an important person any more,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now my wife's sister tells me the tone of the telephone
changes two days before I arrive,'' he added with a grin at the
status of his new life.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Khrushchev promises that he will worry far more than the
average American about the current ``artificial'' and ``corrupt''
situation in Moscow, where, he says, a stumbling Boris Yeltsin
recalls the final years of Czar Nicholas II before the Bolshevik
revolution. ``I can't feel I am safe here and not care about all my
family and friends there.''
</P>
<P>
   More than ever, he stressed, the people need economic hope and
progress _ an imperative that he said his father once angrily
conceded beyond Western ears soon after his celebrated vow to
``bury'' capitalism. In facing Soviet military demands for more
weaponry, Sergei Khrushchev said, ``My father told the generals
that, between communism and capitalism, that system will win that
presents the better life to the people.''

GOP IS BECOMING MORE AGGRESSIVE ON TAX REDUCTION
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After nearly two decades in which their desire for
big tax cuts was overwhelmed by efforts to eliminate the federal
budget deficit, Republicans in Congress will begin this week to
debate the largest and most broadly distributed tax reduction since
1981.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to overcome opposition from President Clinton and
most Democrats in Congress, as well as indifference among voters,
who consistently rank tax cuts below issues like improving
education and shoring up Social Security when asked about their
priorities. The specifics of the emerging Republican proposals are
the opening gambits in what will be months of partisan maneuvering
over taxes, and the debate promises to present both parties with
difficult choices about whether to compromise or fight it out on
the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   But new projections, however speculative, showing that budget
surpluses will grow faster than anticipated have energized
advocates of big tax cuts and heightened the long-running
ideological debate over the size and influence of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of his party's revived assertiveness on the issue, the
chief Republican tax writer in the House, Rep. Bill Archer of
Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, announced
Saturday that the centerpiece of his bill will be a measure
Democrats thought they had headed off: a reduction of 10 percent in
all personal income tax rates. His committee is expected to vote on
the package this week.
</P>
<P>
   The change, which would be phased in gradually over 10 years,
would cost roughly $400 billion in that period, nearly half the
$864 billion in tax cuts that Archer intends to include in his
bill. Among the bill's other features is a reduction in the capital
gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Archer plan, which would bring the current 15 percent tax
bracket down to 13.5 percent, the 28 percent bracket to 25.2
percent and the top 39.6 percent bracket to 35.6 percent, is
anathema to liberals, who say it favors the wealthy who need it
least. But such a reduction is a long-held goal of conservatives,
who say it does nothing more than give the biggest tax cuts to
those who pay the most taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's proposal further hardened positions on both sides.
White House officials and congressional Democrats say the growing
budget surpluses presents an opportunity to prepare for long-term
challenges like the aging of the population while paying off the
national debt and investing prudently in areas like education and
health care. A big tax cut, they said, would not only endanger
those objectives, but risk plunging the nation back into a morass
of budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they too are all for improving education and
dealing with social issues. But they say there is so much money on
the table that the only way to prevent Washington from spending it
on ever-expanding entitlements, additional bureaucracy and
pork-barrel projects is to send as much of it as possible back to
taxpayers, who can use it more productively than the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason for this surplus is because taxpayers are
paying too much, which is why they deserve a refund,'' Archer said.
``And if we don't cut taxes now and the money stays in Washington,
the politicians will surely spend it. Republicans are determined to
protect taxpayers who ultimately get stuck with the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   The very magnitude of the projected surpluses suggests there is
room for compromise. But for now, both sides are gearing up for
several months of all-out partisan warfare, starting with a vote on
Tuesday or Wednesday in the Ways and Means Committee on Archer's
bill.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say Clinton is not against tax cuts,
noting that he has already put down a bid in the form of his
proposal for $250 billion in tax breaks over the next decade
intended to spur more retirement savings among low- and
middle-income families.
</P>
<P>
   They said, however, that he would stick to his strategy of
demanding that any tax cuts await the resolution of efforts to
shore up Social Security and Medicare, both of which face financial
problems in coming decades as the baby boom generation grows old.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House is now adding another argument to its case.
Administration officials said the surplus estimates being relied on
by Republicans were predicated on domestic spending being held to
levels that were politically unrealistic and that would require
deep cuts in everything from law enforcement to Head Start over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, White House officials said, the surplus projections
have been exaggerated by a technical factor. The portion of the
surplus that both parties agree is up for grabs, the part generated
by general tax revenues rather than payroll tax receipts that are
nominally earmarked for Social Security, is $996 billion over the
next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   But the $996 billion figure assumes that all of the surplus goes
to paying down the national debt, thereby reducing interest costs
to the government. To the degree that the money is used for tax
cuts or anything else, interest costs will be higher than assumed,
reducing the size of the surplus _ by $179 billion over 10 years,
according to an estimate by the administration. That means, in the
administration's view, that an $864 billion tax cut would return
the government to a deficit a decade from now _ a conclusion that
Republicans, who use slightly different numbers, dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The path we've laid out is a balanced allocation of the
surplus,'' said Jacob J. Lew, the director of the White House's
Office of Management and Budget, previewing a line of attack
administration officials plan to employ in coming days and weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go down the other route and put everything into a tax
cut, sucking up all the dollars, it leaves you either with
devastating cuts to programs that would be impossible to deliver on
because they'd be unacceptable to the American people, or you'd end
up with deficits,'' Lew said.
</P>
<P>
   Having just recovered from the deficits created in part by the
Reagan-era tax cuts and the agonizing choices they forced upon the
nation, Lew said, the country should resist again going down a
tax-cutting road ``that's very difficult to turn back on.''

   The tax-cutting packages presented in pieces over the last few
days by Archer and his counterpart in the Senate, William V. Roth
Jr., R-Del., who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, are
opening gambits in what is likely to be months of maneuvering over
the nation's priorities as it shifts into an era of fiscal plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's proposal is slightly smaller than Archer's, at no more
than $792 billion over 10 years, and it specifically leaves room to
deal with one of Clinton's priorities, adding prescription drug
coverage to the Medicare system of health insurance for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But both versions are chock-a-block with proposals that have
been little more than pipe dreams for Republicans in recent years,
from eliminating the tax on estates to reversing the quirk in the
tax code that penalizes many married couples.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans expect that neither version will make it into
law intact, given Clinton's opposition, they are hopeful that some
of the ideas could be included in any compromise.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the sparring over taxes will go a long way toward
determining how the parties address a variety of related issues,
from Social Security and Medicare to breaking a logjam in Congress
over next year's spending bills. And with Republicans and Democrats
alike torn over whether confrontation or compromise will play
better with voters, it will shape their strategies as they head
into the 2000 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of both parties in the House would prefer fighting
it out over fiscal policy on the campaign trail rather than cutting
a deal, judging that staking out a clear ideological position will
help them as Democrats fight to wrest control of the chamber from
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to solidify Republican support for a bill they
can campaign on, based on the fact that they know this bill will be
so irresponsible that the president will be forced to veto it,''
said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the
Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is more complicated in the Senate. There, moderate
Democrats are open to a substantial tax cut, and Republicans are
trying to make it easier for them. The plan introduced by Roth on
Friday was built around a middle-class tax cut far more palatable
to Democrats than the approach taken by Archer in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Some Senate Democrats also see an opportunity to neutralize tax
cuts as a political issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats have largely captured the education and
environmental issues, and have an expanding advantage on guns and
abortion,'' said Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., who
co-sponsored a bipartisan $345 billion tax cut proposal earlier
this year. ``There is no reason for us to lose on the tax issue.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The most critical factor may prove to be Clinton's calculation
about which way to go.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 he brokered a bipartisan compromise that gave the
Republicans a tax cut while protecting Democratic spending
priorities. In 1995 the president played a partisan standoff on the
budget to his advantage, reasserting his authority and invigorating
his party after its defeat in the 1994 midterm elections. This time
around he has reasons to go both ways.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans believe that failure to press their
tax-cutting agenda as far as possible could accelerate the slide in
their electoral fortunes since 1994 by alienating the conservative
base that handed them control of Congress. Indeed, tax cuts are
almost as much a moral issue for Republicans as an economic issue.
</P>
<P>
   A high tax burden, Roth said Saturday in delivering the weekly
Republican national radio address, ``undermines the fundamental
values that dictate that you _ the individuals and families who
worked to create this economic expansion _ should be able to use
this surplus for you and your loved ones.''

<P>
   After years of shying away from the field, a growing number of
college students, including those from elite liberal arts colleges,
now say they want to be schoolteachers.
</P>
<P>
   Just over 10 percent of all freshmen say they want to teach in
elementary or secondary schools, according to a new survey by the
Cooperative Institutional Research Program at the University of
California at Los Angeles. The percentages, for 1998, the latest
year available, are the highest since the early 1970s and nearly
twice what they were at their low point, in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   And students at some of the nation's top universities, like
Harvard and Princeton, are also showing a growing interest.
</P>
<P>
   Education and policy experts say these numbers reflect a shift
in attitudes about teaching _ from seeing it as a career plagued by
low pay and low prestige to seeing it as a career that needs smart
and altruistic people.
</P>
<P>
   Interest in teaching, the experts say, is being fueled by
students' search for meaningful work, concern about the plight of
at-risk children and a response to the national call for higher
standards and teachers with degrees in academic subjects, as well
as in education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing a significant shift toward education, toward
government and public policy and community action type work,'' said
Maureen Tobin, director of the career development center at Kenyon
College, the oldest private liberal arts college in Ohio, where
about 20 percent of the class of 1998 planned to become teachers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The UCLA survey, first conducted in 1966, polls 300,000 freshmen
at over 600 American colleges and universities each year about what
they want to do after graduating.
</P>
<P>
   While the survey does not necessarily reflect actual career
choices, which may change after freshman year, other signs of
renewed interest in teaching are appearing as well.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Applications to many of the nation's top graduate schools of
education _ which can also include programs in counseling, human
development or psychology, are on the rise. While the number of
students graduating from medical schools, law schools and business
schools has dropped off or held steady in recent years, the number
of students earning degrees in education has increased, according
to the National Center for Education Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   The number of bachelor's and master's degrees in education rose
31 percent from 1986 to 1996 (the last year available), compared
with 22 percent in other fields.
</P>
<P>
   Recruiters at teacher-placement organizations say applicant
pools are steady or growing. At Teach for America, which demands
only a two-year teaching commitment and does not require new
teachers to be certified, says it has recorded a strong increase in
applications in recent years, especially from schools like Spelman
College, Cornell University, the University of Michigan, Stanford
University and Princeton. Last fall, Teach for America received
applications from 3,025 people, up from 2,745 the year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've certainly noticed over the past two years that there is
an increase in interest from college students,'' said Wendy Kopp,
president of Teach for America. ``Part of that can be attributed to
the fact that we have become more sophisticated in our recruiting
efforts. But there is also a mood on college campuses right now
that is conducive to people being interested in teaching. People
are looking for ways to assume a significant challenge and to make
a difference right out of college.''
</P>
<P>
   In response to the growing interest in improving the quality of
teachers, many top liberal arts colleges are setting up or
revitalizing teacher education programs, which provide the
necessary coursework to get a teaching degree or certification.
</P>
<P>
   At Princeton University, for example, the number of students
enrolled in its teacher preparation program has risen to 25 from
five since 1990. (The high was in 1975, when 77 students were
enrolled.) In the last 10 years, the number of students in Colby
College's education and human development program has doubled, to
almost 100, said Mark Tappan, who directs the program with his
wife, Lyn Mikel Brown.
</P>
<P>
   And Bennington College's teacher education program has grown to
24 students from two since its inception two years ago. The program
allows students to obtain both a bachelor's degree in liberal arts
and a master's in education in five years.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind A. Hoffa, an associate dean at Amherst College and
director of its career center, has been watching interest in
teaching grow on her campus as well. In early 1998, after years of
refusing to give credits for teacher education courses taken at
nearby Mount Holyoke College, Amherst reversed itself, Ms. Hoffa
said. The college is now formally helping students earn teaching
credentials through the Holyoke program. To date, 35 students have
asked to participate.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Many liberal arts colleges do not offer the necessary coursework
and student teaching experience required by most states for
certification. As a result, many graduate schools of education are
reporting growing numbers of applications from new college
graduates with liberal arts degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's Graduate School of Education, for one, has reported a
34 percent increase in applications since 1990, said Roland Hence,
a university spokesman. The number of applications to the teacher
education programs at Columbia University's Teachers College has
risen to more than 830 this year from 700 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting a lot of career changers,'' said Barry M.
Rosen, a spokesman for Teachers College. ``But there is also a rise
in applications from new college graduates and the average GRE
scores of the applicants has been going up as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Many career counselors and college administrators say students
are responding, in part, to the national call for new teachers. The
federal Department of Education has estimated that schools will
need to hire 2.2 million teachers over the next 10 years to meet a
wave of retirements, rising enrollments and demands for smaller
class sizes.
</P>
<P>
   It is precisely that call and the desire to make a difference
that has drawn students like Sarah Bertucci into teaching.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived at Princeton in the fall of 1993, Ms. Bertucci
figured she would major in geology and use her passion for nature
and numbers to make a name for herself doing scientific research,
architecture or engineering.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw myself in a nontraditional job for women,'' said Ms.
Bertucci, who grew up in Rochester. ``I did not want to be a
teacher.''
</P>
<P>
   But the summer after her freshman year, she got a job as a
teacher's assistant at an alternative high school in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved the relationships with the students,'' she said. ``I
learned so much from them. It hooked me pretty fast. The minute I
got back to college, I ran over to the teacher education program
and said, `Sign me up.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now 23, she finished the last of her student teaching
requirements last November and is looking for a job at a school
near Boston.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   David Robinson, a 23-year-old graduate student from Albany, said
he decided to become a teacher instead of a corporate executive
after an unsatisfactory internship he had while he was a student at
the University of Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got a feeling for the corporate life and realized it
wasn't for me,'' said Robinson, who graduated with a bachelor's
degree in English literature in 1998 and is finishing up his
master's at Teachers College. ``I realized that it was my tutoring
experiences that were the most rewarding on a personal level.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Robinson will begin teaching ninth and 10th grade
English at the Bronx Leadership Academy in the South Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite indications of growing interest in teaching, the
realities of the job can be discouraging, especially in urban
schools, which find it hard to compete with suburban ones for new
teachers. Michael Casserly, executive director of the Council of
the Great City Schools, a coalition of urban school systems, said
schools in big cities can expect half of their new teachers to quit
within the first three to five years as a result of stress, long
hours and difficult working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that the numbers are up is a good sign,'' Casserly
said. ``The challenge for us is to draw more of those new teachers
into the urban systems, where the shortages are greatest and
burnout is so high.''
</P>
<P>
   And while teachers' salaries are rising, they still lag behind
those in other fields. According to the American Federation of
Teachers, first-year teachers made an average of $25,735 in
1997-98. By contrast, new engineers were making about $42,862 and
those working in business administration made $34,831.
</P>

<P>
   It was in part the pay issue that derailed Jonathan W. Thatcher.
Thatcher, 21, who will be a senior at Amherst this fall, decided
recently to scrap his plans to become a teacher and to go instead
to law school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a combination of things,'' Thatcher said from his home
in Mechanicsburg, Pa. ``Coming out of Amherst, there are heavy
expectations that you are going to do something and do something
big. That pressure is there.''
</P>
<P>
   After a minute, he added: ``On a more personal level, my father
lost his job several years ago, and his pension is not that much.
If I could make the kind of salary so that someday I could help
them out if they got in a pinch, that would make me very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon K. Reid went to Harvard University in 1992 with plans to
head to medical school after graduation. But after sophomore year,
Reid, 25, took a year off to do community service and tutor at-risk
high school students. By the middle of his senior year, the Long
Island native decided to put medical school on hold and get his
master's degree in education. He is now using his degree in
biochemistry to teach science at Newton North High School outside
of Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm really making a difference,'' said Reid, who also
teaches music at the school. ``And as long as I can keep giving it
my all, I'll definitely keep doing it.''

   It happened again this year. Another drug scandal in sports.
This time, it involved more than a dozen cyclists in Swiss and
Italian races failing blood tests, including Marco Pantani of
Italy, last year's winner of the Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
   But some critics are pointing to what they see as a disconnect
between excessive worry over performance-enhancing drugs and
uncritical applause for the other ways of boosting an athlete's
performance _ from high-technology running shoes to chains of
stores devoted to dietary supplements.
</P>
<P>
   The laments over the cycling scandal sounded all too familiar to
anyone who has followed the continuing drama of drugs in sports. A
common reaction is often disgust. French Cycling Federation
president Daniel Baal said with drug use so rampant, ``I can't
watch a fake spectacle.''
</P>
<P>
   If an athlete excels _ or develops an injury or illness _
charges of drug use spring up. European cycling officials charged
the athletes with using erythropoietin, or EPO, which raises red
blood cell counts, enabling the blood to carry more oxygen to
muscles. Now, when cyclists sprint up a mountain flawlessly,
spectators may well ask: Is it natural ability combined with tough
training? Or is it EPO?
</P>
<P>
   In the July 1996 issue of the Journal of the American Medical
Association, Dr. Thomas Murray, the president of the Hastings
Center, an ethics institute, and Dr. Don Catlin, who operates the
Olympic drug-testing lab at the University of California at Los
Angeles, wrote that drug testing in the Olympics ``is an effort to
preserve what is beautiful and admirable in sports and to ensure
that all athletes compete on a level playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   But some critics argue that drug use is not inherently different
from other ways many top athletes try to gain that tiny margin that
separates the winners from the losers.
</P>
<P>
   Take the arguments surrounding EPO. Dr. Norman Fost, the
director of the program in medical ethics at the University of
Wisconsin and an outspoken critic of what he sees as a double
standard, says there are three ways to raise the hemoglobin level
of blood: Train at high altitudes or spend time in chambers with
low oxygen levels, which accomplishes the same thing. Bank your own
red blood cells and then inject them. Or take EPO.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's hypocritical is saying there's something immoral about
using mechanism three or mechanism two,'' Fost said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many argue that taking a drug like EPO is unnatural. What
does it mean to break a world record when the athlete's edge is
supplied by a drug as opposed to something else? ``Tell me a sport
or show me an athlete that doesn't have unnatural assists,'' Fost
said, referring not only to special running shoes and fiberglass
poles for pole vaults but also to secret devices and methods.
</P>
<P>
   When American swimmer Janet Evans won a gold medal in the 1988
Olympics in Seoul, she wore a ``slime suit,'' a greasy swimsuit
that had been developed in secret, which slashed her time. At that
same Olympics, Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson was stripped of his
gold medal because he had failed a test for steroids. Fost says Ms.
Evans won praise for using an unnatural assist while Johnson was
vilified.
</P>
<P>
   Drugs are chemicals that change the body, but so are special
training diets, says Michael Shapiro, a law professor at the
University of Southern California. So is Gatorade.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the feelings about drugs is that they somehow make the
athlete superhuman, as opposed to getting a better bicycle or a
better pole vault,'' said James Bakalar, the associate editor of
the Harvard Mental Health Letter. ``When you analyze this, it
doesn't work out too clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   But aren't such performance-enhancing drugs dangerous? They are
certainly perceived to be. If spectacular victories raise
suspicions about drugs, so do illnesses. When American sprinter
Florence Griffith Joyner, the winner of three gold medals in the
1988 Olympics, died suddenly last year at age 38 of suffocation
related to an epileptic seizure, there was a spate of unfounded
whispers that drugs had killed her.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar example, Murray writes in a 1983 article for The
Hastings Center Report: ``I have heard reports of two women, world
champions in the 1970s, who appeared to age with stunning rapidity.
While no conclusive proof is possible that these effects were due
to steroids, or even that these two women used steroids, their
women competitors have no doubt that steroids were the cause.''
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence that athletes were harmed by such drugs is
scanty at best, said Fost. And if people are worried about physical
impairment, he adds, the risks of taking drugs pale in comparison
to the risks of simply playing many of the sports, even noncontact
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg Louganis cracked his head on the diving platform,'' Fost
said. ``We didn't say we want to ban diving because of its
danger.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the coercive nature of drugs, the pressure athletes
may feel to use them to keep up with their competitors? By using
drugs, athletes ``have turned a sport into a sophisticated game of
chicken,'' Murray writes.
</P>
<P>
   No one has to take such drugs and most athletes refuse them,
critics say. Yet every athlete takes part in a game of chicken when
it comes to deprivation and risk in training.
</P>
<P>
   Fost says there is perhaps another reason why drugs remain such
a major issue in sports: They can be a welcome diversion from other
issues, like the serious risks of permanent injury in football,
gymnastics and other events. The drug issue, he said, is ``a cheap
fix, a way of appearing concerned about ethical problems in
sports.''

scanty at best, said Fost. And if people are worried about physical
impairment, he adds, the risks of taking drugs pale in comparison
to the risks of simply playing many of the sports, even noncontact
sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg Louganis cracked his head on the diving platform,'' Fost
said. ``We didn't say we want to ban diving because of its
danger.''
</P>
<P>
   What about the coercive nature of drugs, the pressure athletes
may feel to use them to keep up with their competitors? By using
drugs, athletes ``have turned a sport into a sophisticated game of
chicken,'' Murray writes.
</P>
<P>
   No one has to take such drugs and most athletes refuse them,
critics say. Yet every athlete takes part in a game of chicken when
it comes to deprivation and risk in training.
</P>
<P>
   Fost says there is perhaps another reason why drugs remain such
a major issue in sports: They can be a welcome diversion from other
issues, like the serious risks of permanent injury in football,
gymnastics and other events. The drug issue, he said, is ``a cheap
fix, a way of appearing concerned about ethical problems in
sports.''

   LOS ANGELES _ In the two decades since John Belushi bellowed,
``Your honey or your wife!'' as a corpulent killer bee on
``Saturday Night Live,'' those relentless, aggressive insects have
passed out of the realm of schlock movies and sketch comedy and
into the daily reality of life in states along the Mexican border,
beginning nine years ago in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the last corner of Los Angeles County's 4,000
square miles was declared officially colonized by Africanized honey
bees, when a swarm was found lurking under the eves of a building
in the desolate desert suburb of Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   Science has been powerless to stop the bees' steady northward
march from South America, and the sighting of a single swirling
swarm in a backyard tree can still prompt a brief mention on the
local television news.
</P>
<P>
   But there is nothing like the panic in the streets that
Hollywood's mid-1970s imagination predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Californians have reacted to this latest invader with
equanimity because their state has long been home to a rogues'
gallery of flying, crawling pestilence. This is, after all, the
place ``where bowers of flowers bloom in the sun,'' and that means
a motley chorus of pests the world over is always buzzing
``California, Here I Come!'' and posing new threats to the state's
$27 billion-a-year agricultural industry.
</P>
<P>
   There are thrips, tiny juice-sucking insects that prey on
avocados, scarring and discoloring the fruit so it looks like a
potato. There are olive fruit flies from the Mediterranean,
discovered here last fall, the first ever in California and perhaps
in all of North America, which leave black olives grayish-white and
rotting. There are red imported fire ants from South America, whose
mounds grow as big as basketballs and make it hard to move
harvesting equipment through orchards.
</P>
<P>
   And now come the Africanized bees, whose ancestors came from
South Africa and were released inadvertently from a Brazilian
breeding experiment 42 years ago. They have gradually moved north
and west, and recently were discovered for the first time east of
the Mississippi River, in Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The bees are no more venomous than their calmer cousins but are
considerably more aggressive, capable of delivering 10 times as
many stings.
</P>
<P>
   In California, the bees stand poised to colonize the commercial
honey-bee hives that are vital to pollinating commercial crops,
principally almond groves. Because the Africanized bees are
unpredictable and harder to manage, they represent a threat to an
important industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we have so many things blooming and growing together
here that don't belong together?'' asks Robert Page, an
entomologist at the University of California at Davis who has
helped isolate a gene that may make Africanized bees meaner.
``We've been a real cultural mixing bowl forever. Everybody who
comes wants to bring their favorite plant. And when they come, they
also bring their favorite plant's parasite or disease agent.''
</P>
<P>
   In this state, there is seldom a letup.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 the state Department of Agriculture set up the Pest
Detection Emergency Protection division to combat an invasion of
the Mediterranean fruit fly, which attacks 250 types of crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a long discussion about what we would do when there
wasn't an emergency project to keep people busy,'' Pat Minyard, the
division's manager, said ruefully, adding: ``We've never had that
situation. There is an extraordinary range of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Jennings, director of Pest Management Policy for the
Department of Agriculture in Washington, said he knew of no formal
ranking of pests by state, but that California and Florida, with
their warm climates, long growing seasons and diverse crops, would
be together at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a pest unless it's doing something economically,''
Jennings said. ``What rises to be a pest is a direct function of
what you're growing.''
</P>
<P>
   For ordinary citizens, Africanized bees can be a severe
annoyance, and there have been a handful of fatalities, including a
72-year-old man who was attacked and killed two years ago in his
mobile home in Casa Grande, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Noise, like that from lawn mowers or leaf blowers, seems to
aggravate the bees. The Africanized variety will chase a human who
disturbs it up to a quarter mile, 12 times as far as the European
bee, and if you duck under water, it will simply outwait you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, everyone should just increase their awareness about
it,'' said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Agriculture
Department. ``There's not really much that we can do to stop its
flow. We live with a lot of pests that can harm you, sting you.
Awareness is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, California works diligently to stop the flow of
pests that pose more immediate threats to agriculture, especially
the various fruit flies that love backyards and commercial
orchards.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, much of San Diego is under quarantine because of
Mexican fruit fly infestations, and big black and white signs
dotting the freeways warn residents not to move fruit from trees in
their own backyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, people don't realize the impact they could
have in bringing even a single piece of fruit,'' Hidalgo said.
``You shouldn't even take it off your property. If you take it a
mile, two miles to your office, now that's an infested area, too.
But it's something we have to basically use the honor system on.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, in the Westwood section of Los Angeles, 10 olive
fruit flies were found in a residential neighborhood, and about 400
have now been trapped in an effort to gauge the scale of the
problem over a 300-square mile area.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say it was the first-ever sighting of this pest in
California, though it is widespread in Europe and North Africa.
Unlike other fruit flies, it poses a threat only to olives, but
California is the nation's sole producer of commercially grown
olives, with a 1997 crop valued at nearly $70 million. Most of the
growing areas are well north of Los Angeles, but officials are
taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' said Minyard of the state agriculture department,
``we're just trapping, trying to wait and see.''

important industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do we have so many things blooming and growing together
here that don't belong together?'' asks Robert Page, an
entomologist at the University of California at Davis who has
helped isolate a gene that may make Africanized bees meaner.
``We've been a real cultural mixing bowl forever. Everybody who
comes wants to bring their favorite plant. And when they come, they
also bring their favorite plant's parasite or disease agent.''
</P>
<P>
   In this state, there is seldom a letup.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982 the state Department of Agriculture set up the Pest
Detection Emergency Protection division to combat an invasion of
the Mediterranean fruit fly, which attacks 250 types of crops.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a long discussion about what we would do when there
wasn't an emergency project to keep people busy,'' Pat Minyard, the
division's manager, said ruefully, adding: ``We've never had that
situation. There is an extraordinary range of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Jennings, director of Pest Management Policy for the
Department of Agriculture in Washington, said he knew of no formal
ranking of pests by state, but that California and Florida, with
their warm climates, long growing seasons and diverse crops, would
be together at the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a pest unless it's doing something economically,''
Jennings said. ``What rises to be a pest is a direct function of
what you're growing.''
</P>
<P>
   For ordinary citizens, Africanized bees can be a severe
annoyance, and there have been a handful of fatalities, including a
72-year-old man who was attacked and killed two years ago in his
mobile home in Casa Grande, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Noise, like that from lawn mowers or leaf blowers, seems to
aggravate the bees. The Africanized variety will chase a human who
disturbs it up to a quarter mile, 12 times as far as the European
bee, and if you duck under water, it will simply outwait you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, everyone should just increase their awareness about
it,'' said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for the state Agriculture
Department. ``There's not really much that we can do to stop its
flow. We live with a lot of pests that can harm you, sting you.
Awareness is the key.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, California works diligently to stop the flow of
pests that pose more immediate threats to agriculture, especially
the various fruit flies that love backyards and commercial
orchards.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, much of San Diego is under quarantine because of
Mexican fruit fly infestations, and big black and white signs
dotting the freeways warn residents not to move fruit from trees in
their own backyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, people don't realize the impact they could
have in bringing even a single piece of fruit,'' Hidalgo said.
``You shouldn't even take it off your property. If you take it a
mile, two miles to your office, now that's an infested area, too.
But it's something we have to basically use the honor system on.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, in the Westwood section of Los Angeles, 10 olive
fruit flies were found in a residential neighborhood, and about 400
have now been trapped in an effort to gauge the scale of the
problem over a 300-square mile area.
</P>
<P>
   Officials say it was the first-ever sighting of this pest in
California, though it is widespread in Europe and North Africa.
Unlike other fruit flies, it poses a threat only to olives, but
California is the nation's sole producer of commercially grown
olives, with a 1997 crop valued at nearly $70 million. Most of the
growing areas are well north of Los Angeles, but officials are
taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' said Minyard of the state agriculture department,
``we're just trapping, trying to wait and see.''

   TOKYO _ Anyone who believes that respectability is priceless has
not been to Japan lately. Here it sells for $100 a month.
</P>
<P>
   While the Japanese economy remains a mess, one type of business
seems to be doing well: the alibi-ya, whose name comes from the
English word alibi and the suffix ya, meaning a seller. In essence,
they are conjurers who make people at the margins of Japanese
society look dignified and respectable.
</P>
<P>
   The alibi-ya are the marketplace's way of reconciling a shame
society _ one that emphasizes peer pressure and public shame to
achieve good behavior _ with what are regarded as shameful
industries. Japan, more than most industrialized countries, has
strict bounds of propriety and plenty of minders to see that they
are adhered to. As everywhere, they often are not.
</P>
<P>
   Women in the sex industry are frequent clients of the alibi-ya,
which enable them to tell mom and even boyfriends about their fine
jobs in a trading company. The alibi-ya provide name cards, pay
stubs and an impressive position in a decent line of work _ all
totally fictitious. If a caller tries to reach the young woman
while she is at her nonexistent job, a polite receptionist will
explain that she has stepped out but will return the call shortly.
Then the receptionist passes on the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``Girls want to make their families feel better,'' explained
Kenichi Seko, who runs an alibi-ya called Fuji Operating. ``They
want their families to think that they have a good, proper job.''
Seko sat at a conference table in his comfortable ground-floor
office suite with computers and black leather couches. On the door
are the names of several companies Seko uses on name cards given to
his customers. But there is no mention of Fuji Operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to have a girl's family come here looking for
her and see Fuji Operating and realize that it's an alibi-ya,''
Seko explained. ``If anybody comes here, it looks like the real
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The alibi-ya business sector is, of course, a tiny one by the
standards of Japanese industry, and it began only about a decade
ago. At first it involved just telephone answering services, but
now it supplies various phony employment references and pay stubs
to help clients rent apartments or obtain credit cards. An alibi-ya
can even provide a fake boss to make a wedding speech about what a
wonderful employee the bride was.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcasters are also entering the alibi-ya business. Japan's
cable radio system, with its crystal-clear reception on dozens of
channels, carries one called the ``alibi channel.'' It broadcasts
the honks and rumble of roadside traffic so that a subscriber can
turn on the radio and make a call that sounds as if it were coming
from a telephone booth on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how listeners use the alibi broadcasts,'' said
Yasuhiro Urasaki, a producer for cable radio. ``But I assume that
they use it when they oversleep and miss a meeting with a client.
Then they can put on the alibi program and then call and say,
`Sorry to be late, but I got lost on the way.'''
</P>
<P>
   Major train stations also have the equivalent of alibi shops,
selling specialty gifts from all over Japan. Thus if a businessman
has forgotten to get a gift for a friend while on a trip to the
southern city of Fukuoka, he can go to Tokyo Station and get a
typical Fukuoka product like hot pickled pollack roe. Or he can
tell his wife he is going on a business trip to the northern island
of Hokkaido, and then on his way home from his girlfriend's house
swing by Tokyo Station to pick up an appropriate Hokkaido gift,
like Rishiri Island dried kelp.
</P>
<P>
   The sex industry is the main customer for the alibi-ya,
reflecting one of the paradoxes of Japan: A society that puts a
premium on traditional virtue (at least for women) also has a huge
sex industry. ``Japan has modernized in many ways, but mentally
it's pre-modern,'' said Yoko Tajima, a prominent feminist who
teaches at Housei University in Tokyo. ``Even high school students
sell themselves; even housewives sell themselves. But on the other
hand, women are supposed to be virtuous.''
</P>
<P>
   While the United States tends to fill the ranks of prostitutes
at least partly with drug addicts and a large underclass, Japan has
almost no underclass or addicts. So massage parlors are staffed by
middle-class women and girls who are frequently extremely
uncomfortable with what they are doing _ and who are close enough
to their families to want to stay in regular touch.
</P>
<P>
   The reason seems to be that with Japan's recession, a growing
number (though still a tiny proportion) of housewives are worrying
about how to pay the mortgages and are quietly getting jobs in sex
businesses, while telling family members that they are working in
an office or restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Respectability is apparently a crucial consideration, for
recruitment advertisements by sexual establishments all focus on
two lures: lots of money and an in-house alibi-ya. Usually the
in-house alibi-ya is just a second telephone line answered in the
name of a different company. Or else it is an affiliated restaurant
where the woman pretends to work. So some women want the greater
protection and benefits of a professional alibi-ya, even though the
fees are hefty _ typically, a registration fee of $100 and then $50
to $150 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a society where people don't trust people,'' said
Seko, explaining the attraction of an alibi-ya like his own. ``They
trust where you work, what your position is. It's strange. A girl
can have a huge amount of money in the bank, but a real estate
company won't want to rent to her. And then I put my chop on a
paper, saying she works for me, and then they trust that.''

BEYOND THE BAR EXAM: A QUESTION OF CHARACTER

<P>
   To win admission to the bar in New York state, law school
graduates are asked to deny under oath that they have ever belonged
to any group ``advocating or teaching that the government of the
United States, or any state or any political subdivision thereof,
should be overthrown.''
</P>
<P>
   That question, with its echoes of McCarthyism, is part of a
character review that is as essential to becoming a lawyer in the
United States as passing the bar exam.
</P>
<P>
   The arcane character-and-fitness process, conducted in the
strictest secrecy, got some rare public attention after a series of
drive-by shootings last weekend in the Midwest that may have been
touched off by the denial on moral grounds of a law license to the
leader of a white supremacist group.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Nathaniel Smith, who killed himself last Sunday as the
police closed in on him, was a disciple of Matthew Hale, a white
supremacist whose appeal for a law license had been rejected by the
Illinois bar on July 2, just hours before Smith began his shooting
spree. Hale said that Smith might have taken the rejection as a
sign that the group's rights were being trampled upon.
</P>
<P>
   Court officials in several states said denials of law licenses
on ideological grounds were common in past decades, but are now
rare. Today, denials almost always involve financial problems, drug
or alcohol abuse, or conviction for several serious crimes. Child
support has become a major issue, and applicants in New York have
been turned down for being more than three months behind in their
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Other financial problems that can prevent admission to the bar
include unsatisfied judgments and failure to honor agreements to
pay off credit card debts. And applicants have been denied
admission if they lost time in school because of drug or alcohol
problems, but had not sought treatment, or had multiple convictions
for driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol. In some cases,
the officials said, applicants withdrew their requests for
admission when they realized the bar officials had obtained
information about their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hale, who graduated from law school and passed the bar
examination, was rejected by the Illinois Bar Association's
Committee on Character and Fitness last December. The panel said
his racist activities demonstrated that he did not have the fitness
of character to qualify as a lawyer. He heads a white supremacist
group called The World Church of the Creator, advocates white
separatism, and has said he would prefer not to represent black
clients.
</P>
<P>
   In rejecting Hale last December, the panel said, ``History tells
us that extermination is sometimes not far behind when government
power is held by persons of his racial views.'' Hale has said he
plans to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme cases like Hale's notwithstanding, some experts think
the moral standard for admission to the bar is not taken seriously
enough. Hale was among 25 rejections out of 3,200 applicants in
Illinois last year; in Manhattan and the Bronx, fewer than 10 out
of 2,600 applications were rejected. Nearly all the rejections
involved financial or substance-abuse problems, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immoral character should not exclude only the Hales,'' said
Richard Zitrin, a San Francisco lawyer who is the co-author of
``The Moral Compass of the American Lawyer'' (Ballantine, 1999). He
said reviews of applicants are not tough enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``All kinds of people are flying below the moral-character radar
because too often that element of admission is a rubber stamp,''
Zitrin said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, James Cohen, the chairman of the legal education
committee of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York,
said the reviews have become largely proforma. He recalled the case
of a law student who had three felony drug convictions but was
admitted on the ground that he had demonstrated rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, Cohen said, reviewers know only what the
applicant reports about convictions, debts and other problems.
Lying on an application can lead to disbarment, but Cohen said it
is unlikely that fudgers will be caught. And he said anyone who has
negative information about an applicant is unlikely to intervene,
partly out of fear of being sued.
</P>
<P>
   Character and fitness checks, which vary in form and seriousness
from state to state, have their roots in the 12th century. They are
justified on the theory that the court must be able to rely on a
lawyer's word, and attorneys must be trusted with clients' money.
</P>
<P>
   But the standards have varied over the centuries, and critics
say the checks have been used in different eras to prevent members
of minority groups and suspected communists from practicing law.
Several law professors said reviewers should focus on a small list
of criminal offenses like embezzlement that might have a bearing on
the practice of law, and should stay away from free-speech issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old elephants harrumph and say the standards of the bar
are deteriorating and this is no time to yield,'' said Geoffrey
Hazard, a legal ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. ``But
they are generating a ton of paperwork for very little
consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the critics' complaints is that the standards are vague.
In New York, for instance, an applicant must demonstrate to a
committee run by the state Supreme Court that he or she ``possesses
the character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and
counselor-at-law.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Rhode, a law professor at Stanford University who has
studied character committees, said the criteria that exist are
applied with great inconsistency. She found, for instance, that a
committee in one part of a state had rejected applicants based on
parking and fishing offenses, while a committee in another part of
the same state had approved a convicted child molester.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their character flaws, lawyers in Manhattan, at least,
seem to be a patriotic bunch. Confronted with the question about
whether they had ever plotted to overthrow the government, not one
applicant in the last 10 years has answered, ``Yes.''

plans to take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Extreme cases like Hale's notwithstanding, some experts think
the moral standard for admission to the bar is not taken seriously
enough. Hale was among 25 rejections out of 3,200 applicants in
Illinois last year; in Manhattan and the Bronx, fewer than 10 out
of 2,600 applications were rejected. Nearly all the rejections
involved financial or substance-abuse problems, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Immoral character should not exclude only the Hales,'' said
Richard Zitrin, a San Francisco lawyer who is the co-author of
``The Moral Compass of the American Lawyer'' (Ballantine, 1999). He
said reviews of applicants are not tough enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``All kinds of people are flying below the moral-character radar
because too often that element of admission is a rubber stamp,''
Zitrin said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, James Cohen, the chairman of the legal education
committee of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York,
said the reviews have become largely proforma. He recalled the case
of a law student who had three felony drug convictions but was
admitted on the ground that he had demonstrated rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, Cohen said, reviewers know only what the
applicant reports about convictions, debts and other problems.
Lying on an application can lead to disbarment, but Cohen said it
is unlikely that fudgers will be caught. And he said anyone who has
negative information about an applicant is unlikely to intervene,
partly out of fear of being sued.
</P>
<P>
   Character and fitness checks, which vary in form and seriousness
from state to state, have their roots in the 12th century. They are
justified on the theory that the court must be able to rely on a
lawyer's word, and attorneys must be trusted with clients' money.
</P>
<P>
   But the standards have varied over the centuries, and critics
say the checks have been used in different eras to prevent members
of minority groups and suspected communists from practicing law.
Several law professors said reviewers should focus on a small list
of criminal offenses like embezzlement that might have a bearing on
the practice of law, and should stay away from free-speech issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old elephants harrumph and say the standards of the bar
are deteriorating and this is no time to yield,'' said Geoffrey
Hazard, a legal ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania. ``But
they are generating a ton of paperwork for very little
consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the critics' complaints is that the standards are vague.
In New York, for instance, an applicant must demonstrate to a
committee run by the state Supreme Court that he or she ``possesses
the character and general fitness requisite for an attorney and
counselor-at-law.''
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Rhode, a law professor at Stanford University who has
studied character committees, said the criteria that exist are
applied with great inconsistency. She found, for instance, that a
committee in one part of a state had rejected applicants based on
parking and fishing offenses, while a committee in another part of
the same state had approved a convicted child molester.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their character flaws, lawyers in Manhattan, at least,
seem to be a patriotic bunch. Confronted with the question about
whether they had ever plotted to overthrow the government, not one
applicant in the last 10 years has answered, ``Yes.''

   NEW YORK _ For many parents in urban America, agonizing over
whether to send their children to public or private schools has
become a ritual fraught with concerns about money and fears that a
public-school education is a sentence to a life of second-class
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Many parents think private schools do a better job, an
assumption that has grown into a powerful movement for tax vouchers
to help children leave the public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But hard evidence comparing the performance of public and
nonpublic schools has proved elusive. This month, however, New York
state released test scores on a new fourth-grade reading and
writing test that provided a rare basis for side-by-side
comparison, and the results were surprising: There were only modest
differences in the performance of private schools _ mainly Catholic
ones _ and public schools.
</P>
<P>
   The comparison is far from perfect. For one thing, the test was
new and controversial. Some schools drilled students for months,
even during holidays, while others did little to prepare. The test
was optional for private schools, and many of them opted out _
including nearly all the elite ones in New York City _ making
generalizations about private school performance especially
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was general agreement among educators that the
results present a challenge to the conventional wisdom about public
and private education.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, 53 percent of private-school students passed the
test, compared to 48 percent of public-school students. In New York
City the gap was wider: 44 percent of private school students
passed, as against 33 percent of those in public school.
</P>
<P>
   But when students with learning or behavioral problems are
excluded, the scores rise for public schools. (The public schools
have far more of these special education students: 50,519
fourth-graders statewide compared with a mere 647 in private
school, according to the state statistics.) Excluding special
education, 55 percent of students private schools statewide passed
the test, and 52 percent of those in public school. In New York
City, 45 percent of students in private school passed the test, and
37 percent of those in public school.
</P>
<P>
   The new test was administered to 29,000 fourth-graders in 1,024
private schools, 74 percent of private schools statewide.
Ninety-nine percent of the Catholic schools, 686 of them,
administered the test. The next highest participation was among
Jewish schools _ 104 of them, or 61 percent, gave the test. Sixty
nondenominational schools, or 34 percent, participated.
</P>
<P>
   Public-school advocates say the scores show that public schools
have been unfairly maligned. ``The parochial schools didn't shine
at all,'' said Seymour Fliegel, a senior fellow at the Center for
Educational Innovation, a research group that supports public
schools in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Even some voucher advocates acknowledge that the test shows that
private schools are no panacea. ``The private schools really ought
to be doing a whole lot better than they're doing by taking
advantage of their freedom to do things differently, and by
delivering a superior product,'' said Chester Finn, a former Reagan
Administration official now at the Manhattan Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Finn suggests that the dirty little secret behind the new data
is that almost everyone in the education world, whether in public
or private school, is the captive of the same fads, philosophies
and materials disseminated by teaching colleges and textbook
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The curriculum of a fourth-grade math class in a private
school is often very close to the curriculum of a fourth-grade math
class in a public school, complete with all the same
vulnerabilities, the same goofiness, often the same textbook and
the same teacher beliefs about what's important,'' Finn said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some previous studies comparing public and
Catholic schools, notably one by sociologist James S. Coleman in
1981 and another by a New York state commission in 1994. Both
concluded that Catholic schools do better, but questions were
raised about their methodologies.
</P>
<P>
   The new test, administered for the first time this year,
required students to read long passages of fiction and nonfiction,
and to write essays about what they had read. It was preceded by
months of feverish cramming and hand-wringing from both teachers
and parents, who feared it was too difficult, and perhaps even
inappropriate for 9-year-olds. It was scored in four levels,
roughly corresponding to minimally skilled, below standard,
proficient and superior, although the state did not endorse any
labels.
</P>
<P>
   The results gave ammunition to people who think Catholic schools
serve disadvantaged students better than public schools. The
private schools, both religious and independent, had just half as
many students at the bottom level, or 8 percent, compared to 16
percent for public schools, excluding special education. Joseph
Viteritti, research director of the Wagner School at New York
University, said this proved that ``fewer kids fall between the
cracks'' in private school. But another explanation, said Fliegel,
is that the most disadvantaged students may be the least able or
motivated to go to private schools.

   At the high end, though, public schools did at least as well as
private ones. Statewide, 5 percent of private school students and
5.6 percent of public school students, excluding those in special
education, scored in the top category; in New York City, the
numbers are 3 percent for private and 3.5 percent for public.
</P>
<P>
   Some individual Catholic schools excelled. At St. Jerome's in
the South Bronx, 29 percent of the students passed the test, ahead
of all but one surrounding public school. Nearby Catholic schools
did much worse, with St. Pius V, for instance, having only 11
percent passing. St. Jerome's is one of New York City's poorest
parishes, where income averages $5,000 per person, said the Rev.
John O. Grange, the parish priest. Some students are the children
of poor, illiterate Mexican immigrants, on scholarship. But Father
Grange said most of the students are slightly better off than those
in nearby public schools. Tuition is $2,000 per child.
</P>
<P>
   But in middle-class neighborhoods, public schools tended to
outscore Catholic schools. In affluent Bayside, Queens, for
instance, 81 percent of public-school students passed the test,
compared with 60 percent in Catholic schools.
</P>
<P>
   Among the independent schools that took the test, variations in
performance discourage sweeping conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   The Trinity School on the Upper West Side was one of the top
performers in the state, with 98 percent passing, 30 percent in the
top level, and just 2 percent below standard.. At Manhattan Country
School on the East Side, more children scored in the middle, with
94 percent passing, but only 0.3 percent at the top and 6 percent
below standard. At the Cathedral School in Morningside Heights,
only six students took the test, indicating the danger of making
too much of statistics at all.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line, said Diane Ravitch, a senior fellow at the
Brookings Institution, is that no one type of school is inherently
better or worse. ``You can't really make a blanket statement,'' Dr.
Ravitch said. ``A parent can only make a judgment about what's good
for their own child.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When President Clinton headed to the back roads of Appalachia
last week to call attention to those left out of the nation's
pageant of prosperity, his visit had a distinctly familiar air.
John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson had all
made the trip more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   You can still find many of the poorest Americans living in the
shadow of rickety coal tipples in Appalachian hollows, but
Clinton's visit, in fact, had as much to do with change as
constancy. Despite the poverty that persists, Appalachia is a very
different place with very different economic development needs than
it was in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   What never seems to change is the mythology of the place as the
poster child for American poverty, an image that persists, to the
region's detriment and benefit, no matter how much times change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always glad when we get any kind of attention, because
the region remains so misunderstood,'' said Jean Haskell, director
of the Center for Appalachian Studies and Services at East
Tennessee State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' she said, ``what happens a lot of the time is
that images are so ingrained, we get, by definition, the same old
culture-of-poverty story. It's a very oversimplified view of the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   Images of Appalachian poverty go back to regional writing of the
19th century. But that image of a place ``below the bottom looking
up to see the bottom,'' as one local mayor put it in the 1960s,
took on particular resonance during that era, when the ills of
Appalachia became a prime spur for the War on Poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Appalachia still remains poorer than the nation as a whole, and
in forlorn coal mining communities far off the interstates, life
can seem every bit as dismal as it did 35 years ago. But, by most
measures, Appalachia is becoming less a place apart.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, 219 of the 406 counties in the region qualified as
distressed, meaning they had poverty and unemployment levels 150
percent of the national norm, and per capita income two-thirds or
more below the national norm. Today 108 counties are listed as
distressed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, 31 percent of the people in the region lived in poverty
compared with 22 percent nationally. Now the poverty rate is 15
percent, just two points above the national average. Once an
educational wasteland, the region now has a high school graduation
rate slightly above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the region has not shared in the current prosperity. But
from the manufacturing hub of Tupelo, Miss., to the aerospace
center at Huntsville, Ala., to the glutted tourism scene in
Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, Tenn., or the booming retirement and
second-home meccas in Asheville, Cashiers or Highlands, N.C., much
of Appalachia is basking in the same economic glow as the rest of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is the region has progressed
tremendously in the 34 years since Johnson went there,'' said Jesse
White, the federal co-chairman of the Appalachian Regional
Commission, which was established in 1965 to promote economic
development. It is headed each year by a federal appointee and by a
governor of one of the states.
</P>
<P>
   But the old images persist, and were probably reinforced by
Clinton's trip, a subject that people in the region view with very
mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Appalachia has benefited enormously because of
its down-and-out image.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the Appalachian Regional Commission has approved
spending $7.4 billion in the region, which covers parts of 13
states. Nearly two thirds of that has gone to build 2,400 of an
anticipated 3,000 miles of highway.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it is a short step or two from the image of
pervasive poverty to the stereotype of inbred, gap-toothed
hillbillies who, needy or not, are not necessarily the most likely
targets for corporate recruiters looking for attractive expansion
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to call attention to the problems to get the proper
kind of focus,'' said West Virginia Gov. Cecil Underwood, the other
commission co-chairman. ``But if you overplay it, then it just adds
to the morale problems and the loss of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   There was both praise for and skepticism about Clinton's talk of
new markets, investment and entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   And a bleak analysis would say that, despite the progress, the
region faces enormous new hurdles because its traditional strengths
in natural resources do not go as far in an age defined by
microchips rather than coal mines.
</P>
<P>
   But both White and Ms. Haskell said that the trip reflected a
contemporary approach to the region's economic development _ more
focused on entrepreneurship and long-term investment than on
smokestack chasing or anti-poverty programs. In that sense, White
said, maybe the imagery of the region will finally begin to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very different trip than the one LBJ took in the
1960s,'' he said. ``If you remember, President Clinton's second
stop was to an electronics company started by a man who left the
region and then came back and created good-paying jobs. The last
thing we wanted was for the bad news of Appalachia to be the only
story that came out of this trip.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When President Clinton headed to the back roads of Appalachia
last week to call attention to those left out of the nation's
pageant of prosperity, his visit had a distinctly familiar air.
John F. Kennedy, Robert F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson had all
made the trip more than 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   You can still find many of the poorest Americans living in the
shadow of rickety coal tipples in Appalachian hollows, but
Clinton's visit, in fact, had as much to do with change as
constancy. Despite the poverty that persists, Appalachia is a very
different place with very different economic development needs than
it was in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   What never seems to change is the mythology of the place as the
poster child for American poverty, an image that persists, to the
region's detriment and benefit, no matter how much times change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always glad when we get any kind of attention, because
the region remains so misunderstood,'' said Jean Haskell, director
of the Center for Appalachian Studies and Services at East
Tennessee State University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' she said, ``what happens a lot of the time is
that images are so ingrained, we get, by definition, the same old
culture-of-poverty story. It's a very oversimplified view of the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   Images of Appalachian poverty go back to regional writing of the
19th century. But that image of a place ``below the bottom looking
up to see the bottom,'' as one local mayor put it in the 1960s,
took on particular resonance during that era, when the ills of
Appalachia became a prime spur for the War on Poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Appalachia still remains poorer than the nation as a whole, and
in forlorn coal mining communities far off the interstates, life
can seem every bit as dismal as it did 35 years ago. But, by most
measures, Appalachia is becoming less a place apart.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, 219 of the 406 counties in the region qualified as
distressed, meaning they had poverty and unemployment levels 150
percent of the national norm, and per capita income two-thirds or
more below the national norm. Today 108 counties are listed as
distressed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1960, 31 percent of the people in the region lived in poverty
compared with 22 percent nationally. Now the poverty rate is 15
percent, just two points above the national average. Once an
educational wasteland, the region now has a high school graduation
rate slightly above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the region has not shared in the current prosperity. But
from the manufacturing hub of Tupelo, Miss., to the aerospace
center at Huntsville, Ala., to the glutted tourism scene in
Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge, Tenn., or the booming retirement and
second-home meccas in Asheville, Cashiers or Highlands, N.C., much
of Appalachia is basking in the same economic glow as the rest of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth of the matter is the region has progressed
tremendously in the 34 years since Johnson went there,'' said Jesse
White, the federal co-chairman of the Appalachian Regional
Commission, which was established in 1965 to promote economic
development. It is headed each year by a federal appointee and by a
governor of one of the states.
</P>
<P>
   But the old images persist, and were probably reinforced by
Clinton's trip, a subject that people in the region view with very
mixed feelings.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Appalachia has benefited enormously because of
its down-and-out image.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1965, the Appalachian Regional Commission has approved
spending $7.4 billion in the region, which covers parts of 13
states. Nearly two thirds of that has gone to build 2,400 of an
anticipated 3,000 miles of highway.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it is a short step or two from the image of
pervasive poverty to the stereotype of inbred, gap-toothed
hillbillies who, needy or not, are not necessarily the most likely
targets for corporate recruiters looking for attractive expansion
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to call attention to the problems to get the proper
kind of focus,'' said West Virginia Gov. Cecil Underwood, the other
commission co-chairman. ``But if you overplay it, then it just adds
to the morale problems and the loss of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   There was both praise for and skepticism about Clinton's talk of
new markets, investment and entrepreneurship.
</P>
<P>
   And a bleak analysis would say that, despite the progress, the
region faces enormous new hurdles because its traditional strengths
in natural resources do not go as far in an age defined by
microchips rather than coal mines.
</P>
<P>
   But both White and Ms. Haskell said that the trip reflected a
contemporary approach to the region's economic development _ more
focused on entrepreneurship and long-term investment than on
smokestack chasing or anti-poverty programs. In that sense, White
said, maybe the imagery of the region will finally begin to change.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very different trip than the one LBJ took in the
1960s,'' he said. ``If you remember, President Clinton's second
stop was to an electronics company started by a man who left the
region and then came back and created good-paying jobs. The last
thing we wanted was for the bad news of Appalachia to be the only
story that came out of this trip.''

   The duffel bag full of diamonds makes for a great plot twist, no
doubt about it. Also the ``to do'' list that began, ``Launder
money.'' All in all, the tale of Martin Frankel is already making a
most satisfying addition to the lore of that most modern of
outlaws, the fugitive inancier.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a surprising number of them in the last three
decades, with Robert Vesco being perhaps the most notorious. And
their stories serve as a reminder that even millions of dollars of
loot cannot buy happiness, at least when you're on the lam. A good
safe haven is hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel was a reclusive stock trader who operated from
Greenwich, Conn., where secretive money managers are thick on the
ground. But last year, while John Meriwether and the crew at
Long-Term Capital Management were legitimately losing billions of
dollars through complex trades and threatening the foundations of
the world financial system, prosecutors say Frankel was engaged in
a rather different economic activity: looting insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel disappeared in early May, shortly before firefighters in
Greenwich were called to one of his estates to douse a smoldering
filing cabinet. Investigators found, among other things, the ``to
do'' list, as well as astrological charts created to help answer
the question, ``Should I leave?''
</P>
<P>
   The stars must have been auspicious; Frankel has disappeared,
along with millions (perhaps billions) of dollars, according to
prosecutors and court documents. A diamond dealer has confirmed
that he sold Frankel $10 million worth of stones, and that
associates of the financier packed them up in two suitcases and a
duffel bag.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel is believed to be hiding in Europe now, but only after
having looked into countries elsewhere that have been safe havens
for other financial fraudsters.
</P>
<P>
   One was Brazil, where Ronald Biggs has become something of a
tourist attraction. Biggs helped pull off Britain's Great Train
Robbery in 1963, and escaped from prison in 1965; he surfaced in
South America in 1970, and has since managed to fend off all
efforts to extradite him (Brazil's excuse was that Biggs had
fathered a son there who would be hurt if his father was sent back
to face the music).
</P>
<P>
   Another spot Frankel studied, according to documents he left
behind, was Israel, which grants citizenship to almost any Jew who
chooses to immigrate (gangster Meyer Lansky was an exception).
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli citizenship did not help Eddie Antar, also known as
Crazy Eddie, whose chain of electronics stores collapsed in 1989.
He disappeared shortly thereafter, and prosecutors and lawyers for
the company's shareholders discovered that Antar had spirited
millions of dollars to Switzerland, Lichtenstein, England, Canada
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Antar may indeed have been a little nuts; the U.S. marshals got
on to him after he demanded that Swiss police help him get access
to a frozen bank account. He had apparently been living the high
life on several continents under several names but was based in
Israel, where he was arrested in 1992; he was sent back to the
United States, where he ultimately pleaded guilty to racketeering.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland may be the best haven of all, depending on what you
are charged with. Tax evasion is not cause for extradition there,
which is why Marc Rich is flourishing in the Alpine town of Zug. A
commodities trader accused of tax cheating, he fled to Switzerland
in 1984, and until 1994 ran an extremely successful trading
operation.
</P>
<P>
   For foreign-born swindlers, the United States appears to be a
popular destination. The Irish Times recently reported on the case
of Finbarr Ross, whose financial empire collapsed in 1984 owing
investors millions of pounds. He was arrested last year in
Oklahoma, where he had become an ordained minister at the Light of
Christ Church in the small town of Talequah.
</P>
<P>
   Caribbean islands may seem alluring, but they do not always work
out. In the 1980s, J. David Dominelli convinced San Diego's high
society that he was a crackerjack currency trader who would make
them millions. He wasn't and he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   When his scheme collapsed, he fled to Montserrat, a British
colony where he had set up a bank. Maybe he shouldn't have held
that news conference; in any event, he was booted out and sent back
to Miami, where he was arrested. He was sentenced to 20 years for
fraud and tax evasion.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping a low profile can be hard for truly proficient
fraudsters. David Friedland, a former New Jersey state senator,
faked his death by staging a scuba-diving accident in the Bahamas
in 1985. Soon he was indicted for stealing $20 million from a union
pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, he turned up in the Maldive Islands in the
Indian Ocean, which is pretty much as far from everything as a
fugitive can get. But his flashy style and success as a businessman
(he had a chain of scuba shops) had attracted too much attention,
federal marshals said after they arrested him in 1987. They added
that he had posed for a photo used on a tourism postcard, which may
not have been a great move, stealth-wise.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to fugitive financiers, nobody beats Vesco,
who could have been dreamed up by Graham Greene (or Ian Fleming).
To avoid charges that he had stolen more than $200 million from a
European mutual fund, Vesco fled in 1972 to Costa Rica, which at
the time was a haven for the legally challenged.
</P>
<P>
   Buying influence seems to have been part of his modus operandi;
in addition to contributing to Costa Rican officials, he made an
illegal $200,000 campaign contribution to Richard Nixon. He was
also indicted in the United States in 1989 on charges of organizing
drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   One problem with buying governments, however, is that they do
not always stay bought. In the late 1970s, Vesco was forced to move
to the Bahamas, and then, in the 1980s, to Cuba. He appeared to
live under the protection of Fidel Castro, and maintained the usual
trappings of a successful financial fugitive: houses, cars, planes,
yachts and flunkies.
</P>
<P>
   But three years ago, Cuba charged Vesco with fraud in connection
with a company that was supposed to be developing a cure for
cancer. He was convicted and, when last heard of, was serving a
13-year sentence in a Cuban prison.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear exactly what ran out, Vesco's money or his luck
(or Castro's patience). But at least it narrows the search for the
latest fugitive financier: Frankel probably has no plans to move to
Havana.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The bedfellows get stranger and stranger: Rep. Henry Hyde, the
anti-abortion, right-wing Republican, joins forces with Rep. Barney
Frank, the gay, left-wing Democrat, to curb federal power in
property forfeiture; Ron Unz, the conservative Republican who
helped end bilingual education in California, argues against school
vouchers in the pages of The Nation, a leftist magazine; the
Clinton administration fights its longtime allies, the trade
unions, over their support of steel import quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Politics has long forged odd alliances but there is clearly
something significant happening to the national debate when
give-peace-a-chance Vietnam doves morph into Kosovo hawks and the
front-runner for each party's presidential nomination slams the
door on traditional party militants to capture the political center
when the nomination process has barely begun.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, when people were described as ``on the left'' or
``on the right,'' liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican,
their views on a range of issues _ on religion and state,
education, war and peace, taxation _ could be inferred. That's no
longer the case.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who tried for years to kill the federal Education
Department now want to be known as the education party. The
Democrats, whose long commitment to fighting poverty was evident
last week in President Clinton's tour of the nation's poor areas,
have effectively ended welfare. And the White House, sounding like
a group of Rockefeller Republicans, says a keystone of foreign
policy should be opening the world to U.S. exports and investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the big issues that used to divide the left and right _
the Cold War, inflation, crime, welfare _ have just collapsed as
partisan issues,'' said Francis Fukuyama, a professor of public
policy at George Mason University. Fukuyama predicted, in some
fashion, the current confusion a decade ago with a much-discussed
article in The National Interest magazine titled ``The End of
History?'' in which he argued that liberal democracy and a
market-oriented economy together form the only viable option for
modern societies.
</P>
<P>
   Fukuyama was dismissed by those who noted that history, far from
ending, quickly found other conflicts on which to focus: The era of
the angry white male in American politics, followed by the Clinton
impeachment fight, made reports of the death of ideology and the
end of the culture war seem premature.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some believe that the big conflicts are far from over,
that a vague and dangerous centrism has masked, not solved, them.
Republican conservatives, disenchanted by the party's abandonment
of the crusade against abortion and other matters they consider pro
family, said in June they might start a new party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relativism that is being so widely adopted may be the
dominant culture, but there is another culture that is very
uncomfortable with it and is resisting it,'' said conservative
historian Gertrude Himmelfarb, whose book ``One Nation, Two
Cultures'' is to be published this fall by Knopf. ``There are many
of us who are still resisting the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   The traditional left is no less incensed by what it sees as the
nation's acquiescence to the Reaganism of the 1980s _ the end of
welfare, the growing resegregation of American schools, the wide
acceptance of the death penalty and the lack of availability of
health care for millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the failure of communism has a lot
to do with the marginalization of the left,'' said Katha Pollitt, a
columnist for The Nation. ``But for me the central value of the
left is a commitment to equality, including economic equality, and
we have less of that today than we had 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, few in this country or abroad argue much any more
with Fukuyama's point about the centrality of markets to modern
societies.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hue, national secretary of the French Communist Party,
which in the 1970s and '80s maintained a firm Marxist line, said
recently: ``The Communists are not adversaries of the market. The
Communists have broken with the statist vision of things.''
</P>
<P>
   The leftist governments in Britain and Germany are further
evidence of this change. When the Labor Party leader Tony Blair was
elected prime minister in Britain, a London tabloid ran a
caricature of him dressed in baby clothes as his Conservative
predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, cooed, ``It's a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Russia today, Communists are considered conservatives and
free-marketers liberals. In Israel, the group that most resembles
the founding socialist Zionists, with their frowzy clothes,
collectivist vision and unyielding dedication, are the right-wing
Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   There is much talk among former leftists here and in Europe of
something they call the third way, or what may be seen as
capitalism with a conscience. But it is pretty hard to distinguish
it from the compassionate conservatism that serves as the rallying
cry of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential

<TEXT>
<P>
   The bedfellows get stranger and stranger: Rep. Henry Hyde, the
anti-abortion, right-wing Republican, joins forces with Rep. Barney
Frank, the gay, left-wing Democrat, to curb federal power in
property forfeiture; Ron Unz, the conservative Republican who
helped end bilingual education in California, argues against school
vouchers in the pages of The Nation, a leftist magazine; the
Clinton administration fights its longtime allies, the trade
unions, over their support of steel import quotas.
</P>
<P>
   Politics has long forged odd alliances but there is clearly
something significant happening to the national debate when
give-peace-a-chance Vietnam doves morph into Kosovo hawks and the
front-runner for each party's presidential nomination slams the
door on traditional party militants to capture the political center
when the nomination process has barely begun.
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, when people were described as ``on the left'' or
``on the right,'' liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican,
their views on a range of issues _ on religion and state,
education, war and peace, taxation _ could be inferred. That's no
longer the case.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans who tried for years to kill the federal Education
Department now want to be known as the education party. The
Democrats, whose long commitment to fighting poverty was evident
last week in President Clinton's tour of the nation's poor areas,
have effectively ended welfare. And the White House, sounding like
a group of Rockefeller Republicans, says a keystone of foreign
policy should be opening the world to U.S. exports and investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the big issues that used to divide the left and right _
the Cold War, inflation, crime, welfare _ have just collapsed as
partisan issues,'' said Francis Fukuyama, a professor of public
policy at George Mason University. Fukuyama predicted, in some
fashion, the current confusion a decade ago with a much-discussed
article in The National Interest magazine titled ``The End of
History?'' in which he argued that liberal democracy and a
market-oriented economy together form the only viable option for
modern societies.
</P>
<P>
   Fukuyama was dismissed by those who noted that history, far from
ending, quickly found other conflicts on which to focus: The era of
the angry white male in American politics, followed by the Clinton
impeachment fight, made reports of the death of ideology and the
end of the culture war seem premature.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some believe that the big conflicts are far from over,
that a vague and dangerous centrism has masked, not solved, them.
Republican conservatives, disenchanted by the party's abandonment
of the crusade against abortion and other matters they consider pro
family, said in June they might start a new party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The relativism that is being so widely adopted may be the
dominant culture, but there is another culture that is very
uncomfortable with it and is resisting it,'' said conservative
historian Gertrude Himmelfarb, whose book ``One Nation, Two
Cultures'' is to be published this fall by Knopf. ``There are many
of us who are still resisting the '60s.''
</P>
<P>
   The traditional left is no less incensed by what it sees as the
nation's acquiescence to the Reaganism of the 1980s _ the end of
welfare, the growing resegregation of American schools, the wide
acceptance of the death penalty and the lack of availability of
health care for millions of people.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that the failure of communism has a lot
to do with the marginalization of the left,'' said Katha Pollitt, a
columnist for The Nation. ``But for me the central value of the
left is a commitment to equality, including economic equality, and
we have less of that today than we had 20 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, few in this country or abroad argue much any more
with Fukuyama's point about the centrality of markets to modern
societies.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hue, national secretary of the French Communist Party,
which in the 1970s and '80s maintained a firm Marxist line, said
recently: ``The Communists are not adversaries of the market. The
Communists have broken with the statist vision of things.''
</P>
<P>
   The leftist governments in Britain and Germany are further
evidence of this change. When the Labor Party leader Tony Blair was
elected prime minister in Britain, a London tabloid ran a
caricature of him dressed in baby clothes as his Conservative
predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, cooed, ``It's a boy.''
</P>
<P>
   In Russia today, Communists are considered conservatives and
free-marketers liberals. In Israel, the group that most resembles
the founding socialist Zionists, with their frowzy clothes,
collectivist vision and unyielding dedication, are the right-wing
Jewish settlers in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   There is much talk among former leftists here and in Europe of
something they call the third way, or what may be seen as
capitalism with a conscience. But it is pretty hard to distinguish
it from the compassionate conservatism that serves as the rallying
cry of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican presidential
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while the eclipse of the left has clearly played a major
role in the shift, the demise of the right is equally significant.
Paul Weyrich, who coined the phrase ``moral majority'' in the 1970s
and was the godfather of what became a substantial political
movement, said recently that the effort had ended in failure. He
recently urged his adherents to ``tune out and drop out,'' sounding
rather like '60s-era liberals frustrated by the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he will not require judicial nominees to oppose
abortion, which had been a standard Republican position. Evangelist
Pat Robertson has said: ``There's no way that we are going to pass
a constitutional amendment banning abortion. It's just not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, when Weyrich said, ``We lost the culture
war,'' he was referring to the fact that most Americans did not
view Clinton's extramarital sex and lies as the basis for
impeachment, but he was also casting the issue in larger terms:
efforts to expunge '60s-era personal morals had failed.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Wolfe, a professor of political science at Boston College,
agrees in some sense with Weyrich. He spent several years
interviewing middle-class Americans for his book ``One Nation,
After All'' (Viking, 1998) and found that most people are far more
tolerant of others and other ways of life than is often assumed.
</P>
<P>
   As Wolfe puts his findings now, ``The right won the economic
war, the left won the cultural war and the center won the political
war.''
</P>
<P>
   While most analysts agree that the nation seems to be entering
an uncharted era of consensual politics, they don't agree on why.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lind, a senior fellow at the New America Foundation in
Washington, has argued in a series of books and articles that what
is really going on is that a university-trained professional
``overclass'' has managed to suppress discussion of class conflicts
that are as powerful as ever.
</P>
<P>
   The goal of the new ruling class, Lind argues, is increased
wealth and comfort for itself, and anything that interferes _ curbs
on immigration, labor or free trade, which would make it harder to
find domestic help and cheap employees and the purchase of products
it wants _ is opposed by all members of the class, whether they
call themselves Democrats or Republicans, liberals or
conservatives. Disagreements over so-called wedge issues, Lind
maintains, are a ruse aimed at making the rest of the nation
believe there is debate going on.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Postrel, editor of Reason magazine, a libertarian
monthly, has a different interpretation. In her book ``The Future
and Its Enemies'' (Free Press, 1998), she contends that the old
categories of left and right have lost their usefulness because the
world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``A defining question in one era _ whether to nationalize the
railroads, give women the vote, outlaw racial segregation or
abolish the draft _ may be settled and therefore meaningless in
another,'' she writes. ``Nowadays, `conservatives' may support
careers for women, and `liberals' may back the death penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Postrel urges abandoning traditional political categories
and creating new ones, namely ``dynamists'' _ those who accept and
promote innovation _ and ``stasists,'' who favor a regulated,
engineered world. She clearly comes down on the side of the
dynamists, arguing that only through unregulated experimentation
will society advance materially and intellectually.
</P>
<P>
   With the explosion of information and technological innovation,
she argues, central planning bodies are impotent; only freedom,
even chaos, will do. By promoting such practices, she says,
societies will progress; by squelching them, they will go the way
of centrally planned governments.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new idea but has come to a kind of fruition. Half
a century ago, conservative economist Friedrich Hayek argued that
socialism had no future because in a modern economy the vast
majority of information generated is local in character and
requires higher and higher degrees of sophistication to grasp. As a
result, distant managers or bureaucrats are unlikely to be
sufficiently nimble or informed to make good decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is not only Soviet-style governments that have been
forced to undergo change but large corporations like IBM, which
nearly collapsed and has had to create more entrepreneurial styles
of work for its employees. With such a focus on individual
initiative and the accompanying access to vast quantities of
information, it is not surprising that broad ideological approaches
are losing out to a case-by-case, problem-solving one. Nor is it
surprising that with increased exposure to other people and ideas
has come increased tolerance and openness to other ways of life.
</P>
<P>
   Unz, the California activist who fought bilingual education,
says he opposes school vouchers because, while competition and
marketing may be good for selling sneakers or soft drinks, they are
bad for public education.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call myself a Ronald Reagan Republican but I look at things
on a case-by-case basis,'' said Unz, a Silicon Valley entrepreneur
who is also pushing campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   It is entirely appropriate that Silicon Valley has become one of
the country's focal points because its arresting combination of
market economics and informal personal and social behavior _
Reaganesque politics of the 1980s and Clintonesque morals of the
'60s _ seems to define the nation today. Many had previously
thought the two incompatible. Sociologist Daniel Bell once wrote of
the inherent contradiction between the Protestant ethic of
capitalism and the hedonism it created. And Reagan Republicans
tended to think of their goal as reversing the trends of the '60s.
Yet many analysts argue today that the Reaganites accomplished
their own revolution without really shifting the society as they
had hoped; they may have curbed the extremes of the 1960s but much
of the rest has been absorbed into mainstream culture.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lilla, a political philosopher at New York University,
wrote in The New York Review of Books in May that the two
revolutions are coexisting nicely right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts are these,'' he wrote. ``The '60s happened, Reagan
happened and for the foreseeable future they will together define
our political horizon. As anyone who deals with young people today
knows, Americans find no difficulty in reconciling the two in their
daily lives. They see no contradiction in holding down day jobs in
the unfettered global marketplace _ the Reaganite dream, the left
nightmare _ and spending weekends immersed in a moral and cultural
universe shaped by the 60's.''

 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It's not every day that Jesse Helms and the Beastie
Boys find themselves comrades in arms.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing the chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee and the hip-hop group have in common is contempt for
China for its treatment of Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
   The Beasties hold concerts to support the Dalai Lama. Helms
leads the conservative charge against the Clinton administration's
China policy _ coddling dictators to make a buck, he says _ and
inveighs against the World Bank, which he and his allies lump
together with the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund
and other mysterious institutions that often go their own way.
</P>
<P>
   This alliance of convenience came together recently in a
remarkable face-off between Washington and the World Bank over a
development project so small and out of the way that it would
usually attract little notice: A $40 million effort to relocate
58,000 of China's poorest farmers _ they make $60 a year _ to more
fertile land in Qinghai province in western China.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that they would be moving into territory the
Tibetans consider part of their original homeland, even though most
maps show it outside Tibet and the Chinese consider it non-Tibetan
land. Critics said the bank was aiding China's effort to dilute the
minority Tibetan population _ and doing so in the province that was
the birthplace of the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies an unusual tale of Washington lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks the Tibet lobby _ best known for patrons like
Richard Gere and Harrison Ford but power-challenged by Washington's
usual measures _ mobilized allies on the far left and the far
right. In a flash it reversed White House policy, and led the
administration's nominee for Treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers,
to announce that the United States would try to block the loan. The
World Bank emerged bloodied, and agreed to study the issue anew. It
was a feat that the city's highly paid power brokers could only
admire.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, only the lobbyists with the deepest pockets and the
busiest PACs get that kind of attention. Silicon Valley, source of
all those new-economy campaign contributions, won two tremendous
victories recently: limiting damages from suits arising from Year
2000 computer bugs, and convincing the administration to relax
export controls on powerful but widely available computers,
including sales to China. After years of wrangling, the House
finally passed a financial restructuring bill this month that was
so hotly contested by banks and brokerages, and for so many years,
that many thought Congress would debate it forever to keep the
money flowing in from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   But every once in a while the stars align in a way that smaller
and far less wealthy groups can score a big victory. It helps if
they show pictures of crushing poverty or tell stories of
repression and _ most important _ side with politicians who may
have ulterior agendas. The Tibetan crowd did all of that and won at
least a partial victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a culmination of forces that have been gathering
steam for years,'' said John Kenneth Knaus, who spent four decades
at the CIA helping the Tibetan resistance fight the Chinese and
recently recounted that struggle in a book, ``Orphans of the Cold
War'' (Public Affairs, 1999). ``They have always been a very
cohesive group, and their story has always had a great appeal in
Congress. But this time they got further.''
</P>
<P>
   China occupied Tibet in 1950, and Tibet's political fortunes
have waxed and waned in Washington depending on the prevailing mood
toward Beijing. China considers it a province, and screams whenever
it believes Washington is meddling in its internal affairs. When
the 64-year-old Dalai Lama shows up in Washington, he is handled
like a chunk of plutonium, meeting the president in diplomatically
staged ``drop by'' visits, sitting in the offices of lesser
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But if ever the Tibet lobbyists had an opportunity, this was the
moment. The accusations of Chinese spying at nuclear laboratories
in the United States and the anti-American protests after the
accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade have left
Congressional conservatives looking for a quick, cost-free way to
lash out at China. Human rights groups have concluded that the
administration's China policy is one of toothless, token
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Onto this battlefield walked the World Bank, whose savvy
president, James Wolfensohn, usually sees land mines ahead and
saunters around them. But China was pressing for this loan as part
of a last series of interest-free deals that end after June 30. The
details were rushed. The environmental studies were done once over
lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not only politically offensive,'' said Dana Clark, a
senior attorney for the Center for International Environmental Law.
``It was done in violation of the bank's own policies.'' Meanwhile
China threatened to end its relations with the bank if the loan was
denied _ a step that would give the West less control over
Beijing's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly the Office of Tibet, which represents the Dalai Lama,
and the International Campaign for Tibet were swinging into action.
Members of the Senate were lined up to ask about the program at
Summers' confirmation hearing. The Treasury, not looking for a
fight at a sensitive time, immediately agreed to oppose the plan.
So did Germany. World Bank officials were called to a meeting on
Capitol Hill and saw the future.
</P>
<P>
   A World Bank official quipped, ``When you have a coalition of
students in California with body piercings saying the same thing as
Jesse Helms, you are on a highway to nowhere.'' On the left and the
right, the official said, the message to the bank was simple: ``If
you do this, we will kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn tried to travel to the region himself, then sent a
team to reconfirm that the resettlement of the farmers would be
voluntary, and that children would attend schools reflecting their
ethnic backgrounds. ``This is the first time most of these children
will get a school,'' he said. China, he added, didn't need the
bank's money _ but with it, the West would have a voice in what
China does in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the World Bank's board approved the loan for the
resettlement _ in part because it feared the United States was
moving on an isolationist path that would only worsen relations
with China. But the Chinese won't get the money until an
independent review board within the World Bank looks at the
project. The Tibetan lobby vows to be back.  &QL;

   WASHINGTON _ It's not every day that Jesse Helms and the Beastie
Boys find themselves comrades in arms.
</P>
<P>
   About the only thing the chairman of the Foreign Relations
Committee and the hip-hop group have in common is contempt for
China for its treatment of Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
   The Beasties hold concerts to support the Dalai Lama. Helms
leads the conservative charge against the Clinton administration's
China policy _ coddling dictators to make a buck, he says _ and
inveighs against the World Bank, which he and his allies lump
together with the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund
and other mysterious institutions that often go their own way.
</P>
<P>
   This alliance of convenience came together recently in a
remarkable face-off between Washington and the World Bank over a
development project so small and out of the way that it would
usually attract little notice: A $40 million effort to relocate
58,000 of China's poorest farmers _ they make $60 a year _ to more
fertile land in Qinghai province in western China.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was that they would be moving into territory the
Tibetans consider part of their original homeland, even though most
maps show it outside Tibet and the Chinese consider it non-Tibetan
land. Critics said the bank was aiding China's effort to dilute the
minority Tibetan population _ and doing so in the province that was
the birthplace of the Dalai Lama, the exiled spiritual leader of
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies an unusual tale of Washington lobbying.
</P>
<P>
   In a few weeks the Tibet lobby _ best known for patrons like
Richard Gere and Harrison Ford but power-challenged by Washington's
usual measures _ mobilized allies on the far left and the far
right. In a flash it reversed White House policy, and led the
administration's nominee for Treasury secretary, Lawrence Summers,
to announce that the United States would try to block the loan. The
World Bank emerged bloodied, and agreed to study the issue anew. It
was a feat that the city's highly paid power brokers could only
admire.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, only the lobbyists with the deepest pockets and the
busiest PACs get that kind of attention. Silicon Valley, source of
all those new-economy campaign contributions, won two tremendous
victories recently: limiting damages from suits arising from Year
2000 computer bugs, and convincing the administration to relax
export controls on powerful but widely available computers,
including sales to China. After years of wrangling, the House
finally passed a financial restructuring bill this month that was
so hotly contested by banks and brokerages, and for so many years,
that many thought Congress would debate it forever to keep the
money flowing in from all sides.
</P>
<P>
   But every once in a while the stars align in a way that smaller
and far less wealthy groups can score a big victory. It helps if
they show pictures of crushing poverty or tell stories of
repression and _ most important _ side with politicians who may
have ulterior agendas. The Tibetan crowd did all of that and won at
least a partial victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a culmination of forces that have been gathering
steam for years,'' said John Kenneth Knaus, who spent four decades
at the CIA helping the Tibetan resistance fight the Chinese and
recently recounted that struggle in a book, ``Orphans of the Cold
War'' (Public Affairs, 1999). ``They have always been a very
cohesive group, and their story has always had a great appeal in
Congress. But this time they got further.''
</P>
<P>
   China occupied Tibet in 1950, and Tibet's political fortunes
have waxed and waned in Washington depending on the prevailing mood
toward Beijing. China considers it a province, and screams whenever
it believes Washington is meddling in its internal affairs. When
the 64-year-old Dalai Lama shows up in Washington, he is handled
like a chunk of plutonium, meeting the president in diplomatically
staged ``drop by'' visits, sitting in the offices of lesser
officials.
</P>
<P>
   But if ever the Tibet lobbyists had an opportunity, this was the
moment. The accusations of Chinese spying at nuclear laboratories
in the United States and the anti-American protests after the
accidental bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade have left
Congressional conservatives looking for a quick, cost-free way to
lash out at China. Human rights groups have concluded that the
administration's China policy is one of toothless, token
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Onto this battlefield walked the World Bank, whose savvy
president, James Wolfensohn, usually sees land mines ahead and
saunters around them. But China was pressing for this loan as part
of a last series of interest-free deals that end after June 30. The
details were rushed. The environmental studies were done once over
lightly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not only politically offensive,'' said Dana Clark, a
senior attorney for the Center for International Environmental Law.
``It was done in violation of the bank's own policies.'' Meanwhile
China threatened to end its relations with the bank if the loan was
denied _ a step that would give the West less control over
Beijing's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly the Office of Tibet, which represents the Dalai Lama,
and the International Campaign for Tibet were swinging into action.
Members of the Senate were lined up to ask about the program at
Summers' confirmation hearing. The Treasury, not looking for a
fight at a sensitive time, immediately agreed to oppose the plan.
So did Germany. World Bank officials were called to a meeting on
Capitol Hill and saw the future.
</P>
<P>
   A World Bank official quipped, ``When you have a coalition of
students in California with body piercings saying the same thing as
Jesse Helms, you are on a highway to nowhere.'' On the left and the
right, the official said, the message to the bank was simple: ``If
you do this, we will kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfensohn tried to travel to the region himself, then sent a
team to reconfirm that the resettlement of the farmers would be
voluntary, and that children would attend schools reflecting their
ethnic backgrounds. ``This is the first time most of these children
will get a school,'' he said. China, he added, didn't need the
bank's money _ but with it, the West would have a voice in what
China does in the region.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the World Bank's board approved the loan for the
resettlement _ in part because it feared the United States was
moving on an isolationist path that would only worsen relations
with China. But the Chinese won't get the money until an
independent review board within the World Bank looks at the
project. The Tibetan lobby vows to be back.  &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Talking over lunch last week in the dining room
of the American Postal Workers House, a federally subsidized
residence for the elderly, 87-year-old Leah Greenstein pulled from
her purse a well-worn card on which she keeps a list of her
medications.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take Synthroid _ that's for my thyroid _ I take two of
them,'' she said, reading from the list. ``Prinvil _ that's for
high blood pressure _ two a day. Ecotrin _ that's coated aspirin;
it doesn't affect the stomach _ to prevent a heart attack or
stroke. Prilosec _ that's for digestion. Vioxx _ I just started
that a few weeks ago. That's the newest drug for arthritis.''
</P>
<P>
   In all, Mrs. Greenstein, whose ailments include high blood
pressure and colitis, takes 12 prescription medicines daily.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has put the cost of prescription drugs at the
center of discussions in Congress on Medicare, but for millions of
older people like Mrs. Greenstein, their multiple medications
always seem to be part of the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   As people live longer and acquire more chronic ailments, the
pharmaceutical industry has supplied an endless stream of remedies,
and paying for prescriptions and keeping all the pills straight is
a daily concern.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Greenstein considers herself lucky. She qualifies for a
Pennsylvania program for low-income elderly under which she pays
just $6 a month for each prescription (still, times 12, that's a
chunk of her monthly Social Security check of $712). If she had to
pay for the drugs herself, an official with the program estimated,
they would cost $600 to $700 a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pain in the neck,'' said Mrs. Greenstein, who manages
her medication with the efficiency of the bookkeeper she was for
many years. ``Sometimes I say to my doctor, `Why do I need all
these drugs?' He'll take me off one, and add two more.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare, the federal health insurance program for the elderly
and disabled, does not include prescription drugs, and with the
availability of new drugs to treat the ills of old age, along with
the high cost of much of that medication, many old people who do
not receive state aid are struggling to pay the bill. Clinton has
proposed adding a drug insurance plan to Medicare under which
premiums would be waived for low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 13 states that provide some form of prescription-drug
coverage for the poor elderly, Pennsylvania has one of the most
generous, said Thomas Snedden, the program's director. The program,
financed by the state lottery, pays $250 million on prescriptions a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, with strict income limits, it covers only a fraction of
the state's elderly. With an annual Social Security income of
$17,000, Alice Wiley, a 75-year-old retired seamstress in West
Philadelphia, earns too much to qualify. Mrs. Wiley, who had a
recurrence of breast cancer, has recently started taking Tamoxifen,
two pills a day, at $3 a pill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just going to do without it,'' Mrs. Wiley said. ``I
can't afford it. My son paid for it.''
</P>
<P>
   To Mrs. Wiley, each pill is precious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit right down to the table with that pill and hold it real
fast,'' she said. ``You don't drop that pill.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Mrs. Wiley is also on high blood pressure medication, which she
says costs $6 for 24 pills.
</P>
<P>
   At the Jacob and Esther Stiffel Senior Center in South
Philadelphia, Thursday was a belated Fourth of July party. Men and
women in their 70s and 80s sang and danced to the music of a live
band. Between sets, many of them talked about the medications that
they say keep them well enough for them to continue showing up at
the center that sustains them.
</P>
<P>
   Like Leah Greenstein, many of the women carried handwritten
medication lists in their purses.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Welsh, 77, who has diabetes and recently underwent
surgery for breast cancer, has 10 different drugs on her list,
including Tamoxifen, Synthroid and Diovan, which she takes for high
blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Welsh and her husband, David, who are retired tile
contractors living on a fixed income, are enrolled in an HMO that
allows them to pay $15 for each brand-name prescription, and $10
for the generic ones. Even so, with monthly prescription-drug bills
of about $150, they say they have had to stop going out to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most important part of our lives,'' Welsh said,
pointing to the white piece of paper that listed his wife's drugs.
``It keeps her alive.''
</P>
<P>
   When Zelda Somers was younger, her passport, with stamps from
all over South America, Spain and other European countries, marked
her as a world traveler. Now, at 82, Mrs. Somers, who recently
suffered a heart aneurysm, does not venture much beyond home, the
senior center and the doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   And these days she carries a ``medication passport,'' a small
brown booklet, distributed by the Pennsylvania Department of Aging,
in which she keeps meticulous track of the eight drugs her doctor
has prescribed.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Somers, who ran a food market with her late husband, is
well acquainted with her pharmacist.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time the doctor forgot to tell me that when he put me on a
new drug I should stop taking another one,'' Mrs. Somers said. ``My
pharmacist told me, `Zelda, when you take this, you can't take
that.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Bea and Sam, a couple in their 80s who declined to give
their last name, taking prescription drugs has become a ritual of
married life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get two little medicine cups,'' said Bea, a former
secretary. ``He gets five pills. I give them to him every
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to get confused about who is taking what, and how
much.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take Inderal,'' said Sam, who used to work at the Navy Yard
here.
</P>
<P>
   Bea broke in. ``No, you're not on Inderal,'' she said. ``I'm on
Inderal. We both take Prilosec. That's marvelous. It keeps the acid
from forming in the stomach.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same table, 83-year-old Bessie Schwartz, who takes heart
medication and Prilosec, said, ``This is what keeps us alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Schwartz, who earned her living making lampshades, has had
two heart attacks. She said her mother did not have the benefit of
modern medicine and prescription drugs. She had high blood
pressure, and died of a stroke in 1932. She was 51.

   Ernest Hemingway brilliantly cultivated his elephantine public
image during a 30-year reign as America's most famous writer.
</P>
<P>
   But the rough and cantankerous Hemingway, who committed suicide
in 1961, might have a difficult time recognizing himself today in

   There's ``True at First Light'' (Scribner), the new novel

   Hemingway _ the person, not the brand _ worked as hard as he

   ``Papa Hemingway'' eyewear, starting at $300, evokes a fashion
mystique. Hemingway himself had a dimmer view of spectacles. A.E.
Hotchner, a friend and biographer, recalled Hemingway's description
of how he bought his first eyeglasses in the early 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   When I hit New York I went to see an eye doctor. That's when I
got my first glasses. I went out of the office with them on and I
saw things so clearly for the first time in my life, I began to get
nauseated. I was only a block from Bob Benchley's, so I went up to
his place and we both got cockeyed drunk and that got me over the
nausea.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   In 1950 Lillian Ross portrayed a garrulous, rambunctious
Hemingway on a trip to New York City. ``He had on steel-rimmed
spectacles, with a piece of paper under the nose-piece,'' she
wrote. Hemingway's fourth wife, Mary, insisted that he buy a coat
and fix his eyeglasses:
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to buy Papa a coat.'' Hemingway grunted and leaned
against the car. ``A nice, rainproof coat,'' Mrs. Hemingway said.
``And he's got to get his glasses fixed. He needs some good, soft
padding for the nose-piece. It cuts him up brutally. He's had that
same piece of paper under the nose-piece for weeks. When he really
wants to get cleaned up, he changes the paper.'' Hemingway grunted
again.

considerable merriment at Sloppy Joe's, the Key West, Fla., saloon
that was a Hemingway haunt and where the bartender referred to the
writer and his third wife, Martha Gellhorn, as ``beauty and the
beast.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparison more aptly applied to Hemingway, in his
odoriferous Basque shorts tied in the middle with a piece of rope
... ``I am really not abnormally clean,'' Martha would protest many
years later. ``But Ernest was extremely dirty, one of the most
unfastidious men I've ever known.''

after her husband:

<P>
   ``Keep your eye on this big clown, see that he's shaved and
cleaned up when you go out on the town.'' While this injunction was
superficially affectionate, it was actually a sign of tension, for
Hemingway's lack of cleanliness was rapidly becoming a serious
problem for Martha. ``The Pig'' was the rather edgy term of
endearment she had fastened on him.

had a less romantic view of chez Papa. In 1922, the young Hemingway
and his first wife, Hadley, lived in a cheap apartment in Paris
with a hole-in-the-floor toilet.
</P>

   From the flush-box hung a chain that, when pulled, deluged the

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even before NATO's bombs stopped falling in
Yugoslavia, the Pentagon's war planners and like-minded lawmakers
on Capitol Hill started asking a question that would have seemed
unthinkable not long ago: Is America's military too small?
</P>
<P>
   In the decade since the Soviet bloc fell apart, the nation's
four major armed services have steadily shrunk, both in size and
weaponry. In 1989 there were 2.13 million men and women on active
duty in the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marines. In 1999 there are
1.36 million, a 36 percent drop.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, though, the number of peacekeeping missions,
relief efforts and other military operations has proliferated _
from the Persian Gulf to the Caribbean, from Bosnia to Kosovo.
Eight years after Saddam Hussein was evicted from Kuwait, the
United States and Britain still patrol over much of Iraq from bases
in the Persian Gulf and Turkey. And since last December, U.S.
pilots have been skirmishing with Iraq's air defenses every few
days.
</P>
<P>
   From missile shots against Islamic terrorist Osama Bin Laden to
drug interdiction in Latin America, the Pentagon's commanders say
the U.S. military today is as consumed with what they call
``operations other than war'' as a much larger force was with
fighting Cold War proxy battles and preparing to stop a Soviet
invasion of Western Europe. The new assignments, they complain, are
straining the downsized military, perhaps to the breaking point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a situation where we have a smaller force and we have
more missions,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen told the Senate's
defense appropriations subcommittee in May. ``We are wearing out
systems. We are wearing out people.''
</P>
<P>
   Such assertions seem to guarantee a renewed debate about just
how large a military the United States needs _ particularly since
the questions have arisen just as the Clinton administration and
Congress are eyeing enormous budget surpluses and considering the
first increases in the defense budget since the early years of
Ronald Reagan's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Although the increases proposed so far have been earmarked for
new weapons, repairs and training, they have also opened the
possibility of expanding personnel, which is by far the most costly
item in the budget because it involves salaries, pensions and
benefits. And that, to some, is no coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the services are positioning themselves for the fight
for their part of the budget surpluses,'' said Steven Kosiak,
director of budget studies at the Center for Strategic and
Budgetary Assessments in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's 78-day air war against Yugoslavia was a resounding
victory for the U.S. military. But the war also exposed weaknesses.
At the height of the bombing, the United States had more than 800
aircraft and 37,500 people committed to the fight. The Air Force,
in particular, was strained, with 40 to 45 percent of its entire
force somehow involved _ a higher percentage than was devoted to
war in either Vietnam or the Persian Gulf, according to a senior
officer. In certain areas, the strain was even greater.
Three-quarters of the force's aerial tanker crews, for example,
were used in the air war.
</P>
<P>
   The effort forced the Pentagon to scale back operations
elsewhere, raising questions about the nation's ability to fight
two major regional wars at once, a core tenet of the military's
strategic planning.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, pulled out aircraft
patrolling northern Iraq from a base in Turkey to devote them to
pummeling Yugoslavia. (When the United States launched air strikes
against Iraq last December, three months before the Kosovo war,
aircraft were diverted from hurricane relief in Central America.)
</P>
<P>
   Now that NATO's war is won, the problem has not eased, but
simply shifted to the ground. The Army is sending 7,000 soldiers to
keep the peace in Kosovo, most of them from Germany, with no
prospect of leaving soon. There are 7,700 troops in support or
refugee-relief roles in Albania and Macedonia. Nearly four years
after the civil war ended in Bosnia, there are still 6,000 soldiers
deployed there. The U.S. presence in South Korea _ now at 37,000
soldiers _ is nearing its 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   This commitment to ever more scattered operations overseas is
perhaps an inevitable manifestation of America's global
pre-eminence, and that sense of permanence is behind the calls for
a reversal of the military's steady downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Charles Krulak, who recently retired as commandant of the
Marine Corps, said his service needs 5,000 more marines, which
would raise the total to 177,000. The Army's new chief of staff,
Gen. Eric Shinseki, said rethinking the size of the Army _ now at
467,000 soldiers _ was his first priority. Privately, Army
officials say 500,000 would be better.
</P>
<P>
   With the military already facing problems recruiting young
Americans, it is not clear how that could be accomplished. But on
Capitol Hill, lawmakers have heartily endorsed the idea _ and not
just Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to add enough personnel to the force to meet the
demands of the post-Cold War world without wearing out so many of
the wonderful men and women on whom our security depends,'' said
Rep. Ike Skelton of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on the House
Armed Services Committee, in a floor speech July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Other lawmakers agree the military is strained, but say the
solution is to scale back its operations. They cite the 270
soldiers still deployed in Haiti and the 870 serving in a
multinational observer force on the Sinai Peninsula that has
monitored the Israel-Egypt peace since 1982. Republicans would like
to see the U.S. troops leave Bosnia, even though peace there is
tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   Many military analysts, however, say that the problem may not be
as serious as military officers paint it, and that solving it may
not require more troops. These critics say the size of the force
does not matter as much as how well the force is managed.
</P>
<P>
   In the world today, only China has a larger military, with an
estimated 2.5 million troops but nothing like the technological
prowess of the United States. Russia has just over one million men
and women in arms, but they are demoralized, underequipped and
underpaid (when paid at all).
</P>
<P>
   Kosiak said the U.S. military was still arrayed very much like
it was during the Cold War, when hundreds of thousands of troops
hunkered down in Europe and waited for World War III.
</P>
<P>
   The services, especially the Army, have been slow to adapt to
the increase in smaller-scale operations, he said. The military
does not need more troops, he added; it needs to streamline its
bureaucracy so it can better employ the ones it has.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are operations,'' Kosiak said of today's missions,
``that a military as large as the United States military should be
able to carry out.''

   This final budget adds U.S.-MILITARY-REVIEW and art indicators.

<P>
   On the dress page:

<P>
   (moved in the `a' category)
</P>
<P>
   LEFT-RIGHT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Liberals and conservatives as
strange bedfellows: Politics has long forged odd alliances but
there is clearly something significant happening to the national
debate when Vietnam doves morph into Kosovo hawks and presidential
front-runners rebuff traditional party militants to capture the
center when the nomination process has barely begun. Not long ago,
when people were described as ``left'' or ``right,'' liberal or
conservative, Democrat or Republican, their views on a range of
issues _ on religion and state, education, war and peace, taxation
_ could be inferred. That's no longer the case. By Ethan Bronner.
</P>
<P>
   FUGITIVE-FINANCIERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The tale of Martin
Frankel is already enhancing the lore of that most modern of
outlaws, the fugitive financier. There have been a surprising
number of them in the last three decades, with Robert Vesco being
perhaps the most notorious. And their stories serve as a reminder
that even millions of dollars of loot cannot happiness, at least
when you're on the lam. By Leslie Eaton.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moved in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   APPALACHIA-REVIEW (Undated) _ When President Clinton visited
Appalachia to call attention to poverty, his visit had a familiar
air. The Kennedys and LBJ had made the trip more than 3 decades
ago. But although some poverty persists, Appalachia is a very
different place with very different economic development needs than
it was in the '60s. What never seems to change is the mythology of
the place as the poster child for American poverty, an image that
persists, to the region's detriment and benefit, no matter how much
times change. By Peter Applebome. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   PRIVATE-SCHOOLS-REVIEW (New York) _ For many urban parents,
agonizing over whether to send their children to public or private
schools has become a ritual fraught with concerns about money and
fears that a public-school education is a sentence to a life of
second-class opportunities. But hard evidence comparing the
performance of public and nonpublic schools has proven elusive.
Now, though, New York state has released test scores that provide a
rare basis for side-by-side comparison, with surprising results:
There were only modest differences in the performance of private
schools _ mainly Catholic ones _ and public schools. By Anemona
Hartocollis.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-MILITARY-REVIEW (Washington) _ In the past decade, the U.S.
military has shrunk, both in size and weaponry. At the same time,
though, the number of peacekeeping missions, relief efforts and
other military operations has proliferated _ from the Persian Gulf
to the Caribbean, from Bosnia to Kosovo. Pentagon's commanders say
the U.S. military today is as consumed with ``operations other than
war'' as a much larger force was with fighting Cold War proxy
battles and preparing to stop a Soviet invasion of Western Europe.
The new assignments, they complain, are straining the downsized
military, perhaps to the breaking point. By Steven Lee Myers. WITH
GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   CALIF-INSECTS-REVIEW (Los Angeles) _ The last corner of L.A.
County's 4,000 square miles was recently declared officially
colonized by Africanized honeybees. Science has been powerless to
stop the bees' steady northward march from South America. But
Californians have reacted to this latest invader with equanimity
because their state has long been home to a rogues' gallery of
flying, crawling pestilence. By Todd S. Purdum. WITH GRAPHIC.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS-DRUGS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The suspicions also are
familiar. If an athlete does very well, or if an athlete develops
an injury of illness, charges of drug use spring up automatically.
This raises questions about the ethics of drug use in sports. What
is it, some ask, that is at the root of society's horror of
performance-enhancing drugs? By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   LAWYERS-CHARACTER-REVIEW (Undated) _ Character review is as much
a part of becoming a lawyer as passing a bar exam. The arcane
character-and-fitness process, unknown to most of the public but
hotly debated within the profession, is facing new scrutiny after a
drive-by shooting rampage last weekend by a disciple of Matthew
Hale, a white supremacist who had been rejected by Illinois bar
examiners on moral grounds. By Mike Allen.
</P>
<P>
   HEMINGWAY-HYPE-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Ernest Hemingway
brilliantly cultivated his own elephantine public image during his
30-year reign as America's most famous writer. But the rough,
cantankerous Hemingway would probably have a difficult time
recognizing himself today in the hype overlicensed Hemingway
products, which reaches full-throttle this week in the buildup to
the centennial of his birth on July 21.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week, leading
with the pros and cons of swimming with dolphins, and the
possibility that George Washington fathered a child with a slave.
</P>
<P>
   _ Moved in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ALIBIS-REVIEW (Tokyo) _ Alibis for sale in Japan provide
bogus ``respectability.'' The alibi-ya are essentially conjurers
who help people at the margins of society. For instance, women in
the sex industry are frequent clients of the alibi-ya, which enable
them to tell relatives and even boyfriends about their fine jobs in
a trading company. The alibi-ya provide name cards, pay stubs and
an impressive position in a decent line of work _ all fictitious.
If a caller tries to reach the young woman while she is at her
nonexistent job, a polite receptionist will say she has stepped
out. By Nicholas D. Kristof.
</P>
<P>
   TIBET-LOBBY-REVIEW (Washington) _ A behind-the-scenes look at
why the pro-Tibet lobby can be so effective in Washington. Tibet
sympathizers, who have included figures as diverse as right-wing
Sen. Jesse Helms and the Beastie Boys rock music group, caused the
U.S. to reverse its stance and come out against a World Bank loan
to China intended to help establish Chinese farmers on land the
Tibetans say is traditionally theirs. By David E. Sanger. WITH MAP.

U.N. POVERTY AGENCY VYING WITH AID OFFICES FOR CASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JUDITH MILLER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Mark Malloch Brown, the new chief of the U.N.
Development Program, had barely moved into his spacious office with
its panoramic views of the East River and the United Nations when
he got some bad news. Denmark and Germany, mainstays of his
agency's $2 billion dollar budget, were slashing their annual
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The German Cabinet, citing its obligation to limit its budget
deficit under Europe's single-currency agreement, announced that it
was cutting its contribution to the world body's main foreign aid
arm by 50 percent, or $25 million. Denmark, too, announced a 23
percent cut to finance a pledge it had made to rebuild Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Kosovo crisis has intensified the already fierce
competition for dollars among relief and development agencies and
makes it all the more likely that the search for funds will consume
much of Malloch Brown's tenure.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in contributions, which are voluntary rather than
mandatory like U.N. dues, are not limited to Denmark and Germany.
America's portion of the budget has been dropping, too.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent issue of the journal Foreign Affairs, James Gustave
Speth, an American who headed the agency for six years before
Malloch Brown took over on July 1, called Washington's donations
``particularly stingy.'' While Nordic countries contributed about
$16 per capita to the agency, Speth complained in a recent
interview, America's per capita contribution stood at 50 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his country's reduction, Poul Nielsen, Denmark's
development minister, who had been Europe's candidate for the job
of leading the agency, denied that the cut was what a Danish
journalist called a ``devious'' act of ``revenge'' for not having
won the post.
</P>
<P>
   While Malloch Brown declined to discuss Denmark's motives in an
interview last week, he expressed his ``alarm'' that a country with
such a long history of generous giving to the world's poor would
``tax Africa to fund Kosovo.'' Denmark, he added, underscoring his
concern, risked setting ``a dangerous trend'' that he hoped other
donors would not follow.
</P>
<P>
   As for Germany, the new administrator, as the agency's chief is
known, vowed to ``fight'' the Cabinet's decision through friends in
the German government and, if necessary, reverse the planned cuts
in parliament, which is expected to consider the issue this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Malloch Brown framed the challenge to get more money for his
agency as primarily one of marketing. Employing the free-market
jargon so fashionable in the development community these days,
Malloch Brown stressed the need to promote his agency's
``comparative advantage'' in advancing development through ``good
governance.''
</P>
<P>
   Projects that foster democratic, honest, responsible government,
the rule of law, competent, unbiased judicial systems and
commercial codes, private organizations and partnerships between
government agencies and commercial and nonprofit partners made aid
dollars go further, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Malloch Brown, who was previously vice president for external
affairs at the World Bank, said he intends to use his communication
skills to enhance his agency's reputation and promote its
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   While he praised his predecessor, Speth, who is now the dean of
Yale University's School of Forestry and Environmental Studies,
Malloch Brown's emphasis on giving the agency a higher profile
seemed to imply that Speth had been less than successful in this
regard.
</P>
<P>
   The Development Program has almost 6,000 employees in 130
offices throughout the world and disperses more than $1 billion of
its $2.4 billion budget to help fight poverty and underdevelopment.
Recently, Malloch Brown gave his far-flung team a pep talk,
delivered via audio and video-conferencing. He warned the staff
that to continue being a ``relevant'' player in development, the
agency had to ``reinvent'' itself.
</P>
<P>
   Articulate, energetic and experienced in relief work, the
46-year-old British national was a popular choice among U.S.
officials and many relief workers, who felt that Speth had placed
too little emphasis on integrating emergency assistance into
long-term development aid.
</P>
<P>
   But Europeans, increasingly resentful of the United States for
failing to pay the $1.6 billion in back dues it owes the United
Nations, had campaigned intensively for their candidate, Nielsen,
to lead the agency, and Secretary-General Kofi Annan's selection of
Malloch Brown, a long-time associate, caused a diplomatic stir.
</P>
<P>
   Malloch Brown's World Bank background is the source of another
concern. Some fear that the bank, which lends $22 billion of
development aid a year, may come to dominate the agency's
activities.
</P>
<P>
   Malloch Brown vowed that he would not permit the World Bank to
``swamp'' his agency. But, he added, it was an ``open secret'' that
he expected to be judged partly ``by my relationship with the World
Bank.'' He urged development proponents not to think of the
relationship as a rivalry for clout, but rather as an ``opportunity
for partnership.''

   My, What Big Teeth You Have
</P>
<P>
   A colorful mural at Knossos, Crete, from around 1600 B.C., shows
a school of dolphins swimming in a sea of fish, serene and
seemingly happy. Since then, smiling dolphins have become an icon
of inner peace. Authors and new-age centers hail them as superior
beings with much to teach humans. Swimming with the dolphins, they
say, can heal emotional wounds and open reservoirs of deep
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   But science detectives in Europe and America, following a trail
of bloody clues, have found that dolphins are in fact serial
killers whose butchery is unrelated to the need for food. Citing a
rise in bites, federal officials warn that people who swim with
wild dolphins run the risk of serious injury and even death.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Spradlin, an expert at the National Marine Fisheries
Service, said a man in Brazil who harassed a dolphin was rammed by
it and died from his injuries. ``People tend to anthropomorphize
dolphins,'' he said. ``Most don't understand the safety concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The dolphin myth was shattered by waves of dead porpoises and
baby dolphins that washed up in Scotland and Virginia. Many corpses
had bruises and broken bones and bore the tooth marks of adult
dolphins. Videotapes of dolphin attacks clinched the case.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphin lovers are attacking the research. Human pollution, some
say, may be driving the dolphins mad. ``I have never found their
behavior even remotely associated with being violent or
threatening,'' said Augusto Medelius, a surfer who has often
witnessed dolphins at play in Peru.

<P>
   The Mystery of Venus and George
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in 1784 or 1785 a boy was born to Venus, a slave on the
estate of George Washington's half-brother, John Augustine
Washington. The boy, named West Ford, was treated with special
favor. John Augustine's wife, Hannah, instructed in her will that
he should be freed and taught a trade.
</P>
<P>
   So who was West Ford's father? Three of his descendants _ Linda
Bryant of Aurora, Colo., her sister Janet Allen of Peoria, Ill.,
and their cousin, Judith S. Burton of Alexandria, Va. _ say their
family's oral history, passed down in secret for six generations,
records the name of Venus' lover: George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Historians do not agree, for several reasons. Washington may
have been sterile: he had no children with his wife, Martha, who
bore four from her previous marriage. He was highly protective of
his reputation and unlikely to have risked it with an illicit
liaison. And there is no record that he visited his brother's
estate or had any other opportunity to be with Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Far more probable, say historians, is that one of John Augustine
Washington's three sons was West Ford's father. They were young,
unmarried and living on the plantation. One candidate is Bushrod
Washington, who bequeathed land to West Ford and resembled him,
according to portraits. Another possibility is the youngest son,
George Augustine Washington. The middle name may easily have been
lost in the retelling over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Many slave-owning families had two sides: the white family and
the unacknowledged children of master-slave unions. The descendants
of Sally Hemings, a slave on Thomas Jefferson's estate, have long
preserved the oral tradition that the third president was their
ancestor, a claim that was long denied by many historians but
dramatically supported by DNA data published last November.
</P>
<P>
   With the Washington and Venus story, there is as yet no DNA
evidence, and so far every available historical fact points to a
Washington other than George.

   Vaccine in Mice Offers Hope in Alzheimer's Fight
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have developed a potential vaccine for Alzheimer's
disease. Researchers at Elan Pharmaceuticals in South San
Francisco, a division of the Elan Corporation of Dublin, used mice
that had been genetically altered so they produced plaques of
amyloid protein in their brains, a primary abnormality in
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   When they vaccinated healthy young mice, the mice grew up
without ever forming plaques; in diseased mice, the treatment
eradicated the plaques and also improved the condition of damaged
neurons and reduced inflammation. Elan hopes to begin human trials
by the end of the year.

   Weapon Against Lung Cancer
</P>
<P>
   Smokers and former smokers aged 50 and over could greatly reduce
their risk of death from lung cancer by having yearly CT scans of
their lungs, doctors reported. The scans are far better than
conventional chest X-rays at detecting tumors when they are small
enough to be cured, and might increase survival rates from 12
percent to 80 percent, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Cancer Institute and American Cancer
Society said more research was needed before public health
recommendations could be made.

   Mrs. Clinton's Listening Tour
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton began her first full-fledged campaign
trip to New York at an upstate farm belonging to Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, a fellow Democrat who is retiring from the Senate next
year. He said he hoped she would succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   In her first outing in a state in which she has never lived, she
seemed to have nearly as many differences with her husband, the
president, as with her likely opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. She declared Jerusalem the ``eternal and indivisible
capital of Israel,'' argued against proposed Medicare cuts for New
York's teaching hospitals and embraced a proposal that would help
dairy farmers but raise milk prices for downstate consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly she listened, though, and said more than once, ``Thank
you for explaining this to me!''

   Barak Takes Charge in Israel

<P>

   When Salam Al-Marayati was appointed in June to a congressional
terrorism commission, Jewish groups quickly protested. While
Al-Marayati is known as a moderate among American Muslim leaders,
and has built relationships with Jewish groups in Los Angeles,
where he lives, he also has made statements suggesting that
Palestinian terrorism arises from ``despair and suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt has withdrawn his
appointment, maintaining that Al-Marayati, who fled Iraq with his
family when he was 4 years old, could not pass a security clearance
in time.

   My, What Big Teeth You Have
</P>
<P>
   A colorful mural at Knossos, Crete, from around 1600 B.C., shows
a school of dolphins swimming in a sea of fish, serene and
seemingly happy. Since then, smiling dolphins have become an icon
of inner peace. Authors and new-age centers hail them as superior
beings with much to teach humans. Swimming with the dolphins, they
say, can heal emotional wounds and open reservoirs of deep
spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   But science detectives in Europe and America, following a trail
of bloody clues, have found that dolphins are in fact serial
killers whose butchery is unrelated to the need for food. Citing a
rise in bites, federal officials warn that people who swim with
wild dolphins run the risk of serious injury and even death.
</P>
<P>
   Trevor Spradlin, an expert at the National Marine Fisheries
Service, said a man in Brazil who harassed a dolphin was rammed by
it and died from his injuries. ``People tend to anthropomorphize
dolphins,'' he said. ``Most don't understand the safety concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   The dolphin myth was shattered by waves of dead porpoises and
baby dolphins that washed up in Scotland and Virginia. Many corpses
had bruises and broken bones and bore the tooth marks of adult
dolphins. Videotapes of dolphin attacks clinched the case.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphin lovers are attacking the research. Human pollution, some
say, may be driving the dolphins mad. ``I have never found their
behavior even remotely associated with being violent or
threatening,'' said Augusto Medelius, a surfer who has often
witnessed dolphins at play in Peru.

   The Mystery of Venus and George
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in 1784 or 1785 a boy was born to Venus, a slave on the
estate of George Washington's half-brother, John Augustine
Washington. The boy, named West Ford, was treated with special
favor. John Augustine's wife, Hannah, instructed in her will that
he should be freed and taught a trade.
</P>
<P>
   So who was West Ford's father? Three of his descendants _ Linda
Bryant of Aurora, Colo., her sister Janet Allen of Peoria, Ill.,
and their cousin, Judith S. Burton of Alexandria, Va. _ say their
family's oral history, passed down in secret for six generations,
records the name of Venus' lover: George Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Historians do not agree, for several reasons. Washington may
have been sterile: he had no children with his wife, Martha, who
bore four from her previous marriage. He was highly protective of
his reputation and unlikely to have risked it with an illicit
liaison. And there is no record that he visited his brother's
estate or had any other opportunity to be with Venus.
</P>
<P>
   Far more probable, say historians, is that one of John Augustine
Washington's three sons was West Ford's father. They were young,
unmarried and living on the plantation. One candidate is Bushrod
Washington, who bequeathed land to West Ford and resembled him,
according to portraits. Another possibility is the youngest son,
George Augustine Washington. The middle name may easily have been
lost in the retelling over the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Many slave-owning families had two sides: the white family and
the unacknowledged children of master-slave unions. The descendants
of Sally Hemings, a slave on Thomas Jefferson's estate, have long
preserved the oral tradition that the third president was their
ancestor, a claim that was long denied by many historians but
dramatically supported by DNA data published last November.
</P>
<P>
   With the Washington and Venus story, there is as yet no DNA
evidence, and so far every available historical fact points to a
Washington other than George.

   Vaccine in Mice Offers Hope in Alzheimer's Fight
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have developed a potential vaccine for Alzheimer's
disease. Researchers at Elan Pharmaceuticals in South San
Francisco, a division of the Elan Corporation of Dublin, used mice
that had been genetically altered so they produced plaques of
amyloid protein in their brains, a primary abnormality in
Alzheimer's.
</P>
<P>
   When they vaccinated healthy young mice, the mice grew up
without ever forming plaques; in diseased mice, the treatment
eradicated the plaques and also improved the condition of damaged
neurons and reduced inflammation. Elan hopes to begin human trials
by the end of the year.

   Weapon Against Lung Cancer
</P>
<P>
   Smokers and former smokers aged 50 and over could greatly reduce
their risk of death from lung cancer by having yearly CT scans of
their lungs, doctors reported. The scans are far better than
conventional chest X-rays at detecting tumors when they are small
enough to be cured, and might increase survival rates from 12
percent to 80 percent, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Cancer Institute and American Cancer
Society said more research was needed before public health
recommendations could be made.

   Mrs. Clinton's Listening Tour
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton began her first full-fledged campaign
trip to New York at an upstate farm belonging to Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, a fellow Democrat who is retiring from the Senate next
year. He said he hoped she would succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   In her first outing in a state in which she has never lived, she
seemed to have nearly as many differences with her husband, the
president, as with her likely opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani. She declared Jerusalem the ``eternal and indivisible
capital of Israel,'' argued against proposed Medicare cuts for New
York's teaching hospitals and embraced a proposal that would help
dairy farmers but raise milk prices for downstate consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly she listened, though, and said more than once, ``Thank
you for explaining this to me!''

   Russia Gains Kosovo Role

   After weeks of wrangling, NATO and Russia agreed on a role for
Russian troops in the peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Paratroopers
who will make up most of Russia's 3,600 troops began arriving at
Kosovo's main airfield on Tuesday, following a tense weekend during
which NATO blocked Russian aircraft from landing.

   The Russians have agreed to serve under NATO command, but they

arise. Still, NATO commanders believe they are the best hope for
convincing fearful Serbs, who have historic ties to Russia, to

   Record Set in Mile
</P>
<P>
   For those who treasure the breaking of supposedly impenetrable
barriers, Roger Bannister will always be a hero. In 1954, the
Briton became the first to run a mile in less than 4 minutes, doing
so in 3 minutes 59.4 seconds. Now international track meets
generally bypass the mile in favor of the slightly shorter 1,500
meters. Still, the mile retains glamour, so there was excitement
when Hicham el-Guerrouj, a 24-year-old Moroccan, lowered the world
record to 3 minutes 43.13 seconds in Rome. Had he run that time in
Bannister's record race, he would have beaten Bannister by 120
yards.

ABUSES OF FORMER MILITARY RULERS IS HAUNTING BRAZIL TODAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By LARRY ROHTER    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Nearly a decade and a half of democracy
have erased the abuses of military rule from the memory of most
Brazilians. But two cases dating from that unpleasant 21-year
period have suddenly been thrust into the national spotlight,
creating embarrassment and discomfort for the current civilian
government, which had no involvement in the original events.
</P>
<P>
   The more ticklish and emblematic of the pair is the formal
reopening of the so-called Riocentro case, named for an arena where
on April 30, 1981, some 20,000 supporters of left-wing causes had
gathered for a concert. Minutes before the show was to begin, two
bombs exploded in the parking lot, killing an army sergeant and
severely wounding a captain.
</P>
<P>
   Contradicting news reports that named the two soldiers as the
perpetrators, a military investigation eventually concluded that
the men, who worked for the army's political intelligence division,
had been victims of a plot by left-wing terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Now prosecutors say that original inquiry was ``an absurd
fantasy'' marred by ``innumerable contradictions,'' and have vowed
to discover and try those who ordered and covered up the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farce of the Riocentro military inquiry has been a bone
long stuck in the throat of the national citizenry,'' Nilmario
Miranda, a left-wing congressman, said in welcoming the move. ``The
decision to reopen the case is an act of justice and respect for
the historical truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The belated investigation comes fast on the heels of another
controversy, over the nomination of Joao Batista Campelo as the new
chief of the federal police. No sooner had Campelo been named
Brazil's top law enforcement official than a Roman Catholic priest
came forward to say that he had been tortured in 1970 during
interrogations Campelo supervised.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the accusations, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
stuck by the choice, and in five hours of dramatic televised
testimony in mid-June, Campelo denied the accusation, declaring,
``I have never seen an instrument of torture in the police stations
where I worked.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, reporters uncovered documentary evidence that supported
the priest's account. Campelo stepped down, apologizing for ``the
serious political situation'' he had created.
</P>
<P>
   As in the reluctant defense of Gen. Augusto Pinochet by Chile's
civilian government, the re-emergence of such issues here years
after the military left power indicates that ``the scourge of the
past doesn't go away,'' but can ``come back to haunt you'' in
unexpected ways, said Richard Millett, an American expert on the
Latin American military.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has found a good way to dispose of these skeletons in
the closet because there probably isn't one,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A few of Campelo's more hard-line supporters, however, have
drawn a different conclusion. ``That's what happens when you
torture but don't kill,'' said Jair Bolsonaro, a retired military
officer here who is now a member of Congress, representing a
right-wing party.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso rebounded quickly from the Campelo debacle, replacing
him with an officer who had also served in the secret police during
the military dictatorship but has the political advantage of being
the first black to be named Brazil's top police official.
</P>
<P>
   It will be more difficult, political analysts predicted, for the
president to find a palatable solution to the revived Riocentro
case.
</P>
<P>
   A former professor of sociology, Cardoso, like many other
intellectuals then on the left, was himself persecuted by the
military during the years of dictatorship, which lasted from 1964
to 1985, and went into exile for several years. But his father was
an army general who is still admired by the nationalist wing of the
armed forces, and during his five years in office, the president
has cultivated better ties with the military while simultaneously
reducing its power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing the government wants to do is get involved
seriously with this and destabilize things,'' said Alexandre
Barros, a political consultant in Brasilia. With the armed forces
having recently been deprived of Cabinet rank, their wages and
pensions frozen and a civilian minister of defense imposed on them,
Cardoso would prefer to ``circumvent or isolate this issue so that
it doesn't do greater damage,'' Barros said.
</P>
<P>
   But Gen. Newton Cruz, the retired former director of Brazil's
National Intelligence Service, has told reporters that he was
notified in advance of the planning of the attack and knows who
ordered it. He has also said he will refuse to divulge any
information if he is called to testify in a court or at public
hearings that the Brazilian Congress may hold, an act of defiance
that could lead to an institutional showdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hearings may clarify things, but whether anyone will be
punished is another question,'' said David Fleischer, publisher of
a political newsletter and a professor of political science at the
National University of Brasilia. ``There will probably be a general
catharsis and clarification, but it is doubtful that those who
perpetrated it will be identified or punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Military prosecutors who are involved in the new investigation
argue that neither the statute of limitations nor a 1988 political
amnesty apply to the Riocentro case. That has led to speculation
that at least the wounded captain, who is now a colonel still on
active duty, may be charged _ or offered as a sacrificial lamb to
appease civilians.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an institution, the armed forces are trying to redefine
their role in society,'' Barros pointed out. ``All the generals who
were involved in this are probably either retired or dead, so what
you have is a younger generation of officers who want to get rid of
this stain and reposition themselves.''

   DAJABON, Dominican Republic _ Twice a week, this border town
opens its gates so that Haitians can come in.
</P>
<P>
   On these two market days, as many as 8,000 Haitians freely cross
the Massacre River, the boundary that separates the Dominican
Republic from Haiti in the north, to sell clothes, shoes, perfume
and cosmetics or to buy almost anything.
</P>
<P>
   In a shopping frenzy, they rush into the crammed streets where
vendors have laid out merchandise under blue tarps, and rush out
with live chickens in their arms, blocks of ice on their heads and
wheelbarrows of carrots, chayote and pasta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get along very well,'' said Felix Rodriguez, 42, a farmer
who has driven from the Cibao agricultural region to sell his
produce here for the last six years and who knows enough Creole to
barter. ``We need them and they need us.''
</P>
<P>
   The informal commerce in Dajabon gives no hint of the violent
history and chilly relations between these two countries that are
lumped together on the island of Hispaniola but separated by
prejudice, mistrust and past territorial conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last three years have both governments taken steps
to strengthen diplomatic, legal and commercial ties and to set up a
bilateral commission on issues like trade, immigration and tourism,
and to stop turning their backs on each other. Officials say they
need a united front to tackle common problems like deforestation,
epidemics and illiteracy.
</P>
<P>
   But despite market days and a new political will to forge a
closer relationship, Haiti and the Dominican Republic remain
nations living side by side yet worlds apart.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, there are the warm personal relations between
the Dominican president, Leonel Fernandez, and the Haitian
president, Rene Preval, and advances like the accords last year
that allowed the countries to begin direct mail service and thus
stop routing their letters through Miami.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, huge obstacles remain, like political
instability in Haiti, deep cultural and racial prejudices, and
heavy historical baggage that includes the Haitian occupation of
its neighbor for 22 years in the 19th century and the massacre of
thousands of Haitians along the border by the Dominican government
62 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a deep-seated suspicion between the two societies
because of what the Dominicans perceive has been done to them by
Haiti and vice versa,'' said Fritz Longchamp, Haiti's foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe they resent us because we've invaded them,'' he said.
``Haitians believe Dominicans despise them and do not consider
Haitians human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond history, their interaction has been largely defined by
Haiti's desperately poor population and the Dominican Republic's
need for cheap labor, a combination that has led to both
cooperation and friction over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many Dominicans look down on a neighbor that is poorer
and more unstable. While the Dominican Republic, which occupies the
eastern two-thirds of the island, is now experiencing one of the
highest economic growth rates in the Western Hemisphere, about 7
percent, Haiti ranks as the hemisphere's poorest country.
</P>
<P>
   In public discourse, Haitians are frequently blamed for
displacing Dominican workers and depressing wages in the Dominican
Republic, a country that already has an unemployment rate of about
15 percent. Although traditionally concentrated in the sugar-cane
industry, Haitian workers have also come to dominate agricultural
and urban jobs, like construction, Dominican officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Race and culture provide enormous obstacles to improving
relations. Privately, many Dominicans speak of Haitians with both
pity and disdain, stereotyping them as carriers of disease and
practitioners of witchcraft and blaming them for ``blackening''
their side of the island, where the lighter-skinned population is
mostly mulatto.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not like us,'' said Angela Diaz, 58, a Dajabon native
who owns a hotel and a hardware store here and credits Haitians for
``keeping commerce alive'' in the town. ``They have different
customs and 85 percent of them are crafty.''
</P>
<P>
   Even among those Dominicans who denounce the mistreatment of
Haitians, some turn up their noses at the thought of any closer
relationship than that of trading partners. Among Haitians, such
attitudes and the abuses that often accompany them are deeply
resented.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department's latest report on human rights in the
Dominican Republic cites deplorable conditions and restricted
movement in state-owned sugar plantations and mills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Haitians in the Dominican Republic live in an apartheid
situation,'' said Arnold Antonin, director of Centre Petion-Bolivar
in Port-au-Prince, a nonprofit group working to foster Caribbean
integration. ``And the anti-Haitians in the Dominican Republic
continue talking about a pacific invasion by Haitians, but at the
same time the State Sugar Council still looks for Haitian workers.
It's a contradiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Although official statistics are scarce, both Haitian and
Dominican officials estimate that several hundred Haitians cross
the border illegally most days, and try to stay in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at least 14,000 Haitians were repatriated, many
forcibly removed from their homes without a chance to collect their
belongings or paychecks before being bused back to Haiti, said
officials at the Haitian Embassy in Santo Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the time those who cross the border come back poorer
than when they left,'' said Longchamp, the Haitian foreign
minister, who noted that the money sent home by Haitians working in
the Dominican Republic was negligible.
</P>
<P>
   The Dominican Republic is now seeking changes in its immigration
laws aimed at improving border controls and defining the status of
the half a million Haitians already in the country, most of them
illegally, who make up an underclass with few rights.
</P>
<P>
   The changes being drafted by the Fernandez government are
expected to redefine the rules for hiring foreign workers and to
impose sanctions on employers who violate labor restrictions.
Officials are also debating new rules for citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   Dominican officials say the changes will most likely result in
the repatriation, not the integration, of most Haitians who are now
in the country. But they say it is all part of their determination
to face long-ignored problems with new cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Even amid persistent tensions, the recent interest in working
together reflects the gradual democratization of both countries
after years of dictatorial governments and a more open-minded
generation of political leaders and intellectuals, some of whom _
like Fernandez, who was raised in New York City _ were once
immigrants themselves.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   When Fernandez and Preval traded visits last year, it was the
first time that a Dominican president and a Haitian president had
traveled to each other's countries in at least six decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the efforts, officials on both sides agree, are also driven
by the times _ a recognition of the benefits of regional economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to change the relations from a tense situation to a
stable situation,'' Fernandez, who has made foreign policy a high
priority, said in an interview. ``We want a stable situation where
the Dominican Republic can feel that Haitian problems won't spill
over to the Dominican Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dominican officials say what they need most is a commitment
from other countries to finance the economic development of Haiti.
The European Union has begun to finance joint projects along the
border, including construction of roads, rehabilitation of a port
that can serve both countries and plans for an environmental
research center.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have sponsored some joint environmental and
law-enforcement projects but still channel most aid to each country
separately.
</P>
<P>
   For all the controversy over Haitian immigration, there is
little to deter crossing the border, except for four official
border crossings and scattered Dominican guard posts that resemble
miniature medieval castles surrounded by spectacular mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Around these mountains, all that separates the two countries at
times is a dirt road, and the only people visible for miles are the
children who run excitedly down the slopes from the Haitian side at
the sound of an engine to beg for money.
</P>
<P>
   Far fewer Dominicans, an estimated 10,000, have crossed the
border into Haiti to make a living. They make up an eclectic group
of mostly business people, including vendors and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are not the same as in the past, when Dominicans and
Haitians wanted to kill each other over anything,'' said Juan
Fabian, 43, who moved to Port-au-Prince, Haiti's capital, 12 years
ago to help introduce barbecued chicken _ or ``the Dominican
system'' as he calls it _ and now has a Haitian wife and a
3-year-old son he described as ``Dominico-Haitian.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Dominican Republic there are also many self-described
Dominico-Haitians, in the shantytowns where sugar-cane workers
live, known as ``batey,'' and in Santo Domingo's ``Modelo'' market,
which can pass for a Little Haiti. There Haitians and Dominicans
coexist, united in hardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get along like brothers who work together,'' said Jorge
Reyes, 23, one of several cane workers recently passing time in the
balcony of a crumbling wood house in Batey No. 3 near the southern
border town of Jimani. The workers said they had just finished the
harvest and were waiting for three months' pay from the state.
</P>
<P>
   When Reyes, responding to a reporter's question, said he was
Dominico-Haitian, a skeptical Dominican worker interjected: ``Tell
the truth. Tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born here!'' Reyes insisted, offended, and pulled out a
crumpled birth certificate. In the end, the workers eventually
agreed, it did not matter who was what.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon Beato, 68, a Dominican who worked as a guard and said he
too was owed money, said, ``We all suffer equally.''

U.N. REPORTING CUTS IN GLOBAL DRUG CROPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Pino Arlacchi, the director of the U.N. International Drug
Control Program, addressed the General Assembly 13 months ago and
proposed eliminating opium poppy and coca leaf cultivation in 10
years, his strategy was greeted with polite skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of getting opium and coca farmers to grow less
profitable crops in return for the promise of schools, medical
clinics and roads and other means to a better life struck many
listeners as unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   But Arlacchi says that his timetable for eradicating the raw
ingredients for heroin and cocaine around the world is, if
anything, running ahead of schedule in some countries, though he
acknowledged difficulties in others.
</P>
<P>
   Arlacchi insisted that people are taking alternative
development, as his strategy is called, more seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``The skepticism has disappeared,'' he said in a telephone
interview from the Office for Drug Control and Crime Prevention
headquarters in Vienna, Austria. ``Now we're not discussing any
more if it's possible to eliminate opium poppy and coca production.
We are discussing how to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   As evidence, Arlacchi cited the progress achieved in Peru and
Bolivia over the last year and a half.
</P>
<P>
   In Bolivia, 34,000 acres of coca plants have been eradicated
since the beginning of 1998. He described this as equivalent to
depriving the drug market of nearly 43 tons of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   In Peru, more than 50,000 acres were taken out of coca
cultivation, an amount equivalent to pulling nearly 65 tons of
cocaine from the market.
</P>
<P>
   The decline began before Arlacchi began spreading his gospel of
alternative development, thanks to separate efforts by the Peruvian
and Bolivian governments, which included Peru's air interdiction of
aircraft transporting coca base to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian coca cultivation dropped by 56 percent between 1995 and
1998, according to the White House's Office of National Drug
Control Policy. Bolivian coca cultivation, it said, declined by 17
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Arlacchi estimated that it will cost $5 billion over a 10-year
period to phase out coca leaf and opium poppy production. His
recipe includes money from international donations, cooperation by
local governments and ``a modest degree of coercion'' to make
farmers switch to legal crops.
</P>
<P>
   Opium poppy production in Afghanistan looks likely to increase
this year, Arlacchi said, but the ruling Taliban militia is showing
more willingness to help reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
   In June, he said, nearly 1,000 acres of opium poppies were
eradicated in Qandahar province, where the U.N. drug control agency
has an alternative development project. The acreage taken out of
cultivation would have produced about 24 tons of opium, or 2.4 tons
of heroin. By bringing alternative development to Qandahar,
Arlacchi said, ``We removed 2.4 tons of heroin with a $5 million
investment.''
</P>
<P>
   And in Shinwar and Nangarhar provinces of Afghanistan, Arlacchi
said, the Taliban promised to confiscate any increase over last
year's opium harvest. Afghanistan vies with Myanmar, formerly
Burma, as the world's biggest producer of opium.
</P>
<P>
   After Arlacchi visited Laos in May, he reported that the Laotian
government agreed to phase out opium poppy production there over a
six-year period.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is significant because Laos is the third largest producer
of opium,'' he said. Arlacchi said that he promised to raise $80
million to finance Laotian alternative development programs.
</P>
<P>
   Previous opium production in Thailand and Pakistan, he noted,
also dropped off once programs were put in place to help farmers
there grow other crops.
</P>
<P>
   But Arlacchi said that ``Myanmar has made very modest progress''
in reducing its opium output.
</P>
<P>
   While coca cultivation plunged in Bolivia and Peru, it increased
next door in Colombia, the primary source of cocaine. Arlacchi, who
last visited Colombia in March, said that eradicating its coca
crops depends on whether the government can achieve peace with
leftist guerrillas who control wide swatches of countryside.
</P>
<P>
   With a credible peace, he said, ``We can really say that the
years of illicit crops are numbered.''
</P>
<P>
   But if peace efforts fail in Colombia, he said, the progress
made in reducing coca production in the Andean countries will
suffer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to soliciting funds from the United States and other
major donor countries, Arlacchi has also met with James Wolfensohn,
the president of the World Bank. The bank previously did not regard
drug eradication as a development issue, Arlacchi said, but ``now
the World Bank body is starting slowly to change its attitude.''

SECRETIVE CHINESE GROUP HOLDS 2-DAY PROTEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SETH FAISON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Nearly 1,000 members of a spiritual movement known as
Falun Gong held a two-day demonstration inside government
headquarters in a southern Chinese city last week, a human rights
organization reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred by a recent crackdown on Falun Gong in Beijing, where
China's leaders appear alarmed by the size, organization and
secretive nature of the movement, the demonstrators entered the
inner courtyard of Communist Party headquarters in Nanchang, the
capital of Jiangxi Province, on July 6 and 7.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators demanded the retraction of an article in an
official publication that likened Falun Gong, or Buddhist Law, to a
superstitious cult.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the danger implied in official warnings, they refused
to leave until a government official finally disavowed the article,
the human rights organization said.
</P>
<P>
   Although police were deployed, the demonstration was peaceful
and no one was arrested, reported Hong Kong's Information Center of
Human Rights and Democratic Movement in China.
</P>
<P>
   Falun Gong burst onto the national scene in April, when more
than 10,000 members surrounded the leadership compound in central
Beijing to demand official recognition from leaders who had never
heard of the group, whose secretive nature and loose structure
prevent an accurate estimate of its size. Falun Gong claims 100
million members, and government estimates are set at 20 million to
60 million.
</P>
<P>
   What most alarmed Beijing's leaders was the discovery that some
senior members of the government and the army believe in the
healing powers of Falun Gong, a branch of qigong, a traditional
teaching that human energy may be channeled to achieve supernatural
powers.
</P>
<P>
   Followers of Falun Gong claim that their founder, Li Hongzhi, is
capable of flying and other extraordinary feats. However, Li could
not prevent the authorities from circumscribing his activity in
China, and he fled to the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Nanchang, the demonstration was sparked by an article
denouncing Falun Gong in a publication called Jiuan Zhilu,
published by the Provincial Communist Party Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators assembled on Tuesday to demand a retraction,
the Hong Kong human rights group said, but it took until noon the
next day for an official of the newsletter to meet with nine
members of the group and agree that the article represented only
the author's view and not the view of any magazine or other
official organization.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Always alert to threats to its authority, the Communist Party
has recently launched an internal campaign to try to identify and
purge any senior party members whose allegiance might be
compromised by sympathy for Falun Gong.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign may be difficult. The vast majority of people in
China believe in some form of qigong. Many simply practice it as a
form of physical exercise, while perhaps hundreds of millions
actively follow various qigong sects that preach supernatural
powers.
</P>
<P>
   Concern among the authorities was palpable in a series of
harshly worded editorials in the People's Daily over the past two
weeks. Exercise is deemed acceptable, but Falun Gong practitioners
are accused of being tricksters and political subversives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem does not lie in those who practice qigong, but in
a small number of people with ulterior motives,'' one editorial
said. ``They sell cultural rot in the name of spreading traditional
culture, or use all manner of pseudo-science, using magic to
deceive and dazzle and bluff, swindling people of their wealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one believes that a certain practice can cure any illness,
and even make one into a sage or a spirit, that is wrong,'' the
newspaper said. ``It will guide one down the wrong path and
endanger one's physical and mental health.''

   KOSOVO POLJE, Yugoslavia _ Crammed into a schoolhouse, 30 to a
room, or living in tents pitched on the school grounds, their
horses tethered nearby, the Gypsies of Kosovo are living in a
precarious state. Always at the bottom of the social pile in this
sectarian society, they have now hit their nadir.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 5,000 people have sought shelter in this compound,
fleeing the vengeance of returning Albanians who accuse them of
collaboration with the Serbs in the last months of violence and
ethnic purges. They are frightened and angry and now homeless, many
of them burned out of their homes as the Albanians were just three
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Black-haired and dark-skinned, the Gypsies, or Roma as they are
also known, live in settlements all over Serbia and Kosovo. As
elsewhere in Europe, they are the most discriminated against of all
ethnic minorities. They live in districts that are close to slums,
or drift with their horses and caravans in a seminomadic existence
of joblessness and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The Selimi family is now living in a tent on the school grounds.
It is well constructed _ a blue tarp, with the initials for the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees printed on it, drawn
over wooden supports cut from saplings. Naked babies scramble on
the blanketed floor. Bejaze Selimi sits cross-legged, slapping them
hard when they get too boisterous. She wears a flouncy lacy skirt
and skimpy top. Her bare arms are tattooed with delicate, dark blue
decoration.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hate us because we voted for Slobodan Milosevic; that's
why they hate us. And yes, it's true. We all voted for Milosevic,''
she said, cutting through the complaints of the men in her family,
who lie or sit nearby, all naked to the waist in the heat. She is
direct, and her eyes show a sharp intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought in the beginning he was good,'' she said. ``We did
not know that he would set a trap for us.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1991 Yugoslav census found between 30,000 and 40,000 Roma
living in Kosovo. Today there are probably only 6,000 or 7,000,
gathered together for security in small refuges. Most of them fled
the province for Serbia proper, but the last to leave were turned
back by Serbian officials and are now stuck.
</P>
<P>
   They say they want to go elsewhere, to the United States,
Britain, France or Germany, said Paula Ghedini, a project officer
for the U.N. refugee agency. ``Some few cases might be eligible,
but no way can we resettle them,'' she said. ``It's not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet there is so much bad blood, the Roma are adamant that they
can no longer live in Kosovo. The Albanians seem to be making their
return home difficult.
</P>
<P>
   The Gypsy quarter of Pristina, Kosovo's capital, presents
perhaps the worst scene of destruction in the city today. An area
of steep winding cobbled streets and small old plaster houses, much
of it is now reduced to charred rubble. Clothes and belongings are
strewn in courtyards and back alleys and the pungent smell of fire
hangs heavy. The Gypsies have gone.
</P>
<P>
   The wanton destruction shocks, but even more shocking is that
the houses are still smoldering, and every night more fires light
up the sky. The burning started after NATO troops arrived in
Kosovo, and is being done by Albanians bent on revenge. On a recent
evening, as NATO troops and firefighters moved through the area,
spotting and wetting down fires, a new fire broke out every 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Albanians _ youths and older men _ appeared out of the darkness,
slipping through the narrow spaces between houses, always shrugging
their shoulders when asked who was setting the houses alight. ``The
kids are doing it,'' said one man. ``Albanians, men from outside,''
the youths said.
</P>
<P>
   The anger Albanians feel against the Gypsies is sharp and nasty.
It stems mostly from the accusation of collaboration and a sense of
betrayal, that a people who were also treated badly by the Serbs
should turn so readily against their neighbors and kick the
Albanians when they were down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Albanians feel much more betrayed by the Roma than by the
Serbs, who were always against them _ it is much more emotionally
charged,'' Ms. Ghedini said. ``Gypsies lived predominantly with the
Albanians and went to Albanian schools, but they always voted with
the Serbs.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That the Roma collaborated is widely known. They did not hide
it, even organizing a parade of their own police unit in Pristina
during the worst purges of Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Makolli, of the Council for the Defense of Human Rights
and Freedoms in Pristina, said he ran into a checkpoint, run by
Roma, during the first weeks of the NATO bombardment. ``They aimed
their weapons at me,'' he said. ``I knew almost all of them, after
living 30 years in this city.''
</P>
<P>
   Makolli concedes that many Roma were drafted and maybe even
coerced to act as they did. Often they were enlisted to do the
worst jobs, including picking up and burying bodies. He also
believes that the Roma were manipulated by the Serbian government
over the years specifically to stir up ethnic tension in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many Kosovo Albanians, like Makolli, find it hard to forgive
the apparent alacrity with which many Roma looted, burned and
wielded weapons during the last months. His group has recorded
testimony that points to the involvement of some Roma in massacres,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really bad to hate an ethnic race, but this hatred is
based directly on what they did,'' Makolli said. ``Roma took people
from refugee columns, they demanded identification papers, they
took action in the same way that the Serbian forces did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every Albanian expected it from the Serbs, but from the Roma,
they did not expect this,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Zenel Sopjani, 45, an Albanian cook, stayed in his house in the
Gypsy quarter throughout the war. He was helped by a Gypsy
neighbor, who now has had to flee, and he feels bad about that. Yet
he says most of his Gypsy neighbors acted badly toward him. ``When
the bombing started their attitude changed,'' he said. ``They saw
they had power and weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Roma now taking refuge in the school say they did nothing
wrong, even if others did. They say they guarded houses and goods
for Albanian neighbors. Most of them are manual laborers, but some
are educated, engineers and traders.
</P>
<P>
   They had benefited over the last decade from Milosevic's
suppression of the Albanians, often picking up the vacant jobs and
getting an education. Yet always marginalized, the Roma apparently
opted for power. ``At times they have chosen certain options they
thought would benefit themselves,'' said Ms. Ghedini. ``This time
they jumped the wrong way.''

FOR GOP CONTENDERS, STRAW POLL LOOMS LARGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DES MOINES, Iowa _ Six years ago, when he first started running
for President, Lamar Alexander never figured the biggest test he
would face in his grinding quest would be a straw poll. But it has
come down to that for the former Tennessee governor, as well as for
half a dozen other hopefuls seeking the Republican nomination in
2000.
</P>
<P>
   As Alexander put it, when 10,000 Iowa Republicans gather in Ames
next month for the party's traditional presidential straw poll, on
Aug. 14, the results will add up to more than ``just another straw
in the wind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are higher now than before,'' he said last week.
``All the money and media and hype going into this campaign have
changed and speeded things up. This time Ames will show the nation
who's ready. It's the big political event of 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   It has not always been like that. For years, Iowa's
first-in-the-nation February caucuses were the start of the
candidate winnowing process. But now the Iowa straw poll looms as
the starting point, even if at heart it is nothing but an
unscientific beauty contest that elects not a single convention
delegate.
</P>
<P>
   Never in its 20-year history has the poll been accorded such
importance. It has been considered a good tool for building
election enthusiasm but never a tool for seriously measuring
candidate readiness. And like all presidential straw polls, it has
no great history of predicting winners, no great surprise for a
poll typically won by the candidate who can bus in the most
supporters, pay their $25 entrance fees, then wine, dine and
entertain them sumptuously and say not a word if some get carried
away and try to vote twice.
</P>
<P>
   Two developments have speeded up the winnowing dynamic. First,
there is the huge early lead that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has
taken in national polls and in raising money. Add to that the
``front loading'' of next year's caucus and primary schedule, to
the point that the nominating process will almost be over before it
begins.
</P>
<P>
   This confluence of front running and front loading has left many
candidates, among them Alexander, scrambling desperately almost
from Day 1 to find the money and traction needed to rise above
single digits in the polls. Many currently trail the governor by a
daunting 35 points or more and, as a result, are already on the
ropes.
</P>
<P>
   As many political professionals and pundits see it, a big Bush
victory in Ames would effectively eliminate maybe half of the field
of 12 Republican candidates and would considerably lengthen the
odds for those left standing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out of Ames this time, it's a good bet that only the
top three finishers and the candidates who greatly exceed
expectations will have the means and realistic reason to
continue,'' said Dee Stewart, the executive director of the
Republican Party of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Bush, the candidates most often mentioned as having a
good shot at finishing in the top tier are Steve Forbes, the
multimillionaire publisher, and Elizabeth Dole, the former Red
Cross president and wife of Bob Dole, the 1996 Republican nominee.
In the second tier are Alexander, former Vice President Dan Quayle,
Pat Buchanan, the commentator, and Gary Bauer, a family-values
advocate. The last tier includes Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, Alan
Keyes, the broadcaster, and Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain of Arizona, the 12th candidate in the
Republican field, says he will not compete in the Ames poll.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that he has been campaigning almost nonstop in Iowa
for six years, Alexander appears to have one of the best campaign
organizations in the state. He managed to finish fourth at Ames in
1995, but was out of the race by early March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to exceed expectations,'' he said as he set off on a
23-day, 60-county tour of the state in a bus named ``Exceeding
Expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who finished third at Ames in 1995, sees Ames 1999 in
starker terms. He, too, is struggling mightily for traction now,
like most hard-right and Christian conservatives in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grim Reaper is going to be waiting outside the gates of
the Ames fieldhouse,'' he said while campaigning in Des Moines last
week. ``About five or six of those fellas may never survive. Women,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Bush is taking Ames seriously. Since he jumped into
the race last month, he has by all accounts put a big,
smooth-running campaign organization in place in the state. Topping
that off, on Wednesday he paid a whopping $43,500 to get prime
space outside the Ames fieldhouse for entertaining and feeding his
supporters _ roughly 10 times what most candidates paid.
</P>
<P>
   He has drawn criticism and raised eyebrows, however, for thus
far making only one Iowa visit and for scheduling only five
additional days of campaigning between now and Aug. 14. He may lead
his nearest rivals, Mrs. Dole and Forbes, by better than 3-to-1 in
statewide polls, surely a comfortable edge, but that edge does not
automatically translate to a 3-to-1 lead in a straw poll.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Forbes, like Alexander, plans to spend the better
part of three weeks campaigning in Iowa between now and Aug. 14. He
predicts that he will make a ``respectable showing'' in Ames, but
he insists that however he fares and whatever conclusions people
draw about the results, he will stay in the race _ with the money
to compete _ until the final nominating vote next summer in
Philadelphia.

COMMENTARY: CONFRONTING POVERTY IN AMERICA: IF NOT NOW, WHEN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Bill Clinton's mood was upbeat. The appearance
with Gov. Gray Davis and Magic Johnson at the high school in Watts
had gone well. Now he adjusted his long legs in the back seat of
the limousine and began answering questions about his effort to
draw private investors to some of the poorest regions of America.
</P>
<P>
   The president contends that there are ``new markets'' to be
tapped, and therefore ``money to be made,'' in such chronically
distressed areas as Appalachia, the Mississippi Delta, the vast
Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota and inner-city
neighborhoods like Watts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not like either the Great Society of the '60s or the
great neglect of the '80s,'' said Clinton. ``This is about getting
good jobs into the inner cities and rural areas by building an
economic infrastructure that is part of the private economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will send legislation to Congress this week that calls
for $1.6 billion in federal tax credits and loan guarantees that
are designed to stimulate $15 billion in private investments over
five years.
</P>
<P>
   There are skeptics, especially among those who think Clinton
should have done more for the poor during his first six years in
office. Without question, he should have. And this is a modest
effort at a time when the nation could afford a much grander
assault on poverty.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's proposal is, at least, a start. And if even this
modest effort fails to win approval at a time when the nation is
experiencing its greatest prosperity ever, it would mean that we
truly care nothing at all about the poor among us.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional approval is not a lock. With the nation enjoying a
spectacular budget surplus, the Republican Party is looking lustily
at another big tax cut. It is not much interested in initiatives
that might bring struggling Americans into the economic mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   The president scoffed at the GOP tax-cut plans, saying, ``If you
pay for their tax cut and their defense proposals, it would restore
the deficit and dramatically cut our investments in the areas of
education and health care and the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``It would be a terrible mistake to walk away from our
education obligations, and it would be, I think, very dumb to
restore the deficit if we can avoid it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then a grin crossed his face. ``You know,'' he said, ``the
Republicans have made a lot of money out of our economic policy.
That's one of the reasons they can afford to finance their
campaigns so generously. They've done well.''
</P>
<P>
   Without mentioning George W. Bush by name, the president said it
was as if the Republicans had decided, ``OK, you've made us a lot
of money. Now we want to be in power again, and change the economic
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   His grin broadened. ``Keep in mind,'' he said, ``I'm for a tax
cut, too. I just think it ought to be affordable.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to Los Angeles came at the end of a four-day
tour of impoverished regions across the nation. In some cases he
visited people experiencing gruesome levels of distress, including
a woman at the Pine Ridge Reservation who lived with 28 others in a
five-bedroom dwelling.
</P>
<P>
   These are the glory days of our prosperity. If now is not the
right time to offer help to those who are really hurting, to
Americans who live in shacks and caves, and with barely enough food
to survive, then when?
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the interview with Clinton, I asked if he and the
first lady are committed to living in New York even if she loses
her bid for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   He referred to a conversation they had in 1993, when he said to
Mrs. Clinton, ``Ever since you came to Arkansas in 1973, we've
lived where my work dictated, and where I wanted to live.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he told her that at the end of his presidency he would
have to spend a lot of time in Arkansas establishing his
presidential library and center. ``But I said, `I will live
wherever else you want to live.' And she had told me years ago that
she wanted to go to New York. And I said, `That's fine with me. I
love New York. I'll be happy to live there.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I'm going to divide my time between New York and Arkansas,
no matter what happens.''

FAA MISSES DEADLINE IN SETTING RULES FOR AIR TOURS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Ever since the collision of two aircraft filled
with tourists in the Grand Canyon 13 years ago, safety officials
have urged the Federal Aviation Administration to step up its
oversight of air tours. After a spate of air-tour accidents in
Hawaii, the FAA promised in 1995 to write new national rules by the
end of 1997, calling it ``a high priority.''
</P>
<P>
   But it has not happened yet, and around the United States this
summer, hundreds of tour operators _ no one knows just how many _
are carrying tens of thousands of tourists under the old, loose
requirements. And though the data are so sketchy that nobody knows
the odds, statistically speaking, these tourists appear to be
holding some of the riskiest air tickets money can buy.
</P>
<P>
   As long as they do not fly more than 25 miles from where they
take off and land, tour operators are exempt from many rules. For
example, they do not have to limit their pilots to eight hours of
flying a day, and during the intense summer season, some fly
longer. Their pilots do not have to pass an annual flight check, or
a quiz conducted in flight or in a simulator. The planes need not
carry a maintenance log on board.
</P>
<P>
   After the accidents in Hawaii, the FAA issued special temporary
rules for the Grand Canyon and Hawaii, cutting accidents there
sharply, but nationally accidents have stayed at about 10 a year,
and the government is struggling to decide what it wants to require
in the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just frustrating,'' said Barry Sweedler, director of the
National Transportation Safety Board's office of recommendations,
which has repeatedly called for changes. ``This is a situation
where everybody agrees that this is a good thing to do, and we are
now three and a half years since the board had asked the FAA to
have this completed.''
</P>
<P>
   A report by the inspector general of the Transportation
Department concluded in May that the new rule ``has been delayed
too long and should be moved forward quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The FAA began writing special regulations for air tours after a
collision on June 18, 1986, between a helicopter and a twin-engine
plane in the Grand Canyon, which killed 25 people and left wreckage
on the canyon wall. The rule established traffic patterns and
barred planes from the canyon itself.
</P>
<P>
   Helicopter accidents in Hawaii killed 23 people from 1989 to
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Grand Canyon and Hawaii, from April 1995 to June
1998, the inspector general's report counted 31 accidents resulting
in 25 deaths and 52 injuries, and policy-makers are confident that
they can cut those numbers sharply with better regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Better regulations will not prevent all crashes, but experts
point to several crashes that new rules could have made less
likely.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the pilot of a single-engine Waco died, along with
two passengers who had bought tickets for a 15-minute flight on
Aug. 24, 1997, near Ocean City, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot, who was qualified as an airline pilot and a flight
instructor, radioed to the plane owner that he had ``two female
passengers on board who wanted a thrill,'' according to the
safety-board report. But he was apparently overconfident; witnesses
said he was trying to do a loop and lost control at a low altitude.
At the higher altitude required under stricter rules, he might have
recovered, according to the inspector general's office.
</P>
<P>
   Two people died and one was seriously injured when a Bell
helicopter came apart in flight in Marathon, Fla., in April 1994.
Maintenance personnel had botched a previous repair and had skipped
a required inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Nelligan, a spokesman for the inspector general, said the
FAA could have caught these lapses more easily if they had occurred
under the group that is not exempt, which gets scheduled
inspections; the exempt group is subject to inspection at any time,
but FAA inspectors look at them only sporadically, Nelligan said.
</P>
<P>
   Others point out that exempt tour operators have reasons beyond
the fear of the FAA to stay safe. ``Almost always, the guys doing
the flying are the guys who own the company,'' said James Coyne,
president of the National Air Transportation Association, a trade
association that includes repair stations, flight schools, airport
operators and others.
</P>
<P>
   He said they had a strong incentive to preserve their businesses
and themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike airlines, companies running tours do not have to report
operating data, so calculating accident rates is guesswork. But an
air tour appears to be far more dangerous per passenger mile than a
regularly scheduled flight and, the inspector general's report
suggests, much more dangerous than an air taxi, too, because those
usually fly at higher altitudes over fixed routes.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy Gilligan, the FAA's deputy associate administrator for
regulation and certification, said that she wished regulations for
tour operators had been issued, but that the agency had been busy
drafting other rules and lacked the legal and technical staff to
write more.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ms. Gilligan said, even if tour operators were regulated
only under the looser rules that apply to the smallest commercial
operators, there were still strict requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as though any Joe can jump in a plane and fly
tours,'' she said. And the special rules for Hawaii and the Grand
Canyon cover most of the tours, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the operators are so varied that writing a rule to
cover them all is difficult. Some are primarily ``fixed base

small airports, and offer air tours on a casual basis, while
others, like those at the Grand Canyon, run the aviation equivalent
of tour buses.

   At Barnstorming Adventures, located at McLellan-Palomar Airport
near Carlsbad, Calif., Kate Lister and her husband, Tom Harnish,
operate six single-engine airplanes, including two open-cockpit
biplanes, both built in the 1920s, which they would almost
certainly have to retire under rules now being contemplated.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons have little to do with safety, Ms. Lister said.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she said, the biplanes were built with a metal skid
where the tail touches the ground, and sometime in the 1930s
someone added a wheel instead. But the planes fly under a standard
certificate that specifies the original design, with the skid.
</P>
<P>
   If she had to meet airline rules, she said, the discrepancy
would have to be corrected, but it would take many hours of work by
engineers to prove that the wheels, in use now for more than 60
years, were safe.
</P>
<P>
   The planes are well maintained and careful records are kept, Ms.
Lister said, but the logbooks are not on the planes. ``Holy moly,''
she said in a telephone interview. ``Nope, we don't comply with
that one. There's not a lot of storage space in a 1929 open-cockpit
biplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of the rule could be easy to apply, she said, like
the number of hours of experience her pilots must have and the
limit on the number of hours per day.
</P>
<P>
   But companies that give tours that are already in the more
regulated group want their competitors regulated the same way.
``They're putting people in the airplane for money, and we all need
to operate under the same regulation,'' said Jay Hudson, the
director of operations at Hudson Air Service, in Talkeetna, Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   If the policy-makers in Washington have open-cockpit biplanes in
mind at all, they are approaching the issue only slowly. The FAA's
1997 deadline came and went. A year later, the agency actually
finished work on a proposed rule, and sent its draft to the
secretary of transportation and the Office of Management and Budget
for approval, the last step before publishing it for public
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Then the FAA changed its mind, and pulled the rule back for more
work. Ms. Gilligan said staff members realized that the rule they
had drafted would cover air tours that ran only a day or a week a
year, like those at a county fair, and could ban many of them. So
it wrote an exemption.
</P>
<P>
   A new draft went to the transportation secretary last month, and
agency officials are hopeful they can get it issued formally by
late summer, so the public comment period can begin. That leaves
the possibility of having a rule in place by next year, although no
one is sure, because there is certain to be voluminous comment. And
even after the rule takes effect, operators would probably have a
year to comply.

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: NEW FROM FAULKNER, AN OLD STORY 
</HEADLINE>
  ( nk ) 
 By DUDLEY CLENDINEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the spring of 1948, with tensions rising in the South and
Southern Democrats rebelling against the civil rights program
President Harry Truman had proposed to Congress that February, a
New York literary agent sent a short story by William Faulkner to
The Atlantic Monthly and Harper's Magazine. It was a fractured
time. World War II, by wrenching Americans out of their accustomed
lives and routines, had forever broken the foundation of
segregation _ the assumption by blacks and whites alike that the
system was ordained and enduring. That it would change was not yet
clear, but the earth had cracked. In July, Truman ordered an end to
discrimination in the armed services and civil government ``as
rapidly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The dominant character in the story that Faulkner had typed,
down in Oxford, Miss., was a stubborn black man named Lucas
Beauchamp, who wore the old broadcloth coat, the gold watch chain
and silent self-assurance of his white, slave-owning grandfather,
Carothers McCaslin. His very presence in town was sometimes enough
to enrage young rednecks, and for whatever reason, Harper's and The
Atlantic Monthly turned the story down. The magazines had published
Faulkner's fiction before America entered the war, including a
story about Beauchamp and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   But the rejected story was about the relations between Beauchamp
and whites. It was culled from the front part of a novel,
``Intruder in the Dust.'' That novel, published in the fall of
1948, was about a white boy who saved Beauchamp from the false
accusation of murdering a white man. But the unpublished Beauchamp
short story, which emerged for the first time last week in the
pages of the Virginia Quarterly Review, offers a different
revelation. There, in Faulkner's words, undiminished by time, is
all the texture, the back-country manners, the flavor and scent of
a racial structure long collapsed, a way of life forever gone. It
is stunning, reading it, how the past rushes back. One can smell
the dark, rich nuances and tensions of Mississippi, 1948. It is
even more poignant to finish this story and realize how far we
still are from achieving its end.
</P>
<P>
   For this is a story of instruction about giving and accepting on
terms of mutual respect. It is the 12-year-old white boy, cold and
wet from a fall in the creek, who is commanded by Beauchamp to
follow him to his cabin. There he is wrapped in the black man's
quilt and warmed by his fire. But Beauchamp is no servant. He will
not be paid, and the challenge for the boy is to accept the gift,
and therefore the authority and humanity of the man who gave it. It
is a story about freedom, about black strength and competence, and
about white acceptance, and acknowledgment, and respect. More than
50 years later, those are still issues in America and the world, as
well as in Mississippi. &UR;  &LR;

   LUSAKA, Zambia _ The signing of a cease-fire agreement meant to
end the war in Congo stalled for hours Saturday as two factions
within one of the rebel groups contested which one of them would
sign the cease-fire document.
</P>
<P>
   As 300 senior diplomats, international observers and journalists
waited for seven hours inside the Great Hall of the Mulungushi
International Conference Center, and several heads of state and
senior ministers did the same in a back room, negotiators were
apparently arguing over whether Ernest Wamba dia Wamba or Bizima
Karaha would sit in the red chair with the ``RCD'' label in front
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Wamba dia Wamba founded the RCD, the Congolese Rally for
Democracy, but has headed only a splinter group since being ousted
by Emile Ilunga, and his deputy, Karaha.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am the legitimate leader of the RCD and should sign on its
behalf,'' Wamba dia Wamba said. Ilunga said that was unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   For a historic meeting hailing what African politicians have
said is ``an African solution to an African problem,'' it also
displayed problems of organization. No one seemed to be in charge
and no explanation of what was going on was given to the delegates,
who included foreign ministers and ambassadors as they sat in the
room from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Rumors spread, and no announcements were
made as to when or whether the signing might take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my years in Africa, I've never seen anything like
this,'' said a senior Western diplomat who attended as an observer.
``You usually have contentious issues to iron out in these
negotiations, but you make sure they're ironed out before you
invite all the heads of state for a signing. You don't let someone
start claiming squatter's rights to a chair.''
</P>
<P>
   Zambia's president, Frederick T.J. Chiluba, announced on
national television Friday night that the signing would take place
at 10 a.m. the following day. Saturday morning, President Laurent
Kabila of Congo landed at the Lusaka airport at 11:15 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   On word that Kabila had arrived, a dozen television cameras were
clicked into place on their tripods and 50 microphones were put in
front of Chiluba's designated chair. Then nothing happened.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Wamba dia Wamba came in alone and sat in the chair of
the rebel faction he used to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he was doing, he replied: ``Who can dictate to me who
signs for the Congolese people? Why can't we both sign? I should be
signing it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the hours dragged on, the only other diplomat to join him at
the table was the Angolan defense minister, Kunda Paihama. About 4
p.m., as it looked as if the signing might be a complete failure,
Wamba dia Wamba received a message that sent him off into a back
room, apparently for negotiations to resolve the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Seven heads of state, including Kabila, were supposed to endorse
the deal, with other regional leaders witnessing the signing,
Zambian mediators said. Besides Congo, signers of the pact are to
include Rwanda and Uganda, which are backing the Congolese rebels,
who accuse Kabila of corruption, mismanagement and warmongering;
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola, which have backed Kabila out of
financial and security interests, and South Africa. Zambia would
sign too, as the host country.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   President Eduardo Dos Santos of Angola sent his defense minister
to sign in his place.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the leaders who were in Lusaka Saturday are expected by
Monday at the summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity
in Algiers.
</P>
<P>
   When Kabila arrived at the airport Saturday morning, he said he
was ``more than hopeful.'' Other leaders expressed similar
optimism.
</P>
<P>
   A 30-page peace plan adopted by regional defense and foreign
ministers on Wednesday was completed after two weeks of often
acrimonious talks by officials and mediators in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   The cease-fire document calls for the guns in Congo to fall
silent within 24 hours and for a joint military commission to
administer the accord and oversee all fighters. It also allows for
the creation of a unified army after a 90-day national dialogue
under a ``neutral facilitator'' on Congo's political future and for
peacekeepers from the Organization of African Unity or the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The pact provides for an operation that is intended to
strengthen peace by tracking down Hutu militias and any other armed
groups. The enforcers involved in such an operation can, according
to the pact, use ``persuasive or coercive measures'' to disarm them
and hand over ``mass killers, perpetrators of crimes against
humanity and other war criminals'' for trial by the international
war crimes tribunal on the Rwandan genocide.
</P>
<P>
   The Hutu militiamen are implicated in the 1994 genocide in
Rwanda of Tutsi and moderate Hutu. The Tutsi-dominated government
entered Congo to fight them, but Congo accuses Rwanda of seeking to
seize territory.
</P>
<P>
   The accord allows rebels to hold their territorial gains, which
amount to nearly half of the vast mineral-producing country
formerly known as Zaire, until a dialogue on restoring state
administration to all areas is concluded. Those talks are supposed
to open within 90 days of the pact being signed.
</P>
<P>
   Karaha said on Friday that the dialogue meant that the parties
would agree ``by consensus'' on a ``new presidency, new government
and new institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is what we agreed on with Kabila's representative in
Lusaka,'' he said, suggesting that only a new political arrangement
and a new Congolese army could bring stability to Congo. Whether
Kabila will agree to any such arrangement seems open to doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The accord calls for the deployment of U.N. peacekeepers after
120 days, the disarmament of armed groups in 120 days and the
withdrawal of all foreign troops in 180 days, subject to a
``definite schedule'' for those withdrawals to be drawn up by the
joint military commission.

GOP IS BECOMING MORE AGGRESSIVE ON TAX REDUCTION

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After nearly two decades in which their desire for
big tax cuts was overwhelmed by efforts to eliminate the federal
budget deficit, Republicans in Congress will begin this week to
debate the largest and most broadly distributed tax reduction since
1981.
</P>
<P>
   They will have to overcome opposition from President Clinton and
most Democrats in Congress, as well as indifference among voters,
who consistently rank tax cuts below issues like improving
education and shoring up Social Security when asked about their
priorities. The specifics of the emerging Republican proposals are
the opening gambits in what will be months of partisan maneuvering
over taxes, and the debate promises to present both parties with
difficult choices about whether to compromise or fight it out on
the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   But new projections, however speculative, showing that budget
surpluses will grow faster than anticipated have energized
advocates of big tax cuts and heightened the long-running
ideological debate over the size and influence of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of his party's revived assertiveness on the issue, the
chief Republican tax writer in the House, Rep. Bill Archer of
Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, announced
Saturday that the centerpiece of his bill will be a measure
Democrats thought they had headed off: a reduction of 10 percent in
all personal income tax rates. His committee is expected to vote on
the package this week.
</P>
<P>
   The change, which would be phased in gradually over 10 years,
would cost roughly $400 billion in that period, nearly half the
$864 billion in tax cuts that Archer intends to include in his
bill. Among the bill's other features is a reduction in the capital
gains tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Archer plan, which would bring the current 15 percent tax
bracket down to 13.5 percent, the 28 percent bracket to 25.2
percent and the top 39.6 percent bracket to 35.6 percent, is
anathema to liberals, who say it favors the wealthy who need it
least. But such a reduction is a long-held goal of conservatives,
who say it does nothing more than give the biggest tax cuts to
those who pay the most taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Archer's proposal further hardened positions on both sides.
White House officials and congressional Democrats say the growing
budget surpluses presents an opportunity to prepare for long-term
challenges like the aging of the population while paying off the
national debt and investing prudently in areas like education and
health care. A big tax cut, they said, would not only endanger
those objectives, but risk plunging the nation back into a morass
of budget deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say they too are all for improving education and
dealing with social issues. But they say there is so much money on
the table that the only way to prevent Washington from spending it
on ever-expanding entitlements, additional bureaucracy and
pork-barrel projects is to send as much of it as possible back to
taxpayers, who can use it more productively than the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason for this surplus is because taxpayers are
paying too much, which is why they deserve a refund,'' Archer said.
``And if we don't cut taxes now and the money stays in Washington,
the politicians will surely spend it. Republicans are determined to
protect taxpayers who ultimately get stuck with the bills.''
</P>
<P>
   The very magnitude of the projected surpluses suggests there is
room for compromise. But for now, both sides are gearing up for
several months of all-out partisan warfare, starting with a vote on
Tuesday or Wednesday in the Ways and Means Committee on Archer's
bill.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials say Clinton is not against tax cuts,
noting that he has already put down a bid in the form of his
proposal for $250 billion in tax breaks over the next decade
intended to spur more retirement savings among low- and
middle-income families.
</P>
<P>
   They said, however, that he would stick to his strategy of
demanding that any tax cuts await the resolution of efforts to
shore up Social Security and Medicare, both of which face financial
problems in coming decades as the baby boom generation grows old.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House is now adding another argument to its case.
Administration officials said the surplus estimates being relied on
by Republicans were predicated on domestic spending being held to
levels that were politically unrealistic and that would require
deep cuts in everything from law enforcement to Head Start over the
next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, White House officials said, the surplus projections
have been exaggerated by a technical factor. The portion of the
surplus that both parties agree is up for grabs, the part generated
by general tax revenues rather than payroll tax receipts that are
nominally earmarked for Social Security, is $996 billion over the
next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
   But the $996 billion figure assumes that all of the surplus goes
to paying down the national debt, thereby reducing interest costs
to the government. To the degree that the money is used for tax
cuts or anything else, interest costs will be higher than assumed,
reducing the size of the surplus _ by $179 billion over 10 years,
according to an estimate by the administration. That means, in the
administration's view, that an $864 billion tax cut would return
the government to a deficit a decade from now _ a conclusion that
Republicans, who use slightly different numbers, dispute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The path we've laid out is a balanced allocation of the
surplus,'' said Jacob J. Lew, the director of the White House's
Office of Management and Budget, previewing a line of attack
administration officials plan to employ in coming days and weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go down the other route and put everything into a tax
cut, sucking up all the dollars, it leaves you either with
devastating cuts to programs that would be impossible to deliver on
because they'd be unacceptable to the American people, or you'd end
up with deficits,'' Lew said.
</P>
<P>
   Having just recovered from the deficits created in part by the
Reagan-era tax cuts and the agonizing choices they forced upon the
nation, Lew said, the country should resist again going down a
tax-cutting road ``that's very difficult to turn back on.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The tax-cutting packages presented in pieces over the last few
days by Archer and his counterpart in the Senate, William V. Roth
Jr., R-Del., who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, are
opening gambits in what is likely to be months of maneuvering over
the nation's priorities as it shifts into an era of fiscal plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Roth's proposal is slightly smaller than Archer's, at no more
than $792 billion over 10 years, and it specifically leaves room to
deal with one of Clinton's priorities, adding prescription drug
coverage to the Medicare system of health insurance for the
elderly.
</P>
<P>
   But both versions are chock-a-block with proposals that have
been little more than pipe dreams for Republicans in recent years,
from eliminating the tax on estates to reversing the quirk in the
tax code that penalizes many married couples.
</P>
<P>
   While Republicans expect that neither version will make it into
law intact, given Clinton's opposition, they are hopeful that some
of the ideas could be included in any compromise.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The outcome of the sparring over taxes will go a long way toward
determining how the parties address a variety of related issues,
from Social Security and Medicare to breaking a logjam in Congress
over next year's spending bills. And with Republicans and Democrats
alike torn over whether confrontation or compromise will play
better with voters, it will shape their strategies as they head
into the 2000 election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of both parties in the House would prefer fighting
it out over fiscal policy on the campaign trail rather than cutting
a deal, judging that staking out a clear ideological position will
help them as Democrats fight to wrest control of the chamber from
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to solidify Republican support for a bill they
can campaign on, based on the fact that they know this bill will be
so irresponsible that the president will be forced to veto it,''
said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, the senior Democrat on the
Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is more complicated in the Senate. There, moderate
Democrats are open to a substantial tax cut, and Republicans are
trying to make it easier for them. The plan introduced by Roth on
Friday was built around a middle-class tax cut far more palatable
to Democrats than the approach taken by Archer in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Some Senate Democrats also see an opportunity to neutralize tax
cuts as a political issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats have largely captured the education and
environmental issues, and have an expanding advantage on guns and
abortion,'' said Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., who
co-sponsored a bipartisan $345 billion tax cut proposal earlier
this year. ``There is no reason for us to lose on the tax issue.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The most critical factor may prove to be Clinton's calculation
about which way to go.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 he brokered a bipartisan compromise that gave the
Republicans a tax cut while protecting Democratic spending
priorities. In 1995 the president played a partisan standoff on the
budget to his advantage, reasserting his authority and invigorating
his party after its defeat in the 1994 midterm elections. This time
around he has reasons to go both ways.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Republicans believe that failure to press their
tax-cutting agenda as far as possible could accelerate the slide in
their electoral fortunes since 1994 by alienating the conservative
base that handed them control of Congress. Indeed, tax cuts are
almost as much a moral issue for Republicans as an economic issue.
</P>
<P>
   A high tax burden, Roth said Saturday in delivering the weekly
Republican national radio address, ``undermines the fundamental
values that dictate that you _ the individuals and families who
worked to create this economic expansion _ should be able to use
this surplus for you and your loved ones.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Low humidity will cover a large area from the northern Plains to
the Northeastern states as a sprawling zone of high pressure
strengthens over the Midwest. Sunshine will be plentiful in most
areas, but a jet stream disturbance will bring variable clouds and
a few mountain showers to northern New England. Daytime
temperatures will be within a few degrees of seasonal values across
these regions. Overnight, clear skies and light winds will promote
rapid dissipation of the daytime warmth. As a result, pre-dawn
temperatures will average 6 to 12 degrees below normal.
</P>
<P>
   A stalled front, marking the transition zone between sultry
conditions over the Gulf of Mexico states and the much less humid
air to the north, will be the focus for abundant clouds and
numerous thundershowers. Local flooding rains will occur,
especially in portions of the Tennessee Valley and southern
Appalachians where recurrent thundershowers pass over the same
areas. Variable clouds and sunshine will occur near the Gulf of
Mexico coast, but scattered thunderstorms will form in the heat of
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The Southwest will stay unsettled as moist air continues to be
drawn into the region by high-level winds from the southeast.
Afternoon thundershowers will erupt over many mountain peaks from
the southern Rockies to the southern Sierra. Weak winds around
20,000 feet will result in slow-moving thunderstorms heightening
the risk of flash flooding. Meanwhile, most of the Northwest will
be sunny and hot.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Lightning Detection
</P>
<P>
   Bolts of lightning can often appear to strike randomly. But
networks of lightning detectors suggest patterns that may help
forecasters predict the growth of thunderstorms. Conventional radar
tracks storms by detecting microwave radiation reflected by
precipitation. The heavy rain and hail in strong storms reflect
more radiation. Lightning detectors show that the greatest
electrical activity in a storm often precedes the heaviest
precipitation by about 15 minutes. Thus, detection of increasing
number of lightning bolts may be used to predict the sudden growth
of a thunderstorm.

EDITORIAL: THE BURDEN OF INEVITABILITY  
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, July 11:
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bradley is having an enviable political moment. His race
for the presidency no longer seems as quixotic or self-indulgent as
it did only a few months ago. The former senator and basketball
star suddenly has status, which in today's politics translates as
the hefty $11 million now simmering in his campaign treasury. Thus,
the political class, including democratic donors and journalistic
commentators, is sniffing an unexpected contest, and giving this
underdog his break. Added weight is allotted to his earnest words
and even what once may have sounded deadly dull has now been
labeled refreshing and unpackaged.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all for Bradley, he is not doing so well as to be
pronounced the front-runner. That dangerous position has been
inherited by Vice President Al Gore, who seems to be under attack
even by people who say they admire him, really, as a nice and smart
person who could have invented the Internet, even if he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Being out front, at this stage, means that success is already
discounted and any failure or even confusion is a sign of doom. The
first nick in Gore's campaign was delivered by Bill Clinton, with
his famous commentary about the weaknesses of the Gore operation.
That set off a debilitating debate that neither man seems able to
extinguish. There have also been reports of tension between the two
over Gore's sudden criticism of Clinton's conduct in the Lewinsky
affair. Whether there is real tension or simply a calculated
separation strategy, the impact has been damaging to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   This White House melodrama is only one of the irritants at the
Gore campaign headquarters in Washington. Across the country, the
campaign of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for the Republican
nomination has won the donor Lotto, amassing more than $36 million
in four months. Bush, whose charm has already taken on legendary
proportions, also strayed into Hollywood recently, drawing rave
reviews from some of the very movie stars who provided both glitter
and real gold to Democratic presidential campaigns in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a fairly hefty lead in the polls for the nomination,
Gore has been facing the kind of campaign staff turmoil that
activates Washington's political salons, where the talk is that
there is something close to panic reigning at Gore central. The
change that has brought the vice president the most deserved
criticism is the addition of Carter Eskew to help with media
matters. Eskew is a talented image maker, but he is well known as
the architect of the tobacco-industry campaign for a better deal
from Congress in recent years. His tobacco credentials would seem
to be at odds with Gore's heart-wrenching story at the Democratic
convention in 1996 about how his sister died of cancer from
smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Front-runners, of course, usually survive such perils on the way
to the nomination _ Bob Dole and Walter Mondale come to mind. But
the wounds of a rough primary season can prove costly in the
general election. Jimmy Carter never fully recovered from Ted
Kennedy's primary challenge in 1980. Gore has particular reason to
worry because Bradley is hardly an electrifying figure and few
people expected he would present a serious threat to the vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential politics, a civic exercise that thrives on
unpredictability, is once again providing its little surprises. The
Republican race was supposed to be the busy one, the Democratic
side a done deal. Now, it appears the scripts have shifted, as Gore
looks for his footing outside Bill Clinton's White House.

EDITORIAL: A NEED FOR FOREIGN AID 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, July 11:
</P>
<P>
   For a nation of America's wealth, providing aid to alleviate
misery in the poorest countries is a worthy cause. But foreign aid
is also important to protect U.S. interests. Assistance that helps
prevent foreign political conflicts or economic calamities can
reduce the need for far more costly future U.S. involvement.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has ignored this rule, and is once again embarked on an
effort to slash foreign aid. Such assistance, which pays for
everything from military training for U.S. allies to disaster
relief, already makes up less than 1 percent of the federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   Spending on aid has dropped by more than 50 percent in
inflation-adjusted dollars since 1985. The Senate last month
approved a foreign operations appropriation for 2000 that is $800
million less than this year's $13.5 billion total, and $1.9 billion
less than President Clinton's request. The House appropriation is
expected to be even lower.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has justifiably threatened to veto
the appropriations bill unless money is added to pay for programs
to dismantle nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union and to
support the Wye River peace agreement between Israel and the
Palestinians, as well as to restore cuts to dozens of other
programs, including the Peace Corps. The White House also strongly
opposes language in the spending bill that could limit the
administration's options in managing the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Critics often point to past failures. During the Cold War aid
was doled out to corrupt anti-Communist regimes that did nothing to
improve the conditions of the poor. But aid can be effective in
relieving poverty if it is used to strengthen civil society and
nurture reform. The Clinton administration has tried to put money
into programs that promote democracy-building, community-based
economic development and local initiatives on environmental
protection and health care.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half of the current aid budget supports military or
security-related objectives, and is likely to stay that way. Israel
and Egypt alone now get about 40 percent of the total. A modest
share of the budget is spent on refugee and emergency aid. Only
about a third of the budget goes to traditional development
activities running the gamut from child immunizations to
microcredit programs. Development programs with long-term promise
tend to suffer the cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Development experts have become smarter about how to use aid to
improve economic and social institutions. The World Bank recently
reported that an extra $10 billion in aid annually could lift 25
million people out of poverty if the money was directed to
countries with sound fiscal policies and a healthy public sector.
While more countries are meeting these criteria, total development
assistance worldwide from industrialized nations has dropped by
one-third since 1991, with Washington leading that decline. The
trend is tragic given how much needs to be done to help the more
than 1 billion people in extreme poverty who live on less than $1 a
day. The Clinton administration's goals for foreign aid are not
particularly ambitious. But Congress' effort to trim back the
meager funds is a shortsighted national shame.

SPORTS COLUMN: SPORTS AND SEX ARE ALWAYS TOGETHER
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another time, I pitched a proposal on the sexual implications
of sports to a magazine called Eros. The rejection letter came
swiftly; the editor said there were no such implications because,
as any fool could see, sports was pure sex in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   At the time (this was before two Yankees pitchers switched
wives), I thought he overstated the situation. But now I'm
wondering if he was on to something. At the least, sex has sold
sports as subliminally as it has sold cars and beers, which in turn
are sold by sports.
</P>
<P>
   More directly, if you start in this century with the promotion
of the hypermasculine Babe Ruth and go on through the sexually
ambiguous Babe Didrikson, the current selling of the American World
Cup team as the babes of soccer seems like a logical arc.
</P>
<P>
   Sexuality may be so intrinsic to sports that unless the audience
is sexually comfortable, the game just won't sell.
</P>
<P>
   This doesn't mean that the players have to be sexually alluring.
It just means that they can't be threatening. A lovely lesbian may
be bad for business if you are pushing a traditional family
package. Forget a gay man. Meanwhile, a female shot-putter who uses
steroids that give her manly muscles and a mustache may so
reinforce gender stereotypes that she threatens only her drug-free
competitors. And the same goes for a wife-beating linebacker who
feels whole only in the midst of a 'roid rage.
</P>
<P>
   There is a wonderful midland Babbittry to the selling of the
World Cup team. The enthusiastic complicity of the players evokes
the car washes and bake sales that many of them once ran to raise
money for their youth traveling teams. They are on a mission, for
their sport and for themselves, and if that means a little
cheesecake (or a lot in at least one case), sacrifice is the name
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The implications here are not that the players are sexually
available, but that they are ``normal,'' that they are proper role
models for all the girls who will buy shoes and gear (and
eventually cosmetics that won't run or cake late in the match?).
For the World Cup team to crack into the male-dominated
merchandising mart as a group and as individuals, they must dispel
the aura of homosexuality that was hung on women's athleticism as a
way of stifling their emerging physical and political power.
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, a Faustian bargain here. Women's tennis had
to sell cigarettes to survive; let another generation decide how
many lung cancer casualties were worth that important cultural
victory. Also, there is a betrayal of all the lesbians whose
enormous contributions to many sports should not be forgotten in
the hetero happy hours where soccer babes entertain potential
sponsors; the so-called ``meet the shooters at your local Hooters''
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   All this bubbles up in the same season that 18-year-old
Alexandra Stevenson, who may be the future of tennis as well as of
interracial relations, wowed us by becoming not only the first
female qualifier to reach the semifinals at Wimbledon but also the
first whose father was a legendary basketball player. After a
Florida newspaper printed Alexandra's birth certificate, Julius
Erving issued a statement acknowledging paternity.
</P>
<P>
   OK, Editor Eros, there must have been sex here, too. And,
naturally, there were agitated, if not hysterical reactions. There
was justifiable concern that Erving's relationship with Samantha
Stevenson, a pioneering sportswriter whose work has appeared in The
New York Times, would be used as evidence against women's access to
male games. There is no question that sleeping with a subject is
unethical, a conflict of interest, although it seems healthier, at
least more human, than many of the relationships between dominating
male sports figures and sycophantic male sportswriters and
broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   It was these sycophants, more than athletes and coaches, who
fought hardest to keep women out of press boxes, much less locker
rooms. They were afraid that women would adulterate their
testosterone moments, the mutual masculinity they fantasized in
their same-sex access. Tell me there isn't sex in all this, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, well, having lusted in vain for Billie Jean King in the late
'60s, I can take no moral high ground here. People who live in
glass columns should probably not even turn over stones, much less
throw them. And like any healthy sports fan of any gender or sexual
orientation, I say the more flesh the better. What do you think
male or female basketball, volleyball and ice skating are about? If
the World Cup soccer babes are hot, let another generation worry
about their impact on the sporting ozone layer.
</P>
<P>
   It's progress. Eros magazine went out of business years ago,
probably done in by Sports Illustrated. &QL;

 ANGUS MACDONALD DIES AT 60; WAS SCOTTISH BAGPIPER OF NOTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Angus MacDonald, whose verve and virtuosity made him one of the
world's best and best-known bagpipe players, died on June 25 in a
hospice in Edinburgh, Scotland, where he lived. He was 60.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, said a friend and fellow
professional bagpiper, Donald McBride of Edinburgh.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald served in the Scots Guards, a military unit in the
British army, for 30 years and held the rank of pipe major. He also
spent several years as the personal piper to Queen Elizabeth II and
won numerous major piping awards, including the Clasp and the Gold
Medal, both of which are sponsored by the Highland Society of
London.
</P>
<P>
   ``He probably was one of the best this century in light music _
dance and marching pipe music,'' said Paula Glendinning of Ashton,
Md., a former student of MacDonald's who is now the editor of The
Voice, a bagpipe magazine in Baltimore. She said he also won awards
for his classical music composed for the Scottish Highland
bagpipes, called piobaireachd.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald was influential as a teacher, too, giving instruction
and performances in many nations. Indeed, few people have become so
identified with the bagpipe, one of the oldest instruments known to
man, dating back to the Middle East 4,000 years ago. The instrument
played today _ inimitable with its combination of shrillness backed
by a deep bass line _ is about 300 years old.
</P>
<P>
   ``He traveled all over the world, and that's why he is so well
known,'' Ms. Glendinning said.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Cameron Highlander, MacDonald was born on Oct. 20,
1938, in Glasgow, Scotland. He discovered his passion for bagpipes
in the pipe band at the Queen Victoria School in Dunblane and rose
to the position of boy pipe major.
</P>
<P>
   He left school at 15 and joined the Scots Guards in 1953 as a
piper. He rose through the ranks and in 1965 became pipe major and
household piper to the Queen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, MacDonald was reassigned to the Guards Depot piping
school at Pirbright. Four years later, he joined the Scots Guards
recruiting team, where he became something of a pied piper with his
performances. He later served as senior instructor at the Army
School of Piping and piper to the governor of Edinburgh Castle. He
became a member of the Order of the British Empire in 1983, the
same year he retired.
</P>
<P>
   After his retirement from the military, MacDonald taught at the
Piping Center in Glasgow, the world's foremost piping institution.
He also traveled, training pipers from Northern Ireland to Oman to
Malaysia. And he performed in many countries, including the United
States, where he had a large following.
</P>
<P>
   Besides winning the Clasp and the Gold Medal, MacDonald won
several other bagpipe awards. including victories in the Grant's
Scotch Whisky Championship at Blair Castle.
</P>
<P>
   MacDonald is survived by his daughter, Fiona MacDonald of
London.
</P>
<P>
   In a forward to the 1993 reprint of the 1927 book ``The Piper in
Peace and War'' by C.A. Malcolm, MacDonald said of Scottish
regimental pipers: ``They have been, and still are, some of the
best ambassadors this country has.''

MICHAEL K. HOOKER, CHANCELLOR, UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.C., Md., Va., Mass., Vt.)  (js) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael K. Hooker, the chancellor of the University of North
Carolina who took a high-technology, community-oriented approach to
higher education, died on June 29 at UNC Hospitals. He was 53 and
lived in Chapel Hill, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, the
university said.
</P>
<P>
   Taking up the reins at his alma mater in 1995 as its eighth
chancellor, Hooker made computer literacy and close ties to North
Carolina's citizenry the hallmarks of his administration. He
promoted an initiative to require all freshmen to have laptop
computers for their academic work next year, as well as a pledge to
insure that the university serve the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is only one reason to have a public university, and that
is to serve the people of the state,'' Hooker stated as his creed.
``That should be the touchstone of everything we do: whether it's
in the interest of North Carolina and our citizens.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Hooker, the school of education's Web site offered free
links to public school systems in the state. Teachers and educators
from all of North Carolina's 117 school districts were trained on
the site to use its database of lesson plans.
</P>
<P>
   Under his guidance, Internet-based courses were introduced at
the undergraduate and graduate levels to make the university more
accessible to state residents.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kenneth Hooker was born in Richlands, Va., the son of a
coal miner, and was the first of his family to graduate from
college. He received a master's degree in 1972 and a doctorate in
philosophy in 1973 from the University of Massachusetts, and then
started teaching at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   Hooker went to Johns Hopkins University as an assistant
professor in philosophy in 1975 and successively served as
assistant dean, associate dean and dean until 1982, when he was
named president of Bennington College. He was president of the
University of Maryland at Baltimore County from 1986 to 1992, and
president of the University of Massachusetts system from 1992 until
his return to Chapel Hill three years later.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote scholarly articles on medical ethics and edited
``Descartes: Critical and Interpretive Essays'' (1978) and
``Leibniz: Critical and Interpretive Essays'' (1982).
</P>
<P>
   Hooker's marriage to Anna Hostettler Burns of Baltimore ended in
divorce. He is survived by his wife, Carmen; a daughter from his
earlier marriage, Alexandra Hooker of Baltimore; his mother,
Christine Hooker of Roanoke, Va., and his wife's two daughters,
Jennifer and Cyndi Buell of Charlotte, N.C.

 &HT;    Fame's a monster at Fenway
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ No one can deny that Boston Red Sox shortstop Nomar
Garciaparra inspires devotion among his fans.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two months, a computer hacker tried to cast nearly
40,000 All-Star votes for the former Georgia Tech star via the
Internet. Major League Baseball caught on and threw out the votes,
but Garciaparra didn't need the extra help to win the fan balloting
over the New York Yankees' Derek Jeter.
</P>
<P>
   But while an overzealous fan in cyberspace is one thing, people
invading his personal space is another matter entirely. Before
Friday's game against the Atlanta Braves _ the seventh game
Garciaparra has missed because of a groin injury _ he talked about
the perils of popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People do crazy things,'' said Garciaparra, 25, the 1997
American League Rookie of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Is that flattering or scary?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I find it flattering when people are bum-rushing us at the
hotel for an autograph and your clothes are all marked up?'' he
asked. ``Am I scared because I have no safety and security, or is
it flattering because people want (his autograph)? People are going
to look at it any which way. I look at it (this way): I just ruined
a $200 shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Garciaparra, sipping a sports drink at his locker,
turned serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not fun when you get followed home,'' he said. ``They're
running through red lights and cutting off people to get to you.
(I'm thinking) how am I going to get out of this one?''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra said he's been followed twice from Fenway Park, once
last year and once this year. He finally evaded his stalkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go home,'' he said. ``I drive around the city looking
for police.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra said he feels bad when fans go to such extremes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ruins it for the people who just want the honor of shaking
a person's hand,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that he still goes to restaurants in Boston's North
End.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still do my thing,'' he said. ``I don't see myself as a
celebrity. I'm not any more special than anybody. I just happen to
be on TV and play at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in Boston are great to me. It takes two seconds to
say hi to somebody and shake their hand. As long as they're not
disrespectful, I'm going to give them the same respect back.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra has gone so far as to lecture an adult who pushed a
little kid out of the way to get an autograph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `You think you're more important than this little kid
smiling?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra made a lot of kids smile Friday when he popped into
a baseball camp at Georgia Tech to visit his former coaches. ``That
was fun,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The work began when he arrived at Turner Field. He ran a few
sprints and tested his agility.
</P>
<P>
   The groin injury, Garciaparra said, ``Felt good today, better
than it did (the day before). If I have another good day tomorrow,
we'll go from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra injured himself in Baltimore running out a triple in
the ninth inning and missed two games. He returned to the lineup,
then aggravated the injury July 2 in Chicago going from first to
third.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes to play, and he only goes at one speed,'' said Red
Sox manager Jimy Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra was putting up exceptional numbers dueling Jeter and
Seattle's Alex Rodriguez for the All-Star starting position when
the injury struck.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Garciaparra batted .394 with four home runs, two
triples, 12 doubles and 16 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know my numbers,'' he said. ``I don't want to know
them. I don't pay attention to them. Numbers are irrelevant to me.
I just know the team's playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra will try to build on a 17-game hitting streak when
he returns to action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very annoying,'' he said of sitting out, ``regardless of
the year I'm having. I just don't like sitting around watching the
game. When I know I can play and they're giving me a day off,
that's fine. When I can't play due to something physically holding
me back, I can't stand it. I hate it. It drives me crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not sure if he'll be able to play Tuesday in the All-Star
Game, but that doesn't grate on him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now that's not on my mind,'' he said. ``I'm more
concerned with getting out there and playing. And winning.''
</P>
<P>
   This will be Garciaparra's second All-Star Game. As a rookie in
1997, he had one at-bat and flied out to right field. He also won
the Home Run Derby for rookies and thoroughly enjoyed himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my attitude toward the All-Star Game is different,''
he said. ``I don't play for them, I don't care about them. I play
with All-Stars every day. You're in the highest level in the world,
and you have to still separate that more. Are you kidding me?''
</P>
<P>
   Garciaparra realizes that his achievements may not be separated
from Jeter and Rodriguez for another decade. He says it's an honor
to be mentioned in the same sentence with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good time to play baseball,'' Garciaparra said. ``I
think it's an even better time to be a fan.''
</P>
<P>
   A respectful fan.

 &HT;    Small Georgia town honors a favorite son
 &HT;    By Guy Curtright
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Ga. _ Jackie Robinson was just a toddler when his mother
took the family to California in search of a better life and he
returned to his southwest Georgia birthplace only once.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles Copeland, 91, hasn't forgotten that day nearly 50
years ago or the pride he and everyone else in Cairo's black
community felt.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson _ the man who smashed the color barrier in baseball and
brought hope to so many people _ was returning to his roots.
</P>
<P>
   It was Jackie Robinson Day and thousands turned out in
mid-October 1949 for a parade through Cairo in honor of the
Brooklyn standout.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was Robinson in town, but so were Dodgers teammates Roy
Campanella and Don Newcombe, plus Larry Doby, the first black
player in the American League.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about the biggest thing to ever happen here,'' said
Copeland, a retired school principal. ``Everyone was so proud of
Jackie. You didn't have to be a baseball fan to appreciate what he
had done. Young people today don't really understand.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why Dr. Linda Walden, the only black physician in Grady
County, is determined to keep Robinson's legacy alive in Cairo _ an
agricultural center of about 9,000 residents near the Florida line
that is known for its cane syrup and okra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie showed that, no matter how humble your beginnings or
how big the obstacles, you can make a difference if you have the
dream and get the opportunity,'' said Walden, a cousin of Robinson.
``That lesson is as important today as it was 50 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Walden is founder and president of the Jackie Robinson Cairo
Memorial Institute Inc. The nonprofit organization is raising funds
to built a culture and recreation center in Robinson's honor. The
facility would include a small museum and a bronze statue of
Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The target date for groundbreaking is early next year, perhaps
Jan. 31 _ Robinson's birthday. But fund-raising has been slow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the rural South, and things don't move fast,'' said
Walden, who grew up in Florida but returned to Cairo to open a
family practice in 1996. ``But honoring Jackie has been too long in
coming. He is an icon, and his legacy needs to be preserved. That
he was born in the sticks of South Georgia is very much a part of
his story. It shows where he came from and what he had to
overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, Cairo made little note of Robinson. But in 1996 the
baseball field for the Cairo High School Syrupmakers was renamed in
honor of Robinson. Then in 1997 _ the 50th anniversary of Robinson
joining the Dodgers _ a 10-mile stretch of Ga. 93 became Jackie
Robinson Memorial Highway. A wall of fame at the Roddenbery
Memorial Library features photos of Robinson and his brother, Mack,
a 1936 Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, a state historical marker should be in place to
mark where Robinson was born in 1919, off Hadley Ferry Road in the
Rocky Hill community, near Beachton and south of Cairo. The house
burned years ago, and only one of the two chimneys remains.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Roosevelt Robinson was the youngest of five children born
to Mallie McGriff Robinson. Husband Jerry, a sharecropper on the
Sasser Plantation, deserted the family shortly after Jackie was
born. In May 1920, when Jackie was about 16 months old, Mallie
Robinson and her children boarded a westbound train about midnight
and headed for Pasadena, Calif., where a brother lived.
</P>
<P>
   Mallie Robinson returned to Cairo occasionally to visit a
sister, but Jackie did not come back for nearly 30 years. Grady
County _ about one-third black _ remained segregated, but by then
Robinson was a national hero.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn had just played the New York Yankees in the World
Series, and the Jackie Robinson All-Stars were beginning a
barnstorming trip. One game was in Atlanta, where a record 25,221
overflowed Ponce de Leon Park for an exhibition game the preceding
spring between the Dodgers and the Atlanta Crackers.
</P>
<P>
   The barnstorming tour had to be cut short, but not until after
Robinson drove to Cairo with Campanella, Newcombe and Doby for a
day in his honor.
</P>
<P>
   Newcombe, now director of community relations for the Dodgers,
still remembers the turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cairo isn't a very big place, but the streets were packed,''
said Newcombe, Rookie of the Year in 1949. ``They had a big parade,
and everybody turned out.''
</P>
<P>
   A collection was taken up for Robinson, but he declined the
monetary gift, instead asking for a country-cured ham. When he got
back to New York, however, his California-reared wife, Rachel,
looked at the salt and mold on the ham and threw it away; she
thought it was spoiled.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit to Atlanta several years ago, Rachel Robinson
said her late husband was deeply touched by his reception in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said there were so many people who walked in from the
countryside to see him,'' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Robinson had gone home.
</P>

 &HT;    CARE packages hope, help in Kosovo
 &HT;    By Keith Graham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Kosovo _ Marshall Burke's workday is already more than
15 hours old.
</P>
<P>
   It began with a trip to Cegrane, a refugee camp in Macedonia,
where he talked with farmers agonizing over their return to the
ruined villages of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   It is ending with a conversation with a journalist at a run-down
hotel in Skopje, Macedonia's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Burke has spent the past 14 years with CARE, often traveling
from crisis to crisis around the world. Yet he is far from jaded.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is exhausted and sticky with sweat, he talks about
the people he has met that day:
</P>
<P>
   _ A farmer angry because his barn has been destroyed by Serb
paramilitaries and worried about how he will feed his family with
no crop to harvest.
</P>
<P>
   _ A refugee mother so stressed out she cannot produce milk for
her baby.
</P>
<P>
   _ A cardiologist who was forced from his home and now is trying
to make ends meet by driving a truck for a relief agency.
</P>
<P>
   Burke wonders: How do you make those people real? How do you
bring their feelings to life for people back home in America?
</P>
<P>
   Burke still is touched by the stories of individuals.
Ultimately, he believes, the hope brought to them by the CARE
staffers now fanning out across Kosovo, Macedonia and Albania is
what the relief and development agency is all about.
</P>
<P>
   But Burke _ a 49-year-old north Atlanta resident who once ran a
bar in Tucson, Ariz. _ is also a big-picture man.
</P>
<P>
   Now the executive director for development in the Southeast for
Atlanta-based CARE USA, Burke earned a Ph.D. in desert ecology
before he owned a bar. In his spare time, he started a nonprofit
organization in Tucson to help people with AIDS. He has spent much
of his career with CARE teaching people better agricultural methods
and ways to use natural resources without destroying the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   He takes pride in the fact that the organization he works for is
one of the world's largest private international development and
relief agencies.
</P>
<P>
   CARE, he says, springs into action for emergencies like the war
that sent hundreds of thousands of refugees fleeing from Kosovo.
Its workers do ``some of the dirtiest, most difficult and dangerous
jobs'' in crisis-ridden countries, not only here in the Balkans,
but in Africa, Asia and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   But, while some CARE workers are responding to the emergencies,
others keep working steadily in more than 60 countries helping
people learn to read, dig wells or improve their health.
</P>
<P>
   The agency began by dispensing the CARE packages that helped
rebuild Europe following World War II. Unfortunately, Burke says,
many Americans have paid little attention since.
</P>
<P>
   Even in Atlanta, he has seen the blank stares when he talks
about his work _ until he says, ``You know, the CARE package.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my great dreams,'' Burke says, ``is that if CARE should
say it was going to leave Atlanta there would be as much hue and
cry as there would be if the Braves were to say they were
leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   Seen through the eyes of Marshall Burke, CARE is a beautiful
sight. Through the eyes of Inose Tatsuya, it is not so pretty, at
least at this moment.
</P>
<P>
   Near the U.S. military command post in the Kosovo town called
Urosevac by the Serbs and Ferizaj by ethnic Albanians, Tatsuya and
a Japanese television crew are waiting for a CARE team scheduled to
assess damage in the devastated village of Kacanik.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the team is already a half-hour late for the
trip's start, and Tatsuya is worried he won't get the footage he
needs. ``They change their plans all the time,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Three CARE staffers finally arrive, but before going to Kacanik
there are detours: A satellite phone is set up for a call. The CARE
team has to go to a warehouse where food is being unloaded. There
is a break for lunch.
</P>
<P>
   Then, more than two hours after the Kacanik survey was to begin,
the apologetic CARE driver announces he is low on fuel and needs to
return across the border into Macedonia to fill the tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delays, delays, delays,'' says Fatos Bajinovci, an ethnic
Albanian who witnesses the scene.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes sometimes, says Wendy Driscoll, a Nairobi-based
spokeswoman for CARE temporarily assigned to the Balkans. ``A lot
of your time is hurry up and wait.''
</P>
<P>
   Assignments for staffers are often in flux. CARE must coordinate
its work with other humanitarian agencies and local authorities.
There are concerns about the security of staffers in an area
riddled with land mines and still torn by violence. Vehicles and
fuel are in short supply, and communication with staffers in the
field can be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the border with Macedonia, a team of CARE workers is
operating a way station for refugees returning to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are giving food packets,'' says Agron Destani, 24, an
ethnic Albanian from Macedonia who had worked as an airport clerk
before joining CARE on a three-month contract. ``A lot of people
are crossing.''
</P>
<P>
   Refugees are given flour, meat spreads, jam, sardines, cheese,
pretzels, cooking oil and soap. In a single day, nearly 15,000
people get this kind of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Destani and the other CARE workers must fend
off Macedonian police officers who think they deserve bags of food.
A Macedonian soldier suddenly sprays water from a hose into the
hot, dusty site where the way station has been set up, turning it
into a sea of mud before the CARE staff can persuade him to stop.
Then a United Nations truck accidentally knocks down the lean-to
where the food is kept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day sort of presents a new challenge,'' says a
philosophical Kevin Romano, 25. From Washington, he had been
studying at the London School of Economics before coming to work
for CARE seven weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are bad days. There are good days,'' agrees Loic Cohen,
32, a Frenchman who worked for Action Against Hunger before joining
CARE. ``It's a bit messy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``CARE,'' one staff member jokes, ``is the Austrian way to spell
chaos.'' CARE workers, it seems, are people who like to go about
doing good _ especially if it involves a lot of going about.
</P>
<P>
   But, ultimately, there is a method in the madness.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans, Marshall Burke explains, ``We've had an
emergency for three months. We have not had time to catch our
breath.''
</P>
<P>
   The pace has been hectic. Before NATO began its airstrikes on
Yugoslavia, CARE had operated programs in Serbia, Kosovo and
Montenegro. That operation, based in offices in Belgrade and in
Pristina, Kosovo's capital, closed just before the NATO bombardment
began March 24. Three CARE workers did not make it out of
Yugoslavia. They were arrested and are still held on spying charges
CARE officials call absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as refugees began flooding from Kosovo into neighboring
Albania and Macedonia, CARE opened offices in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantan Marge Tsitouris, director of the emergency group for
CARE USA, was named interim emergency coordinator for the region
and shuttled back and forth between Albania and Macedonia with
files in her backpack.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the refugees started going over, we said we've got
refugees and we've got a job to do,'' the 22-year CARE veteran
explains.
</P>
<P>
   CARE Australia, which had spearheaded the Yugoslav operation,
led the new programs in Macedonia. Atlantan Bob MacPherson was
initially sent in as team leader in Albania, working with staff
members from CARE Canada and CARE Germany, but that assignment
ended when a car he was traveling in went over a cliff. With
MacPherson recovering in a hospital in Germany, CARE Canada took
over leadership in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Carsten Voelz, a German who is CARE's regional coordinator for
the Fier, Albania, area, says staff from Canada, Germany, France
and Norway, as well as the United States, have helped. ``This was
really a combined action,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It was also an action that produced new demands every day. Sites
had to be found for refugee camps: An old firing range, for
instance, became the site of the CARE-managed Stenkovec II camp not
far from the Kosovo border in Macedonia. The size of the camps
burgeoned. At Cegrane, another CARE camp in Macedonia adjacent to a
village of less than 5,000 people, the number of refugees swelled
to more than 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   CARE had to scramble to find enough tents to house them.
Latrines had to be built and cooking facilities set up. Because the
available sites were poor, drainage problems became a constant
battle.
</P>
<P>
   Staff had to be brought in from other countries or hired locally
to run the camps. And with the numbers of refugees mushrooming,
just figuring out how much food would be needed each day was an
enormous challenge _ not to mention how much babyfood and how many
diapers.
</P>
<P>
   In all, CARE managed five camps as well as an intake center and
a separate food distribution program in Albania and two camps in
Macedonia. At their peak, they housed 93,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Workers for CARE and other humanitarian agencies had already
begun planning _ and finding funds _ to house the refugees through
what promised to be a long war.
</P>
<P>
   Then, almost as swiftly as the refugees had left Kosovo, they
were returning to it on the heels of a peace-keeping force that was
pushing out the Yugoslav military and Serbian paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, the whole process began in reverse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've already had a war. Eight hundred thousand people have
left their country, and now 800,000 people are going back,'' says
Tsitouris, 59. ``You never got organized.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, CARE is getting organized. As the refugees pushed back into
Kosovo, so did CARE staff, many of them specialists with eyes
attuned to the needs of people returning to devastated lands.
</P>
<P>
   Some looked at housing, others at food and agriculture or
health. And, despite all the hurry-up-and-wait moments and the
changes of plans, they were bubbling with ideas by the time Burke
called a daylong session to exchange ideas.
</P>
<P>
   From that session and later ones about specific programs,
outlines of plans began to emerge _ plans sent back to the offices
of CARE USA and other CARE country headquarters and circulated
among donors. Some of the plans address the immediate emergencies;
others look further down the road to a time of real rebuilding.
</P>
<P>
   The most pressing problems include:
</P>
<P>
   _ Shelter: With as many as 70 percent to 80 percent of houses
burned in some villages, families may have time to refurbish only
one room before the cold Kosovo winter. In the Ferizaj area, Andrew
Gilmour, 35, a Canadian who is CARE's shelter coordinator, thinks
10,000 to 20,000 stoves may be needed. Doors, insulating materials,
windows and beds also are badly needed. Gilmour hopes no more than
eight people will have to share a room by winter.
</P>
<P>
   _ Food: Kosovo was never self-sufficient in food. Now many
farmers have no crop at all. CARE workers want to help get those
farms working again. Seed will be needed, and in some cases tools
must be supplied and machinery repaired. ``There's also a huge
demand for chickens,'' Burke says.
</P>
<P>
   _ Health: CARE has been operating mobile health clinics,
offering pediatric and gynecological treatment for refugees in
Macedonia and Albania. Those programs will shift to Kosovo, now.
The agency also will work to bring rural health clinics up to
standard. Much of the clinics' equipment is old; some of it has
been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   _ Land mines: No one really knows how many land mines have been
left behind by the Serbs, but CARE will attempt to remove as many
as possible and educate the public about the dangers.
</P>
<P>
   In another move to strengthen efforts in Kosovo, Beat Jakob
Rohr, a CARE USA staffer who previously headed CARE operations in
Peru, Mozambique, Kenya and Nicaragua, has been appointed to head
the Pristina office.
</P>
<P>
   The search is on to find new funding for these programs or shift
funds already in the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   With major donors, Burke says, ``I think CARE's reputation is
such that if you call and say you're from CARE you will get what
you need. That's true even when I call people I have never met and
probably never will.''
</P>
<P>
   Out in the field in Kosovo, a couple of hours drive away from
their office in Pristina, CARE workers Andrew Gilmour and Bob
MacPherson, on his first assignment since being released from the
hospital in Germany, are bouncing over rough roads. Gilmour has
just met with other humanitarian organizations to discuss Kosovo's
housing crisis. MacPherson and a consultant have been assessing
sites where land mines may lurk.
</P>
<P>
   In need of diesel for their four-wheel drive Toyota, they head
for one of the few functioning service stations in the area.
Villagers have assured Gilmour the diesel there is not watered down
as it is in most places.
</P>
<P>
   The tank filled, they return to the road. But, rounding a bend
past a burned out Yugoslav tank, they discover warning signs
erected by peacekeeping forces. Land mines are on both sides of the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Then the engine begins to whine, and the Toyota chugs to a halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Land mines on both sides of the road. Water in the gas tank,''
says MacPherson, 53, laughing. ``It doesn't get any better than
this.

 &HT;    The toughest track: Carnoustie
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ There will be no fluke champion this week
at the 128th British Open. The survivor at the formidable
Carnoustie Golf Links will have pushed his spikes through a gantlet
of diabolical rough, wind and relentless length.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the golf ball around Carnoustie will be tough even if
such mild conditions as those enjoyed by participants at Loch
Lomond remain in the area. However, if the more typical nasty stuff
swings in off the North Sea, anything is possible. Par could become
a fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever nature brings, one aspect will remain constant.
Carnoustie is a long, perilous golf course that should satisfy both
traditionalists and sadists.
</P>
<P>
   The first-round 64 that Colin Montgomerie produced at Carnoustie
in the first round of the 1995 Scottish Open _ ``7:10 a.m start,
flat calm,'' he recalled _ is a mark not likely to be touched this
week under a typically tough Open setup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll only realize what that was like when they get
there and find out that 64 is a bloody good score around there,''
Montgomerie said. ``And I wouldn't expect it to be beaten.... It's
playing very long. From the word go, it's just the most demanding
links course that we have, and it's great that it's back on the
Open rotation. It's been 24 years since we played there last (in
the British Open), and that's too long, really.''
</P>
<P>
   A break in the weather might be the only break available.
Carnoustie plays 7,361 yards to a par 71 with these four finishing
holes: par-4 15th, 472 yards; par-3 16th, 250 yards; par-4 17th,
459 yards; and par-4 18th, previously a par-5, 487 yards, with the
twisting Barry Burn 30 yards in front of the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the weather conditions are like they can be, it may make
Pinehurst look easy,'' David Duval said. ``The fairways tend to be
narrower than Pinehurst's were. You have grass that is seven feet
tall everywhere, and wind and rain.... It could be very difficult.
If it's blowing 30 (mph) every day, you could see an 8-over,
10-over type of winning score.''
</P>
<P>
   With winds blowing about 20 mph last weekend at the Western
Open, Tiger Woods called it ``wonderful preparation'' for
Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who reclaimed the world's No. 1 ranking with last
weekend's victory, played the course last week with Mark O'Meara
and friends. He found severe pot bunkers and Barry Burns that wind
through the course. Several downwind holes can produce birdies, but
just as many will require two stout shots to reach in regulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think Carnoustie is a strong player's course,'' Ernie
Els said. ``The winner will be a strong player, somebody who can
hit the ball in the wind, hit the driver strong and has a good
short game. It's not a short-hitter's golf course. You've got to
hit the golf ball there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the wind is blowing, Carnoustie is probably the toughest
course in Britain,'' said Michael Bonallack, secretary of the Royal
&AMP; Ancient Golf Club, which runs the tournament. ``And even when
it's not blowing, it's probably the toughest.''
</P>
<P>
   When Gary Player won there in 1968, he never broke 70. When
Woods played Carnoustie in 1995-96 in the Scottish Open, he hit
5-iron, 5-iron one day, then driver, driver the next on the
459-yard 17th. It's an understatement to say the wind is a factor.
</P>
<P>
   Why has it taken 24 years for a British Open to return to
Carnoustie? Some say it's because the Royal &AMP; Ancient did not wish
for its beloved St. Andrews to be upstaged by a track many think is
superior. The course also went through a down period of maintenance
in the 1980s, and until recently the hotel accommodations near the
site were inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   As for the difficulty that should promote daily moaning and
groaning among the players, Montgomerie said: ``Good. I hope it's
as tough as they bloody well can get it.

 &HT;    Handicapping the British Open
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   FIVE WHO CAN WIN:
</P>
<P>
   _ Tiger Woods: He should be the favorite, despite Scot Colin
Montgomerie's reputation around the place and Sergio Garcia's
Tigermania-like run through Europe. Having reclaimed his No. 1 spot
in the rankings from David Duval, Woods is enjoying his highest
confidence mark since winning the Masters in 1997. Woods has won
three of his last four events _ the Deustche Bank Open on the
European Tour, the Memorial and the Western _ and finished two
shots behind Payne Stewart at the U.S. Open. Woods played
Carnoustie as an amateur in the 1995 and 1996 Scottish Open.
</P>
<P>
   _ Colin Montgomerie: Holds the Carnoustie course record at 64,
which is mind-boggling, and will be the co-favorite, with Garcia,
among European fans. Hasn't enjoyed much success at his own Open _
missing the cut three of the past four years _ but senses a
potential comfort zone at Carnoustie.
</P>
<P>
   _ David Duval: Certainly he has the length and power to beat the
ball through the wind or out of the high grass. Tied for 11th last
year at Royal Birkdale. Has played Carnoustie in recent years for
fun, not in competition.
</P>
<P>
   _ Sergio Garcia: Has never played Carnoustie, but it might not
matter. ``El Nino'' can do very little wrong lately, winning his
first European Tour event, the Irish Open, then contending at Loch
Lomond.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ernie Els: Tied for second, behind Tom Lehman, in 1996 at
Royal Lytham. Long, strong, wide-based player who should be a great
fit for Carnoustie, even in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   FIVE WORTH A LOOK
</P>
<P>
   _ Payne Stewart: How can you not list him among the contenders
after the guts he displayed at Pinehurst? Two-time runner-up in the
British in 1985 and 1990. And his knickers fit the scenery.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jim Furyk: He might not have the length to keep up with the
big boys this time, but he has been a steady force in the British
with a tie for fourth and a solo fourth the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lee Westwood: Everybody keeps waiting for his big arrival, and
winning at New Orleans last year wasn't it. Has played a few times
at Carnoustie in the Scottish Open and British Amateur and likes
the course. With a healthy shoulder, he says his tee-to-green game
has never been better.
</P>
<P>
   _ Phil Mickelson: No more baby beeper problems. Best finish has
been a tie for 24th at Royal Troon in 1997. Anybody who can flop it
from anywhere should be a factor with this much high grass.
</P>
<P>
   _ Davis Love III: Came close at the Masters, but was never a
factor at Pinehurst. Last time anybody got excited about him, he
was backboarding the ball into the hole with his chip at Augusta's
16th. Top 10s in his last two British Opens.
</P>
<P>
   FIVE TO FORGET
</P>
<P>
   _ Nick Faldo: Giving slight indications of a revival, but
doesn't have the concentration that used to be part of his everyday
routine. Last two Opens have been forgettable. Has not contended in
a major since his fourth place at Royal Lytham in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   _ Darren Clarke: Tied for second behind Justin Leonard at Royal
Troon in '97, but missed the cut last year. Maybe he's cooled down
finally about the Irish Open. He bypassed the tournament upon
finding out that while John Daly received appearance fees of nearly
200,000 pounds, he was offered zilch.
</P>
<P>
   _ Scott Hoch: If his equipment company, Yonex, didn't request
that he attend the British Open, he would be back in Orlando. If he
ever contends in the tournament, it will be an accident.
</P>
<P>
   _ Tom Watson: Sure, it would be a great story if Watson could
contend 24 years after he won at Carnoustie. But he's getting ready
for the Senior Tour and no rough _ not 4-foot fescue.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jose Maria Olazabal: Normally, he would be one of the
favorites. But the Spaniard is attending with his right hand still
mending. He broke it at the U.S. Open, slamming it against his
hotel wall after an opening 75.

 &HT;    A year later, Kuchar barely on British map
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOCH LOMOND, Scotland _ Matt Kuchar came here a year ago unable
to tell the difference between reality and fantasy. The lush
countryside of central Scotland deepened the dream.
</P>
<P>
   What more could there be for Kuchar, a 20-year-old golfer from
Georgia Tech who had won the U.S. Amateur, contended in the Masters
and U.S. Open and appeared with Jay Leno on ``The Tonight Show''?
Nothing but the decision: Kuchar was only a telephone call away
from accepting millions of endorsement dollars to turn
professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, everything was kind of a magic-carpet ride,''
Kuchar said Friday, while standing outside the scoring tent at the
Standard Life Loch Lomond Invitational. ``It's a lot different now.
I think maybe you try and live up to those same dreams that came
true last year, and it's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   While this year's phenom, 19-year-old Spaniard Sergio Garcia, is
exciting all of Europe on his way to the British Open, Kuchar has
become a golfing afterthought, last year's news.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be in the Carnoustie area today and Monday, trying for an
Open spot the blue-collar way, as a qualifier at the Monifieth
Links.
</P>
<P>
   After a third round of even-par 71 Friday at Loch Lomond, he and
his mother, Meg, walked around the course and were hardly noticed.
By the time Kuchar landed in Glasgow a year ago, millions of golf
fans had watched him successfully compete at Augusta National and
the Olympic Club and charm a nation with his constant smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've totally dropped off the map yet,'' Kuchar,
21, said. ``I think people still do recognize me. There's not the
hype there was last year, but you can still see people snickering
and pointing, `There's the amateur kid, Matt Kuchar.' That's still
enjoyable, but it's not as great as it was last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the act is different. Kuchar's sometimes controversial and
always demonstrative father, Peter, is in Florida and not carrying
his son's bag. His absence is a combination, Matt said, of finances
and common sense. Last year, a local caddie probably could have
saved a couple of strokes. This year, Matt employed a Loch Lomond
gent he knew only as ``Joe,'' with no last name given. A local
caddie also will work for him at the Open qualifier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very expensive for us amateurs to travel,'' Matt said.
``Dad's paying for this trip. I'm sure if things weren't going on
at home, he would be here.''
</P>
<P>
   One month after the 1998 British Open, Matt and his father
announced that Matt would remain at Georgia Tech. After a mostly
lost 1999 season, punctuated by a disastrous performance in the
NCAAs (81-77), Kuchar will return to Tech for his senior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy with my decision,'' he said. ``It's something
that weighed a lot on me, and I've still thought a lot about, but I
always come back to being happy with what I've done. . . . Most
guys I talked to were really unsure. They kept me confused as to
the boat that I was in. They tried to put themselves in my shoes
and most of them said, `Matt I don't know what I would do if I were
you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what happens, nothing is likely to match the fanfare
of last summer, when Kuchar followed a tie for 21st in the Masters
with a tie for 14th in the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``His window was open the widest the Monday after the U.S. Open
in 1998,'' said agent Vinnie Giles of Pros Inc. in Richmond, Va.
``That's the biggest, widest window he was probably going to find
as an amateur unless he did something pretty phenomenal thereafter.
Now, here we are a year later, and it's obvious his window has got
some dust on it.''
</P>
<P>
   If there's a plus side for Kuchar, the golf industry was in such
a depressed state last year that small contract numbers were
available. Maybe his game and the promotional budgets will be
better in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar concedes that he did not handle ideally the distractions
accompanying his amazing run. In fact, he pushed himself to the
limit, and it affected his game. Behind in his studies from the
extra travel and competition that accompanied the U.S. Amateur
title, Kuchar needed 21 hours last term just to get on time for
graduation. Only now is his game beginning to come back to form.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think people know the different pulls you have on your
schedule,'' he said. ``When you get to a certain level, everybody
seems to want a piece of you. Sure, you get to do so many great
things, but when it comes down to golf, you don`t seem to be quite
as focused. So I lost a little bit of that, and it was a tough year
trying to relive it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinehurst epitomized the slide. He showed up unprepared and
weary from the Palmer Cup matches and missed the cut by eight shots
with rounds of 76-79.
</P>
<P>
   ``You either have it or you don't, and you're stuck with
whatever game you show up with,'' Kuchar said. ``At a major
championship course, if you don't have your A game, the course is
going to eat you up, and it did that to me. . . . Finally, my
game's starting to come around a little bit again. I'm able to see
those shots come off the way they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   He had no guarantee that a different decision would have
extended his wonderful ride. Garcia turned pro and has had amazing
success. England's Justin Rose turned pro and became a golfing
disaster, playing in 22 events before making his first cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt for Justin,'' Kuchar said, ``but I didn't find myself
thinking, `Hey, that could have been me.' . . . I still think
things will work out in the long run.

 &HT;    Students learn how to train dolphins
 &HT;    By Paul Lomartire
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ SeaWorld trainer Lindsay Rubincam seemed a bit
harsh.
</P>
<P>
   She scolded Heather Zeigra, 13, for simply dangling her hand in
a huge killer-whale pool at the theme park's Shamu Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``Heather, don't do that,'' Rubincam warned. ``That water is
their home, and they might not like it. If they don't know you,
you're an intruder to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather had paid $349 to be a SeaWorld trainer for a day and get
a close-up look at what Rubincam and other trainers do for a
living.
</P>
<P>
   One thing she does is respect the killer whales _ particularly
on this day, since a calf had just been born.
</P>
<P>
   The birth made the whales hyper-protective of their 36-foot-deep
pool home, Rubincam said. And though her words seemed a bit
impatient at the time, they proved wise a week later, when a man
was found dead in a killer whale's tank.
</P>
<P>
   Early Tuesday, Daniel Dukes' nude body was found draped on the
back of 11,000-pound Tilikum, a male killer whale in a
breeder/research pool. Some time Monday night, while trainers
charted data on the newborn at another pool and security patrolled
the area, the 27-year-old man apparently went for a swim with
22-foot Tilikum, the largest killer whale in captivity. An autopsy
released Wednesday concluded that Dukes drowned in the frigid
52-degree water.
</P>
<P>
   The pools at Shamu Stadium are also classrooms for SeaWorld's
popular Trainer-For-A-Day program, which started in January. Two
people a day spend about eight hours working with SeaWorld's
dolphins and whales _ all under the watch of professionals such as
Rubincam.
</P>
<P>
   Most participants are in their early 20s or teens, like Zeigra,
who's from Raleigh, N.C., and her partner, Kathleen Reilly, 15,
from Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Dukes' death will not jeopardize the program, a SeaWorld vice
president said Wednesday. In fact, it might do the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who wants to see what we actually do can sign up and
see firsthand, and it's not just a show,'' said Chuck Tompkins,
vice president for animal training. ``You see backstage. We have
nothing to hide.''
</P>
<P>
   Tilikum is the only killer whale at SeaWorld that trainers won't
swim with _ because he's more than twice the size of performing
female whales and, as a breeding male, too unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very cautious around him,'' said Tompkins.
</P>
<P>
   Tilikum is a one-trick whale. For daily shows, a trainer runs
along the perimeter of the performing pool, and Tilikum's massive
body splashes the first rows of spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The SeaWorld death wasn't the only bad marine mammal news this
week. Researchers told The New York Times that studies of dolphins
in the wild have revealed that the mammals have the power and
capacity to kill.
</P>
<P>
   Tompkins has heard it all before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other side of this story is you're talking a very small
percentage of extreme activists who have a narrow opinion on
animals in captivity from dogs to cats to horses to cows. Their
opinion is that none should be under the care of man, but we know
that's not realistic.''
</P>
<P>
   If not for marine theme parks, Tompkins asked, where could
scientists do long-term research on killer whales? The whales are
believed to be smarter than dolphins and fiercer than sharks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way that somebody could come in here,'' continued
Tompkins, ``see what we do, spend time with the trainers and accuse
us of not taking care of these animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Trainers treat orcas gingerly
</P>
<P>
   For Heather and Kathleen, training started with a 7 a.m.
wet-suit fitting. Then it was on to the fish room to fill buckets
with precise amounts of sardines, herring and other fish for
dolphins and whales used in the ``Terrors of the Deep'' shows.
</P>
<P>
   There's dirty work involved _ including scrubbing buckets and
the fish room _ but then comes the fun. Wannabe trainers feed the
dolphins and learn the arm signals that tell dolphins when to leap
and flip.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, the teens moved ``backstage'' at Shamu Stadium.
They tossed food into giant whale mouths and saw up close how orcas
are trained.
</P>
<P>
   Rubincam told the teens that trainers aren't allowed to even
stick a toe in a killer-whale pool until they've completed a full
year of training. ``And then the contact is extremely limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Each killer whale has a specific trainer, Rubincam explained
while a female whale named Umma practiced swimming on her side,
waving a fin.
</P>
<P>
   The girls got to help Rubincam work with Taku, a 5-year-old
male, as he learned a trick called a belly breach. The trainer used
a white pole with what looked like a pom-pom at the end to signal
Taku.
</P>
<P>
   The young trainers took turns slapping the water, a signal for
Taku to leap, and held the pole that the killer whale tried to
touch with his arched tail.
</P>
<P>
   Both teens are considering careers with marine mammals.
</P>
<P>
   That career choice is based on passion, not cash. A trainer's
salary starts just below $15,000 annually, and a senior trainer
with 15 years' experience can earn $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing about this week's death in a killer-whale pool,
Heather remembered how cautious Rubincam and other pros were.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a little bit tenser around the killer whales than
the dolphins.''
</P>
<P>
   And now she knows why.

 &HT;    Foreign workers with visas filling high-tech jobs
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Anil Urs and Phani B. Konduru both came to the
United States from India on student visas in the early 1990s. They
earned masters' degrees in engineering and landed good jobs at
Reynolds and Reynolds in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Dayton-based company relies on Urs and Konduru to design and
write computer software for Reynolds' plants and divisions and to
manage about 35 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Urs and Konduru, like thousands of skilled foreign nationals,
are allowed to work in this country with H-1B visas. Companies
nationwide have come to rely on such workers to fill computer
programming, engineering and other technical jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The growing information technology industry has created a
shortage of some high-tech workers, such as engineers and computer
programmers. For example, unemployment among electrical engineers
is just 0.3 percent and there are 350,000 openings in information
technology jobs _ more than 10 percent of the total IT work force.
</P>
<P>
   Three Dayton-based IT companies _ NCR Corp., Reynolds and
Reynolds and MTC International _ employ more than 100 foreign
nationals through H-1B visas. But the flow of skilled foreign
workers into the States has been stemmed. In June, the H-1B visa
program reached the annual cap of 115,000 foreign workers with
special talents and no more of the visas will be issued until the
next federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   This is the third consecutive year that the United States has
hit the cap before the end of the federal fiscal year _ even though
the cap was nearly doubled last year from 65,000 to 115,000 after
high-tech companies, including NCR, successfully lobbied Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Most companies in the Miami Valley said hitting the visa cap
earlier this year isn't likely to adversely affect them. But human
resources officials from Reynolds and Reynolds, NCR and other IT
companies say it will be a bit more difficult filling vacancies
without access to foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some extent, it diminishes the applicant pool from which we
can draw,'' said Connie Donovan, NCR's vice president of human
resources and planning. The H-1B visa allows a worker in specialty
occupations to work in this country for six years. The visas are
used mostly to bring computer programmers here from overseas,
particularly from India, England, Japan, the Philippines and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Information technology industry officials say that without
enough foreign workers, product development will slow and the
nation's economy will be harmed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a very strong argument . . . I think it's definitely
believable,'' said Sherry Neal, an attorney with Hammond and
Associates, a Cincinnati law firm that handles immigration work for
about 70 companies nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Some labor groups and critics maintain that IT companies want
foreign workers who are more loyal and paid less. Federal
regulations, however, prohibit paying an H-1B visa worker less.
</P>
<P>
   The visa cap will hold at 115,000 in 2000 then drop to 107,500
in 2001 and revert to 65,000 after that. The thinking was to rachet
the number down after Y2K problems are solved.
</P>
<P>
   IT companies have been saying the cap still isn't high enough,
given that the demand for tech talent shows no sign of letting up.
President Clinton's chief economic adviser, Laura D'Andrea Tyson,
writes in Business Week that unemployment rates for IT workers are
below 2 percent, forcing regional employers to mount national
recruiting campaigns. It's time to raise the cap yet again, Tyson
says.
</P>
<P>
   There are roughly 400,000 IT job vacancies now and that figure
is expected to grow to 1.3 million in the next decade, said NCR's
Donovan. And more than half of the students graduating from
American engineering and computer science programs are foreigners,
she said. ``You really have to look at foreign workers from outside
the U.S.,'' Donovan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work force has changed and the way we look at staffing and
the work force has changed. It's no longer a national event,''
Donovan said. ``Your world is a lot bigger. As business grows and
becomes more global, your work force becomes more global.''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies, such as Reynolds and Reynolds and MTC
International's Corbus resort to ``off-shore programming,'' a
practice where projects are sent to computer programmers overseas.
</P>
<P>
   Neal said foreign nationals may appear to be more loyal workers
because they aren't as mobile as other in-demand tech workers. The
Immigration and Naturalization Service must give approval before
foreign nationals change jobs _ a process that can take six weeks.
``Some of the U.S. workers, they get a job offer and they are gone
in a week,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But overall, it's easier to hire a U.S. worker than bring
someone in on a visa, Neal said. A company must pay a $610 fee and
go through the U.S. Department of Labor, the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service and the U.S. Department of State.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would hire U.S. workers if they could find them and they
were qualified,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Neal, who helped clients lobby for the increased cap, said there
is concern _ particularly in labor unions _ that the foreign
workers will take jobs from Americans. In reality, there just
aren't enough skilled Americans to fill all the vacant tech
positions, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Congressmen responded last year with the compromise: a temporary
cap increase and a hike in the visa application fee from $110 to
$610, with the extra $500 going toward scholarships and training
for U.S. workers. Employers pay the fee.
</P>
<P>
   The money is supposed to go toward training programs that will
relieve U.S. dependency on foreign workers. The U.S. Department of
Labor will use some of the money for training programs, and the
National Science Foundation will use some for scholarships for
low-income students in math, engineering and computer science.
</P>
<P>
   But Konduru said the need for IT workers is outpacing the
country's ability to train U.S. workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boom is happening faster than people can react. That's
what's happening,'' Konduru said.

</P>
<P>
   Carpenter's work shed new light on motor disorders, particularly
those caused by diseases of the basal ganglia, the interconnected
groups of masses of gray substance deep in the cerebral hemispheres
and in the upper brain stem. His contributions furthered research
into defects in the neural networks responsible for ailments like
Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter was the author of a standard textbook, ``Human
Neuroanatomy,'' which went into its eighth edition in 1983. It was
translated into a score of languages and remains in use in some 200
medical schools worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   He also wrote ``Core Text of Neuroanatomy'' (fourth ed., 1991),
and, with J.C. Madigan, ``Cerebellum of the Rhesus Monkey,''
(1971). He was a past president of the International Basal Ganglia
Society, consultant to the National Institutes of Health, associate
editor of the American Journal of Anatomy, and a member of the
editorial boards of Neurology, Neurobiology and the Journal of
Comparative Neurology.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter, who was born in Montrose, Colo., graduated from
Columbia College in 1943 and received his medical degree at the
Long Island College of Medicine in 1947. He completed his residency
at Columbia University, joined the department of anatomy in 1953
and rose to full professor in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 he became chairman of the department of anatomy at the
Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda,
Md. He was chairman until 1987 and retired as professor of anatomy
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Carolyn Sloan Carpenter, died in February, after
nearly 50 years of marriage. He is survived by three sons, Dr.
Duncan B., of Saddle River, N.J., Gregory S., of Glencoe, Ill., and
Rustin I., of Acton, Mass.; a sister, Patria Barbary of Taos, N.M.,
and eight grandchildren.

MARK O'BRIEN, 49, JOURNALIST AND POET IN AN IRON LUNG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mark O'Brien, the subject of an Academy Award-winning
documentary about his journalism career, conducted mostly from an
iron lung, died on July 4 at his home in Berkeley, Calif. He was
49.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from bronchitis, said O'Brien's
brother, Kenneth.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 film ``Breathing Lessons: The Life and Work of Mark
O'Brien,'' directed by Jessica Yu, described his struggle to live
productively with minimal assistance and his determination to live
on his own and work. He also founded a publishing company.
</P>
<P>
   Months of declining health had kept O'Brien dependent on the
iron lung for all but a few hours a week, his friends said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who was born in Boston and reared in Sacramento,
Calif., was 6 years old when polio left him paralyzed from the neck
down and forced him to begin using the iron lung.
</P>
<P>
   At some times in his youth, and for a brief period as recently
as last year, O'Brien's breathing could be supported by an
inflatable vest called a turtle shell. But for most of his life he
depended on the much more cumbersome iron lung, which encased most
of his body and helped him breathe by changing the pressure around
him.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 polio survivors in the United States are using iron
lungs.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley in
1978. He became a familiar figure on the streets of Berkeley,
navigating his electric gurney on trips between the campus and the
tiny apartment where he kept his iron lung. In 1982, he received a
bachelor's degree in English literature.
</P>
<P>
   After repeated applications, O'Brien was admitted to the
Graduate School of Journalism at Berkeley. His acceptance set a
precedent that helped other severely disabled applicants enter
state universities.
</P>
<P>
   His work was first published in 1979, when Co-Evolution
Quarterly printed his essay on independent living. Sandy Close,
executive editor of Pacific News Service, saw the article and hired
O'Brien as a correspondent. Close later produced ``Breathing
Lessons.''
</P>
<P>
   Close said O'Brien initially dictated his articles, then used a
stick in his mouth to press the keys of an IBM Selectric typewriter
and finally employed a word processor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, O'Brien co-founded Lemonade Factory, a small press in
Berkeley that publishes poetry by people with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, who said his strong Roman Catholic faith helped him
cope with his disability, had two great passions besides writing:
baseball and Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his brother, Kenneth, of Granite Bay, Calif., he
is survived by his father, Walter F., also of Granite Bay, and a
sister, Rachel Jordan, of Weimar, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien published several volumes of poetry, including a
collection called ``Breathing,'' which included the following
lines:
</P>
<P>
   This most excellent canopy, the air, look you,
</P>
<P>
   Presses down upon me
</P>
<P>
   At fifteen pounds per square inch,
</P>
<P>
   A dense, heavy, blue glowing ocean,
</P>
<P>
   Supporting the weight of condors
</P>
<P>
   That swim its churning currents.
</P>
<P>
   All I get is a thin stream of it,
</P>
<P>
   A finger's width of the rope that ties me to life
</P>
<P>
   As I labor like a stevedore to keep the connection.

SPORTS COLUMN: FEMALE CHAMPIONS TAKE OVER ROSE BOWL
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA , Calif. _ Pompoms fluttering on the sidelines,
starlets twinkling in the stands. This was the traditional feminine
presence in the hallowed oval called the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, as this century runs out, there was not a drum
majorette in sight. Instead, 22 women from China and the United
States were tearing up the Rose Bowl lawn, kicking a round ball
with the side of their boots in the championship game of the
Women's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   In the famous den where Roy Riegels of California ran the wrong
way with a fumble in the college Rose Bowl, where John Riggins
rumbled for a winning touchdown for Washington in the professional
Super Bowl, there were players named Sun Wen and Mia Hamm.
</P>
<P>
   Now the women are part of the legacy, with over 90,000 fans
packing the joint, making it the largest crowd to watch a women's
soccer game anywhere in the world, and presumably the largest crowd
to watch a women's sports event in history.
</P>
<P>
   The fans were here to cheer for the Americans, a zestful bunch
that has been building for a decade and was now trying to hold off
the Chinese, who have come on strong in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans had won the first women's world soccer
championship in China in 1991, and then won the Summer Olympic
Games gold medal in 1996, and now there was something else at stake
_ the possibility of a professional league.
</P>
<P>
   The quest for financial backing from corporate America is now
linked with the legacy of a packed house in perhaps the most famous
football/soccer stadium in North America.
</P>
<P>
   The American players, women from their late teens to their early
30s, have their own takes on playing in the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``Waking up on New Year's Day, temperature in the 80s, the Rose
Bowl on television,'' said Julie Foudy, from Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I picture all the roses in the parade,'' said Michelle Akers
of Seattle. ``My father and stepmother are watching the game on
television. I get bored and I go outside and kick a soccer ball.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're asking the wrong person,'' was the smiling response of
Tracy Ducar, a reserve goalkeeper, who has been part of the soccer
generation for just about all of her 26 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's an alliance of four bowls now, but I still
think of the Rose Bowl as the biggest bowl game of all,'' said
Saskia Webber, another reserve goalkeeper from Princeton, N.J., who
added, ``My mom's from Holland, and she knows about the Rose
Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl became part of American mythology back in the days
of radio, when Jack Benny and his merry band would pack themselves
into Benny's ancient Maxwell and bumble their way to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   One can imagine Benny showing up Saturday and turning to his
wife and his sidekicks and saying: ``Mary! Don! They're kicking a
ball all over the Rose Bowl! Rochester! Dennis! Those are ...
women!''
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl has become identified with soccer, starting with
the 1984 Summer Games, when Olympic patrons filled the stadium to
watch teams from Brazil and France. The huge outpouring for soccer
led to the United States being awarded the 1994 men's World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The famous arena had its tragic, spectacular and tedious
moments. In a first-round game, Andres Escobar of Colombia
deflected the ball into his own goal, and was gunned down
mysteriously when the team returned home.
</P>
<P>
   In the round of 16, Romania and Argentina played a show-time
Magic-Bird 3-2 game, and then in the finals, Italy and Brazil
played a dreary scoreless tie that ended with Roberto Baggio
missing a penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   With Major League Soccer moving into the Rose Bowl in 1996, the
15 largest soccer crowds in the United States have now taken place
in the Rose Bowl. But women had never set a competitive foot in the
Rose Bowl until March of this year, when the American women played
an exhibition with Mexico, followed by a game by the home-team
Galaxy of the MLS.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans beat Mexico, 3-0, in the first game, after which
was heard the sound of many thousands of drivers gunning their
engines. Since then, these women have become even more of a
national attraction. ``I came to a game in 1994 when the men drew
90,000 for a game with Mexico,'' Webber said the other day. ``Most
of those fans were Mexican-Americans, and that was great, but this
time most of the fans will be Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, fans have jammed into this sunken bowl to see
Pacific 10 champions battle Big Ten champions, sometimes for the
national title. This is where Ryan Leaf of Washington State could
not get off a final pass against Michigan in the 1998 Rose Bowl.
This is where Leon Lett of Dallas frolicked foolishly only to have
Don Beebe of Buffalo strip him of the ball on the 1-yard line in
the Super Bowl in 1993. This is where Taffarel of Brazil and
Gianluca Pagliuca of Italy let nothing get past them for 120
minutes in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is the stadium where Gao Hong and Briana Scurry defended
their goals in 1999. Now the Rose Bowl will have a history of women
who did not twirl a baton, but rather kicked a ball far down the
field. Halfway back in this fading century, Jack Benny would have
been speechless.

HARRY ECKSTEIN, 75, PROFESSOR WHO STUDIED POLITICAL CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Harry H. Eckstein, a political scientist who argued that a
critically important role in determining whether democracy
succeeded in a country was played by the country's political
culture, or what he called its authority patterns, died on June 22
in Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach, Calif. He was 75 and lived near
Newport Beach.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was heart failure, the University of California at
Irvine said in announcing his death.
</P>
<P>
   At his death, Eckstein, who lived in Nazi Germany as a boy, was
distinguished research professor of political science at the Irvine
campus, where he had taught since 1980. He previously taught at
Harvard and Princeton universities.
</P>
<P>
   His view of the importance of a country's political culture in
the success of democracy, and not just its constitution and formal
institutions, was very influential among political scientists in
the United States and abroad, beginning in the 1960s, said Walter
F. Murphy, who retired in 1995 as the McCormick Professor of
Jurisprudence in Princeton's department of politics.
</P>
<P>
   And Gabriel A. Almond, a political scientist who taught at
Stanford University, wrote in 1998 that Eckstein had ``won a
lasting place in the systematic literature on the properties and
conditions of democratic stability.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Eckstein's theory, ``governments perform well to
the extent that their authority patterns are congruent with the
authority patterns of other units of society,'' like families,
schools and workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy said Eckstein had found ``that the Norwegian system was
very compatible with democracy, because you could criticize, you
could have give and take.'' But in the Germany that Eckstein had
known as a boy, Murphy said, ``the father ruled the family; in the
school, the professor was God, etc., and his argument was that it
was almost impossible to have a democratic system unless you
changed that subculture as well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He believed that you could do that,'' Murphy said, ``but you
had to work to change it.''
</P>
<P>
   Eckstein, born into a Jewish family in Schotten, Germany, was
brought to the United States when he was 12, lived in Columbus,
Ohio, and went on to obtain bachelor's, master's and doctorate
degrees, all in political science, from Harvard.
</P>
<P>
   His first four marriages ended in divorce.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Marlene Hamilton, whom he
married in 1995; a son, Jonathan Eckstein of Princeton, N.J.; a
stepson, Eric Sterling Ament of Ruidoso, N.M., and two
grandchildren.

SPORTS COLUMN: AN UNFULFILLED DREAM FROM RICKY BYRDSONG
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Ill., Ky., La., Mich., N.J., Pa.)  (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ricky Byrdsong was buried in Atlanta on Saturday, eight days
after he was killed in Chicago in a racist's rampage that left two
dead and several wounded. The athletic community remained in a
state of shock.
</P>
<P>
   The former Northwestern basketball coach was a well-liked member
of a sprawling coaching fraternity. Among those attending memorial
services in Evanston, Ill., last Wednesday were Big Ten
Commissioner Jim Delany; former Michigan coach Steve Fisher; former
Arizona players Sean Elliott and Steve Kerr, now with the San
Antonio Spurs; and Eastern Kentucky Coach Scott Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Washington, commissioner of the Southwestern Athletic
Conference, was still shaken. ``You always hear about people being
killed, but very seldom do you hear about someone you knew _ and
knew well,'' Washington said from his office in Louisiana. ``This
blew us away. I mean, he was out there trying to get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington gained national prominence as executive director of
the Black Coaches Association, which he co-founded in 1988. The
organization was begun to address issues pertaining to the
participation and employment of members of minority groups in
intercollegiate athletics. The association's goal was to help
minority-group members become coaches or administrators at the high
school, collegiate or professional levels.
</P>
<P>
   As executive director of the BCA, Washington grew close to
Byrdsong. They were assistant coaches who climbed the ladder and
pushed against the barriers that kept black assistants as
recruiters but locked them out of head-coaching positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky was a friend to everybody,'' Washington recalled. ``He
was an active member. He was never out front, but you could depend
on him to support you. That's what he brought to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   In a way, though, the fact Byrdsong was out of coaching at the
time of his death underlines the failure of the association to
adequately take care of its members by creating an old-boy and
old-girl network of its own. Byrdsong was named the coach at
Northwestern in 1993. In his first season the Wildcats had their
first winning season in 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   But during a game at Minnesota in February 1994, Byrdsong left
the bench, walked into the stands, chatting with fans and
exchanging high-fives. Blaming stress, Byrdsong then took a 12-day,
four-game leave of absence. He was dismissed after the 1996-97
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The episode at Northwestern was just devastating to him,''
Washington said. ``I don't think he ever bounced back.''
</P>
<P>
   To suggest that the BCA could have saved Ricky Byrdsong's life
is a stretch. He was the victim of a random shooting that could
have occurred anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Washington feels the association could have played a more
forceful role in helping Byrdsong get back into the coaching
profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the black coaches could have pulled him in,''
Washington said. ``That was what the BCA was all about. When a guy
lost his job, when a guy was in trouble, we came to his aid. We
stayed in contact, tried to get counseling. Nobody picked up the
phone and used connections to get him a job with Nike. No one
called and said, `Let me give you an administrative assistant job.'
The whole reasoning for the BCA was to help each other. Now we're
back to this where we eat each other alive.''
</P>
<P>
   What has happened to a movement that, only a few years ago, had
television executives and college administrators panicked over the
prospect of a proposed boycott? Washington said what has happened
is that contentment brought about by the illusion of progress has
created a false sense of accomplishment. The very nature of
Byrdsong's violent death underlines deeply rooted problems that
still need to be addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened to us is that now that the movement has done
its job, so now brothers don't think the Black Coaches Association
had anything to do with them getting their jobs,'' Washington said.
``It's almost like black folks thinking Rosa Parks had nothing to
do with where they are today.''
</P>
<P>
   The BCA is in transition, establishing offices in Somerset, N.J.
But it is also moving from its early grass-roots passion to a more
sophisticated approach that uses the power of law and the enormous
pool of minority athletes to pressure the system for inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Washington stepped down as executive director in 1998 to become
the commissioner of the Southwestern Athletic Conference. The BCA's
board of director's subsequently announced the appointment of C.
Timothy Stoner, a Philadelphia-based lawyer, as Washington's
replacement. The transition has not been smooth, nor the
relationship amicable.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring the Black Coaches Association's board of directors
initiated legal action against Washington in federal court. The
BCA's suit against Washington sought an injunction and an
accounting of finances handled by Washington while he was executive
director. Washington denied any impropriety and asserted a claim of
his own against the BCA for money allegedly due to him. Washington
and the BCA have agreed to submit the dispute to binding
arbitration in place of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Stoner said the association embraces the mission that Washington
outlined more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we move forward the BCA will be in position to make sure
our coaches, our student athletes and our officials have a voice,''
he said. ``We want to organize athletes at the high school level;
we want to use legal pressure to get more minority coaching jobs.
When someone reaches the level of being a Big Ten coach, like
Ricky, there should have been other options.''

 &HT;    Papa's long gone, but memories linger
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. _ He drove ambulances in Spain during World War
I, he wooed the literary elite in Paris, he fished for marlin off
Havana, he stalked mountain trout in Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   But no place seemed to have a stronger hold on Ernest Hemingway
than Key West, the funky end-of-the-continent fishing village that
the bearded ``Papa'' called home for most of the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation gears up to celebrate Hemingway's 100th birthday
July 21 _ events are scheduled in Michigan, Illinois, Boston and
Havana _ many fans of the Nobel Prize-winning author will make
their pilgrimage here.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists: A curse and blessing
</P>
<P>
   About 10,000 Hemingway devotees are expected for the 19th annual
Hemingway Days Festival, a 10-day event that begins Friday and
includes offerings as diverse as a famous look-alike contest, a
marlin tournament, a short story contest and maybe even a mock
running of the bulls down Duval Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The connections are just so deep,'' said Andy Newman, a
publicist for the event. ``In so many ways, Hemingway is an icon
for Key West.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, put in terms that Hemingway himself might admire, ``It's an
excuse to have a literary festival in a bar,'' said Karen Thurman,
another festival organizer.
</P>
<P>
   But for all its panache and posturing, for all its spiritual
kinship with Hemingway's lifestyle of manly fun, the festival takes
place against the backdrop of a city struggling to cope with
rampant growth and its own spectacular success as a tourist mecca.
</P>
<P>
   Key West today is far from the simple, sleepy village where the
famous author spent his mornings pecking at a typewriter in the
study of his stately Spanish Colonial home on Whitehead Street and
his evenings at Sloppy Joe's Bar hefting drinks and swapping
fishing lies with his decidedly nonliterary buddies.
</P>
<P>
   Hemingway's home is still the center of a picturesque district
of gingerbread-trimmed homes with wide porches and lush,
overhanging tropical greenery, and Key West's streets are still
narrow avenues into a quaint, scaled-down past.
</P>
<P>
   But condos and parking garages now dot the crowded landscape,
while cruise ships disgorge 500,000 passengers a year to traipse
down Duval Street's riot of T-shirt shops and souvenir emporiums.
Trendy cafes and upscale guest houses with facades fit for
Architectural Digest charge New York prices.
</P>
<P>
   Housing costs have risen so steeply that many low-paid tourism
workers must crowd three and four people into one- or two-bedroom
apartments that go for $1,500 or more a month, while the cost of a
tumbled-down shack in the historic district might top $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Water contamination problems from a badly needed sewer line
replacement project have made swimming near the shore a hazard,
while state regulators have imposed a strict construction slowdown
throughout much of the Keys because the area doesn't have the
infrastructure _ roads, schools, sewers, etc. _ to handle the
booming population.
</P>
<P>
   And federal regulators recently outlawed the popular practice of
renting out small enclosed rooms that hundreds of homeowners added
beneath their houses on stilts. The ban will lessen the area's
vulnerability to hurricane losses, but has made the affordable
housing crisis even more acute.
</P>
<P>
   It's all enough that ``Papa'' might load up his famous fishing
boat and head for some simpler, undiscovered island were he still
around.
</P>
<P>
   But locals seem to realize they're at something of a crossroads.
A recent round of public hearings was aimed at the soul-searching
question of tourism's impact, with a commission listening to dozens
of complaints from residents who say that while visitors bring
scads of money, they are also too loud and rowdy and leave too much
trash in the streets and on the nearby coral reef.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just have too many tourists visiting Key West,'' said
Richard Malas, who runs a tropical drink stand near one of the
town's popular beaches, which has been mostly deserted lately
because of the water contamination problems. ``It's really killing
the infrastructure, but without the tourists, we have no
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Novelist still a strong presence
</P>
<P>
   Business leaders seem aware that the problems must be addressed,
and steps are being taken. The city has started a $53 million sewer
line replacement project _ work being done strictly with local
funds _ and there is talk of creating affordable housing so that
workers won't flee the area.
</P>
<P>
   City leaders have just passed an ordinance to tighten pollution
rules for the hundreds of boaters who dock at area marinas, while
new regulations stemming from creation of the Florida Keys National
Marine Sanctuary are curbing damage to the coral reefs.
</P>
<P>
   And whatever the problems, it's clear that Key West still holds
a mythical, mystical power over thousands of visitors. Couples with
hands entwined stroll the tree-shaded streets at night as a fresh
ocean breeze ruffles the greenery, while families laugh at the
curious collection of street performers who gather at Mallory
Square each sunset for an only-in-Key-West celebration.
</P>
<P>
   And hundreds still line up each day to pay homage to ``Papa,''
touring the grounds of his home, petting offspring of his famous
six-toed cats, dipping a toe in his swimming pool, admiring the
room where he labored over masterpieces.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a rift two years ago with some of Hemingway's
descendants who wanted a cut of the festival's profits, and
problems this year attracting corporate sponsors, it seems clear
that some kind of festival honoring the famous author will always
be held in Key West.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers say the interest is just overwhelming _ and comes
from all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got an in-flight magazine for Japan Air, Michael Palin
from the BBC and a Swedish television network all doing stories
this year,'' said Thurman. ``The amount of attention is just
amazing.

 &HT;    Get a sneak peek of `Eyes Wide Shut'
 &HT;    By Staff reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The late Stanley Kubrick didn't want you
to know anything about Eyes Wide Shut until the movie opens Friday.
But if you can't wait for some tidbits, consider seeking out these
sources:
</P>
<P>
   _ The novel: The movie is based on Austrian author Arthur
Schnitzler's erotic, mysterious ``Dream Story.'' Although copies
have been hard to find, at least one was in a south county Borders
recently.
</P>
<P>
   _ The memoir: ``Eyes Wide Open,'' a remembrance by Frederic
Raphael of working with Kubrick on the screenplay, was just
published and is full of juicy and controversial tidbits, from
Kubrick's views on Hitler to his insular working methods to
Raphael's splendid insights into Kubrick's mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   _ The magazines: Cruise and Kidman are on the covers of
magazines everywhere, but they're not saying much. Unless you're
intrigued that the long shoot gave Cruise an ulcer or that 65
seconds of nudity will be digitally covered up in the American
version to ensure an R-rating. Time magazine ran an early, positive
review last week and a chart that confirmed or squelched some of
the rumors (does Cruise kiss a dead woman or not?) And critic
Alexander Walker ran a review (also positive) that's available on
the Internet at www.thisislondon.co.uk

   COKE-EUROPE _ BRUSSELS _ The health scare that has gripped
Europe this year goes far beyond the recent Coca-Cola crisis here.
After all, Belgium was an emotional/political/social tinderbox
waiting for something like the naive Coke to come along. A series
of scares from Mad Cow disease to E-coli to Genetically Modified
food to dioxin have people hyper-sensitive about food in Europe.
Added to this: a growing lack of faith in their governments'
ability to protect them _ as evidenced by the popular rejection of
Belgium's sitting government over the dioxin scare. All of these
forces came to bear when the first cases of Coke Sickness came
forward _ primarily involving adolescent girls. And here was a new
health minister in Belgium, who assumed his role when the last
health minister was forced out over the dioxin scare. Adding insult
to injury was Coke being, well, Coke, Arrogant and American and
MBA, it tried dealing with the situation from an American
perspective and allowed it to mushroom out of control. (Roughton,

GANGS' NEW TRADE: YOUNG PROSTITUTES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two years ago, Maria joined a Brooklyn gang whose
members would beat and rob her for sport. She endured the abuse,
her friends said, because she was desperate to belong.
</P>
<P>
   So when gang members asked her to steal from the grandmother who
was rearing her, Maria did not refuse. Nor did she resist their
sexual advances after nights of drinking and smoking marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   She felt loved, especially by one of the gang's leaders, an
18-year-old nicknamed Seven who wooed her with a smile of
gold-capped teeth. Even when he asked her to sell her body on the
streets, Maria did not refuse. She was 11.
</P>
<P>
   Now 13, Maria is a crack addict who has been arrested twice this
year on charges of prostitution and whose body is riddled by
sexually transmitted diseases. She is in a juvenile detention
center upstate.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was in seventh-grade, working on a third-grade level, when
they picked her up,'' Maria's grandmother, Linda, said of the first
arrest. That time, the police brought Maria home and charged Seven
with being her pimp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her the streets were no place for her,'' added Linda,
48, who spoke on the condition that her last name and Maria's not
be used. ``She said, `Once a trick, always a trick,' and walked
away.''
</P>
<P>
   In what crime experts say is becoming increasingly common here
and in other large American cities, gang members once known for
robberies and assaults are using girls like Maria to make money.
They sell them for sex and use them to attract customers to their
drug business.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, more than 100 members of seven gangs operating in
midtown Manhattan were arrested on charges that included using
prostitutes to sell drugs. In Brooklyn and Queens, law enforcement
officials are building cases against neighborhood street gangs
suspected of the same thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know from research that girls are increasingly attracted to
gangs, and that these girls are increasingly being put out
commercially to help the survival of the gang,'' said Richard J.
Estes, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania in
Philadelphia. ``We are finding these patterns all across the U.S.:
young women joining gangs where their major contribution is sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of these women are also involved in other aspects of gang
life, including assaults and robberies, said Deanna Rodriguez, an
assistant district attorney in Brooklyn. ``Twenty years ago, they
might say, `My boyfriend's in the gang and I'm his girlfriend,' ''
she said, adding that almost every local gang chapter now has
female members. ``They do a multitude of things, but sex is
certainly a way for females to make money.''
</P>
<P>
   Women and girls account for 11 percent of the estimated 816,000
gang members in the United States, according to the Federal Office
of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention, which only recently
began compiling such statistics. Studies now being conducted by the
office put the percentage much higher _ 20 percent to 46 percent _
in some cities.
</P>
<P>
   Reliable data on young women involved in prostitution is hard to
come by because many are picked up on other charges, like truancy
and drug possession. Even so, New York City Police Department
statistics show that 1,058 women between the ages of 16 and 20 were
arrested last year on prostitution charges, compared with 832 in
1996. Twenty-five girls under 16 were arrested last year, compared
with five in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say many young runaway girls fall in with gangs because
they come from areas where such groups are common and have stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are attracted to the craziness of the gangs and the
respect they get,'' said Frenchie Laguer, a caseworker with Frost'd
(From Our Streets With Dignity), an outreach program for
prostitutes. ``They are attracted to the things that aren't
supposed to be obtainable to them, and here's this guy saying he'll
do anything for you.''

</P>
<P>
   One 18-year-old prostitute at a doughnut shop under the 59th
Street Bridge, where Linda's granddaughter Maria sometimes worked,
said girls were often lured into working for the gang with promises
of wealth. ``They want the money, the independence,'' she said.
``The gangs give the girls protection and a place to stay when
you're out here.''
</P>
<P>
   While some gangs use prostitutes to bolster their drug business,
others have turned away from drug sales in favor of prostitution,
said Rick Curtis, a sociologist with John Jay College.
</P>
<P>
   ``The profits just aren't in drugs anymore, and the dealers are
whining about not being able to make as much money,'' Curtis said.
``Prostitution is just as lucrative and less of a hassle.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariela P. Stanton, the chief of the Queens district attorney's
anti-bias and youth gang bureau, said she worried that gang
involvement in prostitution might make the trade more violent.
</P>
<P>
   Prostitutes not affiliated with gangs say that has been true in
the East New York section of Brooklyn, where Maria was found
walking the streets for her Bloods gang. Prostitutes there and in
Queens said gang members have harassed and threatened to shoot
women who refused to pay them tribute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in big Blood territory, and these days they want a piece
of the cut,'' said Sarah, 20, as she walked down Pennsylvania
Avenue. ``Gang members have pulled out guns and shot in the air at
us and pushed some of the girls around.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria was found working as a prostitute on the same street by
police officers assigned to Operation Marleny, a new initiative
established to find runaways working as prostitutes and topless
dancers. It is named after Marleny Cruz, a 14-year-old runaway who
was sexually abused and beaten to death in the Bronx in February
1998.
</P>
<P>
   Within a week last January, the officers found five young
runaway girls, including Maria, working the streets in Brooklyn.
Maria bore little resemblance to her photographs, which dot her
grandmother's apartment in East New York.
</P>
<P>
   The smiling child who once posed before backdrops of balloons
and stars had become a mirror image of her mother _ a woman already
incarcerated on charges involving prostitution and drugs. Pointing
to a photograph of Maria smiling in front of a flag, Linda said,
``That was before she started wearing all that makeup and junk on
her face.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria had been in her grandmother's care for several years
because of her mother's repeated trips to jail. Linda had also been
taking care of two other young relatives, and seeking a bigger
apartment, she moved to a public housing project in East New York.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the move, older girls in the same
building began to pick on Maria, then 10 years old, while their
friends who hung out outside made sport of robbing her when she
went to the store for groceries. ``The gangs would jump her, beat
her up,'' Linda said. ``Then they got her to start stealing from
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Maria soon became a member of the gang. School was the first
thing to slip.
</P>
<P>
   She began spending days away from home, and when she would
return, her grandmother began to fear it was only to steal more of
the family's meager possessions. Although only 11, she started
having sex with gang members, getting drunk and smoking marijuana,
her friends and her grandmother said.
</P>
<P>
   Then along came Seven and his plan to put her on the street.
Maria was a veteran 12-year-old prostitute when officers found her
on Pennsylvania Avenue in January. Prosecutors said that Maria
appeared to be about 18 years old. They later persuaded her to file
a complaint against Seven, who is free on bond awaiting trial on
charges that include promoting prostitution, rape, sexual
misconduct and sodomy.
</P>
<P>
   After the arrest, Linda was hopeful that Maria would turn
herself around. And Maria seemed to be improving for a time while
living in a foster care center. But in late February, she ran away,
this time to the Bronx. Undercover narcotics officers found her on
the street again and arrested her. The charge, Linda said, was
prostitution.

KOCH IS OUT OF HOSPITAL; BEAME IS TREATED FOR PAINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After being treated successfully for what doctors
called a moderate heart attack, former Mayor Ed Koch left the
hospital Saturday, wreathed in smiles and trailed by reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no fear of death,'' he said at a news conference
beforehand at New York Weill Cornell Center of Presbyterian
Hospital, wearing a pale blue shirt and suspenders. ``But I want to
go all at once, not slice by slice.''
</P>
<P>
   As Koch soliloquized on the benefits of regular exercise and on
the misfortunes of those without health insurance, another retired
mayor was being treated downtown.
</P>
<P>
   Former Mayor Abraham Beame, 93, was reported to be in
satisfactory condition at New York University Medical Center after
being admitted with chest pains Friday night, a hospital spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Koch, 74, an exercise enthusiast accustomed to daily 6 a.m.
workouts, said he would not yet return to the gym. However, he said
he would continue to write his opinion column and movie reviews,
and planned to see the new Spike Lee film, ``Summer of Sam,''
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   His doctors said that the heart attack Koch suffered July 1 was
the result of a clogged artery. They performed angioplasty to clear
out the blockage and reopened the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Timothy Sanborn, director of the Weill Cornell cardiac
catheterization laboratory, said that Koch's heart muscle has
already made significant recovery. ``We have the bionic man here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Koch and Beame appeared together as recently as June 28, joining
former Mayor David Dinkins in a protest against Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's efforts to revise the City Charter.
</P>
<P>
   On that day, with their own political woes behind them, the
former mayors seemed to share the sentiment that Koch expressed
Saturday upon leaving the hospital: ``Life has been very good to
me.''

 &HT;    Practical parenting examples book's focus
 &HT;    By Emily Rahimi
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If you are sick of reading parenting books that
are peppered with lists and advice, Dr. Kyle Pruett has a solution.
</P>
<P>
   In his latest book, ``Me, Myself and I: How Children Build Their
Sense of Self'' (Goddard Press, $19.95) Pruett guides parents on
how to shape children from 18 months to 36 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moms and dads hardly have time to look at the labels in their
clothing, besides reading a textbook,'' he said. ``There is a lot
of science but I disguise the fact.'' As a result, this book has
simple language and includes many examples to help parents
strengthen their relationships with their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end of babyhood, where children become
themselves,'' said Pruett. Because most people do not have a memory
before the age of 5, many feel that this time is not significant in
a child's life. However, Pruett said this is not true, ``the first
years really last forever.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a variety of people, including men, women, parents and
grandparents, find this book useful, as well as people who are
considering having children: ``It helps them think of whether they
are ready.''
</P>
<P>
   As a father of three, ranging in age from 27 to 5 months, Pruett
has firsthand experience. Residing in Guilford, Conn., he has
practiced child and family psychiatry for more than 20 years,
working as a clinical professor of child psychiatry at Yale
University and writing for many parenting and family magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Pruett also works with national agencies for the assistance of
young children. He is president of Zero to Three: National Center
for Infants, Toddlers, and Families, an early childhood development
think tank, and a founding member of Father to Father, chaired by
Vice President Al Gore, which is a campaign to unite men in being
positive influences in children's lives. Additionally, he is a
presidential appointee and consultant to the Committee on Preschool
Children of the American Psychiatric Association.

   It took Lee Stevens of the Texas Rangers 11 years _ parts of
nine seasons in the minor leagues, and two full ones in Japan _ to
finally stick in baseball's major leagues. Stevens, 32, is not
wasting his shot; he's chasing every edge he can get.
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione is one of those edges.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who has hit 14 home runs and driven in 48 runs so far
this season, said that during workouts last winter he used
androstenedione, the diet supplement whose sales have exploded
since Mark McGwire, the first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals,
acknowledged using it last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take it for a month, take two or three weeks off
and then go back to it just to keep shocking your body,'' Stevens
said recently of his off-season androstenedione use. ``It was doing
something for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' use of androstenedione _ many experts believe it is
tantamount to a steroid _ has produced no great public comment,
much less any kind of controversy, and he is hardly a rarity in his
unhidden but largely anonymous use of androstenedione. In fact,
baseball officials, from union leaders to individual trainers on
major league clubs, estimate that from 5 to 10 percent of the 750
players in the major leagues have used, or are using,
androstenedione. Others in the medical community suspect the number
is higher.
</P>
<P>
   So a year after McGwire acknowledged using the supplement smack
in the middle of his record-breaking, 70-homer season, baseball and
androstenedione remain in a quiet limbo. More than a few experts
believe it is a convenient stall.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball has not banned or discouraged the use of
androstenedione, a product that, while sold legally over the
counter and over the Internet in the United States, is banned by
the National Football League, the National Collegiate Athletic
Association and the International Olympic Committee as a
performance-enhancing and potentially harmful drug. Baseball's top
officials have stuck to their position that they will neither
condone nor discourage use of the supplement until the sport's
scientific study of its effects is completed.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of baseball's stance believe that the sport's failure to
act aggressively against the use of androstenedione in part has
been influenced by a reluctance to diminish McGwire's record.
Baseball officials, including the commissioner and a senior
official with the players' union, reject that assertion.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever baseball's motivation in delaying action on
androstenedione, critics of the supplement regard Lee Stevens as
being, in many ways, the face of the danger they forecast a year
ago. Stevens says that androstenedione is legal, that it has
baseball's blessing, and that he takes it without worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt more intense in my workouts,'' said Stevens, who does
not use the supplement during the season. ``And I did get a lot
stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   For the experts alarmed by androstenedione, players like Stevens
are engaged in conduct that could harm their health. The experts
are also worried that the players have popularized androstenedione
use among American youngsters, and have set back the effort to
clean up the problem of drug use in sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic movement, the National Football League and the
NCAA have all outlawed andro,'' said Barry McCaffrey, the retired
general who heads White House drug control policy. ``And we have in
place this huge apparatus to keep drugs away from youth in America.
But since McGwire's revelation, andro sales have gone up five- to
tenfold. You can get it everywhere, classified as a food
supplement, which sounds so benign. In fact, I'll bet we have a
problem. And if it's dangerous, we better get it off the shelves.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent interviews with more than four dozen major-league players
and team trainers, as well as with more than a dozen medical
experts, make clear that the subject of androstenedione use remains
a common and thorny topic in clubhouses. Players swap theories and
concerns; trainers by and large are against using the supplement,
but are limited in what they can do to prevent its use; team
officials abide by baseball's public position of neutrality, but
have become alarmed by regular reports that use among
minor-leaguers is on the rise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, baseball has a great responsibility,'' said Bud
Selig, the commissioner of baseball. ``I want to be very careful
that we are proceeding with all of the empirical data that one
should have. And it doesn't exist at this point.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   THE PROS AND CONS: EXPERTS REACT TO BOOMING DRUG
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Don Catlin runs the Olympic drug testing laboratory at UCLA
and helped set up the drug protocols for the NFL, which bans the
use of androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   At work each morning, Catlin checks his e-mail and finds
by-now-familiar notes from colleagues around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say things like, `What in the world is going on in
America?' '' Catlin said. ``They can't understand how something
like andro, which their countries all banned a long time ago, is
prevalent in America. We're generally seen as the protectors
internationally, with a government committed to fighting drug abuse
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is very embarrassing. Androstenedione is a steroid,
there's no question about it. It shouldn't be available.''
</P>
<P>
   Catlin's opinion is shared by many other experts on drug policy.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles Yesalis, a Penn State professor and co-author of
``The Steroids Game,'' is frequently asked how androstenedione can
be sold legally over the counter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I say: `It beats me. It makes no sense at all,' '' Yesalis
said.
</P>
<P>
   While baseball is correct that there are few reputable, clinical
studies of androstenedione, interviews with more than two dozen
physicians, researchers and endocrinologists showed little
variation when it came to assessing androstenedione's status as a
supplement and its potential for harm.
</P>
<P>
   With rare exceptions, most believed androstenedione, or andro,
as it is commonly known, should be re-classified as an anabolic
steroid, or at least be made a prescription drug. Most worried that
additional research will in time prove that andro, especially taken
in high doses, significantly raises testosterone levels in the
blood and perhaps levels of the female hormone estrogen. An excess
of either is linked to a host of health problems.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Iowa State University study of 30 young men found that
andro did not help build muscle but did raise the risk of heart
disease, pancreatic cancer and breast enlargement. The study has
been criticized _ not so much by the supplement industry, but by
doctors who believe it understated andro's threat because the test
subjects took dosages far smaller than many body builders routinely
ingest.
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione is a synthetic form of a male hormone that
occurs naturally in the body and is converted to testosterone. It
was developed by doctors in the former East Germany, who began
experimenting on athletes with powerful steroids in a
state-sanctioned effort to dominate athletics. Documents salvaged
by the German molecular biologist Werner Franke just after the
unification of Germany disclosed how the East Germans used andro,
which was not yet banned by the International Olympic Committee, in
the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul. Andro was taken to prolong the
effects of the more powerful anabolic steroids that competitors had
stopped taking weeks before the Games to avoid a positive test for
steroids.
</P>
<P>
   In a nasal spray form, andro was used immediately before
competition. German doctors said in a patent application for
androstenedione at the time that this would raise the testosterone
levels of experienced elite athletes by 237 percent in just 15
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt like a volcanic eruption,'' said the East German
Olympic swimmer Rick Hannermann.
</P>
<P>
   Andro came on the U.S. market only a few years ago and is
available over the counter because of the 1994 Dietary Supplement
Health and Education Act. Passed despite the objections of the Food
and Drug Administration, the law produced a new product class: Food
or diet supplements that can be sold without passing any premarket
testing and without any government agency's attesting to their
safety or effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   To the $15 billion supplement industry, andro has been a
bonanza, with derivatives surfacing all the time. But not everyone
in this marketplace condones how it has been marketed to
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young teens shouldn't be using any of these things,'' said Dr.
Scott Connolly, a physician and the founder of MET-Rx, a national
retailer of supplements including the compound androstendiol, an
androstenedione derivative. ``At the same time, there is this
belief that testosterone is bad for you. But there is abundant data
that the normalization of testosterone in the body throughout life
has many benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Connolly said he sees a market that serves avid body builders,
power athletes, and perhaps an aging male population and women
combating obesity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not antiregulation,'' he said. ``But let's take time to
intellectually examine this. A quick decision would be foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT THE PLAYERS SAY: DISCOUNTING RISKS DESPITE THE FEARS
</P>
<P>
   Mike Simms, a third baseman for the Texas Rangers, used andro
last season. He did not notice any significant results, and
stopped. He said his decision not to try it again was cemented when
he began to read that andro could have minimal effects in building
strength and disastrous effects for his health.
</P>
<P>
   ``One article said instead of raising testosterone, it raised
estrogen,'' Simms said. ``I don't know if that's been proven
medically, but when you start hearing stuff like that, that's not
going to help your baseball career.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiosity and confusion about andro, as well as its use, exists
throughout major-league clubhouses a year after McGwire set off
both outbursts of outrage from his detractors and spirited defenses
from his supporters. Mike Piazza of the New York Mets said he tried
andro several years ago, but found it ``overrated'' and gave it up.
Tony Gwynn of the San Diego Padres said andro is talked about
regularly, and used by some.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have discussions about this all the time,'' Gwynn said.
``What if it's the last year of your contract, and you feel you're
not playing well? With the kind of money out there, could creatine
or andro or steroids make a difference in your play? And if you
only take them one year to prolong your career, would it really be
dangerous to your health?''
</P>
<P>
   Most players are more reluctant to speak publicly about their
interest and use. Of the more than 50 players interviewed in recent
weeks, only four admitted to having at least tried andro. Baseball
officials say they believe the number of users is likely higher.
Gene Orza, the associate general counsel for the players' union,
said ``a good number'' of players might be users, probably some on
every major-league team. A handful of team trainers interviewed
said 5 to 10 percent _ 37 to 75 players _ was probably an accurate
figure.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The trainers said they were instinctively against players using
andro. But the trainers, as well as a team doctor in California,
said several reasons might account for the willingness of players
to risk taking the supplement: a belief that it is safe because it
is available; an athlete's sense of invincibility, and a skepticism
about expert opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most professionals have a very nonfatalistic outlook on
life,'' said Larry Starr, a trainer for the Florida Marlins who has
been in baseball for 28 years. ``I don't know if it's a sense of
indestructibility, but it's a sense of being able to withstand most
things, to be able to conquer most things. I think that's the way
they approach this.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an approach that some baseball officials feel has even
greater appeal for young players trying to make it to the majors.
Jim Duquette, an assistant general manager for the Mets, said two
players at the organization's Class A level were taking andro
earlier this year and were eventually sent for counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is a chance to make millions of dollars, some of
them think the risk is worth it,'' Duquette said. ``What we're
trying to tell them is, `You're talented enough to do it without
it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Other players interviewed about andro and baseball's position of
neutrality offered a mix of understanding, mild criticism and
dispirited resignation. Most said they felt the union was playing
the proper role in defending their right to take it while pushing
for more definitive information. Others said andro should be
outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't sound like it's too good for you,'' said Joe
Girardi, the catcher for the Yankees. ``It's amazing the research
they've come out with. It doesn't really help you. If anything, the
stuff is going to hurt you. I don't understand why people would
take it. I mean, yeah, I think it should be banned.''
</P>
<P>
   But Girardi and others said that, at least in part because
baseball has no drug-testing policy in place anyway, enforcement of
any kind _ either through persuasion or policy _ would most likely
be futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys are going to do whatever they have to do to keep up with
the times,'' said Damion Easley of the Detroit Tigers. ``It doesn't
matter what the union or anybody else says. They'll do whatever
they have to do and worry about the consequences later.''
</P>
<P>
   A WORK IN PROGRESS: BASEBALL'S STUDY IS CALLED A STALL
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire admitted last year that he had been taking, and
would continue to take, androstenedione, baseball officials and the
leaders of the players' union came to an agreement. Noting the
legality of andro, they pledged to conduct their own study to
evaluate the product's effects and risks. Two Harvard researchers
undertook the task.
</P>
<P>
   Critics at the time said the study was turning standard drug
product evaluation on its head, by opting to condone the use of a
substance that might be harmful.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly a year later, the researchers remain at work. In an
interview, one of the researchers, Dr. Benjamin Leder, conceded
that he ``agreed with about everything that was written'' in the
recent Iowa State study that asserted andro use might increase the
risk of heart disease or cancer. And Leder said he agreed with the
suggestion of the study's author that the federal government
``carefully consider intervening and removing androstenedione and
its derivatives from the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would recommend to a weekend athlete interested in
experimenting with andro, Leder said: ``I'd tell them little is
known about andro and its possible effects, both beneficial or
toxic side effects. Taking anything when not much is known about it
is risky.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig and Orza said they were unmoved by the current thinking of
the Harvard researchers, and they emphasized that they were
determined to wait until the study was done before coming to a
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the scientists conclude it's something risky, we'll tell
the players it's risky,'' Orza said. ``We're not going to be shoved
into this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   To its critics, baseball's approach seems to be a cynical answer
to a worry about soiling McGwire's record by acknowledging that
during his record-breaking season, he used a substance that might
have artificially made him stronger and less susceptible to injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``The behavior of baseball has been ignorant and arrogant,''
said John Hoberman, a University of Texas professor whose has
studied the use of steroids by East German athletes. ``Andro is a
gateway drug to the use of anabolic steroids in the mainstream of
America. Baseball's position is just irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   One major-league executive, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said that baseball is cognizant of ``protecting''
McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Both Selig and Orza ridicule such claims, calling them
``unfair'' and ``nonsense.''
</P>
<P>
   After announcing early in the year that he intended to use andro
until it was declared illegal or prohibited by baseball, McGwire
has said little about his use of the substance. When he was asked
about his use of it last August, he told reporters that he actually
used andro to improve his sex drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for your sex life,'' McGwire said. ``I'm serious.
You guys think I'm joking, but I'm serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever McGwire's rationale for using andro, he has always had
defenders who have argued that whatever the medical or ethical
wisdom of his use of andro, it could not have played a significant
role in his hitting 70 home runs. Those defenders remain in force.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't have talent, no drug is going to make you be a
better player,'' said Tim Raines, the former Yankee who is now with
the Oakland Athletics. ``Maybe you'll get muscles, it might build
up your body, but it won't make you a ballplayer. You have to have
talent. McGwire didn't get big last year. If there was a guarantee,
I'd be taking it. We all would be taking it.''

<P>
   It took Lee Stevens of the Texas Rangers 11 years to finally
stick in baseball's major leagues. Stevens, 32, is not wasting his
shot; he's chasing every edge he can get.
</P>
<P>
   Androstenedione is one of those edges.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who has hit 14 home runs and driven in 48 runs so far
this season, said that during workouts last winter he used
androstenedione, the diet supplement whose sales have exploded
since Mark McGwire, the first baseman for the St. Louis Cardinals,
acknowledged using it last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take it for a month, take two or three weeks off
and then go back to it just to keep shocking your body,'' Stevens
said recently of his off-season androstenedione use. ``It was doing
something for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens is hardly a rarity in his unhidden but largely anonymous
use of androstenedione. In fact, baseball officials, from union
leaders to individual trainers on major-league clubs, estimate that
from 5 to 10 percent of the 750 players in the major leagues have
used, or are using, androstenedione. Others suspect the number is
higher.
</P>
<P>
   So a year after McGwire acknowledged using the supplement during
his record-breaking, 70-homer season, baseball and androstenedione
remain in a quiet limbo.
</P>

   Baseball has not banned or discouraged the use of

<TEXT>
<P>
   Those eager to limit the availability of the dietary supplement
andro-stenedione include Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's
antidrug chief, who last week said he is trying to finance a study
that could lead to the substance's being labeled a steroid, and
thus ordered off retail shelves across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to expedite the examination of androstenedione and
determine whether it can be classified an anabolic steroid under
the Anabolic Steroids Control Act,'' McCaffrey said.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that sales of androstenedione have exploded since Mark
McGwire acknowledged using the supplement last year during his
70-homer season, McCaffrey said: ``I'd like to get an answer on
andro as a steroid before the first game of this year's World
Series.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, McCaffrey has appealed to the Drug Enforcement
Administration. If the DEA can be convinced that andro is an
anabolic steroid, it can remove all andro-related products from
store shelves immediately, even though the diet supplement has yet
to be linked to any health-related problems in clinical studies.
</P>
<P>
   The steroids control act sets out a three-prong test for
determining what substances are to be registered as steroids. The
substance or drug must be chemically related to testosterone; it
must be pharmacologically related to testosterone (other than
estrogens, progestogens and corticosteroids); and it must be proven
clinically to promote muscle growth.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey said he believes there is ample data to prove that
andro meets the first two criteria for a steroid, leaving the
muscle-building criteria as yet unproven. Such a study, conducted
on animals, would take a few months and cost approximately $25,000,
McCaffrey said. McCaffrey's office is trying to locate funding for
the testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Andro is a precursor to testosterone and there's also reason
to believe that a significant amount of the andro now available is
falsely labeled and also contains testosterone,'' McCaffrey said in
a recent interview. ``Products laced with testosterone are already
illegal. And there's no question that excessive testosterone use
poses significant, immediate risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this huge apparatus in place to keep drugs away from
our youth, and here's a way for young athletes to sidestep doctors
and their parents and order this off the Internet,'' McCaffrey
said. ``There is a growing eagerness to set high school records to
get college scholarships and a growing belief that you've got to
chemically engineer the body to so.''
</P>
<P>
   Supplement makers and representatives of the billion-dollar
sports supplement industry say their androstenedione products are
safe, produced and sold legally, and are not anabolic steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Androstenedione is a safe product,'' said Michael Ford,
executive director of the National Nutritional Foods Association.
``Every time there's a big-selling dietary supplement, it suddenly
becomes controversial.''

   UNITED NATIONS _ The United Nations is preparing to send a large
peacekeeping force to help stabilize Congo once a cease-fire is
signed, despite reservations by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is preparing to recommend that
the Security Council send a force of between 15,000 and 20,000
soldiers, mainly drawn from African countries.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States has expressed its misgivings about the
likely size and expense of such an operation, officials and
diplomats say, evidently fearful that Congress will balk at paying
its 31 percent share of the bill at a time when it is already
paying for peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali
proposed sending a 4,700-member force to suppress the genocide
under way in Rwanda, the United States blocked the plan, citing the
tight new restrictions President Clinton had placed on U.S. support
for new peacekeeping operations the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   But officials here say Annan feels strongly that having played a
prominent role in ending the conflicts in former Yugoslavia, the
United Nations must in all fairness do as much to help restore
peace to Congo.

IN SHIFT, ULSTER APPROVES PROTESTANT MARCH IN BELFAST ON MONDAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ireland _ The British government in Northern Ireland on
Saturday approved the holding of a perennially contentious
Protestant Orange Order parade Monday near a Roman Catholic
neighborhood in Belfast, the capital of the northern province.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Catholic residents' objections that the event could
produce violent clashes, as it has in the past, the Parades
Commission said the Orange march could muster in a park across the
narrow Lagan River, several hundred yards from the Catholic enclave
on the Lower Ormeau Road.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, violence was averted when the commission refused to
allow the parade to pass directly in front of Catholic houses.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier last week, the commission at first denied the Orange
Order the right to gather in the park, but changed its decision
Saturday, saying the event could be held.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of police officers of the Royal Ulster Constabulary are
expected to patrol the area, particularly a bridge that connects
the park and the Catholic neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a difficult decision to make, and we are conscious of
the worries in the Catholic community,'' said Alastair Graham, the
chairman of the government-appointed Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Of the Protestants who will march, he said, ``They have made
significant changes and we are convinced this can be a peaceful
gathering.''
</P>
<P>
   Any major eruption of violence Monday could further delay the
next step in the peace effort in the province. This week, members
of the Northern Ireland Assembly are supposed to form a Cabinet to
pave the way for the transfer of governmental powers from London to
the assembly, under the terms of a proposal made a week ago by
Prime Ministers Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no certainty that this will happen, as Protestant
leaders have serious misgivings about sharing a Cabinet with Sinn
Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army. The
Protestant Unionists want the IRA to start disarming before Sinn
Fein is allowed Cabinet posts. The IRA, which has observed a
cease-fire for two years, says it has no intention to disarm.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, a poll in The Irish Times in Dublin indicated that
most people in the North, including Protestants, wanted the Cabinet
to be formed as proposed by the prime ministers by Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's parade in Belfast will be one of hundreds around the
predominantly Protestant province celebrating the victory in the
Battle of the Boyne in 1690 by the army of William of Orange, the
Protestant king who defeated his Catholic father-in-law, James II.
Most of the parades pass off without trouble. But a few, like the
Lower Ormeau Road march, are volatile.
</P>
<P>
   Eight years ago, five Catholic men were shot dead by Protestant
guerrillas in the Sean Graham betting shop on the Lower Ormeau
Road. A few months later, Protestants marching by the shop in the
annual parade held up five fingers to taunt Catholic onlookers,
many of whom already felt that the march was insulting and
triumphal.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Ormeau Road march was banned last year, parading
Protestants were stoned by Catholics and there were clashes between
the police and Catholic demonstrators. The week before last, the
government blocked part of another Protestant parade, in Portadown,
west of Belfast, from going through the Catholic area of Drumcree.

A NEW JERSEY COMMUNITY REMEMBERS AN EX-RESIDENT EX-PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SADDLE RIVER, N.J. _ Some people in Westchester County, N.Y.,
are atwitter and others are aghast at the possibility that the
President and Mrs. Clinton might settle there at the end of the
Clinton presidency. If they do, they will hardly be the first
former presidential family to head this way. After all, Ulysses S.
Grant retired to East 63rd Street in Manhattan, Grover Cleveland
retired to Princeton, N.J., Theodore Roosevelt went back to
Sagamore Hill on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Richard M. Nixon, wishing to be closer to his
daughters and their families in New York and Philadelphia, who was
the last former president to choose the New York suburbs for his
retirement home.
</P>
<P>
   After living for several years in Manhattan, Nixon moved to this
north Bergen County Republican redoubt in 1981 and stayed for
almost nine years in a big house on five wooded acres. He is
remembered here today as the private man in the coat and tie who
was devoted to his staff, generous to children and liked to keep to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be completely different with the Clintons,''
said Saddle River Police Chief Robert Re, who headed Nixon's
private security detail from 1985 on. ``Just think of the Clinton
entourage.''
</P>
<P>
   People in the plusher parts of Westchester County may fret at
the prospect of a boisterous ex-president and his politically
ambitious wife moving to their neighborhood, but Saddle River
quickly learned that, at nearly 70 years old, Nixon was beyond the
tumult of public life when he moved here, and once settled, he
spent his years more as a half-remembered headline than as a
continuing event.
</P>
<P>
   With Mrs. Nixon in frail health, the Nixons did not join a
church, did not take up with a circle of local friends, and did not
join the Valley Club, a social group for couples of a certain age
and rank in Saddle River.
</P>
<P>
   When he traveled, it was in one car with a plainclothes man at
the wheel, but no outriders or escort vehicles. He got his hair cut
by Dominick Parisi in Ho-Ho-Kus, ate lunch at Valentino's in Park
Ridge, and after giving up the commute to his office at Federal
Plaza in Manhattan, worked in an office in adjoining Woodcliff
Lake.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations? ``Now and then, we'd have some kids along the
road going, `Heyyy, Tricky Dick!''' Re said, doing a pretty good
two-armed Nixon victory salute. ``But what's that? That's
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   There were visitors, but mostly dignitaries and statesmen. Not
the people next door. ``I don't think he had a friend who could
call up and say, `Hey, let's go bowling,' '' said Mario Perillo,
the head of a tour company and a neighbor of the Nixons. ``To most
people, he was the lonely figure with the flashlight, walking his
dog at night.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet everyone seemed to know what Nixon was doing in his house:
writing. Four books came out of Saddle River, all on foreign policy
and all best sellers. If he made a local impact, it was as the
famously generous man in a coat and tie at Halloween, handing out
candy and printed cards bearing the message, ``President and Mrs.
Nixon wish you a happy Halloween.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, Re said, the former president could even laugh at the
occasional trick-or-treater in a Nixon mask.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Clintons, the Nixons used friends and former staff
members to scout the New York region for suitable houses, and they
looked in Westchester and on Long Island, too. The Secret Service
wanted a house on several acres, to allow a decent security buffer,
and they wanted proximity to New York City, a secluded pool for
Nixon to swim in, and a backyard deck for Mrs. Nixon, said Kathy
O'Connor, the former president's chief of staff at Saddle River,
and now the assistant executive director of the Richard Nixon
Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved that house,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the house is owned by an overseas businessman and seems
from the outside a bit gloomy and unlived-in. Evidence of elaborate
security cameras is everywhere, but it's old stuff, Re said.
</P>
<P>
   The room off the garage that had been the former president's
security ready room is now a small gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Saddle River Mayor Theodore Anthony said: ``I think Mr. Nixon
just wanted to live a quiet life to make up for whatever happened
in his past. I think he was just trying to rebuild.''

INDIA SAYS IT HAS EVICTED MOST PAKISTANI FIGHTERS IN KASHMIR 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ India's prime minister said Saturday that the
military had chased out most of the Pakistani soldiers who have
occupied strategic mountain tops on the Indian side of Kashmir,
even as Pakistan's prime minister continued efforts to convince men
he insists are Islamic freedom fighters, not Pakistani soldiers, to
withdraw voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two months, India has used the combined weight of
its army and air force to evict about 700 men who had infiltrated
several miles inside Indian territory to control rugged peaks that
overlook and threaten a critical military supply line in the Kargil
sector of the disputed territory of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``The enemy's intrusion and aggression in Kargil have now been
decisively turned back,'' India's prime minister, Atal Behari
Vajpayee, said in an address to army commanders Saturday. ``Our
military has achieved this. Most pockets have already been
cleared.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian officials also said Saturday that a North Korean cargo
ship seized last week was carrying the makings of tactical
surface-to-surface missiles destined for Pakistan. Military experts
here have long maintained that North Korea has aided Pakistan in
nuclear weapons development.
</P>
<P>
   Both India and Pakistan successfully tested nuclear bombs last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Vajpayee's counterpart in Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, met Saturday
with his Cabinet ministers and laid plans to address the nation on
Monday on his decision to call on the Islamic militants to pull
back. Pakistani officials have been arguing that the militants have
already achieved their objective: to put Kashmir back on the
international agenda.
</P>
<P>
   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over the Himalayan land
that lies between them since the two nations were created in 1947,
and each wants Kashmir for itself.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Sharif met President Clinton and promised to seek
the withdrawal of the militants. U.S. officials have said they
believe that Pakistan is behind the infiltration and have pressed
Sharif to see to a pullout so peaceful negotiations between India
and Pakistan could begin again.
</P>
<P>
   After Sharif met with his top military and civilian leaders, the
Pakistani government issued a statement saying the Muslim holy
warriors, or mujahedeen, should withdraw so the world could focus
on finding a resolution to the Kashmir dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistan has said the operation in Kashmir is manned by the
mujahedeen, whom it claims not to control, and operates with no
logistical or military support from Pakistan. India has maintained
that the intruders are mostly Pakistani army regulars.
</P>
<P>
   After issuing the statement on Friday calling for the
withdrawal, Sharif met with representatives of mujahedeen groups.
The News, a leading Pakistani English language daily, on Saturday
quoted an unidentified spokesman for the United Jihad Council, an
umbrella organization of the mujahedeen, as saying the group was
considering proposals to pull their men out.
</P>
<P>
   But Abu Shabazz, a spokesman for the council, issued a press
statement that dismissed the report as baseless. For now, it
appeared that the group was sticking to its holy war. But after
hearing Sharif's plea, they will have the option to declare victory
and go home, or to go back to the hit-and-run operations that they
are known for in Kashmir.

HARLEM'S STORIED CARVER BANK STRIVES TO WEATHER PAINFUL PASSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By LESLIE EATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a symbol of Harlem's economic revival, almost
nothing would seem to beat the Carver Bank building on 125th
Street. Four shiny stories of stone and brass and skylights, it is
a monument to the savings bank's five-decade transformation from a
struggling storefront to a pillar of its flourishing community _
and the largest African-American financial institution in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   But the bright facade is deceiving. In the last few years,
Carver has been beset by almost every problem a bank can face,
including fire, fraud and deadbeat borrowers. It has annoyed
customers, infuriated shareholders and angered some community
leaders. And it has lost a lot of money _ $4.5 million in the last
fiscal year alone.
</P>
<P>
   Now a new president, Deborah Wright, 41, must try to bring into
the 21st century an institution that she concedes is about 15 years
behind the times _ and whose last effort to modernize ended in
financial disaster.
</P>
<P>
   And she may not have much time. Kevin Cohee, a rival banker from
Boston who has proposed merging his black-owned bank with Carver,
plans to run for a seat on the Carver board at the annual meeting
later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of folks with very different visions of what
this bank should be,'' Ms. Wright said recently. But, she added,
``they are really all pressuring us to the same place'' _
profitability.
</P>
<P>
   To many people in Harlem and the other neighborhoods the bank
serves, Carver's history _ and its survival as an independent,
black-run bank _ mean a lot. ``It is a very important institution
both in terms of practicality and in terms of its symbolism,'' said
the Rev. Calvin Butts, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in
Harlem, who got his own home mortgage from Carver.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Carver can recover will have implications far beyond New
York. While they are writ large at Carver, the bank's problems are
shared by many other minority-owned financial institutions, which
tend to be small, conservative operations serving rural or
inner-city neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctance of these banks to take risks _ a trait that
served them so well during tough times, including the savings and
loan crisis of the early 1980s _ has become a handicap in the
rapidly changing world of banking. Merely providing a place for
people to park their money is no longer enough for minority-owned
banks, their communities or their customers.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s, bank customers expect instant access to their
money, which requires expensive investments in technology. Big
banks, forced by federal law to lend money in inner cities, have
discovered that they can make money there, and loom as formidable
competitors to Carver on its own turf.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is only getting tougher as banks merge (remember
Chemical? Manufacturers Hanover?) or team up with brokerage and
insurance concerns (witness Citigroup, the behemoth created by the
combination of Citicorp and Travelers Group). Indeed, both houses
of Congress have passed legislation meant to remove many of the
regulations that have governed banking since the Great Depression,
further blurring the line between savings banks like Carver and
other financial institutions, like commercial banks and brokerage
firms.
</P>
<P>
   This brave new world has been hard for many banks, but
minority-owned institutions have particular problems, said William
Cunningham, president of Creative Investment Research in
Washington, a company that monitors minority-owned financial
institutions. ``They're too small, their costs are too high, and
there's not a lot of innovation or vision about using the resources
they have.''
</P>
<P>
   That caution can be explained by their history. Born in the days
of Jim Crow or the early years of the civil rights movement,
black-owned banks and savings and loans were for decades the only
financial institutions serving their communities. They may not have
faced much competition, but neither did they have many financial
resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Growth hasn't always been the issue _ survival has,'' said
Dina Nichelson, president of the American League of Financial
Institutions, a trade association for minority-owned savings and
loans. The number of savings institutions with black, Hispanic or
female managers has dwindled, she said, from more than 100 two
decades ago to no more than 40 today.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of these banks, Carver has been a prisoner of its
past. It opened on 125th Street in 1949 with the backing of the
cream of Harlem's black businessmen, as well as clergymen like the
Rev. M. Moran Weston of St. Philip's Episcopal Church on 134th
Street.
</P>
<P>
   The founders stuck around for decades. Weston and Richard
Greene, the longtime bank president, did not retire from the board
until 1997, when both were well into their 80s. When it came time
to pick new board members, they favored civic leaders like former
Mayor David Dinkins over businesspeople or bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Innovators they were not. Carver did not get its first automated
teller machine until 1989 _ long after they had become commonplace
at other banks _ and its idea of advertising was mailing out a
calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse than change, in board members' minds, was risk. Banks
make most of their money _ and take most of their risk _ making
loans. Carver made almost no loans, except to churches. Instead,
like many other minority-owned banks, it simply accepted deposits
and invested them in money market funds and mortgage securities,
generating consistent but small profits.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's caution only intensified in late 1990, when
neighboring Freedom National Bank, then one of the largest
black-owned banks in the nation, failed after having expanded too
aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   The memory of depositors lined up on 125th Street to try to get
their money out of Freedom haunted Carver's board members, said
David R. Jones, who joined the board in 1989 and is now its
chairman. A former city official who is president of New York's
oldest family welfare organization, the Community Service Society
of New York, has had an account at Carver since he was a child.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Carver started having problems of its own. A fire
destroyed the bank's headquarters, forcing customers to take
shuttle buses from Harlem to an office far downtown, in Chelsea, or
to use branches as far away as Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn or
St. Albans in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Jones said, regulators began to complain that Carver
had too little capital. The bank's board for once decided to do the
trendy thing _ sell shares in the bank, which had been owned by its
depositors, to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wright, now the bank president, recalled being appalled by
the news. She worked on Wall Street for three years in the 1980s.
``I didn't think they had any idea of the vast difference in what
would be expected in terms of reporting, or of the rigor of focus
on performance,'' she said, adding that she visited Weston, the
bank's chairman, to beg him not to take it public.
</P>
<P>
   The deal went forward anyway _ and in 1994 Carver made headlines
when its shares plunged instead of soaring like those of most newly
public savings and loans, as investors looked askance at its poor
profitability and low levels of lending. The bank took a $250,000
charge in November to settle a class action lawsuit brought by
investors who claimed that they had been misled when the bank went
public.
</P>
<P>
   Even after raising more than $20 million, the bank was still not
making loans. To this day, Federal regulators rate Carver's
community reinvestment activity as only satisfactory, rather than
the ``outstanding'' rating that they give Greenpoint Financial, the
Dime Bancorp and Chase, which has three branches on 125th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Some Harlem leaders contend that Carver has not kept up with the
changes in the communities it serves, as the middle-class families
with Caribbean backgrounds _ like those who founded the bank _ were
displaced by immigrants from Africa, the Dominican Republic, Mexico
and the West Indies. Carver ``did not keep up with changing times,
did not go where the people were,'' said Greater Harlem Chamber of
Commerce president Lloyd Williams, whose grandparents were charter
depositors at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   The bank did start to change under Thomas Clark, a former state
banking regulator who became president of Carver in 1995. It began
to make mortgage loans, and it bought loans originated by other
banks. This move was expensive, but it increased earnings over
time.
</P>
<P>
   But there were serious missteps. A new finance official was
arrested on charges of trying to defraud the bank; a new computer
system faltered and cost millions of dollars to fix. Grand plans to
expand in Westchester County never came to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   The worst mistake was a disastrous foray into credit cards, auto
loans and other consumer lending. These areas are not intrinsically
unprofitable _ some banks make big money in them _ but Carver was
not equipped to do so. The board fired Clark in January; he is now
a senior executive at E.G. Bowman, a black-owned insurance
brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Loan losses and computer costs forced Carver to take a $7.8
million charge, which more than wiped out its earnings. It ended
its fiscal year on March 31 with a loss of $4.5 million. Regulators
sharply downgraded the bank, and restricted its ability to make
loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a soap opera that compressed everything that
would happen to a bank into three or four years,'' said Jones, the
board chairman.
</P>
<P>
   After an extensive search by a recruiting firm, Carver's board
decided to hire Ms. Wright as the new president. One of her chief
assets, Jones said, was her ability to put together strong teams of
people without offering top salaries. As the city's housing
commissioner and then president of the Upper Manhattan Empowerment
Zone, she had a good reputation in the community and among
nonprofit groups.
</P>
<P>
   What she lacks is experience in commercial banking; indeed, she
lacks much commercial experience of any kind, as Cohee _ the Boston
banker who was once her classmate at Harvard _ likes to point out.
</P>
<P>
   The board ``took a leap of faith on me,'' Ms. Wright said
candidly.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hoped to make the bank better at serving people
like her, who would like to have accounts there if the services
were as good as those at other banks. She would like the bank to
advise local businessmen and women, not just on raising money, but
on finding successors to run their companies. And she dreams of
serving customers who are uneasy about banks but who must
increasingly deal with electronic paychecks and benefits and tax
refunds.
</P>
<P>
   But she sounds pragmatic: ``We can't serve those people if we
don't have our act together.''
</P>
<P>
   The shareholders, however, may not be willing to wait. The
bank's historically poor financial performance has meant that,
during the greatest stock market surge in American history, the
price of Carver's shares has actually fallen, from $10 in late 1994
to $8.25 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   At the last two annual meetings, more than a quarter of those
who voted favored a shareholder's proposal to try to sell the bank.
The shareholder, Joseph Sonnenberg, a Manhattan retiree who lives
off his investments, said he planned to offer the proposal again
this year. The bank, he said, ``has to prove a lot and I don't want
to wait around that long.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not the only one. Martin Whitman, one of Wall Street's
most seasoned investors, is Carver's biggest shareholder, with
almost 10 percent of the shares. ``The African-American community
needs some way to have a financial institution to call their own,''
he said. But he added, ``Obviously I have no reason to be terribly
supportive of the old board or the new CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Cohee, who owns about 7 percent of Carver's shares
and wants to join the board. He said he was not married to the idea
of merging Carver with his Boston Bank of Commerce, which is much
smaller but far more profitable. But things need to change, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a responsibility as an African-American who runs a
community development institution and knows what impact this type
of institution has on its community to see that the bank is strong
enough to support the dreams and aspirations of its community,'' he
said. ``If it isn't in a position to be effective, many people are
hurt by that failure.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is predicting that the bank will fail; for one thing,
federal regulators now have a mandate to preserve minority-owned
institutions. But whether Carver can stay independent and thrive is
unclear, especially if the economy turns sour or interest rates
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Other minority-owned banks around the country, facing many of
the same problems and faced with the need to raise money that
Carver had in the early 1990's, are watching the bank carefully,
hoping that it will become a successful prototype for the
minority-owned bank of the future. ``They're sort of paving the way
in a lot of areas right now,'' said Bob Adkins, senior vice
president of Broadway Financial Corp., which runs a $140 million
savings bank in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   And even those who have sometimes been unhappy with the bank are
rooting for it now. ``Carver is critical to the growth and
development of Harlem, the Harlems of New York City,'' said
Williams of the Chamber of Commerce. ``And if you believe Langston
Hughes, as goes Harlem, so goes black and Hispanic America.''

   A Florida man paid $451,541 at an auction Friday for the flannel
pinstriped New York Yankee uniform worn by Lou Gehrig 60 years ago
when the first baseman declared himself the ``luckiest man on the
face of the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning bidder was identified as a South Florida sportsman,
who wanted to remain anonymous until Tuesday or Wednesday, said
Marty Appel, a spokesman for Leland's auction house in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Leland's was uncertain if anyone would pay as much as $295,000,
the minimum bid set for the size 46 uniform, the centerpiece of a
two-day sports auction done entirely by telephone, fax or online.
But three bidders pushed the price up five times from the minimum,
with the winner concluding it by phone.
</P>
<P>
   The uniform ranks as the third most expensive article of sports
memorabilia, after the $3 million paid for Mark McGwire's 70th home
run ball and the $640,500 paid for a rare Honus Wagner tobacco
card.
</P>
<P>
   The four sellers of the uniform paid $306,000 two years ago to
buy it from Barry Halper, the New Jersey collector who is a limited
partner in the Yankees. Halper acquired it in 1971 from Gehrig's
widow, Eleanor, who swapped it for six bottles of J&AMP;B scotch.

TEAMS IN NEW BALL PARKS LOOK TO THEIR ROLE MODEL 
LOTS OF LOSSES AT THE BREAK 
AN ABUNDANCE OF ROOKIE PITCHERS 
DODGERS READY TO DEAL
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Cleveland Indians set the standard. Beginning this Thursday
with the Seattle Mariners, a growing group of teams will try to
achieve it: move into new park, sell it out every game, finish
first every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Indians are one of the great success stories of the
'90s,'' Gerry Hunsicker, general manager of the Houston Astros,
said. ``They are the exception rather than the rule. There have
been other new parks that have emerged in the last few years and
nobody has come close to duplicating what the Indians have done. So
doing that would be somewhat of a stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   The new park has been only one ingredient in the Indians'
remarkable turnaround, a team well on its way to its fifth
consecutive division championship after it had endured seven
successive losing seasons and 13 of 14 before moving into Jacobs
Field in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not only the new park that created their success,''
Hunsicker said, ``but a lot of other things beginning with the
structure of the organization and what they've been able to
accomplish within the organization. A new ball park doesn't
guarantee anything. It still comes back to the people running the
organization and the team you're able to put on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are one of four teams that will move into new parks
next season. They will leave the Astrodome for the Ballpark at
Union Station. The San Francisco Giants will exit 3Com Park, nee
Candlestick, for Pacific Bell Park. In Milwaukee, the Brewers will
abandon County Stadium for Miller Park. The Detroit Tigers will
forsake 88-year-old Tiger Stadium for Comercia Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will ignite the mass migration this Thursday when
they play the San Diego Padres at brand spanking new Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   The question all of these teams have to ponder is this: Are they
in the position they wanted to be for their move; that is, are they
prepared to try to capitalize on their new parks the way the
Indians did? The answers vary.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros and the Giants, who have held first or second place
all season, are in better shape than the Mariners, the Tigers and
the Brewers. The Mariners, on the other hand, have some elements,
namely Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez, that the Tigers and the
Brewers don't have.
</P>
<P>
   But will they have them for long? ``We've received a commitment
from ownership to do what we can to extend their contracts beyond
2000,'' said Chuck Armstrong, the club's president. ``Ownership has
assured us the resources are there to try to retain them.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of Griffey and Rodriguez, who could become free
agents after the 2000 season, recently became a hot topic of
discussion in Seattle when they were linked, fairly or not, to a
dispute between the Mariners and the Public Facilities District,
the agency that oversaw construction of the $517 million park, over
payment of $100 million by which the cost exceeded the budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners, who have not resembled contenders all season,
conceivably could still challenge Texas for the American League
West title, but they would have to discover some pitching to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it matters what our position is this season,''
Woodward said. ``The fact that we're moving into the stadium should
put us in a very nice situation in this market. It gives us half a
season to experience the stadium and see if it's more hitter
friendly or pitcher friendly.''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong said he would like to see the Mariners become more fan
friendly. ``We'd like to improve ourselves a little bit, possibly
on the trade front, and hopefully win the AL West again,'' he said.
``We hope moving into Safeco Field will give us a boost.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive was talking about a playing boost. On the economic
side, he estimated that revenue could rise by about $9 million or
$10 million beyond what it would have been at the Kingdome for the
remaining 42 home games. Other new parks, he said, have created an
additional $18 million to $25 million a year. Woodward cautioned
that no one should be fooled by the advantages of a new park.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new stadium won't make a small-market club a big-market
club,'' he said. ``The Mariners won't become the Yankees. But it
will enhance your present position.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers and the Brewers are in the shakiest positions as they
approach their new parks, because they haven't progressed as
rapidly as they had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Tigers were ready to take their run at the Indians'
standard, Randy Smith, their general manager, said: ``If you had
asked this question in April, I'd have said we're right where we
want to be. But guys who have been productive for us in the past
haven't been productive. We still feel we have a lot of talent on
this club, but we need a star or a face guy that elevates everyone
around him. That's our goal between now and next season.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers, who fired their pitching coach Friday, are certainly
not on track to finish close to .500 or a game or two over, which
is what Smith said he had expected. They are, in fact, playing at a
rate that would give them a record only a victory or two better
than last season's 65-97.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Smith said, ``I think we're a heckuva lot closer to winning
than being the club our record indicates.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he showed how closely he has studied the Indians'
development. ``They were 76-86 before they moved into Jacobs
Field,'' he said. ``We have a chance to approach that or do better
even though we haven't played well.''
</P>
<P>
   But returning to reality, Smith acknowledged that the Indians'
feat ``may be a once-in-a-lifetime thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sal Bando knows how Smith feels. As general manager of the
Brewers, he has presided over disappointment, too. ``The ideal
situation would be to be more competitive than we are at the
present time,'' Bando said. ``The worst scenario would be that we'd
be in the middle of the pack, then add some pieces to be
competitive in our first year in the new stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   But, noting the process the Brewers began in 1994, he added:
``You've got to be right on in your predictions of when your guys
are going to mature. We may be one year behind or two years behind,
but right now we aren't where we thought we'd be.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his counterparts, Bando is envious of the Indians' success
but said: ``One thing you don't have now that you did then was the
ability to take Joe Carter and his million-dollar contract and
trade him and get prospects. Today you can't trade your $8 million
player and do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Indians traded Carter nearly 10 years ago, a year before he
could become a free agent, for Sandy Alomar Jr. and Carlos Baerga,
who grew into part of the nucleus that took Jacobs Field by storm.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Tigers, the Brewers' plan to increase their payroll for
next season, but Bando was wary about how he would be able to go
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is who will be out there and can we get him,'' he
said. ``If we want him, others will, too, and will we be able to
spend what others will?''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, solid contenders for the third successive season,
don't have the problems the Brewers and the Tigers have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've more or less accomplished our goal of being the best
team, the best organization we can be going into the new park,''
General Manager Brian Sabean said. ``If you can accomplish that,
the new park will enhance things. The new park won't make us a
better team or organization. You have to do that with people first.
I think we've succeeded in doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Sabean said, the Giants look forward to maintaining their
position and the increased revenue the new park will bring.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who are working on their third consecutive division
championship, have a similar outlook.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started our plan a couple years early,'' Hunsicker, their
general manager, said. ``We've allowed our payroll to increase
rather significantly in anticipation of moving into the new park.
We had a solid nucleus we wanted to try to keep in place going in
there. I'm pleased with what we have.''

 UNDATED: what we have.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lots of Losses at the Break
</P>
<P>
   When Steve Trachsel pitches for the Chicago Cubs Saturday night,
he will be going for his 13th loss. The last pitcher who reached
the All-Star Game break with at least 13 losses, Elias Sports
Bureau research reveals, was Bill Wegman of the Milwaukee Brewers,
who suffered his 14th loss in 1993 in the team's 81st game July 6
and didn't start again that season. He spent more than two months
on the disabled list with a strained forearm and a stomach
disorder. Fourteen losses in 81 games can do that.
</P>
<P>
   The last National League pitcher who achieved that ignominious
level of 13 losses was Jose DeLeon of Pittsburgh, who had a 2-13
record at the break in 1985. He finished the season with a 2-19
record after spending four weeks in the minor leagues and then,
after returning and reaching 19 losses, being relegated to the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   An Abundance of Rookie Pitchers
</P>
<P>
   The major leagues, by necessity, are filled with rookie
pitchers. Some of them even win a game now and then. Jose Jimenez
of St. Louis has become the best known rookie pitcher because he
pitched a no-hitter against Arizona and beat Randy Johnson while
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Weaver of Detroit, Odalis Perez of Atlanta, Kris Benson of
Pittsburgh and Freddy Garcia and John Halama of Seattle have
pitched and won enough for fans to start recognizing their names.
</P>
<P>
   But who among those fans can identify Pat Daneker, Gil Meche,
Jeremy Powell, Wade Miller and Mike Fyhrie? They are rookie
pitchers who made their first major league starts last week:
Daneker for the Chicago White Sox, Powell for Montreal, Miller for
Houston and Meche and Fyhrie against each other in a game between
Seattle and Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers Ready to Deal
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Dodgers, embarrassed beyond belief, are trying
to make some moves to shake up their last-place team. The baseball
grapevine says they are trying to trade Ismael Valdes, one of their
underachieving starting pitchers, and have talked with Detroit
about a swap of first basemen, Eric Karros for Tony Clark. ... The
Colorado Rockies, who have unsuccessfully tried to trade Darryl
Kile, their disappointing starting pitcher, have apparently decided
to expand their efforts in remaking their disappointing team. Dante
Bichette and others are available. The team's ownership has
discovered that the hiring of manager Jim Leyland at $2 million a
year was not the answer. ``They've found out that Don Baylor was
not the problem,'' an executive of another team said, referring to
Leyland's predecessor. ... A rumor surfaced last week that Bud
Selig had just completed his first year as commissioner. Try
telling that to Sue Selig, his wife. She knows that he has been
commissioner for seven years, longer than five of his eight
predecessors.

FRENCH BOAT UNDER WRAPS FOR ADMIRAL'S CUP  
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When it comes to offshore racing, few regattas in the world
compare to the Champagne Mumm Admiral's Cup. Like sterling on
damask, it is a prestigious yacht-racing affair seldom tarnished by
the avant-garde of open sailboat design.
</P>
<P>
   But the French are hearing none of that this year. In a test of
will and foresight, the Admiral's Cup team from France is arriving
in Cowes, England, with an odd duck under glass. It comes in the
form of a wing-shaped mast, steep topsides and a narrow hull. To
heighten the yacht's mystery, the 50-foot Krazy K-Yote Two has been
kept under wraps like a new sports car at an auto show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either it's a great boat, or it's not,'' said Ken Read,
helmsman for the U.S. team's 50-foot rival, Idler, a Nelson/Marek
design. ``When we see it on the race course for the first time,
it's going to be a case of, `Uh-oh,' or `We're OK' We're going to
know in five minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight-race series is to begin Thursday off Cowes. Nine
international groups are entered, including three-boat teams from
England, Germany, Italy, Australia, the Netherlands and the United
States, and groups from Europe and the British Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   Each will race with a prerequisite complement of three boats: a
big-boat, a 50-footer rated under handicapping rules; a
medium-sized boat, a Sydney 40 rated under its one-design class
rules; and a small boat, a Mumm 36, governed by its class rules.
</P>
<P>
   How is it then that one of the big boats of the fleet, the
French Krazy K-Yote Two, can keep word about its design so quiet?
By not sailing it until the day of the race start, that's how.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the problems with innovative things like this is that
the rule-makers try to eventually ban them,'' said David Schwarz,
president of Goetz Marine Technology, the company in Bristol, R.I.,
that made the French boat's controversial mast. ``Good or bad.''
</P>
<P>
   The sports' handicap rules are like moving targets on water,
ever changeable, ever maddening to boat owners and architects. If a
design is innovative, the rule-makers try to discourage its
duplication as a way of reducing costs for other owners.
</P>
<P>
   But for a yacht's designers and builders, new ideas at the
higher echelons of the sport are sales for the future that tend to
filter down to the recreational boater. The winged mast on the 1983
America's Cup yacht was one such example.
</P>
<P>
   Still, on the Admiral's Cup level, the hullabaloo about the
French boat may be more hot air than haute coup. ``I saw it sailing
over the weekend,'' said U.S. team captain Bob Towse. ``It is
radical. But I wouldn't want to guess how it will do. There are no
slow boats out there. No boat will be easy to beat. They're all
well sailed. I think it will be difficult for any boat to win this
Admiral's Cup. We've got the people on our team, and we've made the
preparation. But we've also got the competitors.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rare accommodation in racing's elite, Towse bowed out from
the 50-foot division for this Admiral's Cup to one of his own
keenest rivals, United Technologies chief executive George David,
of Hartford, Conn., who owns Idler. In three previous Admiral's Cup
events, Towse, who is a managing director of Morgan, Stanley Dean
Witter &AMP; Co., the brokerage firm, came close to winning by bringing
a series of big boats that he personally owned and named Blue
Yankee.
</P>
<P>
   In the event this week, Towse will be chartering a new Sydney 40
from its builder, Bashford Boats of Australia. He has named the
yacht Blue Yankee Pride, and stacked its decks with highly seasoned
yachtsmen who have Olympic and America's Cup backgrounds. They
include Steve Benjamin, Peter Isler and Jim Brady. The United
States' small boat, the Mumm 36, is named Ciao Baby.
</P>
<P>
   Read, who was the big-boat helmsman on the victorious U.S. team
in the 1997 Admiral's Cup, said he believed the winner this year is
a toss-up. ``That's the million-dollar question,'' he said. ``On
Idler, which is the only boat I have any control over, we have tons
of experience and an owner who will let us do anything we want to
do to make the team better. From my personal standpoint, I feel
we're going to do great. But as a team, it's a tough read.'' &QL;

NFL NOTEBOOK: IF PHILLIPS COMES BACK, HE MAY BE SUSPENDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE FREEMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the National Football League, a 1,000-yard season and the
seduction that is talent can go a long way to repairing a checkered
past. If you dragged your girlfriend down three flights of stairs,
punched her in the head and then kicked her in the chest, all can
be forgiven if the talent is there. If you are jailed for 23 days
because of a probation violation and drunken driving, you will get
another chance. Accused of assaulting a second, and then later a
third woman? No problem _ a team will come calling anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Phillips . . . he's baaacckk. Or at least on his way to
a return in the National Football League. Although he has more
baggage than an airline during the Christmas holidays, Phillips
will probably join an NFL team this summer after a great year in
NFL Europe. Phillips was the league's most valuable player on
offense, rushing for a record 1,021 yards _ just 288 yards fewer
than the total he rushed for in his two NFL seasons _ and scored 14
touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL had wondered whether Phillips would ever break out and
show the talent that made him a first-round draft pick of the St.
Louis Rams in 1996. He finally did it in Europe and now teams are
stumbling over themselves to get another shot at him.
</P>
<P>
   The league office is taking a much more cautious approach,
though. Indeed, Phillips could face disciplinary action should he
sign with an NFL team.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips' resume is disturbing. In 1995, at the University of
Nebraska, Phillips was found guilty of assaulting his girlfriend
after a brutal attack in which he dragged her down several flights
of stairs and then beat her. He received one year of probation,
then violated it in late 1996 when he was arrested on a drunken
driving charge. He was jailed for 23 days. That was followed by a
no-contest plea after he was charged with threatening the police
when they responded to a woman's assertion that Phillips had
assaulted her at a hotel party in Nebraska in early 1997. Although
assault charges were not filed against him, the incident resulted
in four lawsuits, which were later settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams finally tired of Phillips' problems, which included
sleeping through or arriving late for a number of team meetings,
and released him on Nov. 20, 1997. Two weeks after he was cut, the
Miami Dolphins signed Phillips to a two-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   While he was with the Dolphins, Phillips was accused of twice
punching a woman in the face at a Miami-area nightclub after she
refused to dance with him. A month later, the Dolphins released
him, and last February Phillips pleaded no contest to misdemeanor
battery and was sentenced to six months' probation.
</P>
<P>
   It is that last arrest on which the league office is focusing
because it occurred after the NFL adopted its violent-crime policy.
That policy states that any player who is convicted of a violent
crime must undergo league-sponsored counseling and may be suspended
without pay.
</P>
<P>
   Under the policy, a plea bargain is considered the same as a
guilty verdict, which means that if Phillips signs with an NFL
team, he could conceivably be suspended for a significant portion
of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The length of any such suspension would be up to commissioner
Paul Tagliabue. Phillips is expected to meet with Tagliabue within
the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the NFL is concerned, just because he stayed out of
trouble in Europe does not mean the league will forget what he did
while he was playing with Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Ravens coach Brian Billick met with Phillips in Atlanta last
Thursday, and Phillips is expected to visit with Ravens owner Art
Modell and others in the organization next week. Modell said
Baltimore will not sign Phillips until he has a clear understanding
about whether Phillips is going to be suspended and for how long.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is going to be suspended for a year,'' said Modell,
``what is the point in signing him?''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there remains strong interest in him from more than half
a dozen teams, including two of the best.
</P>
<P>
   Phillips visited the Green Bay Packers and the San Francisco
49ers last week. The 49ers may want Phillips to replace Garrison
Hearst, whose playing days could be over because of a condition
similar to the one that ended the career of the two-sport star Bo
Jackson almost a decade ago. Hearst, who broke his left ankle in a
playoff game against Atlanta last season, is no longer receiving a
sufficient supply of blood to the bone.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay general manager Ron Wolf believes Phillips has matured
and can stay out of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``During his stay in NFL Europe, he has not had one ounce of
trouble,'' Wolf said. ``I am not unsympathetic to the troubles he
has been in and the pain he has caused other people, but I think he
has matured.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is one of the smartest men in the business. But other
executives and coaches are smart, too, and some of them also
believed that Phillips was a better man. One was coach Jimmy
Johnson, whom Phillips completely bamboozled.
</P>
<P>
   At his news conference in Germany last month after winning the
offensive MVP award, nothing but the right words came out of
Phillips' mouth. He said he was humble and happy to have a second
chance in Europe. He weighed 240 pounds when he played for the
Dolphins but is now a slim 210.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely a better player than I was in St. Louis and
Miami,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But is he a better person? Only Phillips knows the answer.
</P>
<P>
   Strahan Frets
</P>
<P>
   The Giants defensive end Michael Strahan is becoming impatient
with the pace of his contract negotiations. The potential deal
could make Strahan one of the five highest-paid players in the
game. When that kind of money is being discussed, of course the
Giants are going to be meticulous. Strahan should be happy because
negotiations are picking up. The Giants made an offer to Strahan's
agent last Friday. There is a slim chance that a deal could be
reached by the time training camp begins at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Since safety Tito Wooten was cut by the Giants last month, he
has received interest from only one team, the New Orleans Saints.
</P>
<P>
   A sign that players are becoming as familiar with computers as
they are first downs: A survey at the NFL's rookie symposium this
summer, in which players are indoctrinated over a three-day period
about life in professional football, showed that 69 percent of the
drafted rookie class use e-mail. In the next millennium when a team
wants to track down a player in the off season, they may use e-mail
instead of leaving phone messages.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Ravens offensive players are enamored of Brian
Billick's play designs because they are difficult for a defense to
predict.

HEAT CAUGHT LONG ISLAND UTILITY WITH NO MARGIN FOR ERROR 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ About 109,000 homes in Nassau and Suffolk
counties lost power during the recent heat wave, officials at the
Long Island Power Authority said Saturday. And they are grateful
the number was so low.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, as temperatures reached 100 degrees and power
consumption set a record of 4,590 megawatts, LIPA's engineers were
poised to shut down power across Long Island in waves, tens of
thousands of homes at a time, to prevent an uncontrollable
blackout.
</P>
<P>
   Only a series of pleading phone calls to government officials,
college presidents and corporate executives, who agreed to send
workers home early, let the power authority avoid such drastic
measures, officials said. The early closings saved a crucial 140
megawatts.
</P>
<P>
   The margin was so slim, officials said, largely because the
power authority could not buy extra electricity from other
utilities in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traditionally, we can import from Con Edison over several
lines that traverse the Rockaways,'' said LIPA chairman Richard
Kessel. ``We couldn't do that on Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessel said LIPA's vulnerability to shortages in imported
electricity, and thus its need for more of its own, were the
biggest lessons of the heat wave, which caused the worst crisis in
the year since the authority took over Long Island's electrical
system. The lights were back on in the last few thousand affected
homes by Thursday afternoon, a spokesman for the authority, Michael
Lowndes, said.
</P>
<P>
   As a first response, Kessel is expected to announce plans Monday
to build new power plants on the Island capable of generating
another 200 to 300 megawatts of electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The existing power plants on the Island can produce about 4,000
megawatts of power, which was more than enough on even the hottest
day of the year until the summer of 1995. But peak usage has been
growing here by leaps and bounds, just as it has all over the
metropolitan area, driven by the proliferation of home computers
and other electronic devices, a rising population and a boom in
homebuilding characterized by ever-more-spacious houses that need
cooling on the hottest days.
</P>
<P>
   To supplement its own power production, the power authority
imports electricity over six lines: two from Westchester County,
three from Jamaica, Queens, and one beneath the Long Island Sound
from Norwalk, Conn. Taken together, those lines can carry a maximum
of about 1,100 megawatts, said William Balet, executive director of
the New York Power Pool, a consortium of the state's eight major
utilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwalk cable was under repair, however, leaving about 900
megawatts of import capacity, and on paper, at least, that would
have been more than enough to cover Tuesday's peak energy demand.
But as Kessel said: ``Capacity isn't energy. You could have all the
capacity in the world, but if the energy isn't available at a given
time and you need it, it's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessel said the power authority also is proceeding with a plan
to build another underwater cable, this one between Shoreham, in
Suffolk, and New Haven, Conn., which will be capable of carrying
600 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
   But Gordian Raacke, executive director of the Citizens Advisory
Panel, a court-appointed watchdog group, called Kessel's plans a
``knee-jerk response.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what they always say _ let's build more power plants,''
Raacke said. ``And a cable to New England isn't going to get us
anywhere, because the people in Connecticut aren't going to be
willing to send the power over here during heat waves.''
</P>
<P>
   Kessel defended the authority's investment in the new cable by
saying a number of large power plants were expected to open in New
England over the next decade, providing ample supplies for that
region. The cost of the underwater cable could be as much as $200
million, according to some estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Kessel said LIPA was also investing heavily in energy efficiency
and conservation programs. But he warned that with power
consumption rising by 4 percent a year _ in part because the
authority has cut electrical rates _ new generators and
transmission lines from other regions were essential to meet
demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're spending $32 million each of the next five years on
that, to promote solar power and fuel cells and research and
development, and all kinds of things,'' he said. ``That's all
great, but that alone is not going to be able to meet the
extraordinary growth in electric usage on Long Island in the next
five years.''

IRISHWOMAN IS `HEART AND SOUL' OF THE POSTAL SERVICE TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   THIONVILLE, France _ The first time Emma O'Reilly understood
that she was something special in the world of European bicycle
racing was when she finished work before a race in Belgium two
years ago, entered the communal dining room and realized that she
was the only woman there.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there were lots of teams,'' she remembered of that race,
the Tour of Flanders. ``Lots and lots of people, and I must have
been the only female. That was my biggest culture shock ever.''
Retelling the incident, she laughed now, as she said she ultimately
laughed then.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what it reminded me of?'' she asked. ``My first day
walking into my electrical work.'' Before she became a masseur, she
served a four-year apprenticeship as an electrician in Dublin and
earned her journeyman's card.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 44 of us there and no other woman my first day at
the electrical trade center. I thought, `There's got to be another
woman.' That's the way at the Tour of Flanders _ `There's got to be
another woman; there's just got to be another one.' Nope.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly, a 28-year-old (``not 29, I won't be 29 until July
22'') Irishwoman, was and is unfazed. She knows her value to the
U.S. Postal Service team as chief soigneur, a combination of
masseur, confidante and jack of many trades. In addition to
massaging three riders each evening in the Tour de France, she runs
the four-member soigneur staff, oversees the team's supply of food
during the three-week race, often stands at the side of the road to
distribute lunch in cloth bags that the riders snatch as they whiz
by, does their laundry and listens to their tales of woe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Emma is the heart and soul of the team,'' said Mark Gorski,
the winner of a gold medal in the bicycle sprint at the 1984
Olympics and now the general manager of the Postal Service
entourage. ``She's so professional and has a wonderful influence on
the other staff members and the riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``She brings a woman's sensitivity to guys' personalities, their
differences in personality, all kinds of things that a male
soigneur just can't bring.''
</P>
<P>
   That being so, why does no other team on the European circuit
employ female soigneurs, even if they are frequent on American
teams? ``It's a cultural attitude about women and their place in
the workplace,'' Gorski said. ``It's the attitude that a woman
traveling with the team 120, 130 days a year is inappropriate. I
think they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   So does O'Reilly, but she is not troubled, she said, because
already she sees major changes occurring in the soigneurs' world.
The old school _ the often-shady soigneurs with their suitcases
full of potions and drugs _ is beginning to give way.
</P>
<P>
   ``No disrespect,'' she said, ``but the old school is former bike
riders. They didn't do a massage course and either couldn't get a
job in the real world or didn't want to get out of the cycling
world and this is a way of staying on. They know everybody and it's
comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the soigneurs are becoming more of a half-and-half
mixture. It's much more people in their 20s who know how to do this
job.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly joined the Postal Service team when it was formed four
years ago, moving from her soigneur's job with the Shaklee team in
Colorado. ``I lived in Boulder and loved it, loved the climate,''
she said. ``My coming from Ireland, the climate is heaven: it's
dry, the sky is always blue.''
</P>
<P>
   Before that, ``I used to do with the Irish national team, just
as a hobby. Then it evolved.'' She was working as an electrician in
Dublin, specializing in switchboard and panel control work, when
she decided to take a night course in massage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I could go away with Irish teams and take a holiday
in Europe with them,'' she said. ``And it got bigger and bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   After completing the massage training from September to May, she
took other courses in sports injury and reflexology, ``again at
night, while I was doing electrical work.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually she was plugged into the soigneurs' network, was
offered a job with a California racing team that didn't quite pan
out and joined Shaklee and then Postal Service.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the bias of European teams against women, O'Reilly found
that male soigneurs were supportive of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first started, so many of them looked out for me,'' she
said. ``If I've forgotten something, heaven forbid, I can go to
them. Maybe because I'm used to working with men all the time, but
so many of the lads are so decent. Now and then, somebody might
make a joke but I don't even respond, just give them a dirty
look.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does she remember trouble with wives of the riders she works
with. ``Maybe I should take it as an insult that the riders' wives
don't give me any grief,'' she joked. ``They just look at me and
feel very secure.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Reilly has a boyfriend, the representative for a helmet
company, whom she sees sometimes at races. She says that she plans
to work another year as a soigneur and then retire, get married and
have children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still old-fashioned enough to think that if I want to
marry, settle down and have children, it would be OK to stay at
home,'' she said.

UNION BACKS NBA DRUG POLICY 
THE JACKSON DIARY 
U.S. TEAM PREPARES 
END OF LINE FOR JONES 
WILLIAMS NEARS 41
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the executive director of the NBA players
association, does not believe the problem is as rampant as it is
perceived. Still, he and the player representatives for the 29
teams agree that with the NBA soon to begin testing for marijuana,
it is time to educate the masses.
</P>
<P>
   During the union's annual meetings in the Bahamas last week,
representatives were told to spread the word to their teammates
about the league's new drug policy. Since marijuana can stay in a
person's system for two to three months, players who use it in July
run a risk of being caught in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly there are guys out there using, and hopefully
they'll get the message that they have to stop,'' Jim McIlvaine of
the New Jersey Nets told The Associated Press last week.
</P>
<P>
   According to rules agreed to during collective bargaining last
January, players who test positive at training camp must undergo
mandatory counseling. A second positive test brings a $15,000 fine,
and a subsequent positive test results in a five-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Rookies will be tested four times a season on a random basis.
</P>
<P>
   A player also can be tested during the regular season if an
arbitrator decides, after a hearing, there is reasonable cause to
believe a player has used, possessed or distributed any prohibited
substance.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years alone, Chris Webber, Mookie Blaylock,
Vernon Maxwell and J.R. Rider have been arrested on
marijuana-related charges.
</P>
<P>
   Steroids were also added to the league's banned substances list
during the last collective-bargaining negotiations, and all players
will be tested when training camps open in October.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone testing positive for steroids gets a five-game suspension
for the first offense, a 10-game suspension for a second offense
and a 25-game suspension for a third offense. Androstenedione, the
testosterone-producing substance taken by baseball's Mark McGwire
and others, is banned by the league.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the marijuana issue has been one of the most troubling
for the league the past two years. That the players have decided to
treat it as seriously as the league says something about the union
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The Jackson Diary
</P>
<P>
   As Jeff Van Gundy prepares to secure his future with the Knicks
_ he will most likely meet with the Madison Square Garden president
Dave Checketts next week to discuss a long-term contract extension
_ the Knicks' coach can take solace in Phil Jackson's recent diary
for ESPN Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In the July 12 issue, Jackson essentially paints the portrait of
an organization looking to go in another coaching direction as
early as two months ago. Jackson has often been accused of
campaigning for Van Gundy's job, but he appears to absolve himself
of any ethical wrongdoing in the magazine.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, most of the controversy surrounding Jackson's
clandestine meeting with Checketts in April can be traced back to
an informal conversation the two had last year after Red Holzman's
funeral _ prompted by Checketts, according to Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Checketts told me he'd like to have me in the organization in
some way, maybe as a vice president,'' Jackson wrote in his
personal diary for the magazine. ``We didn't really talk after that
until just before the end of the regular season. The Knicks were
about even with Charlotte and Cleveland for the eighth, ninth and
10th spots in the East, and they seemed out of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``So my agent, Todd Musburger, and I went to New York to meet
with Dave, who said he wanted me to know that before I started
getting pressured for other jobs, the Knicks were interested in me.
No specific job. ... I told Dave I would talk to him when the
Knicks' season was officially over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awful the way it all came out in the press, how
Checketts said at first we hadn't met and then had to say we did.
It was terrible for Van Gundy. But as it turned out, Jeff did a
tremendous job of getting a team with a lot of weaknesses all the
way into the finals. So the Knicks were out for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also wrote that the Lakers were his first choice all
along, and had some candid comments regarding the team's stars:
</P>
<P>
   _ Shaquille O'Neal: ``Shaquille hasn't performed the way he
could. He should be the league's MVP.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Kobe Bryant: ``A kid uneducated in basketball and life. It's
amazing, he's only 20 years old. My boys are almost that old.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   U.S. Team Prepares
</P>
<P>
   In Orlando this week, the U.S. national basketball team began
preparing for the Pre-Olympic Qualifying Tournament of the Americas
later this month in Puerto Rico, which runs through July 25.
</P>
<P>
   Because a group of non-NBA players did not advance to the title
game of the world championships last year in Athens _ blame the
lockout, if you must _ this version of the U.S. team needs to win
its semifinal game to qualify for the 2000 Games in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   It's almost a fait accompli, with a roster of Tim Duncan, Vin
Baker, Kevin Garnett, Gary Payton, Tom Gugliotta, Allan Houston,
Jason Kidd, Tim Hardaway and Steve Smith _ and recent first-round
draft picks Elton Brand, Wally Szczerbiak and Richard Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping themselves motivated may be the biggest chore, which is
why some other players were brought in to scrimmage against the
team this week. Sacramento's Jason Williams joined Orlando's Bo
Outlaw, Nick Anderson and other Magic players participated in the
workout.
</P>
<P>
   The United States faces Canada in an exhibition Sunday and meets
Uruguay in a first-round game July 15.
</P>
<P>
   End of Line for Jones
</P>
<P>
   John Starks used to say there was an invisible line in
basketball, reserved mostly for players who were never first-round
draft picks and always on the bubble. On one side were many players
who could have been in the NBA. On the other side were the guys who
somehow found a way to cross over, stay on a roster and compete
with the best athletes in the world.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, there is also a line that separates first-round
draft picks. In Nashville, an Aug. 16 trial date was set for former
Knick Dontae' Jones on charges stemming from a nightclub shooting.
He is accused of simple assault with bodily injury, reckless
endangerment and felony vandalism. Jones, who led Mississippi State
to the Final Four in 1996, faces up to 14 years in prison if
convicted on all charges.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting took place April 25 outside a nightclub called the
Players Draft House after an argument between a Memphis rap group
and an entertainment promoter. A Players Draft House security
guard, Darryl L. Tyce, told authorities he saw Jones and another
man firing handguns in his direction. Tyce was wounded in the
stomach and his car was damaged.
</P>
<P>
   The assault charge stems from a separate altercation inside the
nightclub between Jones and a woman, Assistant District Attorney
George Bonds told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Whether he is guilty or not, Jones is clearly approaching his
nadir in his early 20s. Not that he was a can't-miss all-American
destined for NBA greatness, but he was the kind of athletic young
talent who may have been able to find his niche in this league had
he made a sincere commitment to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Like Starks, he was brimming with untapped energy but had
nowhere to put it. Unlike Starks, basketball was not his life.
</P>
<P>
   As a Knick, Jones was one of those locker room cut-ups who kept
his teammates in stitches. In his brief tenure with the team, he
was known best for keeping practices light-hearted and, it probably
follows, not taking the game seriously enough.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was on the injured list for almost the entire 1996-97
season. At one point, he played video games in a security guard's
office of the USAir Arena with Chris Webber after a Knicks victory
on the road. He quipped that it was the most minutes he had played
all season.
</P>
<P>
   During a trip to Atlanta, coach Jeff Van Gundy sent him home
after he slept late and forgot to show up at practice. Remorseful
and contrite, Jones told Van Gundy: ``Good luck at the game, coach.
I know you have to do what you have to do.''
</P>
<P>
   He was genuinely nice and funny. Traded to Boston, Jones played
in 15 games for the Celtics in the 1997-98 season, averaging 2.9
points. He was waived before the start of the 1998-1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   With a criminal trial pending and his NBA career most likely
over, he goes back to being another dreamer on the other side of
that invisible line, maybe never realizing how lucky he was to have
crossed over in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   There are a lot 20-somethings with lithe, 6-foot-6-inch frames
and impressive vertical leaps, jumping out of community centers and
playgrounds across America and talking about how they dunked on
so-and-so in college and once had a tryout somewhere. What a shame
Dontae' Jones didn't seize his opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Williams Nears 41
</P>
<P>
   For the Knicks to win a title next season, Herb Williams was
chided that he would have to accept a reduced role. Williams
laughed, knowing that at 41 and seldom used anyway, his playing
days are most likely over. Still, as the oldest active player on a
roster last season, Williams would not rule out the possibility of
a return. ... Chick Hearn, the play-by-play voice of the Lakers for
the past 34 seasons, signed a two-year contract last Wednesday.
Having called an incredible 3,114 consecutive Laker games, Hearn,
at age 82, plans to add to one of the great ironman feats in
sports. From West to Chamberlain, Magic to Kareem, Shaq to Kobe and
beyond, it is a pleasant reminder that the more things change in
this league the more they stay the same.

IN FOURTH YEAR MLS FEELS FLUSH WITH SOLID OWNERS AND IMPROVED TV
RATINGS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Texas)  (rk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the middle of its fourth season, Major League Soccer
continues to lose money, but league officials say they have the
finances from investor-operators for a minimum of five more
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel chipper and bullish,'' Commissioner Doug Logan said as
the league prepared for Saturday's All-Star Game in San Diego.
``We're right on target with our five-year plan. It has cost us
$100 million to get to this point, but we're in a solid financial
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Counce, the general manager of the Western
Conference-leading Colorado Rapids, had his own optimistic
description of his team's condition. ``We're starting to lose less
money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Logan said the reason for the league's stability came from the
owners' decision a year ago to put up the capital needed to exist
for five more seasons without additional sponsorship or income from
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an unprecedented move that I believe has helped us
tremendously,'' Logan said. ``We've come up with a group of owners
that will stand behind this league.''
</P>
<P>
   The owners are billionaires such as John Kluge, Phil Anschutz,
Lamar Hunt and Robert Kraft. Anschutz, a Denver billionaire, bought
the Los Angeles Galaxy for $26 million last November, only three
years after the cost of becoming an investor-operator of a team was
going for $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Anschutz has been one of the biggest reasons for the financial
security of the league. When a man worth $16.5 billion pours money
into a team it makes the other owners feel more comfortable that
the league is on solid ground.
</P>
<P>
   Hunt made a $26 million investment of his own when he built a
stadium specifically for the Columbus Crew team he operates along
with the MLS's Kansas City Wizards and the NFL's Kansas City
Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of success by the MetroStars in the New York
metropolitan area, the league's attendance numbers have gone up
this season after dropping in the second and third years. After 97
games this season, the average attendance is 15,961, up 6 percent
over the 15,147 average of last season.
</P>
<P>
   With some help from the Women's World Cup, the league's
television ratings have also increased.
</P>
<P>
   The first two games televised by Univision, the Spanish network,
averaged a 5.3 rating, according to the Nielsen Hispanic Television
Index. That is a 51 percent increase over last year and appears to
justify two scheduling changes the league made.
</P>
<P>
   In the first three years, Univision showed MLS games at 3 p.m.
on Sunday, following the telecast of games from Mexico. This
season, league and Univision executives decided to move MLS games
to 1 p.m. and start the telecasts June 20, two weeks after the
Mexican League season ended.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and ESPN International, which will televise the All-Star
Game to 130 countries, also have shown an increase.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been thrilled with the soccer ratings we've seen the
last few years,'' said Mark Mandell, a spokesman for ABC, which
will televise the All-Star Game. ``Between the men's and women's
World Cups, we've seen a bigger increase in soccer ratings than in
any of the other sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher attendance and higher television ratings bring more money
from corporate sponsors, such as Mastercard, AT&AMP;T and Honda, who
now pay more than $80 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Despite signs pointing toward a healthy future, the league
deferred plans for expansion by a year to 2001. Logan will make the
official announcement of that decision at his state-of-the-league
address next Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have two new teams in 2001,'' Logan said, ``but not
before we check some significant loose ends.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Philadelphia and Houston were the cities with the best
chance of getting expansion teams.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the league's 12 existing teams, the Dallas Burn and the
Tampa Bay Mutiny, are still operated by the league, which is
seeking private investor-operators for both.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose Clash, which was operated by the league the first
three years, has been taken over by the Kraft family, which also
operates the New England Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   As a single-entity venture, the league controls all the player
contracts and has set a salary cap at $1.7 million a team after
starting at $1.1 million the first year. The maximum salary is
still $250,000 and the minimum is $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guarantee you there won't be any radical increase in the
salary cap,'' Logan said. ``The average salary is $84,000, which is
more than twice what the average American makes. We don't have any
spoiled athletes in this league.''

FEDERAL INQUIRY OF POLICE DRAWS MIXED REACTION
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Pa.)  (rk) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ News that federal prosecutors have found systemwide
problems in the New York Police Department's handling of brutality
complaints brought a triumphant ``I told you so'' chorus from
longtime police critics Saturday, though they continued to disagree
about how best to reform the department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, we have a real opportunity to bring about systemic
change within the NYPD in order to achieve greater accountability
over our NYPD,'' said Norman Siegel, the executive director of the
New York Civil Liberties Union. ``This is good news, yet long
overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   William F. Kuntz II, a member of the department's Civilian
Complaint Review Board, called the findings by Zachary W. Carter,
the U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, ``courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's absolutely on the right track,'' Kuntz said.
``There are serious problems of brutality and racism in the
department.''
</P>
<P>
   City officials refused to discuss the investigation, so it
remains unclear whether the department will embrace changes
proposed by Carter or leave itself open to a suit by the Justice
Department that could force reform, perhaps by installing a federal
monitor to oversee the nation's largest police force. Specific
results of the federal inquiry also remained unavailable Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Mindel, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's press secretary, would
say only that the Police Department and the corporation counsel
``have been cooperating with the U.S. attorney's review, and the
discussions are ongoing.'' Marilyn Mode, the Police Department's
chief spokeswoman, declined comment altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by the 1997 beating and torture of a Haitian immigrant,
Abner Louima, in a Brooklyn station house, Carter's review is one
of at least 10 focusing on law enforcement agencies nationwide
through a 1994 law authorizing prosecutors to seek changes in the
operations of local police departments in federal courts. Two cases
that have already been litigated, in Pittsburgh and Steubenville,
Ohio, have resulted in court-approved agreements in which police
departments track use of force, civilian complaints and
disciplinary action through databases that are reviewed by
independent auditors.
</P>
<P>
   Even the most vehement critics of the status quo in New York
said they were unsure that federal oversight was the right
solution. Rather, they embraced federal intervention as an
opportunity to shift the political winds in favor of reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've had up to now is political forces, from minority
people and ACLU people, putting pressure on the city to introduce
civilian oversight, and the mayor has successfully resisted it,''
said Paul G. Chevigny, a law professor at New York University who
has written extensively about police brutality and pushed for
changes in New York's complaint review procedures. ``That leads to
a standoff. Introducing the federal government has a tendency to
break that standoff.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chevigny said that a settlement would be better than a
lawsuit, and that a federal monitor was not the most desirable
solution. ``If it's got to be administered against a totally
resistant political system, it's not enough,'' he said.
``Ultimately, without some good faith on the part of the people
running the department, nothing is going to work, or work very
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Eric Adams, president of a civic group representing New
York's black police officers, said city officials had thus far been
``acting like alcoholics in denial by not acknowledging the
problems,'' and that Carter's investigation gives credence to
complaints long voiced in minority communities. He said the city
needed an independent agency with power to gather evidence, because
as long as investigators depend on the Police Department for
information, their work will be compromised.
</P>
<P>
   Current leaders of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association could
not be reached for comment Saturday, but the union's former
president, James Savage, decried the review's findings, and said
federal intervention would not have an impact on whatever problems
do exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the federal government should stick their nose
into Police Department policy,'' Savage said. ``It erodes the
confidence of the public in the Police Department. It's certainly a
blow to the egos of the cops out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Police boosters and critics alike, however, agreed with the
general findings of the federal review _ that the current system
for handling civilian complaints is not working. Police
commissioners have dismissed one-half to two-thirds of the
complaints substantiated by the review board. Of those that are
upheld, the vast majority lead to minor discipline; only one case
in the board's first five years led to dismissal, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost as if it's this stepchild agency,'' Earl S. Ward
said of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, on which he sits.
``They really have to start saying, look, the CCRB recommendations
need to be given serious treatment. That's not happening right
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Siegel, of the civil liberties union, said the review board ``on
paper is the most independent and accountable system in the
country,'' but that it has been ``nullified and sabotaged'' by
mayors and police commissioners unconcerned about brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be oversight,'' he said, ``because the system,
the NYPD and the mayor's office, have had ample opportunity to make
systemic reform. They're minimizing and trivializing the issue.''

RACIAL PROFILING TOPS NAACP AGENDA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The nation's oldest civil rights organization
returned Saturday to New York, the city of its founding, to
celebrate its 90th birthday and confront issues as topical as
racial profiling by the police and getting more blacks to use the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
opened its six-day annual convention at the New York Hilton and
Towers in midtown Manhattan by listing several other concerns at
the top of its agenda, like school vouchers, the backslide toward
segregation, voter registration, the quality of health care, and
preparing for appearances by Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday and
Vice President Al Gore on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But its two top officials, speaking to reporters, clearly marked
as their top concern the increasing number of allegations that city
and state police departments around the country routinely stop and
harass drivers because they are black.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen open season on black people in New York,
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and San Diego,'' said NAACP chairman
Julian Bond at a news conference Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Though he said, ``This is an old, old issue for us,'' Bond said
profiling had resurfaced as an urgent topic in the last year,
particularly after incidents in New York City and the admitted use
of racial profiling by New Jersey state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bond nor Kweisi Mfume, the NAACP's president and chief
executive, specified how the organization would battle racial
profiling. But Bond alluded to the recent case of police brutality
in New York, in which fellow officers testified against Officer
Justin Volpe, who was convicted of sodomizing Abner Louima, a black
man, in a police station with a wooden stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are particularly pleased that this blue wall of silence has
at least been cracked here in New York City,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda differs markedly from that of last year's convention,
held in Atlanta, which took direct aim at critics of affirmative
action, including some justices of the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   This year, organizers said they wanted the convention to focus
more on youth, particularly the need to invigorate the NAACP's
ranks with more young people. The organization's membership,
currently about 500,000, rose by 17,000 in the past year, Bond
said, thanks greatly to efforts to recruit more college-age
members. ``Many of them are coming to us,'' he said, including a
group of students at Harvard University, which formed a chapter
this year, the first at the school since the 1960s, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While still tackling educational issues, like school vouchers,
which the NAACP generally opposes, the convention will also focus
discussion on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Mfume, who spoke despite suffering from a bad case
of laryngitis, said he and Bond would also look at what he called
``the digital divide'' between white and black Americans. A federal
survey last year found that 27 percent of white households were
connected to the Internet, compared with about 9 percent of black
and Hispanic households.
</P>
<P>
   As a way to help remedy that, Mfume announced a plan, still not
complete, to open NAACP ``tech centers'' at chapters around the
country, where children and parents could use Internet together.
The centers, none of which are operating yet, would be wired and
financed in part by AT&AMP;T, Mfume said, once negotiations with the
company are completed in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The organization also hopes to link each chapter in the nation
to a dedicated NAACP computer network, Bond said. ``Our dream is
that the whole of 2,200 branches will be interconnected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to scheduling Mrs. Clinton and Gore, who is running
for president, the convention also invited other presidential
candidates, including former Sen. Bill Bradley, Texas Gov. George
W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole. An appearance by Bradley, scheduled for
Saturday night, was listed as tentative, but neither Bush nor Ms.
Dole will be here.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the lack of any national Republican figures on the
NAACP's schedule, Bond said he and Mfume had tried, unsuccessfully,
to get Bush and Ms. Dole, to show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that scheduling conflicts did not allow as
diverse a selection of speakers as we would have hoped,'' Bond
said. ``But we also are confident that we offered the
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mfume said that both candidates may talk at next year's
convention, before the 2000 election.

SPORTS COLUMN: NEWEST HALL OF FAMER STILL FULL OF SURPRISES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWPORT, R.I. _ The name of the game John McEnroe always played
best was surprise. Where was the next volley going? When was the
inevitable tantrum coming? What Robin Williams is to comedy,
McEnroe was to tennis. He made it up as he went along. He played it
this way, right through a quirky and typically rambling induction
on Saturday into the International Tennis Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   From his choice of presenter to the way he came to embrace his
fellow inductee to a Wimbledon aggravation he has not yet shaken,
McEnroe was hardly the standard guest of honor. He never had it in
him to be.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Heiden, for instance. Who would have guessed McEnroe would
have chosen the Olympic speed-skating legend turned professional
cyclist turned orthopedic surgeon as his presenter? Some years ago,
they met through a mutual friend, a football player for the Chicago
Bears, and hit it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the friends I feel I don't see enough of,''
McEnroe said.
</P>
<P>
   Why not now? Why not here?
</P>
<P>
   ``John called me up and asked and I was, like, wow,'' Heiden
said. ``I don't really know much about tennis, but he said he was
looking for someone who knew him more from off the court than on.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of which, McEnroe admitted he had to look twice when he
read that he would share his induction ceremony with a lesser-known
Mac. The 70-year-old Ken McGregor won the Australian Open in 1952
but was best known as one half of the doubles partnership _ with
Frank Sedgman _ that won the only male doubles Grand Slam, in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, I said to myself, `Who the hell is Ken McGregor?' ''
said McEnroe, proud winner of three Wimbledon singles titles and
four at his hometown U.S. Open in New York. ``What's going on
here?''
</P>
<P>
   At a dinner for the inductees Friday night, McEnroe listened as
McGregor, an Australian, regaled his audience of the very old days,
when attention for tennis players was sparse and money was spare,
and unjust rules created punitive distinctions between amateurs and
pros.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe admitted the experience was educational. ``Ken was a
trailblazer, and made it possible for guys like myself,'' he said,
sounding on a theme he often uses when comparing his own
well-heeled era with the crazy-money one of today.
</P>
<P>
   They were also linked by Harry Hopman, the late, great
Australian Davis Cup captain and fellow Hall of Famer. McGregor
played for three of Hopman's championship teams. McEnroe cut his
permanent tennis teeth, as a 12-year-old charge of Hopman's after
Hopman had left Australia and settled in Port Washington, N.Y.,
near McEnroe's home in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe credited Hopman with imbuing in him the values of the
Davis Cup, which he helped win five times for the United States and
always made himself available for. In a larger sense, McEnroe said
Hopman's influence was about understanding a sense of commitment.
To your country. To your sport. Even to your doubles partner, come
hell, high water, or Wimbledon schedule submerged by rain.
</P>
<P>
   On that touchy subject, McEnroe said he was still nursing the
emotional wounds of Steffi Graf's withdrawal from their Wimbledon
mixed doubles semifinal last weekend. McEnroe noted Saturday that
his first Grand Slam title had been with Mary Carillo, in 1977, at
the French Open. At Wimbledon, he thought he had arranged the
perfect ending to an imperfect story. Center Court. His children
watching. His Hall of Fame induction coming.
</P>
<P>
   Graf pulled out, legitimately citing a minor muscle pull and the
wear and tear of the weather-condensed schedule. On the plane ride
home, McEnroe sat next to Pete Sampras, who, after a while, told
him, ``You really are upset about this.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course he was. This was how McEnroe competed at 20, 30 and
now at 40. It also happened to be the way Graf went about her
business, focused on the prize, singles-minded to the end. No
wonder McEnroe compared the breakup to the dissolution of his first
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the last to know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the time he retired from the tour seven years ago, McEnroe
knew he should have won more. He should never have imploded against
Ivan Lendl in the 1984 French Open final and blown a two-set lead.
He should never have let the big hitters who were taking over the
sport in the mid-1980s get into his head, forcing him to tinker too
much with his game.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wished he had started sooner with the new technology
but then, given the opportunity to play out this point, he realized
he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   His era had Borg and Connors and Vilas and Gerulaitis. It was,
he said, ``an explosion,'' a tennis era unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have changed a thing as to when I came in,'' he
decided.
</P>
<P>
   So why complain about Graf, or anything? It's who he is, what he
brought, the element of showmanship and surprise. Whereas McGregor
spoke for five minutes on Saturday, McEnroe went on for about 45.
It was part of his inherent charm, and his champion's conceit. On a
gray, breezy, Wimbledon-like afternoon, McEnroe seized center
stage, and wouldn't let go.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, off in the distance, you could hear the occasional
boom of a cannon being fired, from the nearby re-enactment of the
Civil War. Presumably, in honor of the one John McEnroe waged
spectacularly with tennis, and himself.

IN GOP TERRITORY, MANY ARE WILLING TO GIVE MRS. CLINTON A CHANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ At the Cooperstown Diner, where the
waitresses swat regulars who lean back in their chairs, many in the
breakfast crowd said that Hillary Rodham Clinton, the would-be New
York senator who has never lived or worked in New York, could
survive being branded a carpetbagger.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's honest and forthright and willing to help out, she
can live anyplace she wants,'' said James Leo, 50, who works at a
lumber yard and generally votes Republican. ``My grandparents
weren't born in this country. She can learn.''
</P>
<P>
   And several said that New York City, 250 miles to the southeast,
is so far away that upstaters consider her likely opponent to be an
exotic import as well. ``Giuliano's no different,'' Leo declared,
almost getting the name right.
</P>
<P>
   Despite news coverage suggesting that Mrs. Clinton is some sort
of political UFO touching down on a bewildered Empire State, most
of the dozens of voters interviewed here after her stops on an
inaugural campaign tour last week were already quite attuned to
what is being billed as the biggest Senate race of all time, and
were settling in for the show.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, a Democrat, spent most of her Listening to New
Yorkers tour in Republican territory, where she and her likely
opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, would have to scrap
for suburban and rural support. Here in Cooperstown, where giant
geranium pots line the Victorian downtown, even traditional
political opponents said Mrs. Clinton had drawn good reviews after
her visits to the local hospital and the National Baseball Hall of
Fame, where she posed with Hank Aaron's ``Powerized'' Louisville
Slugger from his 3,000th hit.
</P>
<P>
   However skeptical some in Cooperstown might be, most said they
were willing to give her a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Simmons, 27, said he knew how she could instantly acquire
her upstate bona fides: go hunting with him. Deer or turkey, her
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Merely accepting, though, will not be enough to win over
Simmons, a welder for a manufactured-housing company. ``It all
depends how hard she hunts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Others did not set the bar so high. ``She's a great lady who has
put up with a lot of adversity,'' said Russ Smith, 63, a Republican
who has driven a school bus here for 42 years. ``You can't be soft
and good.''
</P>
<P>
   Art Callahan, a power company lineman, was excitedly plotting
strategy. ``She would wait until a few months before the election,
then dump Bill!'' he said. ``She'd clean up.''
</P>
<P>
   Reminders were all around, however, that Republicans dominate
this lake-splotched region, which was the setting for James
Fenimore Cooper's ``Leatherstocking Tales.'' (Cooperstown is named
for his father, William Cooper, who founded the village as a
business venture in 1786.)
</P>
<P>
   North of the village, neatly stenciled letters have declared a
roadside outhouse, complete with crescent moon, to be ``Hillary's
Up State Headquarters.'' East of the village, posters say,
``Hillary Go Home to Arkansas!'' and ``Bill's Gals _ Paula, Monica
and HILLARY.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Hall of Fame, Kelly Ryan, a ticket booth attendant, will
turn 18 in time for the election and hopes to make Mrs. Clinton her
first vote. But Kelly reported that when she went home and bragged
about shaking Mrs. Clinton's hand, several people said, ``Oooh!
Wash it!''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the Democratic turf Mrs. Clinton visited, several voters
said she would have to work for their support.
</P>
<P>
   In Albany, Denise Von Kiparski, 39, a state employee who
processes barber, real estate and other licenses, said Mrs. Clinton
had the potential to spark as much excitement among women as
Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura created with his ambush campaign last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she turns us on, I'll get out and help,'' Ms. Von Kiparski
said.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Grimaldi, 55, an ironworker and union representative, waited
in pouring rain at an Albany amphitheater to see Mrs. Clinton speak
briefly during the intermission of a play, and later said he was
glad he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's a fraud,'' Grimaldi said, ``she's doing a good job
portraying herself as sincere _ to me, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   The hard-core anti-Hillary contingent could be found Friday
night in the beer tent at the Otsego County Firemen's Convention,
held among the silos about 25 miles west of Cooperstown, in
Edmeston.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Smullen, 33, a customer service worker, worried that
Mrs. Clinton would import a lot of liberal ideas. ``I'm afraid of
her, to be honest with you,'' Ms. Smullen said. ``She wants to help
the gays, and stuff. In New York state, we've already got enough of
those.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many voters downplayed the issue, some still said they
would always see her as a carpetbagger. ``It's like she looked
around and said, `New York ain't got many people running, so I'll
go there,''' said Brent Burchill, 33, who makes paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Opportunist'' is another word that comes up a lot. ``I think
she'd like to sit in the president's chair,'' said Earle Peterson,
65, a retired veterinarian. ``She feels Bill has blown it, and she
has got to get it done on her own.''
</P>
<P>
   The trappings of the White House also may prove to be a burden.
Several people said they were offended by the small, hand-picked
groups that met her, with the public barred.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the puzzling nature of the First Marriage seems likely to
remain an undercurrent in the race. ``You never hear anybody say
what Bill would do if she wins, which seems really weird,'' said
Lynn Kent, 44, a document imager.
</P>
<P>
   At the Strawberry Festival at St. Mary's Church, a Roman
Catholic parish in Cooperstown, several couples split in their
views of Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should run _ back to Arkansas,'' said Peter Bonhote, 65, a
carpentry teacher. But his wife, Ellen, praised her, saying, ``It's
about time she decided to be independent from her husband.''
</P>
<P>
   The Strawberry Festival turned into an ice cream sundae festival
when the berries fermented after the ladies of the church had
carefully hulled them. Toppings spattered everywhere as Steven and
Martha Heneghan fed their four children (ages 2 to 6) at the same
time that they were explaining why they might cross party lines to
vote for Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a very bright woman who can make things happen,'' said
Dr. Heneghan, 41, a surgeon who moved here from the Bronx. ``We
need that upstate.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Heneghan, 34, said she hoped Mrs. Clinton would bring up
issues like homelessness that many politicians are overlooking.
</P>
<P>
   On nearby Brooklyn Avenue, Susan Snell, 43, an architect and
mother of three young soccer players, was taking an evening stroll.
She is undecided about the Senate race, but said her friends who
had seen Mrs. Clinton were impressed by her knowledge and
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine voting for Rudy, and I really can't imagine
voting for Hillary Clinton,'' Mrs. Snell said. ``But I do think I'm
going to have to vote in this one.''

OUTDOORS: DEBATE BETWEEN FISHERMEN AND ECOLOGISTS INTENSIFIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Maine, Fla.)  (bl) 
 By PAUL MOLYNEAUX   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Konstantino Papoulidis lives to fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy selling vegetables and meeting my customers,'' he
said, standing behind his produce counter in Marathon, Fla. ``But
at the end of the day I close the doors, get in my boat, and go
fishing. I obey the rules and catch enough to feed my family and
friends. I'm not political, but if anybody gets in the way of my
fishing, they're going to hear from me.''
</P>
<P>
   Papoulidis is one of 5 million recreational and 16,000
commercial fishermen in Florida, all demanding a fair share of the
ocean's resources. To guarantee a future for fisheries however,
many scientists say as much as 40 percent of the world's marine
ecosystems need protection. That means closing or restricting many
traditional fishing areas and creating what are becoming known
globally as Marine Protected Areas.
</P>
<P>
   The National Research Council, an independent arm of the
National Academy of Science, is in the middle of a
government-financed, two-year study of the protected areas. The
council's committee of 21 international experts is conducting a
series of five public forums around the United States coastlines.
</P>
<P>
   In April, members met in Islamorada, Fla., to gather information
for their report on the feasibility of protected areas in the
United States. The meeting, held 30 miles northeast of Marathon,
surrounded by the 3,674-square-mile Florida Keys National Marine
Sanctuary, featured fishermen and scientists in the vanguard of
designing marine reserves, a more restrictive step beyond existing
marine sanctuaries in protecting ocean habitat and resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything else has failed,'' the chairman, Eduarde Houde,
said of past policies that have focused on species-specific
management. ``Marine Protected Areas are the last resort for
fisheries management.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee is reviewing data collected from sanctuaries and
areas currently closed by regulation. According to scientists at
Islamorada, protected areas represent a new paradigm in fisheries
management: one that works. A national fisheries service scientist,
Jim Bohnsack, pointed out the results of closing almost a third of
Georges Bank off the Maine coast in 1994, creating a de facto
protected areas. ``Only four years later,'' he said, ``haddock had
increased to the point that the trip limit was raised from 500
pounds per day to 2,000 pounds per day.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists and environmental organizations favor moving
ahead with large closings immediately. But Graeme Kelleher, a
committee member and a former vice chairman of the World
Conservation Union's commission on protected areas, reminded
participants, ``The success of MPAs depends on cooperation and
support from the fishing community.'' Kelleher's experience in the
South Pacific has shown ``that if we close half the reef, we get
twice the fish. After a while fishermen start becoming advocates,
but they have to be involved in the process from the very start.''
</P>
<P>
   The advent of ecosystem management has brought more voices to
the table. Scientists, ecotourists, and the public at large are
claiming a stake in an area that was once the sole domain of
fishermen. In Florida, a region leading the way in protected areas,
fishermen, regulators, the tourism industry and conservationists
have forged a fragile compromise on a 185-square-mile ``no take''
marine reserve in the Gulf of Mexico near the Dry Tortugas. They
hope it will protect spawning aggregations of important species of
snapper and grouper, and increase the overall fish population
throughout the Keys.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, fishermen have been less agreeable to closed areas.
In New England, inshore regulatory closings have led to angry
meetings between regulators and user groups left with no place to
fish.
</P>
<P>
   And even in Florida, commercial fishermen pressured Gov. Jeb
Bush to drop Felicia Coleman from the Gulf of Mexico Fisheries
Management Council because of her advocacy of a 500-square-mile
closed area off Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Florida's recreational anglers support conservation but are
leery of no-take zones. Islamorada's John Brownlee, a senior editor
of Salt Water Sportsman magazine, sees MPAs, ``as a tool, but not a
panacea for all the problems in fisheries today. We need to move
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recreational fishing is mostly catch and release now, and has
a $6 billion economic impact in this state,'' he said. ``You don't
want to just start shutting that down. We need to look at
traditional management tools. In Florida, for instance, we haven't
even tried quotas for commercial snapper/grouper fishermen.''
</P>
<P>
   Vito Calomo, a longtime New England trawlerman and now executive
director of the Gloucester Fisheries Commission, agreed that
traditional measures should be given a chance before ``we draw
lines all over the ocean.'' Calomo testified at the committee's
first meeting in Washington. He acknowledged that fish need safe
havens, but suggested a different way of creating them. ``I told
them we need to go back to gear restrictions,'' he said. ``If
fishermen didn't have the gear to tow over rockpiles, they wouldn't
go there and those would be your marine reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Les Watling, a scientist at the University of Maine, who
recently helped create maps identifying 26 percent of the seabed in
the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank as priority areas for
protection, responded to Calomo. ``If I thought the fishing
industry was serious about matching gear to habitat,'' he said, ``I
would be the first to join them. Yet there are fishermen who insist
in going in those critical areas with rockhopper gear and
flattening them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Gladding, a Key West commercial fisherman, tried to strike
a tone of compromise. ``These fish belong to everyone,'' he said.
``As commercial fishermen, we have the first responsibility to
protect them.'' But he believes, ``There's no such thing as
nonconsumptive use. Catch-and-release fishing has a mortality rate
of 5-10 percent. Every time a snorkeler touches a bit of coral it
dies. That's not nonconsumptive.''
</P>
<P>
   And Calomo is concerned that large protected and other
regulations will favor recreational fishermen and more highly
capitalized, increasingly mobile commercial operations that will
cause the disappearance of small inshore owner-operators, the last
large group of independent food producers in this country. For
consumers, he said, that will mean a loss of access to the freshest
fish.
</P>
<P>
   Every region has its own particular problems to resolve in
creating a regulatory strategy. Both Brownlee and Gladding, are
part of the working group designing the 185-square-mile protected
area near Florida's Dry Tortugas. ``I like MPAs,'' said Gladding.
``But I don't trust the government. We've heard 20-2020: 20 percent
of all our fishing grounds closed by the year 2020. This is only
the tip of the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   But everyone agrees that something needs to be done. ``There's
too many fishermen chasing too few fish,'' said Brownlee. ``If
we're going to accomplish anything, everybody's got to come to the
table ready to gore their own ox.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone, including Konstantino Papoulidis. &QL;

BLACKOUTS RE-ARM ADVOCATES OF CONSERVATION PROGRAMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALAN FINDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At a time when the rising demand for energy has
stretched the New York metropolitan region's power systems to the
limit, the state has quietly scaled back its effort to promote
energy conservation. Once a leader among states, New York has
reduced its main program to encourage conservation of electricity
by 75 percent in the last six years, much to the dismay of
environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists have challenged the cutbacks by concentrating
on environmental concerns. They say it is important to reduce the
demand for electricity in order to curb air pollution by
diminishing the amount of fuel burned in power plants.
</P>
<P>
   But after the blackouts last week in Washington Heights, the
Lower East Side and other New York City neighborhoods,
environmentalists have seized on what they hope will be a powerful
new argument in the debate: Reducing the demand for electrical
power, they say, would reduce stress on an aging electrical
distribution system and diminish the risk of future power failures.
</P>
<P>
   Few if any environmentalists would claim that the cutback in the
state's energy conservation program caused the failure of
``feeder'' cables that carry electricity to neighborhoods from
local distribution stations, which led to the blackouts. Instead,
they say that a reduction in demand for electricity, especially at
peak moments like the hottest days of the summer, would ease the
strains on the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't say that problems with any single feeder line would
not occur,'' said Edward Smeloff the executive director of the Pace
Energy Project at the Pace University School of Law. ``But
statistically more load means more heat, which causes the failures.
The argument for conservation in the current setting is to increase
the robustness of the distribution system, to increase its
reliability.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The system's reliability, already severely tested in the heat
wave, faces much larger tests in the future, utility experts say.
The increasing demand for energy in the New York metropolitan area
is not being matched by a comparable increase in the systems'
capacity to generate and deliver it, the experts say.
</P>
<P>
   They say the answer lies in four areas: building power plants to
keep up with demand rising 2 percent to 3 percent a year
nationally; adding new transmission lines to bring power into the
metropolitan area; upgrading local lines that deliver electricity,
and adopting more aggressive energy conservation programs.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over changes by state regulators in the arcane world
of energy conservation has gone on for several years with little
public notice. That is in part because the regulations are
complicated, but it is also because fuel prices are at record lows
and electricity rates remain relatively low. Moreover, the benefits
of conserving energy are long term, while the cost of investing in
more energy-efficient equipment is immediate.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are far removed from the days, in the 1970s, when the
Arab oil boycott caused energy prices to skyrocket and conservation
to become a way of life, at least for a while. Just as motorists
slowly drifted back to larger, gas-guzzling sedans and sport
utility vehicles, consumers of electricity have lost much of their
passion for energy-efficient appliances and fixtures.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning a decade ago, state utility regulators tried to
encourage consumers to reduce their demand for electricity. They
created a program that requires power companies to reimburse
customers for some of the cost of replacing light fixtures,
electric motors, air-conditioners and other appliances with newer,
more energy-efficient models. The cost of the reimbursement was
built into the rates that utilities were permitted to charge.
</P>
<P>
   While homeowners and apartment owners could take advantage of
the program, it was aimed especially at businesses, owners of
office buildings and other commercial customers, where the
substitution of modern equipment can cut energy use by as much as
20 percent to 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the program's peak years, in 1992 and 1993, power companies
statewide spent nearly $300 million a year to help subsidize the
purchase of energy-efficient appliances and lighting systems. But
then the cutbacks began, first under Gov. Mario Cuomo and
continuing under Gov. George Pataki. Last year, utilities spent $66
million for the conservation effort, according to data compiled by
the Natural Resources Defense Council.
</P>
<P>
   Other states have spent much more. Connecticut utilities spent
$109 million last year to reimburse customers for buying more
efficient equipment, and power companies in New Jersey spent $230
million, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. In
California, utilities spent $415 million last year in a similar
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have all made a much greater commitment to energy
efficiency funding than New York does now,'' said Larry Shapiro, a
staff attorney with the New York Public Interest Research Group who
follows energy policy. ``In New York, the program has been mostly
dismantled.''
</P>
<P>
   State regulators scaled back the program to help reduce
electricity rates and as part of a broad restructuring of the
industry: moving away from the traditional system, which gave
utilities a monopoly on power distribution, and toward a
competitive market in which consumers will be able to choose among
electricity providers. In the new system, the regulators believe,
the marketplace will encourage efficiency, with some energy
companies trying to attract customers by offering conservation
services. The State Public Service Commission, which regulates
utilities, believes that ``innovative, cost-effective energy
services will develop in this new competitive market,'' said David
Flanagan, the commission's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But many conservationists are skeptical that energy companies
and consumers will spend enough on new equipment to curb the growth
in demand for electricity. The competitive pressure to keep rates
low will make it difficult to increase spending on conservation,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a short-term discretionary cost that they could
cut,'' Ashok Gupta, an economist at the Natural Resources Defense
Council, said of the reductions in conservation spending. ``It was
a bad decision to get some short-term savings. It's like not
plugging up the hole in your gas tank because you don't want to
spend the money right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason we need to do it is that markets don't do it,''
Gupta said. ``Developers who build the buildings don't care what
the energy bill will be.''

VENTURA SURPRISES METS AND THEN INSPIRES THEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (With BBO-METS-YANKS) 
 (js) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Robin Ventura approached his locker stall in the Mets'
clubhouse Saturday morning, the good-natured ribbing began.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's walking!'' Brian McRae said, in mock disbelief. ``I can't
believe he's walking. It's amazing! I guess they never had gamers
in this city before.''
</P>
<P>
   New York has had plenty of gamers over the years. But McRae was
right about one thing: Ventura deserves the title.
</P>
<P>
   The third baseman, who turns 32 on Wednesday, was not expected
to play against the Yankees at Shea Stadium Friday night. It was
questionable whether he would even play at all this weekend because
of a bruised big toe on his left foot.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ventura was hobbling around the Mets' clubhouse Friday
afternoon. And he not only talked Manager Bobby Valentine into
letting him play that night, Ventura's defense _ seven assists, two
putouts _ was instrumental in the Mets' 5-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura obviously has a tremendous threshold for pain. His left
foot has bothered him since the first time at bat of the season,
when Florida's Luis Castillo dropped a bunt down the third-base
line in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foot was planted, I tried to go the other way and I
sprained my midfoot,'' Ventura said.
</P>
<P>
   The foot has yet to fully heal. And so, when Ventura was hit on
his big toe with a pitch against the Montreal Expos on Wednesday
night, it only made matters worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The foot hurts, that's all,'' Ventura said. But not enough to
keep him from playing against the Yankees. That would take
something much more serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mostly fielding,'' he said. ``If I feel like I can get to
ground balls, then I'll say I can play. You do what you can,
hitting. But if you don't field balls, you're not really good to
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Ventura, a five-time Gold Glove winner, fielded everything hit
his way. And on Saturday he admitted one of the reasons he wanted
to play was that with Al Leiter pitching plenty of grounders
figured to come his way.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's mere presence at third seems to lift the Mets. Call it
the Willis Reed effect. Reed hobbled out onto the floor for Game 7
of the 1970 National Basketball Association Finals and inspired his
Knicks teammates to a title over the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Mets and Yankees were playing for lesser stakes.
But Ventura hobbled out to third base just the same. And his
teammates, the winning pitcher Leiter in particular, said Friday
night it picked them up. They were not the only ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a tremendous performance from him yesterday,''
General Manager Steve Phillips said Saturday. ``Just being out
there was significant. It was as if he was a magnet, almost like to
test him, and he handled every play. I thing it was a pick up.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bobby Valentine said, ``Robin has given a real favorable
impression since he got here. And these last few days have put an
accent on what he's brought.''
</P>
<P>
   It came as no surprise, therefore, when Ventura popped his head
in the manager's office Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He walked into the clubhouse, came into my office, sat down
and said he can't wait to have three days of barbecue to rest his
body and foot,'' Valentine said, referring to the All-Star Game
break. ``I looked at the calendar and said three days are coming up
soon, and he said he'll use those three days to rest.''
</P>
<P>
   And as much as Ventura deserved a trip to Boston to play in the
All-Star Game, he deserves the rest even more.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   JAY PAYTON is injured again. General Manager STEVE PHILLIPS said
Payton had tweaked an oblique muscle Friday and will be out seven
to 10 days. Payton has already missed considerable chunks of this
season due to shoulder surgery and hamstring problems. Payton, who
has also had numerous elbow problems, just cannot seem to stay
healthy. He is hitting .388 for Class AAA Norfolk in 26 games. ``We
are concerned about him,'' Phillips said. ``It would be nice to
keep him healthy. The ball comes off his bat different than most
hitters. I don't know if it's bad luck or bad collagen.''

A WELL-TRAVELED YOUNGSTER FINALLY HITS HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Md.)   (bl)  
 By ANDREW R. TRIPALDI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlos Parra thinks he has finally found his soccer niche with
the New England Revolution of Major League Soccer. And it took only
three years, two trades, hassles with the National Collegiate
Athletic Association, and a series of personal and professional
adjustments on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Things started out simply enough. While attending West Haven
High School in Connecticut, Parra transferred to nearby Hamden Hall
as a junior, partly because his mother wanted him to attend a
private school but also because Hamden had an outstanding soccer
program.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Hamden Hall in June 1996, Parra, a
defensive midfielder, was set to attend the University of Maryland
on a full athletic scholarship in September. Going to college and
playing soccer had been a family goal from the outset, and Parra
was thrilled that he was going to play at the Division I level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking forward to being a part of the soccer program at
Maryland,'' Parra said. ``I was very excited and very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The rejoicing didn't last long. About a week before Parra was to
move to Maryland, the NCAA ruled that he was ineligible for his
college scholarship because his ninth grade English class at West
Haven was academically unacceptable. Encouraged by his family to
take another English class, Parra fulfilled the NCAA requirement.
But, still stung by the ruling, he decided not to attend Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Parra declared his eligibility for the 1997 MLS draft,
and, at 19, he was selected by the MetroStars and became the
youngest player in the league's history. His soccer nightmare
seemed to have turned into a dream come true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had always rooted for the MetroStars because they were the
local team for me when I was still in school in Connecticut,''
Parra said.
</P>
<P>
   Parra played in four games for New York/New Jersey during the
1997 season. He also spent time with Project 40, a program to
assist the top prospects in the United States between the ages of
18 and 20.
</P>
<P>
   The experience he gained from Project 40 and his youthful
promise on the MetroStars bench didn't help Parra, however, when
Coach Alfonso Mondelo decided to go with veterans.
</P>
<P>
   On June 5, 1998, Parra was traded to Miami for Ramiro Corrales.
Disappointed, but undeterred, Parra embraced Miami and became a
solid contributor to the Fusion. He finished the 1998 season with
two assists in 1,367 minutes over 18 games, establishing himself as
a defensive presence. And Miami made the playoffs, where it lost to
D.C. United in the Eastern Conference semifinals 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   But as the 1999 season approached, Parra, homesick and yearning
to return to the Northeast, expressed his feelings to the Miami
management. On June 4, he was traded to New England for forward
Tony Kuhn and a second round pick in the 2000 college draft. Now on
his third professional team and still young enough to be a college
undergraduate, Parra was coming home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have many veteran players on our team, and at 22, he has
already played in the MLS for three seasons,'' said Walter Zenga,
the New England coach-goaltender, who called the 6-foot-2-inch,
165-pound Parra a strong midfield tackler. ``I think he can
continue to grow and develop into a top player by learning from the
players around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, playing alongside his New England teammates John
Harkes and Joe Max-Moore, both veterans of the United States
national team, can only help Parra. And though it took a while,
Parra said he is finally feeling at home with his role with the
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on how the team is faring, Parra plays 30 to 45
minutes, primarily in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am able to come in the game with fresh legs and win tackles
and get the loose balls,'' Parra said. ``Walter told me that my job
right now is to come off the bench and contribute to the team in
the second half of the game.''

WITH A LOT OF WORK A WRECK CAN BE TURNED INTO A GEM  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.) (rk) 
 By   TRISH HALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You have to wonder. Did it ever occur to the dogs
that their routes had suddenly changed, that they were taking long
detours, walking past construction sites and debris-filled
Dumpsters?
</P>
<P>
   Because for several months, while the owners of Johnny Dog
Walkers were squiring their charges around the Upper West Side of
Manhattan, they were walking even more than usual, looking for
cast-off materials that might be used to restore the owners' new
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   It was a place that needed everything, a place so rundown that
even the typical euphemisms weren't used by the broker _ no mincing
words, no ``with a little TLC this Upper West Side gem. ...'' It
was an out-and-out wreck.
</P>
<P>
   The large one-bedroom apartment with a separate office,
previously occupied by a 92-year-old woman, had a decrepit kitchen,
a bathtub with pipes so corroded water could barely make its way
out, and tons of peeling paint, all of it powder blue, even on the
old oak moldings. The floors were covered with linoleum.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only $110,000 for 780 square feet with a $560
maintenance, a good price for a sunny apartment on West 85th
Street, even three years ago, when they found it. And if John
Kristovich and John Bilka were ever to live in something larger
than a studio apartment, they figured they would have to take on
something with problems. ``No one wanted it,'' said Bilka, 38.
``Which was kind of scary,'' said Kristovich, 34.
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if it would cost about $60,000 to renovate, and the
two men had only $20,000. Buying it in the first place was a big
stretch, made possible only by a loan from Kristovich's father, a
retired policeman in San Francisco who is now a real estate broker.
</P>
<P>
   By looking for old but usable materials, and by doing much of
the work themselves, they hoped to restore the apartment to its
former style, not implant something modern or foreign in the 1899
apartment building. It's not a grand building, by any means, but
their apartment has a great deal of inherent charm, with pleasing
moldings, high ceilings and rooms laid out so that privacy is
maximized.
</P>
<P>
   As so often happens, things didn't exactly go well. Because they
couldn't afford to hire a contractor with a large crew, they hired
a contractor and agreed to do much of the work themselves. Every so
often, Kristovich would hand the contractor a check for $5,000,
until one day he realized that he had already spent $18,000, ``and
we had no kitchen, and no bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the contractor basically disappeared, the two men
said, leaving one worker at the job. With that sole worker, they
proceeded to finish the job, learning about construction as they
did it.
</P>
<P>
   For the kitchen, they found an old cupboard in a Dumpster that
very nearly matched an existing one in their now charming kitchen,
with its green-tiled counter top and window box of geraniums. A
Dumpster also yielded a mirrored cabinet for the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like rats,'' Kristovich said. ``That was something our
contractor couldn't understand, bringing in old crummy stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the bulk of the work was done, and their bill
reached $27,000. Their relationship with the contractor steadily
deteriorated, and at the end, Bilka said, the contractor said,
``OK, that's it, we're outta here,'' and walked out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Bilka was so angry about the mess left behind, he said, ``that I
started throwing bags of garbage at him, paint cans, saying, `Take
it with you.'''
</P>
<P>
   The process was so agonizing that they came to hate the
apartment, and dreaded moving in. ``It was very emotional at the
end,'' said Kristovich. But once the contractor was gone, it was
really over, and they began anew. ``We loved the apartment,'' said
Kristovich. But just to be sure that the bad energy was gone, a
friend came in, with potions of sage and rosewater.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows about blessing apartments,'' Bilka said, sounding
not like a believer but simply a man unwilling to risk any more
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   For Kristovich, who had been working sporadically as an actor
after graduating with a theater arts degree from UCLA, the
renovation was more than just a way to have a place to live. He
found the process so compelling he gave up acting and enrolled in a
two-year degree program in interior design at Parsons.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Bilka, who had been working in theatrical management and set
decoration for movies, now uses their home office to write. Both
continue to walk dogs and to work on the apartment, although
they've stopped their Dumpster shopping. Recently, Bilka stripped
decades of encrusted paint from the original living room
chandelier, exposing its brass-plated tin, and he has plans to do
the same for the one in their office.
</P>
<P>
   But even before they finally finish, they have been wondering
what it might be like to take on another wreck. Just out of
curiosity, they accepted a broker's offer to come and look their
place over and estimate its value. Told that their place might
fetch $330,000, they are tempted to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   Kristovich, though, is not a mover by nature. ``I'd hate to
leave this place,'' he said. ``I could see being a little old man
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Bilka, though, couldn't be more different. In the early 1980s,
he was working for IBM, and moved so often that his manager once
called him in, worried about the number of new addresses. ``He
asked, `Is someone harassing you? Are you in trouble?''' Bilka
recalled. ``I said, `No, I just like to move a lot.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Kristovich's reluctance, it is easy to see that the lure
of the ever-rising real estate market might pull them toward
another project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're attached to our mothers, too,'' he said, ``but for the
right price, we'd sell them.''(BBOX)

LONG ISLAND: AS RENTS CLIMB, CO-OP SALES AND PRICES TURN UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By DIANA SHAMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After renting in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn
for eight years, Nancy Heiss, who works as a project manager for a
Manhattan office furniture company, decided she wanted to buy
rather than continue as a tenant.
</P>
<P>
   But with apartments in both Park Slope and Manhattan so
expensive, she said, her search brought her to Long Beach, an area
where her parents had once lived, and where she has relatives.
</P>
<P>
   She found a $120,000 one-bedroom co-op at 600 Shore Road through
a local real estate agent, Marilyn Topper, and closed June 16. The
94-unit oceanfront building has an indoor pool. Her apartment has a
side view of the ocean and her $600 a month maintenance includes
taxes and heat. With mortgage payments, her monthly costs are
$1,300, which is $300 less than one-bedroom rentals in Park Slope,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some savings, interest rates were down and I just felt
the time was right for me to buy,'' said the 35-year-old Miss
Heiss.
</P>
<P>
   At one time, the Long Island co-op market was almost moribund in
some areas, and price increases are still lagging behind those of
houses and condominiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last market to have been lifted up in the suburbs has been
the co-op market because buyers feel that condominiums offer them
greater flexibility,'' said Kenneth Jacobs, a Manhattan and Yonkers
lawyer who is president of the metropolitan area chapter of the
Community Associations Institute, a national organization of co-op,
condominium and homeowners associations in Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Co-op buyers often do not like the idea that boards have so much
control, Jacobs explained.
</P>
<P>
   Owning shares in a cooperative corporation instead of receiving
a deed to property is still an alien concept for many suburbanites,
said Mark Walsh of Consolidated Communities of Long Island, a group
representing 75 co-op, condominium and homeowners associations in
Suffolk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Co-ops have the same pools and amenities as condominiums, the
buildings are in good shape, the grounds are nicely kept and they
are in good shape financially, but people are still a bit leery of
co-ops,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But a turnaround is now being swelled by first-time buyers like
Miss Heiss who are tired of pouring money into rent and by older
purchasers. For those couples, many of whom are selling their homes
at high prices, co-ops offer a way to stay in their communities in
a maintenance-free setting that, unlike a rental, has tax
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   The revived interest in co-ops began in areas like Great Neck,
which has a heavy concentration of apartment houses, but now
appears to be affecting sales everywhere as prices of single-family
houses and condominiums continue to climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market started turning around slowly the beginning of the
year and it is now really starting to move,'' said Elaine Nolan, a
Hempstead broker, about her area of Mineola and Hempstead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six months ago, we got three calls a month for co-op loans;
now we are getting 10 to 15 calls,'' said Richard Shyman, the
president of IMS Capital in Melville, a mortgage broker. ``Co-ops
are viable again and mortgage money is there again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Prices are coming back incredibly and we are seeing a lot more
action,'' said Steven Greenbaum, director of property management at
Mark Greenberg Real Estate in Port Washington, which manages about
40 co-op buildings in Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   F OR a long time, ``there was almost no market,'' said Michael
F. Cohen, a Smithtown lawyer who represents 20 co-op complexes in
Suffolk. ``But the price of co-op apartments is so disproportionate
to the cost of homes that people realize they represent a
lower-cost alternative and are something they can still afford,''
he added. ``The co-ops I represent have seen sales and prices they
have not seen for a number of years.''
</P>
<P>
   These observations are echoed by co-op owners. ``Nowhere on Long
Island is the market comparable to what's happening in Manhattan,
but it's definitely picking up after being sluggish for a good
number of years,'' said Michael Herzog, president of the co-op
board at the 68-unit Cedarhurst Park in Cedarhurst.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for a one-bedroom apartment in the building have gone up
to $85,000 from $60,000 in three years, Herzog said, and
two-bedrooms have risen to $120,000 from $90,000. ``We are getting
young couples who can't afford a house and who want to own
something, and older people selling houses who want to stay in the
area,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Ellmer, the co-op board president of the 84-unit Seaview
Terrace in Long Beach, said that would-be buyers were calling at
the rate of ``about five calls a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices in the building have seen a ``tremendous jump'' over the
last two years, said Ellmer, a Garden City lawyer. Still, with
prices ranging from $80,000 for a studio to $190,000 for a
two-bedroom, ``the co-ops are reasonably priced for people who have
sold a home and want a smaller place and also for young people just
starting out,'' he said. Many young professionals are coming to
Long Beach, he added, because of the beach community style of
living.
</P>
<P>
   At the Valley Park Estates co-op in Valley Stream, the sponsor,
VP Owners in Great Neck, which still owns 130 of the 436 units in
the complex, had been renting them out for years because nothing
was selling.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has more buyers than empty apartments available, said
Jeffrey Bookman, one of the principals. ``A year ago, we had no
activity,'' he said. ``Now we are selling four to five units a
month.'' With prices for the one- and two-bedroom apartments
ranging from $40,000 to $60,000, and monthly rents for the same
units ranging from $850 to $1,100, ``people realize it's cheaper to
own than to rent,'' Bookman said, adding he has 20 units under
contract.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``The major issue for me was owning something rather than
renting,'' said Lucian Gonzalez, an engineer, recently bought a
one-bedroom unit at Valley Park Estates, paying $40,000. With
maintenance of a $495, his monthly costs come to only $800,
Gonzalez said. He had been paying $700 a month to rent a studio
apartment in Howard Beach, Queens. ``I also view my co-op as a
steppingstone to eventually purchasing a house,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joel Greenberg, a salesman for a hair products company, and his
wife, Diane, who is in real estate sales, moved into the Plaza, a
Lawrence co-op, four years ago, after selling a four-bedroom home
in North Woodmere. The building is next to a country club with golf
and a marina and is a short walk to the train station.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in a house for 30 years, and I didn't miss the house
three minutes,'' said Greenberg, now board president at the Plaza,
a luxury building with a pool and a doorman where two-bedroom
apartments now sell for $250,000 (up, according to Mrs. Greenberg,
from $195,000 a year ago).
</P>
<P>
   It is buyers like the Greenbergs who are also fueling the Great
Neck market. People are selling large and unwieldy houses to move
into a community where amenities, shopping and transportation are
all nearby, said Ellen Steinberg-Finkelstein, who specializes in
co-op sales at Trylon Realty in Great Neck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, people would sell their houses and rent, but now
they want to buy because rentals are too expensive,'' she added.
``My problem is that I don't have enough inventory.''
</P>
<P>
   Two of her recent buyers, Doris and Seymour Graylin, came from
34 years of living in a two-family house in Bayside, Queens, moving
last week into a two-bedroom co-op in Great Neck, for which they
paid $300,000, not counting extensive renovations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never another house,'' said Mrs. Graylin, 69. Her husband, a
retired accountant, is 75. ``I don't want to weed the garden
anymore or shovel snow,'' Mrs. Graylin added.
</P>
<P>
   Their new apartment is two blocks from shopping, restaurants and
the Long Island Rail Road station ``so we won't have to drive so
much,'' she added. ``Renting was not an option,'' she said,
``because we wouldn't have any tax benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices in Great Neck have been rising, Ms. Steinberg-Finkelstein
said. Studios that started at $30,000 two years ago now begin at
$55,000. A typical one-bedroom has gone to $175,000 from $142,000,
and a two-bedroom to $350,000 from $235,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are reliving 1985 to 1986 again because, with the decrease
in the amount of houses on the market, that leaves co-ops,'' said
Jan Kalman, a real estate agent in Woodmere.
</P>
<P>
   In Roslyn, where small houses start at $250,000 and there is
also a shortage of houses for sale, ``co-ops are the best
alternative if you want to get into a good school district,'' said
Roy Sobel, a local broker. Prices for a one-bedroom start at
$60,000, and a two-bedroom recently closed for $79,500, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people can't afford a home, but they want to buy
something and so they are buying co-ops,'' he said.

RESIDENTIAL STORAGE LOCKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One of the frustrations of modern life is having lots
of stuff but nowhere to put it. In a city where closets become
bedrooms, empty space becomes a treasured amenity.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising, then, that when co-op or condominium
boards start thinking about converting spare space into spare
change, they often end up thinking about storage lockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Storage lockers can be a benefit for residents and a
moneymaker for the building,'' said Arnold Roth, president of A&AMP;D
Steel Equipment, a storage locker manufacturer in the Long Island
City section of Queens. ``You take a dirty, dark, empty space and
turn it into a beautiful room that's freshly painted, well-lit and
clean as a whistle.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth's company specializes in building fully enclosed, steel
storage lockers with double doors, a baked-enamel finish and
locking rods that extend through the frame at the top and bottom of
the doors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do leave some holes so that air can penetrate,'' he said.
``But they're small enough to keep the critters with four legs
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Roth said that almost any dry, empty space in a building can be
turned into a storage area that residents will pay to fill with
their belongings.
</P>
<P>
   ``An average-sized storage locker can rent for anywhere from $25
to $40 a month,'' Roth said, noting that ``average'' referred to a
locker that is about 7 feet high, 4 or 5 feet wide and 4 or 5 feet
deep. ``In upscale buildings that are short on closet space, you
can get even more money. We sold one building a 7-foot-tall,
5-by-5-foot locker with double-thick metal walls and a metal
ceiling. It even had hookups for electrical fixtures. They rented
it out for $450 a month.''
</P>
<P>
   While average-sized storage lockers in average buildings demand
more average rents, Roth said, what makes them a ``win-win''
proposition for a co-op or condominium is that even a modest rental
charge quickly becomes pure profit for the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the trick,'' Roth explained. ``Average lockers cost
about $500 to $600 apiece. The co-op board usually buys them with
money from the reserve fund. Then the board rents the lockers to
residents for a monthly fee. That means that if the board gets just
$25 a month, that's $300 a year, and the locker is completely paid
for in about two years.'' After that, Roth said, it's clear profit
for the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``You put in 50 lockers, and in a couple of years you've
recouped your original $25,000 investment and you're making $15,000
a year in profit,'' he said. ``That's better than investing in
bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if a building just doesn't have an extra $25,000 lying
around? Or what if a building's board just doesn't like the idea of
going into the locker rental business?
</P>
<P>
   No problem, said Josh Goldman, an executive vice president of
Bargold Storage Systems in Manhattan. ``We can take a dark, dismal
area and transform it into a professional-looking storage facility
in a couple of weeks and at no cost to the building.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman explained that when a co-op or condominium board hires
Bargold for its storage-locker needs, the building gets a freshly
painted, well-lit storage area filled with elevator-sized
corrugated steel lockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We build our 7-foot-tall lockers 4 feet wide by 6 feet deep,''
he said. ``We want them to be big enough to hold a bicycle without
standing it on end.''
</P>
<P>
   Such lockers, Goldman said, can be installed in whatever empty
space a building has available without the expenditure of one cent
of the reserve fund or one iota of energy on the part of the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do everything,'' Goldman said. ``We build the lockers on
site, paint the room, put in new lighting and secure the room with
high-security locking doors. Then we do all the administrative
work, all the marketing, all the billing, all the collecting and
all the signing up of tenants.'' And at the end of every month, he
added, Bargold sends the building a check for 25 percent of all
storage fees it collects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provide a true amenity for residents with no imposition on
the board,'' Goldman said, adding that the average monthly rent for
a 6-by-6-foot locker in Manhattan is about $45; the average in the
other boroughs and outside the city is about $38 a month. Generally
speaking, he said, Bargold estimates the number of lockers that
will be needed in a particular building at somewhere between 10 and
20 percent of the total number of units in the building.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For boards that like the idea of generating revenue by providing
storage space for residents, but dislike the idea of becoming
locker landlords only slightly less than they dislike the idea of
an outsider siphoning money from the building, there is yet another
alternative: Convert the unused space into cash by building
lockers, allocating shares to the lockers and selling the shares to
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many buildings have allocated shares to areas that are not
physically attached to a particular unit,'' said Arthur I.
Weinstein, vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives
and Condominiums. ``Buildings often allocate shares to parking
spaces and then sell the shares, and the exclusive right to use the
space, to tenant-shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally speaking, Weinstein said, allocating shares to
amenities such as storage lockers is attractive to both the co-op
and its shareholders. The co-op, he said, generates revenue from
the sale of shares to otherwise unproductive space and by
collecting additional maintenance charges on the new shares.
</P>
<P>
   The shareholder, on the other hand, gets to own his or her
storage space rather than having to rent it from someone else, has
surplus belongings close at hand and enjoys the tax benefits of
deducting property taxes and interest on share-loans used to
purchase the shares allocated to the space.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein noted, however, that allocating shares to
nonresidential areas of a co-op can be risky business if it is not
handled properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Section 216 of the tax code says that all outstanding shares
in a co-op must be issued for residential purposes,'' he said,
explaining that it is that section of the code that gives co-op
shareholders the ability to be treated like homeowners and
condominium unit-owners for income-tax purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, Weinstein said, if a board does not make absolutely
certain that shares allocated to ``ancillary spaces'' are owned
only by existing tenant-shareholders as appurtenances to their
apartments, the entire building could lose its status as a
residential co-op under Section 216 of the tax code.
</P>
<P>
   And that, said Joel E. Miller, a Queens tax lawyer, could result
in shareholders losing valuable tax benefits such as the right to
take deductions for property taxes and the interest on share loans
and the underlying mortgage on the building, and depriving them of
the ability to exclude from capital gains taxes up to $500,000 in
gain realized upon the sale of an apartment that is a principal
residence.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said that the best way for a co-op board to prevent that
from happening would be to tie ancillary spaces like storage
lockers to individual apartments by combining the shares allocated
to both on a single certificate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's critical to keep the shares to ancillary spaces
absolutely tied to a dwelling unit in the building,'' Miller said.
``Because if those shares should come into the hands of somebody
who is not a tenant-shareholder, you could have a very expensive
problem on your hands.''

INSIGNIA GROUP'S EXPANDING UNIVERSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, S.C.) (lb) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It would be hard to argue that Andrew Farkas, the
chairman and chief executive of Insignia Financial Group, is afraid
of change.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the company in 1990, he built it into one of the
largest owners and managers of residential properties in the United
States. Then, in 1996, he acquired Edward S. Gordon Co., one of the
largest commercial real estate services companies in the New York
region, and used it as the base for building a nationwide and
international network of commercial offices.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later he got out of the apartment management business
outside the New York area to concentrate on developing the
commercial side of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently he spent $65 million to acquire Douglas Elliman,
which has a network of offices in upscale New York suburbs and is
the largest residential brokerage in Manhattan. With Douglas
Elliman and Edward S. Gordon as its keystones, Insignia has
announced plans to link commercial and residential operations in an
effort to become a powerful real estate services presence in key
corporate-headquarters cities around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strategy for operating the business is to become dominant
in industry segments,'' said Farkas, who is not yet 40 years old,
during an interview in his newly decorated office at 200 Park Ave.
``That's why Douglas Elliman was such a special opportunity. It
enabled us to become dominant in the No. 1 market in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The move of his corporate headquarters to the former Pan Am
building represents something of a homecoming for Farkas, who is a
native New Yorker. He built the residential management business in
Greenville, S.C., because of the lower costs in that region, but
shifted to New York when he disposed of that business last year.
</P>
<P>
   Farkas is a son of the chairman of the former Alexander's
department store chain, Robin Farkas, who now sits on Insignia's
board.
</P>
<P>
   The company's growth notwithstanding, Insignia's stock price has
remained stuck in the $10 to $12 a share range in recent weeks at a
time when the overall market has been soaring, after trading as
high as $15.50 earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that publicly traded real estate service companies
as a group are out of favor on Wall Street for reasons that range
from the inherently cyclical nature of the real estate business to
a skepticism about the belief that combining dissimilar service
operations will increase earnings and cash flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Street either doesn't understand his strategy or it
doesn't believe the parts fit together in a strategic sense,'' said
Will Marks of Bank of America Securities. Marks also noted that
Insignia has the shortest track record of its publicly traded
peers, at nine years, compared with 30 to 90 years for companies
such as CB Richard Ellis, Jones Lang LaSalle, Grubb &AMP; Ellis and
Trammell Crow and their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Insignia is trying to do has not been done at this level
before,'' said David Harris, an analyst with Lehman Brothers. This,
he said, is a problem for investors because they do not have any
similar companies with which to compare Insignia's financial
performance.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to create additional demand for the stock,
Insignia's board authorized the repurchase of $10 million in stock
in October. Last week, the company announced that $7.5 million had
been spent and authorized an additional $10 million repurchase
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Farkas said he expects to acquire other residential brokerage
companies in cities where Insignia already has commercial
operations and to add services, such as providing mortgages to
buyers of residential properties. Today, the company's network is
composed of 49 offices in 25 states and includes 13
commercial-services companies purchased since the Gordon
acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Insignia/ESG is the biggest commercial real estate services
operation in the New York metropolitan area, having closed 19 of
the 50 largest New York City leasing transactions last year.
Nationally, it completed deals for 100 million square feet of
commercial property and arranged for $3.5 billion in sales and
financing in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Farkas is already established in Britain, Germany and Italy, and
he said he is seeking to acquire existing commercial and
residential companies in other locations in Europe and Asia or
start new companies where suitable acquisitions cannot be
completed. ``Our sights are set on major financial capitals of
Europe, Asia, Canada, Latin America and elsewhere,'' he declared in
Insignia's most recent annual report.
</P>
<P>
   The point of all of this is to build a one-stop-shopping real
estate company for big corporations and the people who manage them.
``We want to be part of every New Yorker's personal and corporate
real estate needs,'' he said in an interview earlier this month.
``The same executives who retain us for commercial space are the
ones who use Douglas Elliman to buy and sell their own co-ops and
condos.''
</P>
<P>
   And since Insignia Residential Group manages 60,000 co-op and
condominium apartments in the metropolitan area, many of those
living in the units are already accustomed to writing monthly
checks to Insignia.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry executives, however, question whether the
synergies that Farkas claims are made possible by combining
commercial and residential operations really exist.
</P>
<P>
   Julien Studley, chairman of the commercial brokerage company
bearing his name, which specializes in representing tenants, said
real estate services companies are hard to manage when they grow
quickly, and called Farkas' plans ``a very challenging task.''
Studley has maintained that real estate service companies are
difficult to manage when they grow quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Mosler, an executive vice president of Cushman &AMP;
Wakefield, one of Insignia's major rivals on the commercial side,
said that ``there is not much synergy between residential and
commercial because they are such different businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are skeptical that the combination will add to
their market share,'' Mosler said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the model for such an effort was the firm of
Coldwell Banker, which added residential brokerage to its existing
commercial brokerage in 1937. The company was acquired by Sears,
Roebuck &AMP; Co. in 1981 and Sears decided to sell the
commercial-brokerage operations eight years later to a company now
known as CB Richard Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to question how successful it was, because Sears
decided to break it up,'' Mosler said.
</P>
<P>
   Farkas contests the analogy. ``Coldwell Banker was different,''
he said. ``It was a single brand and a single management doing both
commercial and residential.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward S. Gordon and Douglas Elliman are different brands and
different businesses that were successful independently and are now
linked only by a common ownership, Farkas said. ``They have
completely separate systems and management and never the twain
shall meet,'' he said. ``The two businesses grew up separately and
achieved dominance, and they just happened to have done it in the
same market.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the brand was also emphasized by Alan Rogers,
the chief executive of Douglas Elliman, who continued in his
position after the company was sold to Insignia. Douglas Elliman
has more than 780 brokers, supported by a corporate staff of 100 in
15 offices. Last year it completed more than 4,100 transactions
with a total value of $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The experience since the acquisition was announced at the end of
May, he said, appears to indicate that there is cross-pollination
between the commercial and residential sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are keeping the Douglas Elliman name,'' he said. ``It is a
great brand that has traditionally been upscale. But more recently
we have been making an effort to be all things to all people, with
a cradle-to-grave philosophy.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the approach was to try to connect with young people
when they first move to the city and to stay with them as they
advance professionally and economically. ``They will probably rent
for a few years and then buy something for $400,000 or $500,000,''
he said. ``They will probably upgrade once or twice before they
finally get a big apartment to raise their family.''
</P>
<P>
   He said it is still not clear how the relationship with the
commercial side of the company will work out in the long term, but
he added: ``I've been staggered over the last few weeks about the
contacts we have gotten from ESG. We get calls saying, `I've got
this client, can you help him, can you help this friend?' There
could be a huge opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Siegel, president of Insignia Financial Group, said the
corporate relocations arranged by the commercial side of the
business have implications for employees who will need housing.
``If people are to be transferring into the tristate area, we can
present an analysis to management about the market and whether
there is a need for incentives,'' he said. ``We can present an
entire package.''
</P>
<P>
   The other residential property owned by Insignia is Realty One,
a Cleveland-based brokerage company specializing in
single-family-home sales. Although it is the biggest such company
in Ohio, and thus meets the goal of market dominance, it seems to
stick out in Insignia's mix of commercial brokerage and investment
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Farkas said one attraction was that Realty One was advanced
technically and had a mortgage banking operation, First Ohio
Mortgage, that will almost certainly be added in some form to
Douglas Elliman. The ability to provide mortgage loans without
having to involve third-party lenders aids the brokerage business
by helping to complete transactions and generates income by
charging fees for the services.
</P>
<P>
   Like most such operations, First Ohio groups the mortgages in
pools and sells them to investors.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Realty One two years ago was intended to be the
first step in an effort to consolidate the highly fragmented home
brokerage business, Farkas said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got Realty One in 1997 at a time when there seemed to be an
opportunity to consolidate the industry into a big national
franchise,'' he said. But after the acquisition, the price of
companies in that business increased beyond what Insignia was
willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the pricing moved away from us we pulled in our horns and
spent the last 24 months learning the business,'' he said. Since
then, he said, the price of brokerage firms has declined, so
Insignia is shopping again, with the Douglas Elliman acquisition
the first addition to the grocery cart.
</P>
<P>
   The price of companies like Realty One or Douglas Elliman is
usually described by dividing the price by the annual income of the
acquired company to produce what is known as a multiple. ``We paid
a lower multiple for Douglas Elliman than for Realty One,'' Farkas
said, ``so pursuing consolidation in major markets makes sense
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Farkas, who worked on Wall Street early in his career, described
Insignia as the equivalent of an opportunity fund, seeking
undervalued investments and selling operations at opportune times
to lock in profits.
</P>
<P>
   This, he said, explains why he got into the apartment management
business early in the 1990s and got out of it last year, with the
exception of New York area operations.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Insignia made investments in multifamily
housing at prices the most recent annual report describes as
``materially accretive to our shareholders'' _ that is, cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy then, as it continues to be, was to consolidate a
fragmented industry. But by 1997 the consolidation was largely
complete, with no big residential management companies left to buy.
``We took the business as far as we could, given our capital
structure'' as a taxpaying corporation, he said. ``Then we looked
for a company with different costs of capital _ a real estate
investment trust _ to merge with.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was a deal with a company named AIMCO that
transferred all of Insignia's residential properties and 8,000
management employees to the REIT, which does not have to pay
federal taxes as long as it distributes 95 percent of its earnings
as dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Insignia shareholders received AIMCO stock equivalent to 20
percent of the company in return for Insignia's residential
properties and now receive dividends that Insignia, as a growth
company, did not pay.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Farkas describes the deal as a good one for his company, which
transferred operations accounting for about 50 percent of its
business in terms of cash flow for a price _ $910 million _ that
was equal to 95 percent of the company's total capitalization.
AIMCO shareholders have benefited as well, since the price of the
company's shares has risen from the mid-$30s to about $43 a share.
</P>
<P>
   That left the restructured Insignia with three operating units,
commercial real estate services, residential management in the New
York area and a capital investment operation known as Insignia
Financial Services.
</P>
<P>
   The investment group now provides only about 2 percent of the
parent company's income _ compared with 72 percent from commercial
services and 26 percent from residential _ but Farkas said he
expects it to be the fastest growing.
</P>
<P>
   He said the commercial deals that Insignia/ESG handles provide
information on potentially attractive investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``They provide a pipeline of investment opportunities that we
can evaluate and deploy our capital alongside our customers in
existing properties and in development projects,'' he said. For
example, the company said it has invested $22 million of equity
capital in 22 existing properties with a total value of $700
million and has put $18 million into five development projects with
a total value of $107 million.
</P>
<P>
   He said Financial Services is also raising funds on Wall Street
for investments that will not show on the company's balance sheet
and is participating in CS First Boston's $500 million Praedium
Fund for International Real Estate.
</P>
<P>
   The unit is also marketing securities for property owners who
prefer using public markets to other forms of financing. ``We want
to be an opportunistic player, like Blackstone, Blackacre and
Apollo,'' he said, mentioning three investment groups.
</P>
<P>
   Like consolidation, growth is something of a mantra for Farkas,
whose largely intact management group has made more than 50
acquisitions since 1990. He said the key to healthy growth is to
maintain financial discipline to avoid overpaying for companies,
and devise financial terms that keep previous owners hard at work.
``We are not an exit strategy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1990 as a real estate investment fund
with $5 million in capital, Farkas said, Insignia has increased
market capitalization to over $1 billion. Total revenues of the
company have risen from $122 million in 1996 to $507 million in
1998, with revenues of $636 million projected for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Insignia has said that the standard measure of economic
performance, net income, is not appropriate for a real estate
company, because its merger and acquisition activity generates a
lot of charges that do not actually cost the company cash.
</P>
<P>
   Farkas and others in the industry prefer to measure financial
performance using what is called EBITDA, earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, which they say approximates
the actual cash generated by the business. By this measure,
Insignia's profits have grown from $15 million in 1996 to $53
million last year.
</P>
<P>
   While Insignia was expanding domestically, the company was also
expanding overseas, particularly in Britain, where it bought two
venerable brokerage companies and combined them into an entity
called Richard Ellis St. Quintin.
</P>
<P>
   (There were two companies named Richard Ellis, one based in
Britain and one in the rest of Europe. An American company then
called CB Commercial bought the continental Richard Ellis and
promptly added it to its corporate name, becoming CB Richard Ellis.
Believing the Richard Ellis brand name has considerable value in
Britain, Insignia has retained it, despite the potential for
confusion.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to geographic expansion, Insignia plans to begin
relying heavily on technology and the Internet to improve the
efficiency of marketing and transactions. Farkas declined to
elaborate in detail on the techniques the company plans to start
using later this year, but he playfully opened an e-mail on his
desktop computer that included a movable 360-degree picture of a
building lobby. And company documents note that Realty One has an
automated system for pre-approving mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   His goal, Farkas said, is to be a customer's only real estate
company. ``We are not interested in one-time relationship with
customers,'' he said. ``We want to work with them and be there for
them whenever they think of real estate.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ During his 12 years in power, whenever
Slobodan Milosevic has been on the ropes, most of the punches have
been thrown here in the Serbian capital.
</P>
<P>
   This is where the Serbian leader called out Yugoslav army tanks
and used tear gas eight years ago to put down a violent
demonstration against state-controlled television, the key lever in
his control of public opinion. It was here that the depth of urban
middle-class revulsion with Milosevic's rule was shown to the world
in three solid months of daily street demonstrations in the winter
of 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   But Belgrade, so far, has been a conspicuous wallflower in the
growing anti-Milosevic movement that has found expression across
Serbia in the last two weeks. This city has about a fifth of
Serbia's population and about 40 percent of its educated
middle-class, yet all the action has been in the boondocks.
</P>
<P>
   With rallies in smaller cities across Serbia, the opposition
movement has tapped frustration among restive army reservists who
are home from the lost war in Kosovo and, for most part, unpaid for
their trouble. It also has plugged into discontent among Serbs who
say they fear for their future in the collapsed postwar economy,
are weary of international isolation and are shamed by crimes
committed in their name in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   While Belgrade's city council argued itself into paralysis last
week over the question of Milosevic's resignation, city leaders in
three cities _ Serbia's second and third largest cities of Novi Sad
and Nis, and the northern city of Sombor _ quickly approved
resolutions demanding that he step down.
</P>
<P>
   The delay in Belgrade's involvement in this season's round of
anti-Milosevic demonstrations does not derive from any lack of
ambient animus toward the Yugoslav president, who has been indicted
as a war criminal and has lost four straight wars while turning
once-prosperous Serbia into the basket-case economy of Eastern
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets here on Friday night, it was difficult to find a
citizen of Belgrade, young or old, middle-class or poor, who did
not believe the time had come for Milosevic to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see him strung up and hanging in the center of
town,'' said Ivan Tarla, 23, a film student at the University of
Belgrade. ``We are ready to go out into the street, but we need
very clear goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Disillusionment with Milosevic and the general situation in
Serbia appears likely to grow as residents who already endured 11
weeks of NATO bombing contended Saturday with unusual summer floods
that claimed at least one life in central Serbia and left suburban
streets in Belgrade awash. Angry residents who spoke to reporters
seemed to view the floods either as a punishment from God, or a
further sign of Milosevic's neglect of his people.
</P>
<P>
   The fractured opposition movement in Serbia is not planning
demonstrations in Belgrade until late August precisely because it
does not yet have a unified set of goals. Milosevic, meanwhile, is
attending to his main instrument of control _ the same
state-controlled television that Belgraders demonstrated against en
masse in 1991. He will rebuild the bombed television headquarters
in the capital, officials say, before the bridges that NATO smashed
all over Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the largest single opposition party _ the only one that
can guarantee the daily presence of tens of thousands of
demonstrators on the streets of the capital for weeks on end _ has
not yet joined the Alliance for Change, the coalition of smaller
opposition parties that is organizing rallies against Milosevic
outside Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian Renewal Movement, led by Vuk Draskovic, the
self-proclaimed ``king of the streets'' and an on-again, off-again
critic of the Milosevic regime, is sitting on its hands for the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, who briefly served as a deputy minister in
Milosevic's government before being fired in the middle of the
Kosovo war, has said the time is not yet ripe for demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Polls indicate that in the aftermath of the Kosovo war,
Draskovic's party gained strength and won the support of about 15
percent of Serbia's population, far more than any other opposition
group. His party leads a coalition that runs city hall in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Probably more important, he controls a Belgrade television
station, Studio B, a widely watched alternative to state television
in the capital. Leaders of smaller opposition parties say they must
gain better access to Studio B to whip up mass enthusiasm for
demonstrations in Belgrade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Draskovic's personal political ambitions seem to be keeping his
party out of the streets. He holds a grudge against Zoran Djindjic,
the key leader of the Alliance for Change. The bad blood grows out
of Djindjic's boycott of an election two years ago, when Draskovic
ran for president of Serbia. Badly needing those opposition votes,
he finished a poor third.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers say Draskovic has decided that the only way to
force Milosevic from power is for a strong individual politician to
rise above a decade of confused infighting among multiple small and
ineffectual opposition parties and give Serbs one clear
alternative. That alternative, in their view, is none other than
Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Alliance for Change, while resentful of what they
say is Draskovic's self-involved brand of politics, do not dismiss
his importance _ especially in street demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Mr. Draskovic's support,'' said Slobodan Vuksanovic, a
senior strategist in the Alliance for Change. ``We need him because
of the number of people he can deliver and because of Studio B.
Belgrade is the heart of Serbia in a political sense. Everything
depends on the success of the demonstrations there.''
</P>
<P>
   Vuksanovic said that in Belgrade, unlike most of the rest of
Serbia, the organizational structure of the ruling and opposition
parties is strong and relatively well disciplined. To pull off a
series of major demonstrations that is big enough not to be
disrupted by Milosevic's police or by supporters of the
ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, he said, the Alliance for
Change has no choice but to try to ally itself with Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   Successful rallies in the boondocks, then, are a way of
convincing Draskovic and members of his Serbian Renewal Movement
that if they stand on the sidelines for too long they may be left
out altogether in divvying up power in a post-Milosevic Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   There were signals last week that the strategy is beginning to
work, as a surprisingly passionate anti-Milosevic movement bubbled
up in the least likely of Serbian towns. In the southern city of
Leskovac, long dominated by Milosevic's supporters, more than
20,000 people filled the streets on Monday. The protest was
followed by smaller demonstrations, one of them violent, throughout
the week.
</P>
<P>
   Startled and anxious to cash in on popular sentiment, the
Serbian Renewal Movement decided on Wednesday to help locals in
Leskovac organize their demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public-address speakers are ours, but the microphone is
theirs,'' said Bojana Ristic, head of the Serbian Renewal Movement
in Leskovac.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Draskovic's party conceded in Belgrade last week that
they had underestimated grass-roots anger at the Milosevic regime.
As for future rallies, they seemed to be opening a door that
Draskovic, just two weeks ago, slammed shut.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vuk knows when the time comes,'' said Ognjen Pribicevic, a
senior political adviser to Draskovic.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, it seems many people are ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be the first in the streets because I have had
enough,'' said Mira Angelic, 50, a lawyer. ``Right now, there is no
spark to start the fire. But I think it is a question of days and
weeks. The spark eventually has to come from Belgrade.''

DEVELOPING A SUBURB, WITH PRINCIPLES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)   (bl)  
 By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAYSLAKE, Ill. _ ``Compact, transit-oriented development'' is
how planners say, ``a suburb where you can walk to the train
station from your house.''
</P>
<P>
   A mantra of the anti-sprawl movement, this concept is endorsed
by Chicago Metropolis 2020, an influential planning advocacy group
headed by George Ranney, a lawyer who was formerly president and
chief executive of Inland Steel Industries.
</P>
<P>
   Ranney is not just preaching the concept. He and his wife,
Victoria Post Ranney, plan to add a ``compact, transit-oriented''
town center to Prairie Crossing, their 667-acre development now
under construction in this village 40 miles northwest of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would this town center be an easy walk to a new train
station planned on the Metra commuter rail line, it would be laid
out on a tight grid of narrow streets, with lots as small as 5,000
square feet. Studio apartments over detached garages would bring an
economic mix of residents. And shops, some with dwellings upstairs,
would be scaled to neighborhood needs: a bakery, a deli, a general
store.
</P>
<P>
   Apostasy, in other words, in the world of conventional suburban
subdivisions.
</P>
<P>
   But the 5-year-old Prairie Crossing project already breaks so
many rules of conventional development that it has drawn national
attention far out of proportion to its small size. Of the 317
single-family homes permitted on the site, 133 are now built and 20
more are under construction.
</P>
<P>
   The community is organized around 10 guiding principles _
available for browsing at www.prairiecrossing.com/principles.htm _
including environmental protection, economic and racial diversity,
convenient and efficient transportation, energy conservation,
esthetic design and ``lifelong learning,'' from child care through
courses at a nearby college to informal adult education.
</P>
<P>
   Buyers choose from 12 prototype frame houses that resemble
homesteads. With gabled roofs, jaunty pediments, deep porches,
clapboard siding, sash windows and white trim against a palette of
rustic colors, they exude so much Americana they almost bring an
Aaron Copland melody to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The development,'' the Chicago Tribune Magazine said in May,
``looks like a well-edited version of the Midwest.'' Nearly 70
percent of the land, 463 acres, is set aside as prairie, pasture,
farmland and wetland, with a serpentine lake suitable for swimming,
small ponds, a community-supported organic garden and stables for
horses.
</P>
<P>
   The tradeoff for this ample communal space is that individual
lots are clustered more closely together and are smaller than they
would be in a conventional subdivision. However, Ranney said he is
finding that ``people care more about access to open lands than
having enormous lots.''
</P>
<P>
   And Grayslake Mayor Pat Carey said the village has made use of
the concept elsewhere. On one site where zoning was previously
limited to one-acre lots, Grayslake will now permit lots as small
as the developer cares to build, provided that 50 percent or more
of the property is set aside as contiguous open space and that
there is no increase in the overall number of houses.
</P>
<P>
   Such an environmentally obliging approach comes at a price:
$330,000 for the average house at Prairie Crossing, Ranney said, or
about 20 to 30 percent higher than comparably sized houses in the
area. That is good for the business success of the development but
has tended to work against the diversity goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have done much better than anyone else around here,''
Ranney said, ``but our hope was that we would have a minority
population somewhat larger than we do.'' It is estimated that 8
percent of the families at Prairie Crossing are African-American,
contrasted with 1 percent in the area.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage a greater mix, the Ranneys would sell 25 smaller
houses in the town center for $180,000 to $220,000. Buyers on some
lots could build 600- to 800-square-foot studio apartments atop
their garages for family use or possibly for rent. The Ranneys
propose to increase the number of single-family homes to 400, from
the maximum of 317 now permitted. The plan is designed by Calthorpe
Associates of Berkeley, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly an appeal to the kind of development they're
proposing,'' Carey said. ``If a good deal of people walk across the
street to take the train, that balances against the increase in
density, in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the mayor is only one of seven members of the village
board, whose approval is required for the new plan. And there is no
predicting the outcome of its deliberations later this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Some Prairie Crossing residents wonder whether a town center
that draws outsiders may deprive them of the comfort of knowing
everyone on the street by sight. They are concerned about the
impact on amenities like the little beach along the lake. And there
is an unspoken fear that lower-priced houses in one part of the
development might depress values elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Even broader concerns, felt throughout surrounding Lake County,
center on new burdens being placed on already overcrowded schools
and roads.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we approved the development, we allowed 317 homes,''
Carey said. ``That's cast in stone at the moment. That's a
significant issue. There is a potential for concern about
increasing the number of houses in any development at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Donna Mack, who moved to Prairie Crossing from Chicago last
year, said of the Ranneys' plan: ``If anybody can make this work, I
think they can. It wasn't what I envisioned and it wasn't what I
expected. But I think it can work.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ranneys said the extra density is needed in part to offset
the expenses they have faced dealing with ``outside threats,''
particularly a nearby landfill. They also pointed out that Prairie
Crossing would come nowhere near the 1,600 units approved for the
site in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the property was acquired by Gaylord Donnelley, the
former president and chairman of R.R. Donnelley &AMP; Sons Co., an
enormous printing concern founded by his grandfather in 1864.
Donnelley, a conservationist, owned a farm in the 2,000-acre
Liberty Prairie Reserve, which adjoins Prairie Crossing. He and
other investors founded Prairie Holdings Corporation to develop the
site.
</P>
<P>
   After Donnelley died in 1992, Prairie Holdings was taken over by
his nephew, Ranney, who grew up a half mile away. Donnelley family
members are among the largest investors in Prairie Crossing, as are
the Ranneys. Ranney is a partner in the law firm of Mayer, Brown &AMP;
Platt.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ranney is the great-granddaughter of George Post, an
architect whose works include the New York Stock Exchange, City
College campus and the former New York Times building on Park Row.
She has edited a volume of the papers of landscape architect
Frederick Law Olmsted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm surprised and delighted to see that if you lay out guiding
principles, the debate tends to be whether you're meeting them,''
Ms. Ranney said. ``People are taking up the cause of Prairie
Crossing in ways I would never have guessed five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents are establishing a charter school, publicly financed but
independent of local school boards. Although the charter was
opposed by the two school districts that serve the area, it was
granted on appeal by the state Board of Education. Classes will be
held in a pitch-roofed country schoolhouse where farm children were
once educated. The earlier school closed in 1958. When the Ranneys
learned in 1995 that the owner sought to raze the building, they
offered to move it to Prairie Crossing. Come August, it will be
home again to 60 youngsters, from kindergarten through second
grade.
</P>
<P>
   With ``lifelong learning'' as a guiding principle, Ms. Ranney
said, ``We thought we needed to start at the beginning.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The nation's oldest civil rights organization
returned Saturday to New York, the city of its founding, to
celebrate its 90th birthday and confront issues as topical as
racial profiling by the police and getting more blacks to use the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
opened its six-day annual convention at the New York Hilton and
Towers in midtown Manhattan by listing several other concerns at
the top of its agenda, like school vouchers, the backslide toward
segregation, voter registration, the quality of health care, and
preparing for appearances by Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday and
Vice President Al Gore on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But its two top officials, speaking to reporters, clearly marked
as their top concern the increasing number of allegations that city
and state police departments around the country routinely stop and
harass drivers because they are black.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen open season on black people in New York,
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and San Diego,'' said NAACP chairman
Julian Bond at a news conference Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Though he said, ``This is an old, old issue for us,'' Bond said
profiling had resurfaced as an urgent topic in the last year,
particularly after incidents in New York City and the admitted use
of racial profiling by New Jersey state troopers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bond nor Kweisi Mfume, the NAACP's president and chief
executive, specified how the organization would battle racial
profiling. But Bond alluded to the recent case of police brutality
in New York, in which fellow officers testified against Officer
Justin Volpe, who was convicted of sodomizing Abner Louima, a black
man, in a police station with a wooden stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are particularly pleased that this blue wall of silence has
at least been cracked here in New York City,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   The agenda differs markedly from that of last year's convention,
held in Atlanta, which took direct aim at critics of affirmative
action, including some justices of the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   This year, organizers said they wanted the convention to focus
more on youth, particularly the need to invigorate the NAACP's
ranks with more young people. The organization's membership,
currently about 500,000, rose by 17,000 in the past year, Bond
said, thanks greatly to efforts to recruit more college-age
members. ``Many of them are coming to us,'' he said, including a
group of students at Harvard University, which formed a chapter
this year, the first at the school since the 1960s, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While still tackling educational issues, like school vouchers,
which the NAACP generally opposes, the convention will also focus
discussion on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Mfume, who spoke despite suffering from a bad case
of laryngitis, said he and Bond would also look at what he called
``the digital divide'' between white and black Americans. A federal
survey last year found that 27 percent of white households were
connected to the Internet, compared with about 9 percent of black
and Hispanic households.
</P>
<P>
   As a way to help remedy that, Mfume announced a plan, still not
complete, to open NAACP ``tech centers'' at chapters around the
country, where children and parents could use Internet together.
The centers, none of which are operating yet, would be wired and
financed in part by AT&AMP;T, Mfume said, once negotiations with the
company are completed in the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The organization also hopes to link each chapter in the nation
to a dedicated NAACP computer network, Bond said. ``Our dream is
that the whole of 2,200 branches will be interconnected,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to scheduling Mrs. Clinton and Gore, who is running
for president, the convention also invited other presidential
candidates, including former Sen. Bill Bradley, Texas Gov. George
W. Bush and Elizabeth Dole. An appearance by Bradley, scheduled for
Saturday night, was listed as tentative, but neither Bush nor Ms.
Dole will be here.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the lack of any national Republican figures on the
NAACP's schedule, Bond said he and Mfume had tried, unsuccessfully,
to get Bush and Ms. Dole, to show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that scheduling conflicts did not allow as
diverse a selection of speakers as we would have hoped,'' Bond
said. ``But we also are confident that we offered the
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Mfume said that both candidates may talk at next year's
convention, before the 2000 election.

RUSSIA, BELARUS EDGE TOWARD UNION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ A new country could appear in Europe by this fall, its
apparent purpose to perpetuate a 1,000-year-old truth.
</P>
<P>
   A treaty merging the former Soviet republics of Russia and
Belarus into a single state may be signed this autumn, Prime
Minister Sergei Stepashin of Russia said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has been toying with the idea of a union with Belarus
since 1996, but progress has been slow. The announcement that the
deal could be done before next year's presidential elections stoked
widespread speculation here that President Boris N. Yeltsin of
Russia plans to use the confederation to extend his rule.
</P>
<P>
   Many here believe Yeltsin has no intention of yielding power.
</P>
<P>
   A constitutional two-term limit requires Yeltsin to leave office
this time next year. But he could become the leader of the new
Russia-Belarus union, a new country with a new legal structure, and
transfer many of his powers to the new post.
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics are not without precedent in contemporary Europe.
Slobodan Milosevic retained his powers when he became president of
Yugoslavia after his legal term as the leader of Serbia ran out in
1997. Russian analysts suggest the ``Milosevic variant'' is
actively being discussed by Yeltsin's backers.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin, who started his summer vacation at his residence
outside Moscow Saturday, said in an interview published here last
week that he would step down when his term ends. Russia's minister
for relations with other former Soviet republics, Leonid
Drachevsky, also ruled out a new role for Yeltsin, saying Friday
that he ``cannot be and will not be president of the Russia and
Belarus Union.''
</P>
<P>
   But politicians, analysts and commentators here say the
Kremlin's sudden haste over the Belarus union means Yeltsin is at
least considering the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the worst-case scenario, Yeltsin is already actively
scheming to become dictator-for-life,'' the English-language daily
The Moscow Times said in an editorial last week. ``Even in the very
best-case scenario, Yeltsin has not made up his mind yet, but is
still actively constructing extraconstitutional roads to stay in
power, just in case.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow's rumor mill has been rampant with speculation that
Yeltsin's Kremlin entourage, popularly known here as ``The
Family,'' was plotting ways to prolong the president's term.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the Belarus idea, one scenario involves provoking the
Communist Party into doing something that would allow Yeltsin to
ban it. Removing the body of Vladimir Lenin from the Kremlin wall
and giving it a Christian burial is one such possibility. Yeltsin
has fed that rumor by publicly calling for Lenin's burial.
</P>
<P>
   Another commonly discussed scheme involves fomenting strife in
the Caucasus and declaring a state of emergency. Yeltsin has fed
that one too, by ordering preventive airstrikes against ``bandit
groups'' in the breakaway region of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But some think the Belarus plan is the most likely scenario,
since it would be easiest to pull off.
</P>
<P>
   Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, commenting last week
on this possibility, suggested Yeltsin might try to justify staying
in power by saying he is acting in the public interest.
</P>
<P>
   While Yeltsin is universally unpopular in Russia, a union of the
two countries would be embraced both here and in Belarus, where
nostalgia for the old Soviet Union is strong. Recent polls show 80
percent of Russians support the merger. The parliaments of the two
nations, dominated by Communists and other parties similarly
nostalgic for days gone by, have already agreed to a new national
anthem that uses the music of the old Soviet one.
</P>
<P>
   That means Yeltsin's sworn enemies, the Russian Communists,
cannot speak out against his plans, which, for the moment anyway,
so closely parallel their own. That in itself no doubt gives the
Kremlin leader no small delight.
</P>
<P>
   But there are problems. Some Yeltsin aides fear unification
could provide an opportunity for Belarus's authoritarian president,
Alexander Lukashenko, to fulfill his own ambition of moving into
the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   A charismatic speaker who has banned opposition parties and
jailed their leaders, Lukashenko has grown popular in Belarus's
poorest rural areas since his election in 1994. Lately, he has been
touring Russia in what appears to be an effort to build a political
base. Last week he said he favored putting to a vote whether he or
Yeltsin should lead the new union.
</P>
<P>
   Russian liberals are wary of the union, partly because they
worry about Lukashenko's poor record on human rights, partly
because they wonder how Russia would absorb the Soviet-style
command economy Lukashenko has reinstated in his impoverished
country of 10 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``A single economic course for a new state would be possible
only under one of two conditions: Either Russia swears off reforms,
or Belarus takes them up,'' commented Semyon Novoprudsky, an
political analyst for the daily Izvestia.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has also voiced concern that a union
could undermine Russian democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absent the full restoration of democratic government in
Belarus, it's hard to imagine that any popular approval process on
union in Belarus would be truly democratic and representative of
the will of the people,'' State Department spokesman James Foley
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Washington has long complained about Lukashenko, but its
criticism was not likely to be heard by policy makers in Moscow and
Minsk, many of whom see the union as an appropriate response to
NATO's expansion into countries like Poland and Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   A more serious consideration for Yeltsin could be the reaction
of the autonomy-minded leaders of Russia's 89 regions. The leaders
of Tatarstan and Bashkortostan, predominantly Muslim semiautonomous
republics smack in the middle of Russia, both demanded to be a part
of any negotiations involving a new state.

   COKE-EUROPE _ BRUSSELS _ The health scare that has gripped
Europe this year goes far beyond the recent Coca-Cola crisis here.
After all, Belgium was an emotional/political/social tinderbox
waiting for something like the naive Coke to come along. A series
of scares from Mad Cow disease to E-coli to Genetically Modified
food to dioxin have people hyper-sensitive about food in Europe.
Added to this: a growing lack of faith in their governments'
ability to protect them _ as evidenced by the popular rejection of
Belgium's sitting government over the dioxin scare. All of these
forces came to bear when the first cases of Coke Sickness came
forward _ primarily involving adolescent girls. And here was a new
health minister in Belgium, who assumed his role when the last
health minister was forced out over the dioxin scare. Adding insult
to injury was Coke being, well, Coke, Arrogant and American and
MBA, it tried dealing with the situation from an American
perspective and allowed it to mushroom out of control. (Roughton,

ARAFAT HAS HIGH HOPES FOR MEETING WITH BARAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat expressed hope
Saturday that his meeting Sunday with Israel's new prime minister,
Ehud Bark, would mark a ``new chapter'' in a peace process mired in
mistrust for most of the last three years.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat's comments, coming a day after Barak launched an
ambitious diplomatic mission to restart the Mideast peace process,
demonstrated how dramatically _ and rapidly _ expectations for
progress have been raised by the former Israeli general's move into
office last week.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel and Washington, in particular, anticipation of a
future with peace has replaced the skepticism and bitterness
surrounding the tenure of Barak's predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu.
The mood has remained more cautious among Palestinians, who say
they want to see what deeds follow the Israeli leader's
more-encouraging comments.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the tone on both sides underlines an unmistakable change
in atmosphere that has occurred as a result of Barak's overwhelming
victory over Netanyahu, whose hardline policies deadlocked the
process.
</P>
<P>
   In Egypt Friday on the first leg of his diplomatic tour, Barak
promised to ``turn every stone'' in his quest for peace. And upon
his return home later that day, he said a de-facto Palestinian
state already exists.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, for his part, directly alluded to the chill that marked
Israeli-Palestinian relations during Netanyahu's tenure. In a
statement released by his office, the president of the Palestinian
authority said he would be attending Sunday's meeting with Barak
``ready to begin a new chapter and to wipe out the past three years
of mistrust.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they spoke of new possibilities, however, Palestinian
officials said that they expect quick action from the Isaeli
leader. They also served notice that their patience won't last long
if he delivers only promising words.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is a very precious commodity,'' said Saeb Erekat, the
chief Palestinian negotiator, who also made it clear that he didn't
like some of Barak's initial thoughts about how Israel should
pursue negotiations with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   In his first interview with Israeli television since taking
office, Barak on Friday proposed postponing implementation of the
Wye River interim peace accord, which calls for Israel's withdrawal
from more of the West Bank. Instead, Barak suggested that Wye's
terms be folded into a broader, final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat angrily rejected that idea, asserting that the
Palestinians should not have to wait for their land _ especially
since Israeli had already agreed to cede it.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can anyone who intends to build trust and restore
confidence and who intends to revive the peace process come and
suggest changes such as mixing between Wye and final status
negotiations?'' Erekat said at his office in Jericho on Friday.
``We won't be taken for a ride. ``We don't have neon signs on top
of our heads reading `stupid.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was uncertain Saturday to what extent each side was posturing
or playing to its own domestic constituencies. That may become more
clear when details of Arafat's meeting with Barak _ and what
proposals they make to each other, rather than float in the media _
become known.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, while they seem anxious for initiatives from Israel,
Arab leaders' hopes and spirits appear to have been raised
considerably by Barak's replacement of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give the man some time,'' Mubarak said at a conference when
the prime minister was peppered with questions about his timetable
for implementing peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Barak embarked on his diplomatic blitz Friday after only three
days in office. During the coming week or so, Barak will meet with
President Clinton in Washington and with a series of Arab leaders
on their own turf, trying to restore confidence in a peace process
mired in mistrust during the administration of his right-wing
predecessor,
</P>
<P>
   Barak's outreach campaign began at a meeting with Mubarak at his
summer residence in Alexandria. On Wednesday, he will meet with
Jordan's King Abdullah in the port city of Aqaba. Then he will
continue on to Washington to see Clinton, who has made negotiating
an Israeli-Palestinian peace a priority of his foreign policy _ and
whose intense diplomacy helped to engineer the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The signing of the pact was capped by a historic visit by
Clinton to Gaza, but its implementation has been on hold for more
than seven months since Netanyahu was forced to call for early
elections. Barak took two of those months to form his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The implementation of the so-called ``interim'' peace agreement
is now well over a year behind schedule. Its terms include the
withdrawal of Israeli troops from roughly 13 percent more territory
on the West Bank, the release of political prisoners held in
Israeli jails, the start of construction of a commercial port in
Gaza, and the implementation of ``safe passage'' roads to connect
Gaza to the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this could be implemented within two weeks,'' said
Erekat. ``There is no reason why it couldn't be.''
</P>
<P>
   The issues spelled out in Wye are crucial to a collapsing
Palestinian economy and are critical to restoring confidence in a
public that teeters on despair about the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Fifty-four percent of Palestinians say they are worse off
economically now than before the historic 1993 peace accord, while
only 11 percent say they are better off.
</P>
<P>
   And despite the encouraging words from Barak about peace, the
Palestinian public as a whole remains deeply distrustful of his
intentions and tell pollsters that they have no more faith in him
than they did in Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Although 70 percent of Palestinians still support the peace
process, but almost the same number ``do not trust the peadceful
intentions of a government led by Barak,'' according to a June 21
poll by the Center for Palestine Research and Studies.
</P>
<P>
   Eventhough Barak has fashioned a political career out of
following in the footsteps of the slain Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin, Palestinian observers seem keenly aware that it was Barak
more than any other cabinet minister who objected to the troop
withdrawals from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   And Barak has shown signs that he will a tough negotiator on the
so-called ``final status'' issues that are to take place after the
Wye accord's implementation. They are to focus on Israeli and
Palestinian claims to control of Jerusalem, the return of
Palestinian refugees, and the presence of Israeli settlements on
land captured in the 1967 Six Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Barak already has insisted that the status of Jerusalem is
non-negotiable and that all of ``greater Jerusalem'' will remain
the indivisible and eternal capital of Israel. He has also
indicated that, while he he will not move to reverse the settlement
expansion that took place under Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   However separate the two sides' starting points, some analysts
believe the opportunity for a breakthrough now exists if everyone
concerned shows a real willingness to bend.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important is to regain the confidence and then the
momentum, so that Israelis and Palestinians share a vision of the
outcome,'' said Ron Pundak, executive director of the Economic
Cooperation Foundation in Israel and a principle negotiator in the
peace process. The realization they all must have, he added, is
that ``hey, we are all in the same boat and will have to make our
way in to the future together.''

   SCHOOL-SUPER: KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The court-appointed
Desegregation Monitoring Committee will likely recommend it be

WAR-SITE: PLEASANTON, Kan. _ What happened just south of here 135
years ago this Oct. 25 was quick _ 10,000 troops clashed; Union
cavalry rolled up the Confederate line; two southern generals were
captured along with hundreds of their men, and gunfire echoed over
the quieting battlefield as the Yankee victors executed vanquished
rebels found wearing scrounged blue uniforms. &QL; 
Thus here in Linn County the final nail was pounded into Gen.
Sterling Price's grand strategy to rive Missouri and its western
borders. His army, which threatened St. Louis, besieged Jefferson
City, and then been driven out of Kansas City, was transformed into
a defeated rabble on the Kansas prairie. &QL; 
For Price and his troops the Civil War ended with the Battle of
Mine Creek, itself an oddity in that most of the fighting took
place in 30 explosive minutes. Now, with its sesquicentennial just
15 years away, little Mine Creek and its historic environs look
north and see the approach of a slower yet far more inexorable
host. By JIM FISHER. Story will move in the ``a''

   EYE-SURGERY: KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Craig Schurig is lying down,
arms resting comfortably at his sides. As a suction ring hugs one
of his near-sighted eyes, a small flap of tissue from the outer
layer of his cornea is lifted by a surgeon wielding a tiny,
high-tech tool. Next, for about 25 seconds, surgeon Daniel S.
Durrie trains a laser on Schurig's cornea, flattening the curve a
bit. Then Durrie deftly brings the corneal flap back down, and it
adheres like Velcro. ``I feel good now,'' the red-eyed Schurig said
after the procedure, which took about three minutes. ``The only
thing you feel is the drops going in, the numbing drops.'' Schurig
has just undergone LASIK surgery at the Hunkeler Eye Centers in
Overland Park, Kan. The 34-year-old assistant football coach at
Pittsburg State University is one of an estimated 807,500 Americans

CONSUMERS INCREASINGLY SEEKING LASER SURGERY TO IMPROVE EYESIGHT  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Craig Schurig is lying down, arms resting
comfortably at his sides.
</P>
<P>
   As a suction ring hugs one of his nearsighted eyes, a small flap
of tissue from the outer layer of his cornea is lifted by a surgeon
wielding a tiny, high-tech tool.
</P>
<P>
   Next, for about 25 seconds, surgeon Daniel S. Durrie trains a
laser on Schurig's cornea, flattening the curve a bit. Then Durrie
deftly brings the corneal flap back down, and it adheres like
Velcro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good now,'' the red-eyed Schurig said after the
procedure, which took about three minutes. ``The only thing you
feel is the drops going in, the numbing drops.''
</P>
<P>
   Schurig has just undergone LASIK surgery at the Hunkeler Eye
Centers in Overland Park, Kan. The 34-year-old assistant football
coach at Pittsburg State University in Kansas is one of an
estimated 807,500 Americans this year who will undergo the
procedure first performed a decade ago. That is up from 360,000
last year.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast an estimated 142,500 Americans will undergo a
similar type of surgery known as PRK this year, compared with
90,000 last year. PRK is an older procedure that is losing ground
to LASIK.
</P>
<P>
   Both procedures are types of refractive surgery, which is
intended to improve the eye's focus by changing the shape of the
cornea, the transparent covering of the eyeball.
</P>
<P>
   These intricate procedures represent another example of how a
growing number of Americans _ notably middle-aged, middle- and
upper-income men _ are willing to spend money for surgeries that
they want but, in most cases, don't necessarily need.
</P>
<P>
   LASIK patients spend an average of $1,500 to $2,500 per eye,
usually out of their own pockets, to correct nearsightedness,
farsightedness and astigmatism. Their goal is to set aside their
glasses and contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like is when you work out in the yard and you get
all sweaty, your glasses aren't falling down on your face,'' said
Olathe, Kan., resident Kathy Glover, who had LASIK surgery a few
months ago. ``I wish I had had it done a long time ago.'' Some
problems
</P>
<P>
   Such enthusiasm is not universal.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Handley, a Kansas City psychologist who had LASIK
surgery in December, is unhappy with the results. Handley, 47, had
surgery to correct nearsightedness in both eyes. He paid about
$4,500 for the procedure, which was performed outside the Kansas
City area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't do it over again,'' he said. ``At night I see
around the scar tissue and it creates a lot of halos, glare,
night-vision problems. It's literally impossible to drive at night
in the city, where there are lots of lights, or enjoy events such
as movie theaters or a high school play, anything where you're in a
darkened room and there are lights in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Handley said the problem was caused by his
bigger-than-average-sized pupils. He has tried wearing dark glasses
and anti-glare glasses, but they have not helped. He said his
doctors had told him they had no solution.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say even patients with normal-sized pupils will probably
see halos around headlights at night for a few weeks after LASIK
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, patient satisfaction is not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the June issue of Consumer Reports, the latest
studies of LASIK and PRK claim an 80 percent success rate. Success
is defined as unaided eyesight after surgery that is 20//40 or
better, which would allow you to drive without corrective lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Major complications, such as cutting the corneal flap completely
free, occur in fewer than 5 percent of surgeries. Some experts
estimate that complications such as glare, ghosting and fuzziness
occur in about 10 percent of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Durrie, who mostly does LASIK surgery, said about 5 percent of
his patients needed some additional surgery within a year to reach
their vision goals. There is no charge for such ``touch-up''
surgery, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, 99 percent of patients don't need contacts or
glasses to see at a distance, though they may need reading glasses
as they get older,'' Durrie said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, skyrocketing numbers of patients speak to widespread
satisfaction that spurs demand. Many tell friends and relatives
that it was painless and they could see better immediately. The
positive reviews spur others to open their pocketbooks and look up
at the laser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody either knows someone or works with someone who's had
(LASIK) done,'' said Joseph Tauber, a cornea specialist and
refractive surgeon with the Sabates Eye Centers in the Kansas City
area.
</P>
<P>
   Others report a similar surge. John Doane, a refractive surgeon
with Eye Care in the Kansas City area, said his group had performed
more than 10,000 LASIK surgeries in the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year we anticipate doing 100 percent more than the prior
year,'' Doane said. ``That's pretty much what the market's doing
across the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Such strong demand is particularly notable because almost all of
the money is coming straight out of the patient's pocket. Most
health insurance policies do not cover this type of surgery,
because it is considered an elective procedure. Payment plans
usually are available.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Kazirian, an ophthalmologist and media liaison for the
International Society of Refractive Surgery, characterized LASIK
surgery as a luxury, though it improves the vision of most people
who have it done.
</P>
<P>
   Industry studies show that the majority of refractory surgery
patients are men aged 35 to 45 with incomes exceeding $40,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men might be less willing to put up with slipping eye glasses
and//or difficult-to-care-for contact lenses,'' said Irving J.
Arons, managing director of Spectrum Consulting in Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Durrie, who serves on the American Academy of Ophthalmology's
executive committee for refractive surgery, said that not just the
wealthy were seeking LASIK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have patients who are policemen, firemen, farmers,
construction workers, people who really work and use their eyes a
lot and think they can do a safer job at their work,'' he said.
``They plan for it, and it's a family decision to spend this kind
of money.'' Who's a candidate?
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there is no ideal LASIK patient, but there are
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Durrie said that LASIK patients should be 18 or older and that
the procedure should not be performed on those who are prone to eye
infections. Those with unusually large pupils are poor candidates
because they will see around the edge of the treated cornea at
night, causing them to see halos around lights.
</P>
<P>
   People who are severely nearsighted often are discouraged
because of the risk of unsatisfactory outcomes. Even so, Doane
said, almost all of the people who come to his office are
candidates for LASIK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally their vision has been stable for the past year and
they have a desire to get out of glasses and//or contacts,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When LASIK surgery is performed on those older than 40, surgeons
frequently leave one eye a little nearsighted to forestall the need
for reading glasses.
</P>
<P>
   LASIK patients wear protective eye coverings when they go to
sleep at night for about a week after the surgery, to protect the
eyes from pressure. They use drops for a few weeks to keep their
eyes lubricated.
</P>
<P>
   Handley, who is unhappy with his LASIK surgery, advised
potential patients to be smart consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't,'' he said. ``Make sure your doctor gives you a pupil
exam in dim light before you have any surgery. Research the pros
and cons thoroughly through multiple sources.''
</P>
<P>
   But Glover, the LASIK patient from Olathe, said she could read
menus in dark restaurants now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing, that I didn't know was going to happen, is
that I don't have headaches any more,'' she said. ``I used to have
headaches all the time, and it was eyestrain. I just thought it was
stress in my jaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Schurig said he could now get up in the morning and ``see the
alarm clock, take the dogs out. Before, when my kids would come
into our bedroom in the morning, I could only see their outline.
Now I can see them clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, new techniques are being developed. One of the newest
procedures uses plastic implants, known as Intacs, to correct
mild-to-moderate nearsightedness. Intacs are implanted in the
cornea and can remain permanently, but they can easily be removed
by a surgeon if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware at all that I have them in there,'' said Kelly
F. Grosdidier, a Hunkeler optometrist who had the Intacs procedure
done in May. ``My vision is great.''

HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE SHARE IN TEACHING EMPLOYMENT SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERICA WOOD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ David Fair wasn't a straight-A student,
captain of the football team or involved in oodles of school
activities.
</P>
<P>
   But he was just what Nu-Tech Industries wanted: a hard worker
with an interest in engineering and plenty of time. So last summer
the company drafted him as the first initiate in the Grandview
(Mo.) High School Employment Scholarship Program.
</P>
<P>
   The innovative program helps companies by supplying workers in a
tight job market. It benefits students by teaching them a trade and
pumping money into a college fund. Longview Community College
sweetens the mix by offering participants a two-year scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company makes school make better sense,'' Fair said. ``You
actually apply what you use.'' A few weeks ago, he put his final
high school report card on his boss' desk. Straight A's.
</P>
<P>
   Fair, who describes himself as ``not really that great of a
student,'' rotated through several departments at Nu-Tech, which
manufactures airplane parts for military planes, before he found
his niche in engineering. He spends much of his time pulling the
specifications for Boeing jets from the computer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $6 an hour he makes, the program receives $3
an hour from Nu-Tech that goes into his scholarship fund, which can
be used at any college or university. He's accumulated $6,500 in
the account and will continue to save.
</P>
<P>
   This fall he'll begin at Longview. When finished there, he'll be
able to use his savings for his third and fourth years of college.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of Fair's success, the program has expanded to
10 other businesses, including the U.S. Toy Co. in Grandview and
Loch Lloyd Country Club in Belton.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandview Chamber of Commerce has pledged to market the
program to businesses outside Grandview in the hope of recruiting
20 companies by the end of 1999. Participating businesses get a 50
percent tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Curtis, executive director of the Grandview Chamber, said
her group also wants to involve other school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Area companies need workers, she said, as evidenced by the fact
that they have more interested businesses than interested Grandview
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, they're needing quality workers
desperately,'' Curtis said. ``They (program participants) could be
around for several years or come back after college.''
</P>
<P>
   Nu-Tech President Charlie Newell said it was a way for companies
to reinvest in the community.
</P>
<P>
   When Fair began with Nu-Tech, Newell said, he was a C student.
Sarah Barrows, a Grandview High School counselor, described him as
quiet and not involved in school activities.
</P>
<P>
   But over the course of the year, working full time in the summer
and part time during the school year, Fair became more focused and
began to set goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It motivated me to do better in school and to be more precise
in my work, more thorough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Grandview juniors Dale Gordon and Kelly Parker
joined him at Nu-Tech. Gordon started as a materials handler, but
like Fair, he'll rotate through several departments before he
decides which he prefers.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who has taken programming classes, helps the network
administrator set up computer software.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go to school and train for a lot of stuff,'' Parker
said, ``but it's not going to help you until you actually have to
deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, Newell said is for laid-back students who wonder
what they're going to do in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are really special students, and someone needs to pay
attention to them,'' Newell said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Lukenbill, a Grandview junior, said that by working at
U.S. Toy as an order-entry clerk, she was learning communication
skills and how to work with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a great opportunity, and I love working with
people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her work and that of the other student at U.S. Toy, Laticha
DeMars, pleases Peggy Holloway, Human Resource manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, it gives students the opportunity to
extend their education,'' Holloway said. ``They're a real asset to
U.S. Toy this year.''

COMMITTEE EXPECTED TO SEEK AUTHORIZATION TO CHOOSE SUPERINTENDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Desegregation Monitoring Committee
probably will recommend that it appoint a Kansas City School
District superintendent if the Board of Education cannot reach
agreement with a candidate by a court-imposed deadline of July 19.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members presented their plan at a closed meeting with
U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple last week. School board members
learned of the plan in a memo they received late Friday from the
school district's legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DMC will likely recommend that the DMC be authorized to
employ as its employee a full-time administrator (probably a
retired superintendent), to administer the district on a day-to-day
basis until such time as a permanent superintendent is selected by
the board,'' district lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple has scheduled a hearing for 10 a.m. July 19. If a
superintendent has not been named by then, Whipple will accept
recommendations as to what actions he should take.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Lance Loewenstein said the desegregation
committee's proposal appeared to stop just short of receivership,
in which the court would eliminate the school board and assume
day-to-day control of the district.
</P>
<P>
   Loewenstein said he interpreted the committee's plan not as a
threat but as a gentle reminder that the school board needed to act
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they want to do this,'' Loewenstein said. ``I
think they vastly prefer us to hire a superintendent. They want to
go home. That's obvious to me. They want out of this quagmire in a
very bad way.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo also says the committee is opposed to allowing Phyllis
Chase, the interim chief administrator for curriculum and
instruction, to remain in the position during the coming school
year.
</P>
<P>
   Some board members have advocated letting Chase continue to run
the instructional side of the district while the search continues
for a permanent superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Board President John Rios said Saturday that he had yet to
review the memo, but he expressed concern about its contents. He is
among those board members who have expressed support for leaving
Chase in the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is that it's unfortunate they have that
attitude,'' Rios said of the committee. ``I think she's done a good
job in the interim.''

`BOTTOM FEEDERS' INVADE ALL-STAR GAME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is a beautiful thing to watch Juan Gonzalez go
deep, Tony Gwynn turn on a fastball, Greg Maddux paint the corner.
</P>
<P>
   But there might be something even better in Tuesday night's
All-Star Game at Fenway Park. Some of our baseball gods will seem,
well, a little more like you or me.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen members of the National League team and seven of the
American League are first-timers to the game, a roster of stories
filled with as much failure as success. For every Randy Johnson,
there is Philadelphia's Paul Byrd, who was out of work 11 months
ago after his release from the Atlanta Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Or Ron Coomer, who spent eight years in the minors _ including
some time with the Dodgers _ before making it with the Minnesota
Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Or Jeff Zimmerman, the hard-throwing reliever for the Texas
Rangers. Last month at Dodger Stadium, former Dodger Mike Morgan
was talking about Zimmerman and said, ``You know he learned his
slider in France.'' If that doesn't bring a puzzled look, think of
the 29 GMs who threw away his resume when the unemployed Zimmerman
faxed it to every big-league club a few years back.
</P>
<P>
   Now those players will share their dreams on a national stage.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd's big break came last August, when his name crossed the
waiver wire and caught the eye of Phillies general manager Ed Wade.
His trip to Triple-A was detoured when Matt Beech's season ended
with an elbow injury. Next thing Byrd knew, he was in Philadelphia
for a start against the Houston Astros and the overpowering
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd handed Johnson his only National League loss last season
and won five of his eight starts with the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   And now? Byrd was 11-4 with a 3.72 ERA going into Saturday's
start against Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to thank Christ for guiding my path,'' said Byrd, a
deeply religious man who considered the ministry as a career
alternative a few years ago. ``I also want to thank my wife, the
U-Haul queen of America when I was in the minor leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   Coomer never thought much about the All-Star Game playing in
towns like Modesto, Medford, Ore., Madison, Wis., and Huntsville,
Ala. In 1994, he batted .338 for the Dodgers' Triple-A team in
Albuquerque, but was traded to the Twins the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Twins are in last place in the AL Central, somebody
had to represent the team. And even though Coomer's stats (.284
average, 10 homers, 33 RBI) aren't eye popping, the Twins are
sending somebody special.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a remarkable story and a tribute to his perseverance,''
said seven-time all-star Paul Molitor, a teammate of Coomer's in
Minnesota for three seasons and still a good friend. ``He spent a
long time in the minors, and he's a guy who never quits. I don't
think he takes one minute in uniform for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know when he walks into that locker room on Monday, he's
going to have a feeling like he's never had before.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Coomer was drafted out of college, even if it was in
the 14th round (1987) by the A's, who released three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman, a Canadian, was undrafted out of Texas Christian in
1993. Through a connection with the Canadian national team, he
pitched for Montpelier in the South of France, but somehow his
story wasn't optioned at the Cannes Film Festival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The competition wasn't very good, but I knew I could develop
some pitches without worrying about getting beaten up,'' Zimmerman
said. ``I threw a lot of sliders over there and it paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   But as late as 1997, he still was pitching in the independent
Northern League. Then he fired off 30 resumes. Only the Rangers
responded. His signing bonus was a ticket to spring training.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the last cuts this spring but was called up one
week into the season when the Rangers went to a seven-man bullpen.
He heads to Boston with an 8-0 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't comprehend it. I'm a middle reliever,'' Zimmerman
said. ``We're supposed to be the bottom feeders of baseball.'' &QL;

BETTER TIMES FOR OFFERMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ When Jose Offerman was named to his only other
All-Star Game four years ago, he remembers how he was mercilessly
booed by the home crowd at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's back in the game with his new team, the Boston Red
Sox, and will be playing Tuesday night at Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember they were announcing each of the guys and (the
fans) were giving a lot of applause,'' Offerman said. ``When it was
my turn, they booed me. I can't say it didn't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   After batting .346 with 25 extra-base hits through his first 38
games of the season, Offerman lately has looked like anything but
one of the game's elite. In his next 43 games, he hit .225 with
just seven extra-base hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a surprise, but it's a nice feeling to be on the
All-Star team,'' said Offerman, who will receive a $100,000 bonus
for his selection to the team. ``It's one of those things _ what
have you done for me lately? _ and that's why I'm surprised.'' &QL; 
Deserving
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore 3B Cal Ripken probably would have been voted into the
All-Star starting lineup regardless of his statistics, but he has
to be pleased that he doesn't have to apologize for his presence on
the AL team. ``With the All-Star Game, you want to feel the most
deserving,'' Ripken said of his 15th election, which tied Rod Carew
for the all-time record. ``This year I feel pretty good about how
I'm playing and I'm looking forward to going.'' Ripken bounced back
from a injury-plagued start to put up some decent numbers going
into the break. He hit his 12th homer of the year Wednesday night
and needs just four more to reach 400 for his career. He is
expected to reach 3,000 hits by late August. &QL; 
Cycling
</P>
<P>
   Chris Singleton, a one-time Giants prospect acquired in a
minor-league trade with the Yankees, became only the fourth player
in the history of the White Sox to hit for the cycle. He did it
Tuesday in a game the Sox would lose to K.C. 8-7 in 10 innings. The
last rookie to hit for the cycle was Oddibe McDowell, for Texas, in
1985. Singleton has been a tremendous find. He won the final roster
spot in spring training and took over for fellow rookie McKay
Christensen as the regular center fielder in mid-May. The Sox got
him in a trade for left-hander Rich Pratt, a non-prospect. &QL; 
Candy man
</P>
<P>
   Former Dodger Tom Candiotti made his first start as an Indian on
Saturday vs. Cincinnati since being signed June 29 after clearing
waivers with Oakland. It came down to Candiotti and Mark Langston
for Dwight Gooden's spot in the rotation. Last Saturday, in a
day-night doubleheader vs. the Royals, Candiotti won the first game
with 52/3 innings of scoreless relief. Langston started the second
game and won as well. Candiotti made 11 starts with the A's. Gooden
has made 393 appearances in the regular season. All but four of
them have been as a starter. Gooden made his fourth relief
appearance Wednesday night in the Metrodome after Bartolo Colon was
ejected for hitting Corey Koskie with a pitch. He retired all four
men he faced. &QL; 
Straight A's
</P>
<P>
   John Jaha might be the A's only all-star, but they are staying
competitive in the West with pitching. Right-hander Jimmy Haynes
started the season 1-5, but he's 5-1 since then, and in his last
four starts, he's been almost unhittable. He's allowed 17 hits in
28.1 innings, going at least seven innings each time while
compiling a 2-0 record with a 2.54 ERA. Before that, the ERA was
5.18. Right-hander Tim Hudson, who faced Randy Johnson on Saturday,
got back at the only team to beat him this year when he stopped
Texas 4-2 Monday. Including time in the minors, Hudson is 11-1 this
season. He's 4-1 since joining the A's last month. &QL;

 &HT;    Castilla acquisition just rumor
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The silly season has begun. General manager John
Schuerholz actually laughed aloud when presented with the rumor
circulating through the Braves' clubhouse this weekend: The club is
acquiring Colorado third baseman Vinny Castilla and moving Chipper
Jones to shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only conversation I've had with (Rockies general manager)
Bob Gebhart in the last month was about Jeff Reed,'' Schuerholz
said. And he didn't get him either.
</P>
<P>
   Schuerholz has made his customary midseason calls around the
league, gauging what might be available as the July 31 trading
deadline approaches. But his concern is Javy Lopez. If his catcher
can overcome his knee injury to perform effectively after the
All-Star break, the club will be more passive in the trade market.
</P>
<P>
   If Lopez falters, Schuerholz will pursue a major acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   ``If his injury, for one reason or another, starts to head in
the other direction or doesn't get better or doesn't heal, you have
to get somebody,'' Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   So sorry
</P>
<P>
   Brian Jordan was disappointed that his 12-game hitting streak
ended, one game shy of tying a career-best. But what was worse, he
hit first-base coach Glenn Hubbard with his batting helmet in the
eighth inning, when he attempted to throw it back toward the
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   He explained the helmet got stuck on a finger as he let it go,
sending it in Hubbard's direction. The incident drew an audible
response from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so terrible,'' Jordan said. ``I apologized about 10
times. I made Hubby sick from apologizing so many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Wounded knee
</P>
<P>
   Although he did not appear Saturday, reliever Russ Springer was
available for service, after being knocked out of Friday night's
game with a line drive off the right knee by Mike Stanley. The ball
just grazed Springer's kneecap and he wears a red welt, two stitch
marks clearly visible, on the right side of the knee. X-rays were
negative.
</P>
<P>
   The best?
</P>
<P>
   Opinions were mixed in the clubhouse before the game on whether
Andruw Jones' wall-banging Friday night catch off a Troy O'Leary
drive was the best of his career. Jones caught the ball on a sprint
over his left shoulder an instant before hitting the ball, bounced
off, picked up his cap in the same motion and trotted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to the point where you almost expect him to make the
play, he does it so much,'' left fielder Ryan Klesko said.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus remains Jones' finest catch came May 8, 1998,
against San Diego, when he chased down a deep Steve Finley drive,
caught the ball from directly over his head and leapt into the
wall, clinging to the padding.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time, I think I can catch the ball,'' Jones said.
``Any ball they hit out there, you think you can catch.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest vote for Friday night's effort came from left-hander
Mike Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pitching,'' he said. ``This one was better.

MARLINS DON'T GET THEIR MAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Florida Marlins insisted on Travis Lee for
closer Matt Mantei. They got Brad Penny. That's not necessarily a
bad thing, considering Penny is one of the top-10 pitching
prospects in baseball. But for a team trying to get a new ballpark
by fielding an awful team, the Marlins might have taken a different
approach.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's trade filled a big void for the Arizona Diamondbacks,
who already had blown 14 saves opportunities this season. But they
held their ground on trading Lee, who has been disappointing this
year after a successful rookie year.
</P>
<P>
   Florida, which has been criticized for dumping high-priced
veterans after its World Series title in 1997, isn't saving much
money by dealing Mantei. He is making $375,000 this season. But the
Marlins, who didn't get him a save opportunity until May, thought
they could better use Mantei to improve their long-range situation.
</P>
<P>
   If Florida can sign No. 1 choice Josh Beckett, the addition of
Penny to Double-A right-hander A.J. Burnett and Wes Anderson would
give the Marlins four of baseball's top-10 pitching prospects. &QL; 
You really like me
</P>
<P>
   MVP Sammy Sosa was thrilled to lead the NL in All-Star votes
(2,315,204). Among other things, it meant that he beat Mark
McGwire. ``To be one of the leaders in votes shows me the respect
and appreciation people have given me,'' Sosa said. ``Now I know
that I'm there with Ken Griffey, Jr. and Mark and all the big
names. Now I'm one of them.'' Sosa's All-Star history is
interesting. He did not make the team in '96 even though he was
leading the NL in homers at the break. He was also left off after a
strong start to the '97 season. Last year he was named to the team
but did not play after suffering a minor injury in the final game
before the break. &QL; 
Comeback Kid
</P>
<P>
   After making 162 consecutive relief appearances in the majors
since 1995, Cincinnati left-hander Ron Villone has made six starts
and excelled in the last three, firing 212/3 consecutive scoreless
innings before Houston's Matt Mieske hit a two-run homer. The Reds
signed Villone _ who also played for Seattle, San Diego and
Milwaukee _ to a minor-league contract on April 5 after the Indians
released him in spring training. Now, a pair of Indians shorts hang
in Villone's locker at Cinergy Field, serving as a reminder of how
far he fell. ``They'll be here all year,'' said Villone, who faced
the Indians on Saturday. ``Decoration, motivation, whatever you
want to call it. You've got to remember where you came from.'' &QL; 
Comeback II
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Andy Ashby threw a shutout at Coors Field on Sunday,
serving another reminder of the worst deal in Rockies history:
Ashby, Brad Ausmus and Doug Bochtler to the Padres for Bruce Hurst
and Greg Harris on July 27, 1993. In case you've forgotten, Hurst
was injured and Harris went 4-20 in one-plus seasons; Ashby is
55-38 with a 3.38 ERA in the last four-plus seasons. To be fair, he
was awful in Colorado, going 0-4 with an 8.50 ERA. ``I have no bad
feelings toward the Rockies,'' Ashby said. ``But I thank God every
day that they traded me.'' &QL; 
How about these Mets
</P>
<P>
   The New York Mets beat the New York Yankees 9-8 Saturday on a
pinch RBI single by Westlake High's Matt Franco. The night before,
the Mets won 5-2 on a three-run homer by Mike Piazza off Roger
Clemens. Today, they end the first half with Orel Hershiser going
for his 200th career victory. Hershiser came back Tuesday on one
day's rest and pitched five scoreless innings to set up today's
game. And though he came in batting just .220 with runners in
scoring position, Piazza is now 5 for 9 lifetime against Clemens.
Piazza also beat Clemens last month with a home run. ``A lot of
people think too much is being made of this series with the
Yankees,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine said. ``I don't see it.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Headstrong Hunter spurs Braves in 11th, ties series
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It became a matter of Brian Hunter's head, both inside
it and out.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter's decision to try a two-strike sacrifice bunt started it
and John Wasdin's ensuing throw that glanced off Hunter's helmet
finished it, allowing Andruw Jones to score all the way from first
base Saturday. The Braves outlasted Boston 2-1 in 11 innings in a
game befitting the best pitching staffs in their respective
leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way to have a big head, man,'' Brian Jordan said afterward to
Hunter.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves close the season's first half this afternoon with the
chance to take a second series from Boston, Greg Maddux facing Red
Sox rookie Jin Ho Cho. Maddux has a hard act to follow, after Tom
Glavine allowed a Jim Stanley home run and nothing else over nine
innings. While the Braves had runners in every inning, advancing
just three into scoring position and leaving them all there,
Glavine, working on three days' rest, pitched a solid six-hitter
which brought him no victory but solace as the season comes to the
All-Star halt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably at a point where I don't want it to stop,'' said
Glavine (7-8), who has lost just once in his past seven starts. ``I
might have in April but right now, I'm happy with the way I'm
throwing the ball. I kind of look at it as two seasons. The first
two months weren't very good. The last six weeks have been really
good.''
</P>
<P>
   The 11th teemed with unlikelihoods. Free-swinging Andruw Jones
walked to open the inning. Hunter fell behind 1-2 but after the
bunt sign was taken off, he stuck with it and put a breaking ball
into play to the first-base side of the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not disobeying orders,'' Hunter said. ``It's (helping) us
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasdin's throw glanced off the right side of Hunter's helmet and
rolled off the tarp down the line. Darren Lewis's throw to the
plate was up the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time when you put a bunt down, I try to take a chance
that, if they slip up, I can go to third,'' said Jones, who
provided the Braves' first run in the fourth with his 16th home
run. ``I was running hard and when I saw the ball get away, I just
kept going.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves are 3-2 vs. Boston in a series of terrific games that
are appealing at least to one player. Glavine said, ``If we see
them again in the World Series, it's fine by me.

 &HT;    Another assault on fences
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since it would never happen again, at least in this
lifetime, 1998's Season for the Ages, the Sosa-McGwire Swat Fest,
was pressed like a dried flower in the back of the public
conscience and put up on a shelf, which was apparently a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Because the flower never died and may well live for time
immemorial, given the hairy-chested state of the contempory game.
As the baseball season's first half concludes tonight, no one is on
pace to break Mark McGwire's 70-homer record, nor even reach Sammy
Sosa's sublime 66. But Sosa (32) is on pace to reach 60 and Tampa
Bay's Jose Canseco (31) is on pace for 59.
</P>
<P>
   The lesson of 1998 was, the impossible is only a swing or two
away. The Season for the Ages may actually not have ended, only
taken the winter off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could happen again,'' said Braves right fielder Brian
Jordan, an eyewitness to every McGwire home run in St. Louis a year
ago. ``With the pace Sammy is on, and you got Canseco over 30 at
the break? Both of those guys? We could be seeing another race in
the making.''
</P>
<P>
   And don't disregard McGwire, who entered the weekend tied with
Houston's Jeff Bagwell with 27 homers. McGwire is 10 off last
year's total at the All-Star break but has hardly broken a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers I have now are not too bad and I haven't even got
hot yet,'' McGwire said recently. ``I would think I'd probably get
hot sometime in the next (three) months.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's figures from the break are distorted, as the
All-Star Game falls a week later this year than last. But seven
players entered the weekend with 25 homers or more, compared to
nine last year. Sosa's 32 is just one behind his midway total of 33
last year. Seattle's Ken Griffey (28) and Colorado's Larry Walker
(25) cannot be discounted, though the Mariners' new home at Safeco
Park does not appear to be as home run friendly as the abandoned
Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   But the critical ingredients for another home run rush all
remain: diluted pitching talent, smaller parks, stronger hitters
and, perhaps most important, the knowlege that 60- or 70-homer
seasons are no longer mythic but attainable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at how long it took to even get guys to start thinking
about breaking (Roger) Maris' record,'' Braves hitting coach Don
Baylor said. ``I remember when I was just a young player and Reggie
Jackson got off with 42 one year. Everybody started talking about
Roger Maris.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie broke out in hives and ended up in the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   With the mid-'90s and the coming of age of the current slugger
crop, that all changed. Since 1920, there have been 26 50-homer
seasons in major-league history. Eight of those, nearly 30 percent,
have come in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   If the 1999 field needs a wild card, Canseco is proud to serve.
Having wandered through four American League organizations during
the decade, he reached 30 homers only once in the previous five
years before attaining a career-high 46 with Toronto last summer.
Now 35 years old, he sounds almost stoic about the seasons he
wasted and the present opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've come full circle,'' Canseco said. ``As a baseball player,
no one has experienced as much as I've experienced. I was talked
about being the best player in the world, hands down, by far, at
one point, being this freak that nobody understood. I stood 6-4,
250 pounds and was running 4.3, 4.4 40s. The first guy to do 40-40
(home runs and steals).
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I was, more or less, an outcast in baseball, being
completely forgotten. The worst player. A total joke. Washed up.''
</P>
<P>
   He's never hit 50 before, much less 60. But he has hung on long
enough to join the game's most pyrotechnic era. Maybe he won't get
there. Maybe no one will. But where for decades after Maris there
was a lull, now there is a new optimism.
</P>
<P>
   And for those fathers working on their son's delivery in the
back yard, Jordan has this advice: ``Put the glove down and pick up
the bat, buddy.

<P>
   LUSAKA, Zambia _ After months of on-again off-again
negotiations, the warring parties in the Congo signed a cease-fire
here Saturday. But, in a last-minute twist after 13 hours of delay,
the two rebel groups fighting to oust the Kinshasa government were
not allowed to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Although Zambia's accomplishment in brokering a peace deal was
praised by foreign diplomats and although President Frederick T.J.
Chiluba admonished all present to ``now regard brothers as
brothers,'' the sudden loss of two signatories made the dangerous
fragility of the deal absolutely clear.
</P>
<P>
   One rebel group said it did not feel bound by the deal, which is
supposed to lead to an immediate cease-fire, the creation of a
merged national army, and plans for a discussion on the nation's
future government.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership of one of the two rebel groups, the Congolese
Rally for Democracy, is split between its founder, Ernest Wamba dia
Wamba, and an upstart replacement, Emile Ilunga.
</P>
<P>
   Before proceedings began on Saturday, Wamba dia Wamba, in front
of 50 reporters, quietly sat in the one large red chair reserved
for the Rally, and quietly told them that he wished to sign and
that ``no one can dictate to me who can sign for the Congolese
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Wamba dia Wamba, a professor, is a bookish man with a small
voice, but his quiet defiance turned what should have been a proud
day for Zambia into one of chaos and humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   He wished to be a third rebel signature on a form with only two
dotted lines, but Ilunga refused to even enter the Great Hall of
the Mulungushi Conference Center here, and argued that the police
be called to oust his rival from the chair.
</P>
<P>
   With the presidents of a dozen countries waiting in a back room,
and their foreign ministers and a large contingent of ambassadors
in confusion outside, the ceremony stalled. Scheduled to begin at
10 a.m., it did not begin until 10:30 p.m. _ and there was not been
a single announcement from the conference's hosts as to what was
wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all my years in Africa, I've never seen anything like
this,'' a Western diplomat said. ``At negotiations, you always have
contentious points. But you work them out before you invite in all
the heads of state. I've never heard of anyone claiming squatter
rights to a seat before.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in his brief, impromptu speech at the signing, Chiluba
said he would undertake a ``verification mission'' to decide who
was the Rally's real representative, and that only after that would
the Rally and the other rebel group, the Movement for the
Liberation of the Congo, led by Jean-Pierre Bemba, be allowed to
sign.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier Kamitatu, Bemba's representative at the signing, looked
unhappy, and said, ``We have not signed, so we are not bound.''
</P>
<P>
   The groups that did sign include all the other major parties in
the conflict: the Democratic Republic of the Congo and its allies
Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia. The rebels' two chief backers, Rwanda
and Uganda, also signed.
</P>
<P>
   In so doing, the signers pledged themselves to a cease-fire
within 24 hours, an ``open national dialogue'' about the country's
future ``under the aegis of a neutral facilitator to be agreed
upon.''
</P>
<P>
   They also agreed not to undermine the territorial integrity of
Congo, to ask the United Nations and the Organization for African
Unity to deploy peacekeepers and to commit themselves to finding
and disarming ``militias and armed groups, including the genocidal
forces.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the document reflects a triumphant trend for the
continent: finding African solutions to African problems. In
others, it betrays the continent's deadly weaknesses _ because no
great powers are guaranteeing the peace, the participants are
forced to adopt language that virtually begs for help.
</P>
<P>
   The document also suggests a ``facilitator'' but does not define
what powers he would have, for example, to prevent an embarrassing
breakdown like Saturday's.
</P>
<P>
   But the most obvious sticking point is the disarming of the Hutu
militias that killed 500,000 people in Rwanda in 1994. They were
not represented at these talks, and have everything to lose by
being disarmed. They could be sent back to Rwanda, where some would
face trial and the death penalty if convicted of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go up to a genocidal maniac and say, `Give me your weapon,
please,' and he'll say `Sure, but let me give you the bullets
first,''' said Richard Cornwell, a military analyst at the
Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
   The final draft of the cease-fire document is vague about who
has responsibility for disarming them. The warring parties
themselves seem to be responsible at first, with the job to be
turned over to the United Nations or the Organization for African
Unity, if they volunteer peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   But it could quickly degenerate into renewed fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have time to wait for the U.N. to send people in six
months,'' said Dominique Kanku, from Bemba's rebel faction. ``It's
not a matter of getting cooperation from the genocidaires. And if
they shoot back, we'll have to defend ourselves.'' But, he added,
he was still optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations so far has pledged only 500 peace observers.
South Africa, Nigeria, Egypt and others might offer some troops _
but those would only number in the low thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless the will of all the parties to adhere to it is there,
it's no good,'' said Mark Malan, a peacekeeping operation analyst
at the Institute for Security Studies in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem experts see is the nature of the cease-fire:
Both sides, who have troops scattered over thousands of square
miles, often divided by ethnic group or personal loyalty to a
commander, are supposed to stop fighting, hold the territory
they've captured, disarm any Hutu militias they run across, and
then merge their armies. No one imagines that this will be easy in
Kashmir or Korea, or would have been over the Elbe River, between
much more disciplined armies.

 &HT;    U.S. withdrawals not a surprise
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARNOUSTIE, Scotland _ To read the British tabloids, you would
presume the Americans have become total wimps. Unusual as it is
that several U.S. players have become late withdrawals for this
week's 128th British Open, their losses are being characterized
mostly as reponses to the difficulty of the Carnoustie Golf Links.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carnoustie Blows Americans Away,'' screams one Scottish paper.
``Yanks But No Thanks,'' announces another.
</P>
<P>
   Carnoustie's toughness _ even Scotland's Sandy Lyle pronounced
it as ``evil'' during a recent practice round amidst knee-high
rough _ more likely has been a tiebreaker for players either
injured or not in proper form for a major. In the case of Fred
Couples, who withdrew Friday, it's a combination of poor play and a
10-hour trip from Los Angeles that can not help his weak back.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries have scratched Scott Hoch, who has a foot problem that
requires an MRI; Brad Faxon (broken wrist) and Steve Jones
(shoulder). Poor play has caused no-shows from Ben Crenshaw, Tom
Kite and John Daly. Loren Roberts qualified late and chose not to
cancel plans for a family vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to comment on the Americans' exit Saturday after his win
at Loch Lomond, Colin Montgomerie said, jokingly, ``What, have
Woods and Duval pulled out?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any of the scratching is entirely unexpected,''
said Duncan Weir, the assistant championship secretary of the Royal
&AMP; Ancient Golf Club. ``Ben Crenshaw has not made a cut all year.
Steve Jones' absence is injury-related and Fred Couples' withdrawal
is no great surprise. We had heard it might happen a few weeks
ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoch's withdrawal may be seen as a dodge _ he hates the cold and
rain _ but he might require foot surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Els sees a rough Open
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els bypassed Loch Lomond for extra time to prepare at
Carnoustie, feeling he needs experience there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen rough like it,'' Els said after his first
practice round. ``It's quite unbelievable and I'll be quite happy
when the crowds come in and trample it down. . . . If I could get a
good bet, I'd bet that 4-over par will win.''
</P>
<P>
   Faldo's improved putting
</P>
<P>
   Nick Faldo is starting to see some progress, boosted by a switch
during the U.S. Open to a cross-handed putting grip. He shot a
third-round 68 at Loch Lomond that required 26 putts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've probably improved six shots a round because of it,''
Faldo said.
</P>
<P>
   Carnoustie: The full Monty
</P>
<P>
   With a stretch of nine birdies in 12 holes, Montgomerie became
the first Scot to win in Scotland in 15 years Saturday, shooting a
final-round 64 to take the Loch Lomond Invitational.
</P>
<P>
   The victory surely will make Montgomerie a prime favorite for
Carnoustie, where he shares the course record at 64.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I possibly feel any better than I do now about
golf?'' Montgomerie said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the fact no player has won Loch Lomond and the Open in
successive weeks, he said, ``That's one gone and one to go, I
suppose,'' then added, ``At the same time I'm not thinking about
Carnoustie at all. Of all my (20) wins, this is the most special.

BITTER DIVORCES, CUSTODY FIGHTS OFTEN END IN TRAGEDY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BETSY BLANEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scott Stone Jr. got deadly serious after he lost a bitter
custody dispute with his former wife.
</P>
<P>
   The divorced 35-year-old North Carolina doctor initially agreed
to let his former wife, Marisa Jackson, have custody of their two
daughters, according to court documents filed by Jackson's
attorney. For a time, Stone paid $400 a week in child support to
Jackson, also a physician, records show.
</P>
<P>
   But in March 1998, after Stone had learned that Jackson was
leaving Tarboro, N.C., with the children to take a job in Michigan,
he had his attorney file a motion to try to gain custody of the
girls. In other court documents, Stone denied that he had agreed to
let Jackson have custody.
</P>
<P>
   Stone also stopped sending Jackson child support, court records
show.
</P>
<P>
   On July 5, days after a judge in Edgecombe County, N.C., awarded
Jackson full custody, Stone flew to Texas. He then ambushed and
fatally shot Jackson as she jogged in the Fort Worth suburb of
Southlake, where she and her daughters were visiting Stone's
sister. Minutes later, he killed himself.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings appear to highlight what experts call separation
violence, which can erupt when people feel that their partner has
left for good or when they lose custody of their children.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes there is a history of physical or psychological abuse.
But a bitter custody case _ as court documents appear to indicate
the one between Stone and Jackson was _ could trigger an individual
to act violently, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   In a Pennsylvania study of battering and abuse reports, 75
percent of those reported to authorities culminated with violent
assaults on the abuse victims after they decided to leave, a
Michigan abuse expert said.
</P>
<P>
   In contested custody cases, parents attempt to cast their former
spouses in as negative a light as possible, family law experts
said. It can be a volatile situation, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   The parent who loses custody feels shamed, humiliated by the
former spouse, said Harry Baker, a psychologist who evaluates
parents for family law judges and attorneys representing parents in
Tarrant County, which includes Fort Worth and Southlake. ``Violence
is one avenue of response.''
</P>
<P>
   But it isn't just a former spouse who could be at risk, experts
said. Attorneys, judges and psychologists involved in custody
disputes can be threatened, sometimes killed.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, 1992, George Lott pulled out a gun and started firing
as the 2nd Court of Appeals in Fort Worth heard arguments. A
Tarrant County prosecutor and a Dallas lawyer were killed, and
three other people were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Lott was gunning for the judge who granted custody of his son to
the boy's mother, said Barbara Nunneley, a Hurst family law
attorney who said she has been threatened numerous times by spouses
of her clients.
</P>
<P>
   After the shootings, Lott said his actions resulted from his
frustration in trying to gain custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   Baker, who had evaluated Lott for the couple's 1990 divorce
proceeding, said he was concerned that he might be a target before
Lott surrendered himself about six hours after the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``George Lott never threatened anyone,'' Baker said. ``He just
quietly went about his business.''
</P>
<P>
   Spouses who are left by their mates often feel that they are
entitled to have their partner ``forever'' and can't handle the
reality that the person who left can live without them, experts
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's people who say, `I just don't care about justice,' ''
Nunneley said. ``The law no longer matters to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got the people who act on those emotions and do this
irrational thing that endangers the whole family. It should make us
shudder, just shudder.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurley, a Dallas attorney who is part of the largest
divorce practice in Texas, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The common thread is that those people were deeply troubled
and the custody outcome was just the straw that broke the camel's
back,'' McCurley said.
</P>
<P>
   Tarboro police said they received no reports of domestic
disputes involving Stone and Jackson, who were divorced in April
1997. A check of North Carolina records revealed no protective or
restraining orders involving the couple.
</P>
<P>
   Shootings after a custody decision are rare, Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Stone's relatives told a police chaplain that his actions were
out of character. Often, threats don't precede violence, Baker
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, it's the people who huff and puff who bother me
less,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan McGee, a domestic violence expert in Ann Arbor, Mich.,
near where Jackson lived, said that most times, some type of abuse
occurs before the killing of a partner. But middle- and
upper-middle-class homes see domestic abuse as a stigma and often
don't report incidents, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They avoid calling the police like the plague,'' McGee said.
``They want to keep things looking nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Even an established pattern of control _ such as telling a
spouse where and when she or he can go or with whom to associate _
can be an indicator, McGee said.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show that the Jackson-Stone custody battle was
anything but amicable.
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson moved to Michigan, Stone began placing the child
support payments in an escrow fund instead of paying them directly
to Jackson, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   In answering the custody motion by Stone's attorney, Jackson's
attorney was blunt, saying that Stone knew long before Jackson
announced she was moving that she intended to relocate from
Tarboro, court records state. Stone and Jackson lived in Tarboro
for three years, during two of which they were married.
</P>
<P>
   Stone even watched his daughters when Jackson went to interview
for the job she subsequently took in Ann Arbor, Mich., court
records show. Stone also ``acknowledged and admitted'' that it
would be in the children's best interest for them to remain with
their mother, records state.
</P>
<P>
   Stone should have received reasonable visitation rights, but his
ability to parent the children would compete with other facets of
his life, according to documents filed by Jackson's attorney.
According to Stone's obituary in a Racine, Wis., newspaper, his
hobbies included sky diving, deep-sea fishing and scuba diving.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of Jackson and Stone declined to comment for this
article.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths of Jackson and Stone leave two daughters who must
grow up without parents. Likewise, each family must live without a
child or sibling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at all the lives this will impact,'' Nunneley said.
``This is something they'll (the daughters) take with them into all
their relationships _ relationships with men and with their own
children.''

NEW YORK SENATE RACE GETS ATTENTION  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Republican leaders, troubled by the party's
failure to unite behind a candidate to take on Hillary Rodham
Clinton in the New York Senate race next year, said Saturday that
they had privately debated whether their national chairman should
intervene to discourage a primary battle.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, several party officials said, the conversation
turned to whether national party leaders should try to force Rep.
Rick Lazio of Long Island out of the race to clear the path to the
nomination for Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   But after what were described as passionate discussions at a
closed-door meeting at the party's summer convention here on
Friday, participants agreed that, for now at least, it would be
most prudent to let the state party try to sort out its own
squabbles among rival factions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern was that we could implode in New York over
personality problems,'' said Ronald Kaufman, the Republican
national committeeman from Massachusetts. ``In the beginning, it
was about getting Lazio out. In the end, it was more a consensus, a
realization that it's best left to the powers that be in New York
to work out the problem over time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Nicholson, the party's national chairman, said in an
interview Saturday, ``I'm not actually engaged in trying to broker
anything.'' But he acknowledged that he had been asked whether he
should move more aggressively to unite the New York party.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholson said: ``I said I knew Congressman Lazio. He's a very
able congressman and incredible candidate if he runs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Nicholson said, the party leaders realized ``there
was very likely to be a primary _ and we don't get involved in
primaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was traveling Saturday and could not be reached. His
spokeswoman declined to comment on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   That Republican leaders from around the nation even discussed
the New York Senate race underscores the degree to which the party
views Mrs. Clinton as a formidable rival in the contest to succeed
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who plans to retire next
year. It also demonstrates the nervousness among party leaders that
the difficult relations among Republicans in New York could bruise
the nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The competition between Giuliani and Lazio has rekindled
festering tensions among the state's Republicans. Gov. George
Pataki and former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato never forgave Giuliani for
supporting former Gov. Mario Cuomo in his race against Pataki. They
are said to prefer Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the reaction when the conversation turned to the New
York Senate race, John Ryder, a national committeeman from
Tennessee, said, ``There was an immediate emotional reaction _
there's a strong sense that we have to have a united front against
Hillary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And then after serious discussion, people came to a Federalist
conclusion: It's not appropriate for the national party to tell the
states what they ought to do,'' Ryder said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael McDaniel, state chairman of the Indiana Republican
Party, said he feared that a high-profile effort by the party to
intervene in New York could backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to do everything you can to maximize your opportunity
for victory,'' McDaniel said. ``But it's another thing to have a
big party pronouncement to try to force your will on people. After
a discussion of the frustration of fighting among ourselves, the
prevailing attitude was: Let's not try to strong arm anybody
because that's the state's business. That might force them to arch
their backs and stiffen their resolve even more.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in their public sessions, Mrs. Clinton's expected candidacy
was clearly on the minds of Republican officials at their
gathering, which ended Saturday. Republican Party officials said
they were pulling in large sums of money with mailings that invoke
the prospect of a Sen. Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to the membership on Friday, Nicholson devoted as
much time to castigating Mrs. Clinton as he did to criticizing Vice
President Al Gore, the leading Democratic candidate for the
presidential nomination.

 &HT;    On top of the world

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Considering the last-minute wins the United
States and China have pulled out over each other recently, going to
penalty kicks in the Women's World Cup finals was far from being an
indignity.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it might have been the most fitting way to end an
exhilarating match between the best teams in the world. After
dueling for 120 scoreless minutes Saturday afternoon, Brandi
Chastain put an end to the drama in the final frame of penalty
kicks as the United States won its second world championship 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain placed a perfect shot in the right side of the net past
Chinese goalkeeper Gao Hong as the Americans won 5-4 in the
penalty-kick round.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry, magnificent in the semifinal
victory against Brazil on July 4, set up the victory in the third
round by turning away a shot by Liu Ying, diving to her right and
getting both hands firmly on the ball. The Americans easily made
good on all five of their attempts.
</P>
<P>
   A capacity Rose Bowl crowd of 90,185, largely pro-American,
erupted with delight as glittery confetti spewed onto the field.
While U.S. players celebrated, their Chinese counterparts stood
stoically.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in three tournaments, a home team has won a
Women's World Cup. The Americans, who beat China in the 1996
Olympic final at Sanford Stadium, won the first World Cup,
contested in China in 1991. Norway won the 1995 Cup in Sweden after
defeating the Americans in the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this spring, the United States and China split two
friendlies on the East Coast, with each team winning in the final
minutes. This one needed all 90 minutes of regulation, plus 30 more
in overtime, before going to penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be fair to say that both teams were playing on their
heels, because they kept attacking ferociously all afternoon. But
the defensive skill and tenacity that marked their play during the
World Cup was superb, and itcarried over into the high anxiety of
the extra session.
</P>
<P>
   The dominating play of Michelle Akers carried the Americans, who
got some chances early, but after a while couldn't penetrate
China's rugged wall of defense. Akers, playing in probably her
final World Cup match, was simply dazzling, throwing her body
around the field and holding the midfield to bolster what has been
times a shaky American back line.
</P>
<P>
   Playing with a bruised nose and a banged-up shoulder, she was
her typical kamizake self, heading away Chinese long balls and
setting up the American offense with her strong leg. But in the
final seconds of the second half, she took a shot to her nose that
put her out of the contest going into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   With her out, the Chinese had the entire middle of the field to
roam, and they took quick advantage. Nine minutes in, scoring star
Sun Wen rambled nearly 30 yards before uncorking a shot deflected
by the United States to set up a corner kick. Fan Yunje got off a
perfect header, but the shot was blocked by Kristine Lilly, who was
protecting the left post.
</P>
<P>
   In the second overtime period, each team had golden chances to
win it. Zhang Ouying dribbled into the box, right in front of
Scurry, but Kate Sobrero made a sliding tackle. On the other end,
Tisha Venturini, an overtime substitution, jumped on a loose ball
in the Chinese box but it was knocked away before she could
maneuver.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon MacMillan came on for Cindy Parlow early in the second
half, but that's when China began finding a seam on the right side
of the U.S. defense. Joy Fawcett was beaten by Liu Ying on a touch
pass in the 58th minute and kicked the ball away for a corner kick.
Liu's low shot skimmed off the head of Sun and out of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   In the final minute of regulation, Zhang took an excellent pass
from Sun down the middle, beating Sobrero and Carla Overbeck as she
entered the box. But Chastain made a sliding tackle to avert a shot
on goal. With time running out, China had another corner kick, but
the Americans headed away the ball harmlessly to force overtime.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 30 minutes, the Americans had the better of the
play, controlling possession and presenting a strong defense. In
the eighth minute, they were awarded a free kick 35 yards from the
Chinese goal. Mia Hamm served up a ball that a sliding Akers
touched with her leg, but couldn't direct.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the half, after China found some operating room, Akers
tried to keep a ball in play near the end line but tumbled head
first into a photo barricade. On the ensuing corner kick, she
jumped up to head the ball away. In a later midair collision, she
knocked Sobrero, her own teammate, hard to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   China managed only four shots in all, and none on goal, over the
first 45 minutes, while the Americans had one that was saved easily
by Gao. Sun had China's best scoring opportunity on a free kick in
the 40th minute, but her attempt sailed over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Early comers to the Rose Bowl enjoyed kickabouts and tailgate
parties in the parking lots and crowded souvenir stands inside the
gates. But freedom of movement was drastically curtailed between
matches due to the arrival of President Clinton, although the
stands were filled by kickoff.

REFUSING TO WILT, U.S. WINS SOCCER TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds., this story has been added to NYT Page 1)  
 (HLW)  
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ They played 120 minutes of soccer under a
brutal sun, 90 minutes of regulation melting into 30 minutes of
overtime, and still no one had put the ball into the net in the
final of the Women's World Cup. And so the game was decided by the
sport's most tense and capricious arbiter _ one-on-one penalty
kicks, the shooter versus the goalie.
</P>
<P>
   And when it was over, the Americans having won soccer's world
championship over China on a final left-footed penalty kick by
Brandi Chastain, she whipped off her jersey, twirled it like a
lariat over her head and dropped to her knees in arm-pumping
celebration as 90,185 fans gave her a jubilant cheering embrace and
confetti cannons dusted the field at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It was the largest crowd ever to watch a women's sporting event
in the United States and, organizers believe, in the world.
Chastain's kick _ which gave the United States five successful
penalty kicks to China's four _ consummated three weeks of
unprecedented interest in a sport that filled huge arenas with
soccer moms and dads and little girls who worshiped the American
players, painting their faces red, white and blue in star-spangled
admiration.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps gone forever is the myth that women's sports cannot
attract crowds and sponsorship dollars and that the games that
women play are somehow lesser than the games men play. The Women's
World Cup will undoubtedly be remembered as an epochal moment in
women's sports, along with the Billie Jean King-Bobby Riggs tennis
match in 1973, and the passage of TitleIX in 1972, which
essentially forbade discrimination on the basis of gender.
</P>
<P>
   With Saturday's victory, the American women also made a forceful
case for a professional league of their own that would start after
the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   This was the second world championship for the American women,
who won the inaugural Women's World Cup in 1991 before taking a
bronze in 1995. The United States also won the 1996 Summer
Olympics. However, the Americans had already lost twice this year
to China. And until five American players had lined up the ball 12
yards from the Chinese goal and drilled their five penalty kicks,
one more than China could successfully manage, Saturday's game was
very much in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   America's most confident and accurate taker of penalty kicks,
midfielder Michelle Akers, left woozily at the end of regulation
and spent the rest of the game in the American locker room,
suffering from a concussion and from heat exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome, Akers had
dominated the game in central midfield, sliding hard with her
cleats up, sledgehammering teammates and opponents in her path and
using her head to catapult away one Chinese kick after another.
</P>
<P>
   But Akers stopped a shot with her face at the end of regulation
then crumpled to the ground after heading away a corner kick. Akers
had secured the 2-0 semifinal victory over Brazil with a penalty
kick, but Saturday she was ineligible to return and help her team
after leaving the match.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the toughest damn player I ever played with,'' Chastain
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes into overtime, the Americans got a huge scare when
China's Liu Ying played a perfect corner kick to teammate Fan
Yunjie, who flicked the ball with her head past the outstretched
right arm of Briana Scurry, the American goalie. But Kristine
Lilly, the world's most experienced player with 186 international
appearances, stood exactly where she was supposed to, on the goal
line, near the left post, and headed the ball away for Chastain to
clear with a scissor kick. She was named the most valuable player
of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lill is a workhorse,'' Scurry said. ``There's no one I would
trust more on that post.''
</P>
<P>
   After a pair of 15-minute halves of a scoreless overtime, the
exhausted, drained American and Chinese players gulped bottles of
water and lay on the turf of the Rose Bowl, as trainers massaged
their aching, cramped muscles. Five players from each team would
take the penalty kicks, setting the ball up near the goal, and the
game would be decided as much by chance as skill. All a goalie can
do is guess, acting on instinct. If she guesses correctly, she is a
hero. If not, there is nothing she can do.
</P>
<P>
   Xie Huilin stepped up first for China and punched a penalty kick
into the top left corner of the net. Carla Overbeck, the American
captain went right, and pumped her fist with a celebratory skip
downfield. Qiu Haiyan of China placed a ball just beyond Scurry's
reach, but Joy Fawcett, the world's top defender, did a stutter
step and placed the ball into the right corner. Both teams were now
tied at 2-2 in the penalty kick phase.
</P>
<P>
   Liu Ying was next up for China, but she tipped off her shot in
some manner and Scurry dived to her left, punching the ball away
with both hands. Scurry pitched four shutouts in six games during
this World Cup, but no save was more important than this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew all I had to do was to stop one and we'd probably win
it,'' Scurry said. ``She hit it hard, but she didn't place it that
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Lilly then put a left-footed shot into the net, and the
Americans were up, 3-2. Zhang Ouying tied it right up.
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm, who did not score in her fourth consecutive game, and
who has admitted to lacking confidence on penalty kicks, made a
decisive move this time, putting the Americans up 4-3 and jumping
relievedly into the arms of her teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Wen, the Chinese captain who was tied for the leading scorer
in the tournament with seven goals, was up next for China. She had
been shut down all day by Akers in midfield and Overbeck and Kate
Sobrero on the back line, but this time Sun shot precisely to leave
the penalty-kick phase tied at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was Chastain's turn. If she made the shot, the Americans
would win. If she didn't, a new round of penalty kicks would begin.
She had missed a right-footed penalty kick against China in a 2-1
loss in February at a tournament in Portugal, but Coach Tony
DiCicco called on her again Saturday, and Chastain didn't miss,
curling a left footer into the upper right corner. There was
nothing that China's goalkeeper, Gao Hong, could do in resistance,
and the tired Americans had won.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was happy for being chosen one of the five,'' Chastain said.
``Being fifth, there's a lot of pressure. But my teammates trusted
me and I had been practicing all week. I felt very confident and I
was ready to step up and take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain, the player called Hollywood by her teammates for her
theatricality, whipped off her jersey, exposing her sports bra, and
she was engulfed by her teammates, who had been linked arm in arm
at midfield, bending over, hoping, maybe even praying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Temporary insanity,'' Chastain said of the reaction. ``I
thought, `This is the greatest moment of my career,' and I lost
control.'' &QL;

JUST WHO WAS THE UNITED STATES PLAYING FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP?  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did China matter to ABC Sports at the Women's World Cup
Saturday?
</P>
<P>
   In an international competition in which one team is the United
States, it is worth analyzing how much attention the network pays
to the foreign team. China, aside from being present for the game,
was not an ABC priority. Of course, Chinese players played the U.S.
team to a draw through 120 minutes. You couldn't miss them. But ABC
made this the American team's show.
</P>
<P>
   Makes you wonder what ABC would have done if China had won.
</P>
<P>
   The favoritism wasn't always overt. J.P. Dellacamera and Wendy
Gebauer knew all the Chinese players' names. But the Chinese team's
strategies and personalities were shorted as if they were faceless
automatons.
</P>
<P>
   The first sign came early. Just as the game started, ABC popped
up a graphic: ``USA Keys to Victory.'' Gebauer ticked off the keys.
Fairness would dictate that a similar list of Chinese keys would
follow. It didn't. Did China sneak into the final? No. Were China's
strengths and weaknesses kept secret? No. Did China play its games
in a hermetically sealed stadium? No.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-minute pre-game show (with 9 minutes 24 seconds of
commercials and promotions) offered little to help a viewer get to
know the Chinese players (it wasn't so hot on the American squad
either), which is odd considering that this telecast should have
been tilted toward viewers less knowledgeable about soccer. (The
halftime show was barren of any analysis; imagine a Super Bowl
halftime without analysis?)
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the game, the U.S. players received better treatment
whenever Dellacamera or Gebauer slipped in personal tidbits. (Did
the Chinese team refuse to give any information to the tournament's
media guide?)
</P>
<P>
   And you had to wonder, with all the crowd shots that ABC used in
the Rose Bowl, was there a Chinese contingent? If there wasn't, why
not? If there was, why didn't we see its members cheering for their
team?
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Dellacamera, who had seemed so fair in his
enthusiasms during U.S. games until Saturday, usually sounded more
excited by U.S. scoring possibilities than by China's. That
unfairness emerged most dramatically during the decisive penalty
kicks that ended with the American team's victory.
</P>
<P>
   When Kristine Lilly scored to put the United States ahead, 3-2,
Dellacamera shouted: ``The shot. Goal!''
</P>
<P>
   When China's Zhang Ouying tied it, he said, without a hint of
emotion: ``Zhang. And she scores.''
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm's go-ahead goal was called by Dellacamera with a second
shout: ``Shot. And a goal!''
</P>
<P>
   But Sun Wen's tying goal sounded like a disappointment to
Dellacamera. ``Sun Wen shot and she scores.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brandi Chastain's game-winner was a simple, joyful roar:
``GOAL!''
</P>
<P>
   After Chastain scored, Dellacamera said nothing for nearly two
minutes, just the right strategy. Let the pictures tell the story.
But had the Chinese left the field? Had they fallen through the
little-known Pasadena Trap Door?
</P>
<P>
   In most post-game championship celebrations, television
directors alternate shots of deliriously happy winners with those
of the depressed losers. But as the American team partied, the
Chinese team might well have been in Beijing. Were they stoic? Were
they weeping? Where was their half of the story?
</P>
<P>
   Not visible on ABC. It would take five minutes from Chastain's
goal for ABC to find the Chinese team (for 30 seconds) as it
accepted second-place medals.
</P>
<P>
   Dellacamera and Gebauer's final comments solidified the belief
that China's players and their efforts did not matter. So they did
not mention China. (Nor did the game's host, Robin Roberts.) But
Gebauer, a member of the victorious U.S. team at the 1991 Women's
World Cup, managed to say she had to compose herself because she
had been crying. Jingo bells. All the way.

EYE-SURGERY: (KANSAS CITY, Mo.) Craig Schurig is lying down, arms
resting comfortably at his sides. As a suction ring hugs one of his

his cornea is lifted by a surgeon wielding a tiny, high-tech tool.
Next, for about 25 seconds, surgeon Daniel S. Durrie trains a laser
on Schurig's cornea, flattening the curve a bit. Then Durrie deftly
brings the corneal flap back down, and it adheres like Velcro. ``I
feel good now,'' the red-eyed Schurig said after the procedure,
which took about three minutes. ``The only thing you feel is the
drops going in, the numbing drops.'' Schurig has just undergone
LASIK surgery at the Hunkeler Eye Centers in Overland Park. The
34-year-old assistant football coach at Pittsburg State University

HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE SHARE IN TEACHING EMPLOYMENT SKILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ERICA WOOD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ David Fair wasn't a straight-A student,
captain of the football team or involved in oodles of school
activities.
</P>
<P>
   But he was just what Nu-Tech Industries wanted: a hard worker
with an interest in engineering and plenty of time. So last summer
the company drafted him as the first initiate in the Grandview
(Mo.) High School Employment Scholarship Program.
</P>
<P>
   The innovative program helps companies by supplying workers in a
tight job market. It benefits students by teaching them a trade and
pumping money into a college fund. Longview Community College
sweetens the mix by offering participants a two-year scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company makes school make better sense,'' Fair said. ``You
actually apply what you use.'' A few weeks ago, he put his final
high school report card on his boss' desk. Straight A's.
</P>
<P>
   Fair, who describes himself as ``not really that great of a
student,'' rotated through several departments at Nu-Tech, which
manufactures airplane parts for military planes, before he found
his niche in engineering. He spends much of his time pulling the
specifications for Boeing jets from the computer.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $6 an hour he makes, the program receives $3
an hour from Nu-Tech that goes into his scholarship fund, which can
be used at any college or university. He's accumulated $6,500 in
the account and will continue to save.
</P>
<P>
   This fall he'll begin at Longview. When finished there, he'll be
able to use his savings for his third and fourth years of college.
</P>
<P>
   In part because of Fair's success, the program has expanded to
10 other businesses, including the U.S. Toy Co. in Grandview and
Loch Lloyd Country Club in Belton.
</P>
<P>
   The Grandview Chamber of Commerce has pledged to market the
program to businesses outside Grandview in the hope of recruiting
20 companies by the end of 1999. Participating businesses get a 50
percent tax credit.
</P>
<P>
   Kim Curtis, executive director of the Grandview Chamber, said
her group also wants to involve other school districts.
</P>
<P>
   Area companies need workers, she said, as evidenced by the fact
that they have more interested businesses than interested Grandview
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, they're needing quality workers
desperately,'' Curtis said. ``They (program participants) could be
around for several years or come back after college.''
</P>
<P>
   Nu-Tech President Charlie Newell said it was a way for companies
to reinvest in the community.
</P>
<P>
   When Fair began with Nu-Tech, Newell said, he was a C student.
Sarah Barrows, a Grandview High School counselor, described him as
quiet and not involved in school activities.
</P>
<P>
   But over the course of the year, working full time in the summer
and part time during the school year, Fair became more focused and
began to set goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It motivated me to do better in school and to be more precise
in my work, more thorough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Grandview juniors Dale Gordon and Kelly Parker
joined him at Nu-Tech. Gordon started as a materials handler, but
like Fair, he'll rotate through several departments before he
decides which he prefers.
</P>
<P>
   Parker, who has taken programming classes, helps the network
administrator set up computer software.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can go to school and train for a lot of stuff,'' Parker
said, ``but it's not going to help you until you actually have to
deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The program, Newell said is for laid-back students who wonder
what they're going to do in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are really special students, and someone needs to pay
attention to them,'' Newell said.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Lukenbill, a Grandview junior, said that by working at
U.S. Toy as an order-entry clerk, she was learning communication
skills and how to work with others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a great opportunity, and I love working with
people,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her work and that of the other student at U.S. Toy, Laticha
DeMars, pleases Peggy Holloway, Human Resource manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, it gives students the opportunity to
extend their education,'' Holloway said. ``They're a real asset to
U.S. Toy this year.''

U.S. WOMEN'S WORLD CUP VICTORY SOMETHING FOR THE NATION TO
CELEBRATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MECHELLE VOEPEL  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The site of the Granddaddy of the Them All
got a chance to showcase granddaughters Saturday. And what a
heart-stopping show it was.
</P>
<P>
   The Rose Bowl, shrine of college football, was host to the
Women's World Cup soccer championship game, played in front of the
largest crowd _ 90,185 _ ever to attend a women's-only sporting
event.
</P>
<P>
   And the United States, after a scoreless 90-minute regulation
and two 15-minute overtimes, sent most of the fans into a frenzy,
winning 5-4 on penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who also won the inaugural World Cup in 1991 in
China, got the clinching penalty kick from Brandi Chastain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very confident, and my team trusted me,'' Chastain
said. ``I couldn't wait to step up and take it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain, who sent a shot into the corner to the left of
goalkeeper Gao Hong and clinched the championship, ripped off her
jersey _ a standard celebratory move by male players.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry stopped Liu Ying's
penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   To deafening chants of ``U-S-A, U-S-A,'' the players leaped
about with what energy they had left. After receiving their
championship medals, they jogged around the field carrying three
huge American flags, as fans roared.
</P>
<P>
   A cloudburst of confetti littered the field as Scurry ran to the
stands to slap hands with some fans. She then got down on her knees
and saluted the crowd, which was chanting, ``Scurry, Scurry.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton was here, but it didn't take an order from the
commander-in-chief to grant Marine pilot Christian Corry temporary
leave from his post in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Corry was at the Rose Bowl to watch his wife, U.S. star Mia
Hamm, who made the Americans' fourth penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the whole country was caught up in this, not only fans
of soccer but young girls,'' Clinton said. ``In some ways, it's the
biggest sporting even of the last decade. It's new and exciting for
the United States. It will have a very far-reaching impact, not
only for the United States, but for the world.''
</P>
<P>
   You didn't have to be from the United States, though, to feel
the red-white-and-blue fever _ the Great One, recently retired
hockey star Wayne Gretzky of Canada, sent best wishes Friday night
to the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Fans were up early Saturday, some arriving at the Rose Bowl
around dawn to secure a parking spot and set up a tailgate party.
Or perhaps stake a post near the entrance gates in order to be in
quickly and get a shot at the souvenir stands.
</P>
<P>
   It was somewhat like checkout lines on Christmas Eve, with
excited fans buying everything in sight _ from 12 kinds of T-shirts
to tambourines to soccer balls to Mia Hamm charm bracelets.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere there were men, women, boys and girls with their
faces painted and dressed like flags. Some wore Old Glory in cape
form, a fitting homage to the superwomen on the field, who raced up
and down in the Southern California heat and humidity for 120
minutes before the penalty-kick drama ended it.
</P>
<P>
   The bright-red splashes in the crowd also were proud patriots _
fans of China, the team the United States beat for the gold in the
1996 Olympics. The Chinese fans weren't happy Saturday when Rose
Bowl security guards took away one fan's huge Chinese flag.
</P>
<P>
   That was not because of any anti-China bias; flags of a certain
size were not allowed in the stadium. The Chinese fans booed that,
but it was one of the few times anything but cheers were heard.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain talked in the last week about the fever for the U.S.
women's soccer team that had swept the country, saying: ``You could
cry, it's so nice.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States started its national team back in 1985, and
Michelle Akers remembered how the players and coaches had to sew
the ``USA'' letters on their jerseys back then.
</P>
<P>
   There were times when the U.S. women's soccer team played in
front of 100 or fewer. When the Americans came back from winning
the first Cup, in 1991, no one but their friends and families
seemed to know anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, though, they felt as if all of the United States was
family, and the World Cup was something for everyone to share.

DOUGHERTY HAS SLIM LEAD AND A LOT OF PURSUERS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL ARKUSH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST DES MOINES, Iowa _ With only one round to go in the U.S.
Senior Open, by far the most important tournament in the galaxy for
golfers 50 and older, the surprise halfway leader Ed Dougherty
remains on top. But only barely, and about a dozen pursuers,
including the tour's premier player, Hale Irwin, still have a
reasonable chance of catching him when the intense pressure of this
major championship in Middle America reaches its peak Sunday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty, 51, who had a mostly undistinguished career in his
initial go-round on the PGA Tour _ his only victory in 457 starts
came at age 47 at the 1995 Deposit Guaranty Golf Classic _ was
ahead by three strokes entering Saturday's third round at Des
Moines Golf and Country Club, and held together through much of the
day. It certainly didn't appear as if he were going to fade.
</P>
<P>
   But consecutive bogeys at 16 and 17 lead to a three-over 75 for
a total of four-under 212, just one stroke over Irwin, Dave
Eichelberger and Bruce Summerhays. Gil Morgan, Irwins main rival in
1997 and 1998, is only two shots back, and Joe Inman is three
behind.
</P>
<P>
   Even Jim Colbert, who posted his second straight 68 after an
opening-round 80, is still, remarkably, in the middle of it at
even-par 216, only four behind. It is hard to recall when someone
started with a score in the 80s and rebounded in time to win a
major on any tour.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Dougherty, despite his struggles down the stretch,
remains in a very good mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't the best of days but if someone had told me Monday
that, `Hey, Ed, you'll have a one-shot lead going into Sunday, how
do you think you'll handle it? I would have been thrilled,'' said
Dougherty. ``And I still am thrilled. I have lead the Open for
three days. I'm playing with Hale tomorrow. He's the best player on
the senior tour. Whatever happens, happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, with all his valuable experience three U.S. Open
victories (1974, 1979 and 1990) on the PGA Tour Irwin, the
defending champion, is, unquestionably, the clear favorite. Even
more ominously for his respectful competitors, Irwin may be due.
``I don't feel like I have had my round yet in the tournament,''
said Irwin, whose 70 Saturday followed unspectacular scores of 71
and 72.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been respectable rounds, not those kinds of rounds
that I feel like I can generate. And, hopefully, I can have that
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   No doubt Eichelberger harbors similar aspirations, though he's
acutely aware of the challenge ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying for 35 years to beat Hale,'' said
Eichelberger, ``and it has been pretty hard. In fact, I haven't
done it too many times.''
</P>
<P>
   Irwin actually could have fared even better. He missed a 12-foot
birdie putt at 18 that would have, in retrospect, tied him for the
lead. Yet he could not be too disappointed. He was only one under
par for the tournament until he tapped in for a birdie at 16 and
followed it with a 20-foot birdie putt at 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not in the perfect position,'' he added, ``but I am not
in a bad position.''
</P>
<P>
   Dougherty, of course, is in the best position, but it will be
difficult for him to hang on. He'll be encountering the kind of
final-round pressure that he has not faced too many times in his
career. But big surprises have won before in the U.S. Senior Open _
Larry Laoretti in 1992, Simon Hobday in 1994 _ so anything can
truly happen.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's for sure: No matter who is on the leaderboard on
Sunday, the people will come. All week long, crowds have embraced
this tournament in unbelievable fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's attendance was 47,200, bringing the total number of
fans since Monday's practice rounds to 201,600. This total comes
despite the absence of crowd favorites Arnold Palmer and Chi Chi
Rodriguez, who both missed the cut, and Jack Nicklaus, who withdrew
from the tournament after aggravating a hip that is still
recovering from replacement surgery in January.

CONSUMERS INCREASINGLY SEEKING LASER SURGERY TO IMPROVE EYESIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Craig Schurig is lying down, arms resting
comfortably at his sides.
</P>
<P>
   As a suction ring hugs one of his nearsighted eyes, a small flap
of tissue from the outer layer of his cornea is lifted by a surgeon
wielding a tiny, high-tech tool.
</P>
<P>
   Next, for about 25 seconds, surgeon Daniel S. Durrie trains a
laser on Schurig's cornea, flattening the curve a bit. Then Durrie
deftly brings the corneal flap back down, and it adheres like
Velcro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good now,'' the red-eyed Schurig said after the
procedure, which took about three minutes. ``The only thing you
feel is the drops going in, the numbing drops.''
</P>
<P>
   Schurig has just undergone LASIK surgery at the Hunkeler Eye
Centers in Overland Park, Kan. The 34-year-old assistant football
coach at Pittsburg State University in Kansas is one of an
estimated 807,500 Americans this year who will undergo the
procedure first performed a decade ago. That is up from 360,000
last year.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast an estimated 142,500 Americans will undergo a
similar type of surgery known as PRK this year, compared with
90,000 last year. PRK is an older procedure that is losing ground
to LASIK.
</P>
<P>
   Both procedures are types of refractive surgery, which is
intended to improve the eye's focus by changing the shape of the
cornea, the transparent covering of the eyeball.
</P>
<P>
   These intricate procedures represent another example of how a
growing number of Americans _ notably middle-aged, middle- and
upper-income men _ are willing to spend money for surgeries that
they want but, in most cases, don't necessarily need.
</P>
<P>
   LASIK patients spend an average of $1,500 to $2,500 per eye,
usually out of their own pockets, to correct nearsightedness,
farsightedness and astigmatism. Their goal is to set aside their
glasses and contacts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I like is when you work out in the yard and you get
all sweaty, your glasses aren't falling down on your face,'' said
Olathe, Kan., resident Kathy Glover, who had LASIK surgery a few
months ago. ``I wish I had had it done a long time ago.'' Some
problems
</P>
<P>
   Such enthusiasm is not universal.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Handley, a Kansas City psychologist who had LASIK
surgery in December, is unhappy with the results. Handley, 47, had
surgery to correct nearsightedness in both eyes. He paid about
$4,500 for the procedure, which was performed outside the Kansas
City area.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't do it over again,'' he said. ``At night I see
around the scar tissue and it creates a lot of halos, glare,
night-vision problems. It's literally impossible to drive at night
in the city, where there are lots of lights, or enjoy events such
as movie theaters or a high school play, anything where you're in a
darkened room and there are lights in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   Handley said the problem was caused by his
bigger-than-average-sized pupils. He has tried wearing dark glasses
and anti-glare glasses, but they have not helped. He said his
doctors had told him they had no solution.
</P>
<P>
   Experts say even patients with normal-sized pupils will probably
see halos around headlights at night for a few weeks after LASIK
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, patient satisfaction is not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   According to the June issue of Consumer Reports, the latest
studies of LASIK and PRK claim an 80 percent success rate. Success
is defined as unaided eyesight after surgery that is 20//40 or
better, which would allow you to drive without corrective lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Major complications, such as cutting the corneal flap completely
free, occur in fewer than 5 percent of surgeries. Some experts
estimate that complications such as glare, ghosting and fuzziness
occur in about 10 percent of patients.
</P>
<P>
   Durrie, who mostly does LASIK surgery, said about 5 percent of
his patients needed some additional surgery within a year to reach
their vision goals. There is no charge for such ``touch-up''
surgery, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that, 99 percent of patients don't need contacts or
glasses to see at a distance, though they may need reading glasses
as they get older,'' Durrie said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, skyrocketing numbers of patients speak to widespread
satisfaction that spurs demand. Many tell friends and relatives
that it was painless and they could see better immediately. The
positive reviews spur others to open their pocketbooks and look up
at the laser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody either knows someone or works with someone who's had
(LASIK) done,'' said Joseph Tauber, a cornea specialist and
refractive surgeon with the Sabates Eye Centers in the Kansas City
area.
</P>
<P>
   Others report a similar surge. John Doane, a refractive surgeon
with Eye Care in the Kansas City area, said his group had performed
more than 10,000 LASIK surgeries in the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each year we anticipate doing 100 percent more than the prior
year,'' Doane said. ``That's pretty much what the market's doing
across the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Such strong demand is particularly notable because almost all of
the money is coming straight out of the patient's pocket. Most
health insurance policies do not cover this type of surgery,
because it is considered an elective procedure. Payment plans
usually are available.
</P>
<P>
   Guy Kazirian, an ophthalmologist and media liaison for the
International Society of Refractive Surgery, characterized LASIK
surgery as a luxury, though it improves the vision of most people
who have it done.
</P>
<P>
   Industry studies show that the majority of refractory surgery
patients are men aged 35 to 45 with incomes exceeding $40,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Men might be less willing to put up with slipping eye glasses
and//or difficult-to-care-for contact lenses,'' said Irving J.
Arons, managing director of Spectrum Consulting in Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Durrie, who serves on the American Academy of Ophthalmology's
executive committee for refractive surgery, said that not just the
wealthy were seeking LASIK.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have patients who are policemen, firemen, farmers,
construction workers, people who really work and use their eyes a
lot and think they can do a safer job at their work,'' he said.
``They plan for it, and it's a family decision to spend this kind
of money.'' Who's a candidate?
</P>
<P>
   Experts say there is no ideal LASIK patient, but there are
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   Durrie said that LASIK patients should be 18 or older and that
the procedure should not be performed on those who are prone to eye
infections. Those with unusually large pupils are poor candidates
because they will see around the edge of the treated cornea at
night, causing them to see halos around lights.
</P>
<P>
   People who are severely nearsighted often are discouraged
because of the risk of unsatisfactory outcomes. Even so, Doane
said, almost all of the people who come to his office are
candidates for LASIK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideally their vision has been stable for the past year and
they have a desire to get out of glasses and//or contacts,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   When LASIK surgery is performed on those older than 40, surgeons
frequently leave one eye a little nearsighted to forestall the need
for reading glasses.
</P>
<P>
   LASIK patients wear protective eye coverings when they go to
sleep at night for about a week after the surgery, to protect the
eyes from pressure. They use drops for a few weeks to keep their
eyes lubricated.
</P>
<P>
   Handley, who is unhappy with his LASIK surgery, advised
potential patients to be smart consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't,'' he said. ``Make sure your doctor gives you a pupil
exam in dim light before you have any surgery. Research the pros
and cons thoroughly through multiple sources.''
</P>
<P>
   But Glover, the LASIK patient from Olathe, said she could read
menus in dark restaurants now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing, that I didn't know was going to happen, is
that I don't have headaches any more,'' she said. ``I used to have
headaches all the time, and it was eyestrain. I just thought it was
stress in my jaw.''
</P>
<P>
   Schurig said he could now get up in the morning and ``see the
alarm clock, take the dogs out. Before, when my kids would come
into our bedroom in the morning, I could only see their outline.
Now I can see them clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, new techniques are being developed. One of the newest
procedures uses plastic implants, known as Intacs, to correct
mild-to-moderate nearsightedness. Intacs are implanted in the
cornea and can remain permanently, but they can easily be removed
by a surgeon if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not aware at all that I have them in there,'' said Kelly
F. Grosdidier, a Hunkeler optometrist who had the Intacs procedure
done in May. ``My vision is great.''

COMMITTEE EXPECTED TO SEEK AUTHORIZATION TO CHOOSE SUPERINTENDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Desegregation Monitoring Committee
probably will recommend that it appoint a Kansas City School
District superintendent if the Board of Education cannot reach
agreement with a candidate by a court-imposed deadline of July 19.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members presented their plan at a closed meeting with
U.S. District Judge Dean Whipple last week. School board members
learned of the plan in a memo they received late Friday from the
school district's legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DMC will likely recommend that the DMC be authorized to
employ as its employee a full-time administrator (probably a
retired superintendent), to administer the district on a day-to-day
basis until such time as a permanent superintendent is selected by
the board,'' district lawyers wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Whipple has scheduled a hearing for 10 a.m. July 19. If a
superintendent has not been named by then, Whipple will accept
recommendations as to what actions he should take.
</P>
<P>
   Board member Lance Loewenstein said the desegregation
committee's proposal appeared to stop just short of receivership,
in which the court would eliminate the school board and assume
day-to-day control of the district.
</P>
<P>
   Loewenstein said he interpreted the committee's plan not as a
threat but as a gentle reminder that the school board needed to act
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they want to do this,'' Loewenstein said. ``I
think they vastly prefer us to hire a superintendent. They want to
go home. That's obvious to me. They want out of this quagmire in a
very bad way.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo also says the committee is opposed to allowing Phyllis
Chase, the interim chief administrator for curriculum and
instruction, to remain in the position during the coming school
year.
</P>
<P>
   Some board members have advocated letting Chase continue to run
the instructional side of the district while the search continues
for a permanent superintendent.
</P>
<P>
   Board President John Rios said Saturday that he had yet to
review the memo, but he expressed concern about its contents. He is
among those board members who have expressed support for leaving
Chase in the post.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is that it's unfortunate they have that
attitude,'' Rios said of the committee. ``I think she's done a good
job in the interim.''

<P>
   PLEASANTON, Kan. _ What happened just south of here 135 years
ago this Oct. 25 was quick _ 10,000 troops clashed, Union cavalry
rolled up the Confederate line, two Southern generals were captured
along with hundreds of their men, and gunfire echoed over the
quieting battlefield as the Yankee victors executed vanquished
rebels found wearing scrounged blue uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Thus here in Linn County, the final nail was pounded into
Confederate Gen. Sterling Price's grand strategy to rive Missouri
and its western borders. His army, which threatened St. Louis,
besieged Jefferson City and then was driven out of Westport, was
transformed into a defeated rabble on the Kansas prairie.
</P>
<P>
   For Price and his troops the Civil War ended with the Battle of
Mine Creek, itself an oddity in that most of the fighting took
place in only 30 explosive minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with its sesquicentennial just 15 years away, little Mine
Creek and its historic environs look north and see the approach of
a slower yet far more inexorable host.
</P>
<P>
   Coming are not the cavalry, but surveyors, cement trucks, loads
of lumber, roofers and plumbers, road-building machinery,
utility-line crews, sod-layers, riding mowers and, eventually,
fast-food franchises and shopping malls.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's Louisburg _ just 30 miles up the road?'' asked John
Spencer, a Fort Scott physician whose great-grandfather fought as a
Union cavalry sergeant at Mine Creek. ``Last I looked they had a
McDonald's, a Burger King, a Sonic, gas stations out on (U.S.) 69,
even a Price Chopper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty, 30 years, unless something's done, you'll be looking
at subdivisions around this battlefield.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer and Arnold Schofield, a Fort Scott historian, were
talking about Mine Creek earlier this year while driving home from
a meeting of the Civil War Round Table of Kansas City. Both knew
that in the 1970s Kansas had acquired _ sometimes with less than a
light touch _ 270 acres of the old battlefield for a park east of
U.S. 69 and south of Kansas 52.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, the Kansas State Historical Society opened a visitors
center for self-guided walking tours.
</P>
<P>
   But, Schofield said, that was about it.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, he said, the park was just some land that looks
pretty much as it did in 1864, largely unstudied by professionals,
as has been done at the battlefield in Montana where Lt. Col.
George Armstrong Custer and most of his command died.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you had was pristine land, some that'd never been broken
by a plow and that nobody has ever gone over in a systematic way to
figure out what really happened by finding buried cartridge
casings, old bridles, busted-up guns, maybe even graves,''
Schofield said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew _ after the visitors center _ there wouldn't be much
more (done). Plus, you can't go to the Legislature and say you have
some old ground down in Linn County and we'd like so many dollars
just to poke around. Never happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On that trip back to Fort Scott, Spencer and Schofield decided
to form an association, sort of an adjunct venture that could help
out _ print brochures, fund some archaeological investigations,
provide some audiovisual aids and furnish what they called ``land
stewardship.''
</P>
<P>
   The goals were modest. The tax-exempt group, called the Mine
Creek Battlefield Foundation (816 E. National Ave. Fort Scott, KS
66701) would spend a few thousand dollars annually. Kip Lindberg,
curator at the visitors center, and Charles Gentry, a Fort Scott
attorney, rounded out what was called the ``Four Musketeers.'' Soon
after, Charles Conley, Marty Read and Dale Sprague of Linn County
signed on.
</P>
<P>
   The group got into action quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten days or so later the doc is on the phone yelling, `The
Hamilton land is on the market, the Hamilton land is one the
market,' '' Schofield said.
</P>
<P>
   The Hamilton land was the late Reese Hamilton's 80 acres
abutting the east side of the Mine Creek park. Across the Hamilton
land, historians have long suspected, Union Lt. Col. Frederick
Benteen (later an antagonist ofCuster at the Little Bighorn, sent
his brigade smashing into the army of Gen. John Marmaduke,
scattering it and capturing Marmaduke.
</P>
<P>
   ``That acreage is absolutely vital to the battlefield,'' said
Spencer, who added that it shielded the visitors center just to the
east and safeguarded a tract where myriad battle artifacts have
been found over the years.
</P>
<P>
   But the real key to the Hamilton land is the recent discovery,
through ground-imaging radar, of the long-lost Fort
Scott-to-Westport road, which a few old maps merely hinted at. The
road is west of the famed Fort Scott-Leavenworth frontier trail.
Along and on each side of the newly revealed road, now under just a
few feet of soil, Benteen may have sent his troopers forward.
</P>
<P>
   The asking price to settle Hamilton's estate was $120,000, or
$1,500 an acre, high compared with 20 years ago but not out of line
with today's prices of adjacent land. Schofield said Linn County
was already feeling pressure from speculators who want to get in on
the ground floor.
</P>
<P>
   Where to get the money? The Legislature had already written its
bills for the year. Maybe next year, the foundation was told. But
don't count even on that.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's heirs wanted the money within four months.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we went to a bank, put up some of our own money (roughly 20
percent) borrowed the rest and bought it ourselves,'' Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Gruber, executive vice president of the Civil War Trust
in Arlington, Va., the nation's largest Civil War
battlefield-preservation group, said the purchase of such land by
individuals was all but unheard of.
</P>
<P>
   ``That,'' he said, ``is dedication.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruber also said it was amazing that the group could purchase
the land only about 90 days after hearing it was available.
</P>
<P>
   Civil War battlefield preservation is now in a race against
time, Gruber said. One acre of battlefield is lost every 10
seconds, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can be preserved must be preserved now,'' he said. ``Land
is just disappearing. The pressure of development is that strong.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer, Gruber said, is the growth in what's called
``heritage tourism.'' People are willing to travel to battlefields
and spend money in nearby towns, he said, as long as what they are
visiting still looks much as it did when it became part of the
American legacy. But surround a site _ any site _ with neon,
plastic and asphalt, he said, and people will drive on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you an example,'' he said. ``Chantilly here in
Virginia was a major battle. What's left? A monument in the middle
of shopping malls.''
</P>
<P>
   The Civil War Trust said that Missouri battlefields at Westport,
Independence, Glasgow and Island No. 10 are past saving, and Lone
Jack, Springfield and Lexington are severely threatened. In Kansas,
Baxter Springs and Lawrence have been lost. Only Mine Creek
remains.
</P>
<P>
   Schofield said grant money from other foundations and federal
agencies should recoup the $120,000 spent on the Hamilton land.
Already, he said, members of the Mine Creek foundation are talking
with other area landowners.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Schofield said, is to acquire about 900 acres, then
hand it over to the state so that Mine Creek can be protected from
any encroachment. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just getting started,'' he said.

   LOS ANGELES: screenings.
</P>
<P>
   Several other projects already stand out from the 200-plus major
movies coming next year:
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, Myself and Irene'' from Fox in the summer. Jim Carrey
stars as a state trooper with a split personality with both sides
of himself falling in love with the same woman. ``Irene,'' played
by Rene Zellweger, is the Farrelly Brothers first film since their
blockbuster ``There's Something About Mary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot,'' from Sony in the summer with Mel Gibson as a
father of seven in South Carolina forced to fight the British
during the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Men'' from Fox with Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan and Anna
Paquin. The comic-book heroes saga will be directed by Richard
Donner, who brought ``Superman'' to life in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin Brockovich'' from Universal with Julia Roberts as a
real-life Southern California legal secretary who won a
class-action lawsuit over water contamination.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Grinch Who Stole Christmas,'' for Universal at
Thanksgiving with Carrey in the first Dr. Seuss story to make it to
the big screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Memoirs of a Geisha,'' late in the year for Sony, directed by
Spielberg and based on the novel by Arthur Golden in which a
9-year-old girl is sold into slavery in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ali,'' with Will Smith as the legendary boxer for Sony late in
the year in the third teaming with Barry Sonnenfeld, who also
directed Smith in ``Men In Black'' and ``Wild Wild West.''
</P>
<P>
   Other possible hits include Disney's ``Fantasia 2000'' and drama
``Gone in 60 Seconds''; New Line's thriller ``Flight 180'';
Miramax's teen comedy ``Down To You''; DreamWorks' animated ``El
Dorado'' and ``Chicken Run''; Sony's comedy ``What Planet Are You
From'' and ``Charlie's Angels'' with Drew Barrymore; Universal's
``Rocky &AMP; Bullwinkle,'' ``Flintstones 2'' and ``Nutty Professor
2''; Paramount's ``Rugrats 2'' and ``The Talented Mr. Ripley'' with
Matt Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow; Fox's ``Cast Away'' with Tom Hanks
and Helen Hunt; and Warner's football comedy ``The Replacements,''
with Keanu Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a wish list of franchise sequels that might never
happen but could be fast-tracked to next year if deals are reached.
Among the sequels reportedly in early stages of discussion:
``Godfather IV,'' ``Indiana Jones 4,'' ``Superman 5,'' ``Total
Recall 2,'' ``Jurassic Park 3,'' ``True Lies 2'' and ``Mad Max 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, every Y2K film looks great at this point. But even
the cockiest studio executives remain aware that what seemed
sure-fire on paper can become a dog when moviegoers pony up $8 and
two hours to watch recent misfires like ``EDtv,'' ``Meet Joe
Black,'' ``The Mod Squad,'' ``Deep End of the Ocean'' and ``True
Crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for studios, the bombs have come less often lately.
Several observers believe it's because Hollywood has learned how to
fast-track films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studios are adapting to trends more readily than in the past,
particularly in hot areas like comedies geared to teen-agers and
date crowds,'' Bucksbaum said. ``It used to take them two years to
figure out trends, which change much quicker than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley Thomas, a producer with the Farrellys, noted that
production began on ``Irene'' less than six months after Fox
received the script. ``This really happened extremely quickly,'' he
added. ``I think everyone realized this was a definite summer movie
after the success with `Something About Mary.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood also has been helped immeasurably by the ongoing boom
in shiny new movie palaces with up to 30 state-of-the-art
auditoriums, massive snack bars and staggered start times. The
so-called megaplexes _ built by the theater owners rather than the
studios _ have been a major driver in box office gains of recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Megaplexes have made it comfortable for people to go the
movies,'' Skislock said. ``People are much more likely to not even
check the paper anymore before they go but rather just show up and
decide what to see on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   Studios and producers also have fine-tuned the idea of
delivering films aimed at niches such as teen-agers and families.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can get the 13-to-25-year-old demographic, there are
massive amounts of money,'' said Morgan Rector, president of
Imperial Entertainment Group.
</P>
<P>
   It's not as easy as it sounds, according to Warren Zide,
producer of ``American Pie'' and the horror-thriller ``Flight
180.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to make movies that people can relate to,'' Zide
said. ``People need to respect the fact that kids are smarter than
they get credit for. We like to speak up to kids rather than down
to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Zide also said it's crucial to move quickly at a time when many
studios are cutting the number of films released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We make sure the script is as close to production as possible
and we keep moving things along,'' he added. ``A lot of people fall
into overdevelopment, where all of a sudden you've got a script
that's been in development for three years. I'm not saying that
makes the script bad, but we try to avoid it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood also is scrambling to expand the family audience,
which has been dominated by Disney. DreamWorks will release three
animated movies next year and Paramount will follow up with a
sequel to its surprisingly powerful ``The Rugrats Movie'' through
its Nickelodeon unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see a real opportunity to do family comedy,'' said
Nickelodeon movie chief Albie Hecht, who has a half-dozen projects
in development including ``Snow Day,'' ``Fried Worms'' and a Rube
Goldberg project. ``I think `Something About Mary' is great but you
really don't want to watch it with your kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than present the idealized world of Disney movies,
Nickelodeon stresses realism. ``Disney takes the extraordinary for
granted but we bring it to everyday life,'' Hecht said. ``Our films
are going to be very contemporary.''

STUDIOS PLAN BIG, BIG YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What Y2K problem?
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's movie schedule for next year shows excellent
potential and plenty of depth, analysts and insiders say. That's in
contrast to this year, which most analysts previously predicted
would be remembered as `` `Star Wars' and everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the movies slated for early 2000 should be
able to sustain current box office momentum, analysts say, amid the
increasingly heated battle for consumers' entertainment dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for blockbuster status _ ``tentpoles'' in studio
lingo _ have emerged in two highly profitable areas: vehicles for
superstars like Tom Cruise, Jim Carrey, Julia Roberts and Will
Smith, and movies about outer space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year 2000 schedule is very ambitious and varied with a lot
of tentpole films,'' said Sony distribution chief Jeff Blake, who
counts a half-dozen films as possible mega-hits. ``It's become a
way of life to have strong films and the schedule jammed week after
week so I don't expect any less in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney distribution head Chuck Viane also sees at least six
potential blockbusters from his studio, adding, ``This year's been
good; next year looks fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   In a show of bravado, Hollywood's major studios already have
staked out many key release dates for 2000, from 10 months to a
year before the movies even will be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studios are claiming dates much earlier than they used to,''
said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking
service. ``They've realized you can release two or three movies on
the same date and still do well.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another key reason why studios are locking up dates _
merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how producers are offsetting a lot of their increased
costs and why they're not backing off on making big-budget films,''
Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Two key projects are already on a collision course. Possibly in
an effort to cash in on next year's expected focus on the future,
Warner Bros. and Disney will both release movies about rescue
missions to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's ``Mars,'' originally titled ``Alone,'' will star Val
Kilmer as a stranded astronaut and Carrie-Anne Moss as the rescuer.
It will open in March.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's entry, due in late June, is ``Mission to Mars'' with
Gary Sinese, Tim Robbins and Don Cheadle investigating the
disappearance of the first mission. Principal photography under the
direction of Brian DePalma started two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us three years to get the script right to show a
strong human drama with dangerous and exciting situations,'' said
producer Tom Jacobson. ``We're creating Mars with a combination of
locations like Jordan, the Canary Islands and a 50-acre sand pit in
Vancouver.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson said he was not worried about ``Mars'' taking away from
the audience for ``Mission to Mars.'' ``I'm not one to philosophize
about the business, but I am encouraged by what I've seen this
summer,'' he added. ``If you make a good movie, people will want to
go see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Memorial Day weekend is once again loaded. Warner Bros. will
open ``Space Cowboys'' with Jack Nicholson, Clint Eastwood and
Tommy Lee Jones as retired Air Force pilots retrieving dangerous
space debris. DreamWorks' could roll out ``What Lies Beneath'' with
Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer in a supernatural thriller
directed by Robert Zemeckis. Disney's ``Dinosaurs,'' with a
potentially ground-breaking mix of animation and live action, will
tell the story of a baby dino raised by monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaurs'' could cost as much as $200million, according to
unconfirmed rumors.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Space Cowboys'' and the two Mars movies, three space
travel movies could be opening within three months. Conventional
wisdom would conclude doing so is a lousy idea, but conventional
wisdom has been wrong recently.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, for example, analysts predicted ``Deep Impact'' and
``Armageddon'' would hurt each other by opening only eight weeks
apart; instead, they combined for $350million domestically. The
lesson was not lost on studios, which are scrambling to fill the
void for sci-fi until ``Star Wars: Episode 2'' opens in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a generation growing up with tremendous
excitement about space travel and it will take quite a few films to
make people tired about it,'' said analyst Kevin Skislock of Laguna
Research Partners. ``People will go because it's a way to live it
vicariously. With the effects making it so real and something that
can't be replicated at home, we're only at the beginning of a new
wave of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the strongest early buzz for 2000 comes from another
sci-fi film _ ``Minority Report'' from 20th Century Fox and
scheduled to open June 28. Tom Cruise will star and Steven
Spielberg will direct a big-screen version of a Phillip K. Dick
story about a futuristic ``pre-crime'' police squad.
</P>
<P>
   Also on next year's sci-fi radar are Sony's ``The Hollow Man,''
with Kevin Bacon as a scientist who becomes invisible, and Fox's
animated ``Titan A.E.,'' formerly named ``Planet Ice,'' which
already has been seen in trailers prior to ``Star Wars: Episode One
_ The Phantom Menace'' screenings.

   LOS ANGELES _ What Y2K problem?
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood's movie schedule for next year shows excellent
potential and plenty of depth, analysts and insiders say. That's in
contrast to this year, which most analysts previously predicted
would be remembered as `` `Star Wars' and everything else.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the movies slated for early 2000 should be
able to sustain current box office momentum, analysts say, amid the
increasingly heated battle for consumers' entertainment dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for blockbuster status _ ``tentpoles'' in studio
lingo _ have emerged in two highly profitable areas: vehicles for
superstars like Tom Cruise, Jim Carrey, Julia Roberts and Will
Smith, and movies about outer space.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year 2000 schedule is very ambitious and varied with a lot
of tentpole films,'' said Sony distribution chief Jeff Blake, who
counts a half-dozen films as possible mega-hits. ``It's become a
way of life to have strong films and the schedule jammed week after
week so I don't expect any less in 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney distribution head Chuck Viane also sees at least six
potential blockbusters from his studio, adding, ``This year's been
good; next year looks fabulous.''
</P>
<P>
   In a show of bravado, Hollywood's major studios already have
staked out many key release dates for 2000, from 10 months to a
year before the movies even will be released.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studios are claiming dates much earlier than they used to,''
said Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source tracking
service. ``They've realized you can release two or three movies on
the same date and still do well.''
</P>
<P>
   There's another key reason why studios are locking up dates _
merchandising.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how producers are offsetting a lot of their increased
costs and why they're not backing off on making big-budget films,''
Bucksbaum said.
</P>
<P>
   Two key projects are already on a collision course. Possibly in
an effort to cash in on next year's expected focus on the future,
Warner Bros. and Disney will both release movies about rescue
missions to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's ``Mars,'' originally titled ``Alone,'' will star Val
Kilmer as a stranded astronaut and Carrie-Anne Moss as the rescuer.
It will open in March.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's entry, due in late June, is ``Mission to Mars'' with
Gary Sinese, Tim Robbins and Don Cheadle investigating the
disappearance of the first mission. Principal photography under the
direction of Brian DePalma started two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us three years to get the script right to show a
strong human drama with dangerous and exciting situations,'' said
producer Tom Jacobson. ``We're creating Mars with a combination of
locations like Jordan, the Canary Islands and a 50-acre sand pit in
Vancouver.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobson said he was not worried about ``Mars'' taking away from
the audience for ``Mission to Mars.'' ``I'm not one to philosophize
about the business, but I am encouraged by what I've seen this
summer,'' he added. ``If you make a good movie, people will want to
go see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Memorial Day weekend is once again loaded. Warner Bros. will
open ``Space Cowboys'' with Jack Nicholson, Clint Eastwood and
Tommy Lee Jones as retired Air Force pilots retrieving dangerous
space debris. DreamWorks' could roll out ``What Lies Beneath'' with
Harrison Ford and Michelle Pfeiffer in a supernatural thriller
directed by Robert Zemeckis. Disney's ``Dinosaurs,'' with a
potentially ground-breaking mix of animation and live action, will
tell the story of a baby dino raised by monkeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaurs'' could cost as much as $200million, according to
unconfirmed rumors.
</P>
<P>
   With ``Space Cowboys'' and the two Mars movies, three space
travel movies could be opening within three months. Conventional
wisdom would conclude doing so is a lousy idea, but conventional
wisdom has been wrong recently.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, for example, analysts predicted ``Deep Impact'' and
``Armageddon'' would hurt each other by opening only eight weeks
apart; instead, they combined for $350million domestically. The
lesson was not lost on studios, which are scrambling to fill the
void for sci-fi until ``Star Wars: Episode 2'' opens in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing a generation growing up with tremendous
excitement about space travel and it will take quite a few films to
make people tired about it,'' said analyst Kevin Skislock of Laguna
Research Partners. ``People will go because it's a way to live it
vicariously. With the effects making it so real and something that
can't be replicated at home, we're only at the beginning of a new
wave of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the strongest early buzz for 2000 comes from another
sci-fi film _ ``Minority Report'' from 20th Century Fox and
scheduled to open June 28. Tom Cruise will star and Steven
Spielberg will direct a big-screen version of a Phillip K. Dick
story about a futuristic ``pre-crime'' police squad.
</P>
<P>
   Also on next year's sci-fi radar are Sony's ``The Hollow Man,''
with Kevin Bacon as a scientist who becomes invisible, and Fox's
animated ``Titan A.E.,'' formerly named ``Planet Ice,'' which
already has been seen in trailers prior to ``Star Wars: Episode One
_ The Phantom Menace'' screenings.

PURE STORYBOOK: METS WIN ONE TO REMEMBER  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Yankees bashed nearly a half-mile of home runs
against the Mets Saturday, they came from behind twice and
recovered from what some of them thought was the longest home run
they had ever seen. But the Yankees still needed a single strike to
hold their one-run lead and win this three-ring circus of a ball
game.
</P>
<P>
   The bases were loaded, bottom of the ninth inning, no balls and
two strikes, Yankees and Mets fans alike standing and shouting at
Shea Stadium. The Yankees' Mariano Rivera threw a fastball past the
Mets pinch-hitter Matt Franco. Ball 1, called the home-plate
umpire, Jeff Kellogg, and some Yankees' players and coaches lunged
forward in the dugout, screaming angrily.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera threw another fastball, Franco laced a line drive into
right field, the tying and winning runs scored in the Mets' 9-8
victory, and there was a total meltdown in Queens: the Mets'
professional mien dissolved into adolescent joyfulness as they
rushed Franco on the field, and the Yankees sagged at the shoulders
as they walked off, in one of the most incredible games any of them
will ever play.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets, who won Friday night's game, can complete a sweep of
the Yankees Sunday, when Orel Hershiser pitches against Hideki
Irabu. But none of them was thinking about that within the first
hour after Franco's stunning game-winning single. From the quiet
sadness of Bernie Williams, whose misplay set up the decisive runs,
to the grin of Mike Piazza as he told of his 482-foot home run, the
Yankees and Mets reveled in all that was good and bad and great
about Saturday's game. ``The mood swings were incredible,'' Franco
said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Rivera, ``I never had a feeling in a game like that
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte pitched six innings for the Yankees and then
managed to find the only quiet place in Shea, in the Yankees'
clubhouse, to watch the final innings on a television mounted on a
beam; deep within the ball park, it was as if Pettitte was within a
sound-proofed room. Already there had been so much craziness.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees jumped ahead, 2-0, on Paul O'Neill's home run. The
Mets took a 4-2 lead in the fourth, after the first of the Yankees'
defensive mistakes. Ricky Ledee and Jorge Posada _ who had made
those mistakes in the bottom of the fourth _ tied the game with
back-to-back home runs in the top of the fifth, and then O'Neill
and Chuck Knoblauch blasted home runs, giving the Yankees a 6-4
edge through six and a half innings. Pettitte settled into a metal
chair at a four-legged table in the silence of the clubhouse and
like a man sitting alone on his couch, watched the pendulum of
momentum swing back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza relieved Pettitte for the seventh, and after a
bloop double by Rickey Henderson, Mendoza walked John Olerud,
bringing Piazza to the plate; the home run that Piazza crushed to
win Friday's game was foremost in the memories of the 53,792 fans
at Shea. Mendoza fell behind in the count, tried to come back with
a sinker _ and Piazza murdered the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of Piazza's 34{-inch, 33-{ounce bat striking Mendoza's
sinker propelled Jeff Manto and others off the Yankees' bench. What
a sound. The Yankees' lead was departing Shea along with Piazza's
home run, but that didn't matter; as baseball players, they all
understood the majesty of Piazza's home run. ``I don't usually
watch the other team's homers,'' Manto said. ``But that sounded so
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Said O'Neill, ``When you're on the field and see a guy hit a
ball like that, you almost become a fan.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees in the bullpen beyond the left-field fence saw
Piazza's home run coming, and they stared as if watching a jet take
off from LaGuardia. The ball landed near the top of the
blue-and-white striped tent beyond the left-field fence. Piazza
circled the bases and descended into a sea of excited teammates.
Pettitte watched quietly in the Yankees' clubhouse. Mets 7, Yankees
6.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets' bullpen is not the same without John Franco.
Armando Benitez does not pitch the eighth inning anymore, and
instead of Benitez, Dennis Cook was pitching. Scott Brosius walked,
and one batter later, Posada stepped in to hit. He was playing only
because Joe Girardi had a strained neck, and Posada's fifth-inning
home run had eased the frustration of an otherwise terrible year _
he began the game hitting .199.
</P>
<P>
   Posada did it again: Cook threw a pitch down, Posada lifted it
high and deep to left, and gone, and now it was the Yankees
spilling out of the dugout. Another crossroads, another unexpected
turn. There would be five lead changes and two ties in nine
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera took over for the bottom of the ninth, and the Yankees
could have been forgiven for overwhelming confidence. The last time
they lost a game when leading after eight innings was May 14, 1998,
a string of 124 games. Three outs to go.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera got the first out, then walked Henderson; Mets fans were
screaming, knowing that if two guys got on, Piazza would hit.
Edgardo Alfonzo drove a deep fly just to left of center, and
Williams raced back, feeling for the wall with his right hand. He
had it, he had it.
</P>
<P>
   Williams reached up _ and missed the fly. It bounced on the
warning track, and Henderson, caught by surprise, hadn't advanced
past second; by the time the ball returned to the infield, he had
advanced only to third, Alfonzo to second. ``I should've caught the
ball, no doubt it,'' Williams said through pursed lips.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' infield moved in, with Olerud batting, and Rivera
attacked him with his cut fastball, jamming him inside. Olerud
weakly bounced a grounder to first, where Tino Martinez stepped on
the bag and stared down Henderson at third. Two outs. Groans and
cheers from the fans. Everybody was standing.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza strolled to the plate, but there was no chance the
Yankees would pitch to him with first base open; the Mets' fans
began booing as soon as Posada held four fingers to his right side
to signal an intentional walk.
</P>
<P>
   Bases loaded. Franco was announced as the pinch-hitter for the
Mets. Rivera stood on the mound, waiting, planning to throw cut
fastballs; Rivera buries left-handed batters with his cutter.
Franco knew this, too.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera threw, Franco fouled off the pitch. Another cutter,
strike two. Rick Reed and Cook and a handful of Mets watched in
their clubhouse. Pettitte sat alone.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera fired another cutter right over the middle of the plate,
he thought. ``My heart stopped for half a breath,'' Franco said.
Ball one, Kellogg ruled, and Manager Joe Torre and others yelled
from the Yankees' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   One strike to go. Another cutter from Rivera, and this time,
Franco whistled a low liner through the right side of the infield.
Henderson scored the tying run. O'Neill charged the ball, tried
reaching it on the first hop, couldn't, grabbed the second bounce
and threw home _ too late to get Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   Shea exploded. Brian McRae rushed to bear-hug Franco near first
base and the rest of the Mets circled them, yelling and screaming.
The Yankees walked off to join Pettitte's silent world.

   NEW YORK _ If it had been a World Series game, it would deserve
to be put in a time capsule for as long the Yankees and the Mets
play baseball. Or for as long as anybody plays baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Even as a regular-season subway series game, it deserved to have
had red, white and blue bunting on the box seat railings. Of the 11
games the Yankees and the Mets have played now over their three
seasons of interleague confrontations, this was the best. By far.
By any definition of what baseball is all about.
</P>
<P>
   And when the Mets finally won, 9-8, Saturday on pinch-hitter
Matt Franco's two-out, two-run single in the ninth inning, their
loyalists among the 53,792 fans all but detonated Shea Stadium and
the team celebrated as if it had won the World Series instead of
what so many had tried to play down as ``just another game.''
</P>
<P>
   Never before in the franchise's occasionally storied and often
silly history had the Mets had 24 hours like it.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday night's opener of the second segment of the subway
series that concludes Sunday, Mike Piazza, the Mets' $91 million
catcher, hit a three-run homer off Roger Clemens for a 5-2 lead
that Armando Benitez, with two Yankees on base in the ninth,
preserved by striking out Chili Davis as the Mets and 53,820 held
their breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sit,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine was saying
Saturday during batting practice. ``I was walking along the dugout,
telling guys: `This is exciting. This is exciting.'''
</P>
<P>
   For the Mets, that was merely an overture to Saturday's
excitement that endured for nine innings, from Paul O'Neill's
two-run homer in the first off Rick Reed to the Yankee
right-fielder's throw a split second too late to prevent Edgardo
Alfonzo from sliding across with the winning run on Franco's line
drive off Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   In their nearly four decades, the Mets have had some memorable
consecutive games: three at Shea that won the 1969 World Series
against the Orioles, the Mookie Wilson-Bill Buckner sixth game, and
the homers by Ray Knight and Darryl Strawberry in the seventh game
that won the 1986 World Series against the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   But those three 1969 games were spread over three October
afternoons, and any two of them, back to back, took about 27 hours;
those 1986 games were on a Saturday night and a Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in less than 24 hours, less than 22 hours really, the Mets
had beaten the Yankees twice _ the Yankees whose 1996 and 1998
World Series success has tormented the Mets, the Yankees who before
Friday night had tortured the Mets in six of their previous nine
games since inter-league play began in 1997, the Yankees who hit
six home runs Saturday but still couldn't win.
</P>
<P>
   With the memory of Friday's excitement lingering before
Saturday's game, Louie Armstrong was growling ``What a Wonderful
World'' over Shea's sound system, the ideal theme for what would be
a wonderful game.
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees took a 2-0 jump on O'Neill's first of two
homers, Piazza's double knocked in a run in the bottom of the
first, then the Mets scratched together the tying run in the
second. In the fourth, Robin Ventura's double sparked their 4-2
lead, but in the fifth Ricky Ledee and Jorge Posada hit consecutive
homers to tie the score. In the sixth, O'Neill hit another. In the
seventh, Chuck Knoblauch hit one for a 6-4 Yankee lead.
</P>
<P>
   But with Ramiro Mendoza pitching in the bottom of the seventh,
Piazza crushed a two-out, three-run homer that soared against the
cloudy sky and landed atop the Mets' blue-and-white hospitality
tent out in what is usually the picnic area beyond the left-field
bleachers, an estimated 482 feet from where he swung. Any further
and it would have disrupted the air-traffic controllers at nearby
LaGuardia Airport.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets led, 7-6, but not for long. Posada's second homer put
the Yankees up, 8-7, and turned the Mets' dugout into so many white
uniforms suddenly cast in stone. For several seconds, nobody in
there moved.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton breezed through the Mets in the eighth, but if
Piazza were to get up again in the ninth against Rivera, the
Yankees' incomparable closer, they needed at least two base
runners. They got them. With one out, Rickey Henderson walked and
Alfonzo doubled over center fielder Bernie Williams' head, but John
Olerud then bounced to first baseman Tino Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Two out, Piazza up, and all those fans, for the Mets and Yankees
alike, on their feet. But Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, wisely
ordered the Mets' catcher walked intentionally, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, walking the dugout as he had Friday night, sent up
Matt Franco, a left-handed-swinging sometimes infielder and
sometimes outfielder, to bat for Benny Agbayani as all those fans
held their position and held their breath. Foul ball, strike one.
Swing and miss, strike two. Two pitches later, the Mets had
completed the best 24 hours in their history.
</P>
<P>
   Since losing twice to the Yankees five weeks ago, the Mets have
put together the best record in the big leagues: 23-10 and three in
a row over the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   So put Saturday's game in a time capsule anyway as a tribute to
baseball at its best, to New York-New York baseball in particular.
All those Mets loyalists who were on their feet for Matt Franco's
single and Edgardo Alfonzo's slide were dancing as they departed
Shea, dancing to Billy Joel on the sound system singing, ``I'm in a
New York state of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   And there's another game Sunday.

THREE LAPSES IN NINTH WRECK RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ The blank stare emanating from the eyes of John
Wetteland reflected his agony.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers' closer can tolerate physical errors, but
yesterday's mental indiscretion tormented the All-Star.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland violated one of baseball's rudimentary fundamentals by
failing to cover first base on a ball hit to the right side, and
San Diego's Quilvio Veras and Damian Jackson scored _ without the
ball leaving the infield _ on the game's final play to propel the
Padres to a 5-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unacceptable mistake,'' said Wetteland, who committed
only one of the Rangers' three ninth-inning improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Rusty Greer dropped a fly ball, and third baseman
Todd Zeile accepted responsibility for a bunt coverage that went
awry during an inning in which the Rangers ``didn't do a whole lot
right,'' manager Johnny Oates said.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh-inning home runs by first baseman Rafael Palmeiro and
center fielder Ruben Mateo hurled the Rangers to a 4-3 lead over
the Padres before the defense's trifecta of torment. It began with
Greer, who dropped a fly ball off the bat of third baseman Carlos
Baerga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just missed it,'' said Greer, who attempted to catch the
ball with his glove turned up. ``There's no two ways around it. To
make a mistake like that really stinks. It's disappointing. We all
make mistakes, but you don't want to make one there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a long way to run, but I got there in plenty of time,''
said Greer, who stationed himself deep in an attempt to prevent a
potential double. ``I've made that play 100 times. It just opened
the floodgates. It changed the way John had to pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Ed Giovanola, who replaced Baerga as a pinch runner,
advanced to second on the ensuing walk to Veras, and that set the
stage for the Rangers' second gaffe.
</P>
<P>
   Padres manager Bruce Bochy instructed Jackson to attempt the
sacrifice to advance the runners, but it resulted in a bunt single
when neither Wetteland nor Zeile fielded the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Zeile returned to the bag expecting Wetteland to field the bunt
and attempt to retire Giovanola at third base. Jackson's bunt,
though, did not present Wetteland with a play, which made it the
third baseman's play, Zeile said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more my responsibility,'' Zeile said. ``It's my judgment.
I just jumped the gun.''
</P>
<P>
   That brought Reggie Sanders to the plate with the bases loaded
and no outs, but Wetteland got him on a shallow fly ball. Right
fielder Juan Gonzalez made the play and delivered a one-hop throw
to the plate to retire Giovanola, who attempted to score after
tagging at third base.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanola stopped midway down the third-base line, but Veras
also tagged from second. That forced Giovanola to attempt to score,
and it resulted in a double play. Jackson joined Veras in scoring
position with a two-out stolen base, and Eric Owens worked the
count full during the game's final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland induced the desired ground ball to the right side of
the infield, which Palmeiro stopped by lunging to the ground.
Wetteland, though, broke late toward the bag.
</P>
<P>
   Owens won the foot race for an infield single that scored Veras
from third base, and Jackson raced home from second after Wetteland
failed to control Palmeiro's throw. The ball dropped behind
Wetteland, whose momentum carried him toward first base while the
ball came to a rest on the infield grass.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I would have bounced off the mound and covered first, it's
all academic,'' Wetteland said. ``That's killing me and I'm sure
everybody else at this point. I threw it and saw it come off the
bat, and I thought, `Finally, a ground ball hit.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I turn around, and it's a lot more toward second base than I
thought. That's not an excuse. Anything hit to the right side, and
we should start toward first base. It's an unacceptable mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Wetteland's stare only reinforced his words.

COMMENTARY: NO GOALS SCORED, TWO CHAMPIONS, A BRIGHT FUTURE 
(HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Full sub for VECSEY-COLUMN)   By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Curse of the Rose Bowl struck again
Saturday. A glorious breakthrough sports tournament was decided by
the utilitarian solution of penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody won _ the United States, in fact, beating China on a
penalty kick by Brandi Chastain after a scoreless tie. The
championship is full and complete and fair. The Americans, who had
been building for this home World Cup, will always be champions of
1999, and the Chinese, who were gracious hosts for the historic
first tournament in 1991, will always be runners-up for this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know that it's necessarily fair,'' said Briana Scurry,
the American goalkeeper who punched away one penalty kick to give
the Americans the edge, 5-4, in the grim little coda to the game
itself. ``I guess it's a way of deciding who wins and loses. You
can't ask them to play anymore. But it's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   To fully appreciate Saturday's scoreless tie, you must look at
the past three weeks, go back to the Chinese criss-crossing
America, the Americans making a determined swath toward the Rose
Bowl, the Brazilians outlasting the Nigerians in a 4-3 fast-break
game on a muggy night in Maryland, and eager fans scooping up
tickets until there were no more.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday there were 90,185 fans packed into the Rose Bowl _ once
known only for American football _ making it the largest crowd to
watch a women's soccer game anywhere in the world, and presumably
the largest crowd to watch a women's sports event in history.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, never known as a soccer-loving nation, seemed
captivated by the vibrant athletes from home and around the globe,
giving hope for female athletes in the next century, the next
millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, the third Women's World Cup itself came to a rather
arbitrary end with the specter that haunts soccer tournaments
around the world. The two teams played 120 minutes without a goal,
exactly as Brazil and Italy did in the men's World Cup finale at
this hallowed football stadium, now known nearly as well for the
world's most popular sport, real football.
</P>
<P>
   That 1994 World Cup ended with Roberto Baggio, the ethereal
little star of Italy, missing a penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   This one ended with Hollywood Chastain left-footing a shot into
the upper right corner, then tearing off her jersey to reveal a
black sports bra (``momentary insanity,'' she explained later), but
she was visible only for seconds before being engulfed by her
teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The United States contained China in regulation time as the
brave and aggressive old star, the 33-year-old Michelle Akers,
dominated with her range and her will and her booming headers.
Akers, who has had how many surgeries (``I lost count'') and
suffers from chronic fatigue syndrome, went down after a collision
at the goal line at the 90th minute and had to leave the game, and
the United States barely hung on without her.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Americans are champions, and China is an emphatic
second, representing all the other continents that soon will catch
up with the United States and northern Europe in World Cups to
come. At the same time, many Americans will once again question why
championship games like this one must end on something so arbitrary
and limited as penalty kicks.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of goals is no grave crime. Soccer buffs around the
world can accept that the best two teams in the world might play
each other to a standstill. And you could look at it this way:
Penalty kicks are the very essence of the sport _ kicking the ball
past the goalkeeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two champions,'' said Tony DiCicco, the American
coach, once an accomplished goalkeeper. ``We're delighted to have
it, but they could have carried it home with them. It's not the
best way, but you can't have a replay after a game like this.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco said the world is stuck with this solution ``until some
genius comes up with a better way.''
</P>
<P>
   No geniuses here. After 120 minutes of soccer, it is not fair to
ask Sun Wen or Mia Hamm to play any longer, just as nobody could
have expected Franco Baresi of Italy or Dunga of Brazil to keep
plodding on indefinitely back in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Curse of the Rose Bowl also struck in the first game
Saturday, when Brazil beat Norway for third place after a scoreless
tie, also on the dreaded penalty kick.
</P>
<P>
   The championship game began after the normal blatant American
crudity of jet planes blasting overhead during the pre-game
``festivities'' _ plus skyrockets blasting at field level. No other
country in the world is so fascinated by military explosives
combined with sporting events. Someday, somebody will explain it to
me.
</P>
<P>
   There were also the usual traffic delays, searches, blockages
and general indignities produced by the whim of the chief
executive's deciding to take in a sporting event.
</P>
<P>
   The capriciousness of the result could not dim the celebration
on the field or in the stands. Some of the Americans have played
together all of this decade, and Akers goes all the way back to the
first national team in 1985. They have played all over the world,
they won the first championship in 1991 when it wasn't even called
the Women's World Cup, just as the Super Bowl was not the Super
Bowl the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   They won the 1996 gold medal at the Summer Olympics in front of
76,489 screaming fans in Athens, Ga., when NBC could not be
bothered showing a minute of women with muscles performing the
improvisational genius of soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday ABC showed the whole thing live from the Rose Bowl,
where once upon a time pom-poms fluttered on the sidelines and
starlets twinkled in the stands for big college football games.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday there was not a majorette in sight. Instead, 22 women
from China and the United States tore up the Rose Bowl lawn,
kicking a round ball with the side of their boots in the
championship game of the Women's World Cup, the last of this
century, but just the start of something bigger.

JERRY FALWELL HAS ADVICE ON SELECTING A SUPERINTENDENT  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARA ROSE WILLIAMS

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kansas City School Board needs a superintendent who is
spiritual, moral and a good family man, the Rev. Jerry Falwell said
Saturday during a two-day visit to the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Credentials are important,'' said Falwell, a Baptist minister
and chancellor of Liberty University in Lynchburg, Va. ``But
children should be able to look up to their leader.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the superintendent should be a good role model.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should be able to say to children, `Do as I do' and to
teach basic values,'' Falwell said.
</P>
<P>
   School board member Sandy Mayer said she ``couldn't agree more.
And if he wants to offer us some prayer, we'll take those too.''
</P>
<P>
   During a news conference Saturday, Falwell, who came to speak
today to the congregation of First Family Church, commented on
several topics, from Kansas City's search for a superintendent to
Hillary Rodham Clinton and Tinky Winky, the ``Teletubbie''
character Falwell's newspaper said was a homosexual role model.
</P>
<P>
   However, on Saturday Falwell denied having said anything about
the little purple character that carries a magical handbag.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had never even seen the Teletubbies,'' Falwell said. He said
that several Tinky Winky dolls had since been sent to him and that
he gave them to his grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell said he doesn't have time to worry about children's
television characters because he is more concerned about the torn
moral fabric of the country.
</P>
<P>
   Falwell said his message today to the congregation gathering at
Rockhurst High School would be a call to spiritual commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last generation has been a very sad one,'' Falwell said.
``With the breakdown of the family, drugs, violence and school
violence it has been a tough time for America. This country lacks
leadership, not just political but spiritual.''
</P>
<P>
   Falwell urged pastors to help families rebuild and to encourage
men to do a better job supporting their families.
</P>
<P>
   As for politics, Falwell denounced President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I would rather have Bill than Hillary,'' Falwell said. ``I
think Hillary was the real mastermind of the unacceptable and
unthinkable, like travelgate and filegate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she will win a Senate seat in New York. The
Clintons are going to find out that the American people are
thoroughly disgusted with them.''

DON'T TRADE GREER, JUST SIGN JUNIOR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sigh. How do things like this get started?
</P>
<P>
   Is it because his name isn't something like Juan, or Moose, or
Junior? Is it the freckles?
</P>
<P>
   Or is it simply because Rusty Greer is what he is _
hard-working, underpaid and unquestionably professional _ that his
name always finds itself in trade rumors at this time of the year?
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Greer for Andy Pettitte? You've got to be kidding.
</P>
<P>
   Not this Andy Pettitte. Not the one with the 5-7 record and the
5.56 earned-run average, the one whom opponents are hitting .292
against. Not the Pettitte that can't seem to stay ahead of hitters
anymore and the one who's won only nine of his past 27 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Stop me if I'm missing something here, but Pettitte's days in
New York pinstripes are clearly numbered. He is
arbitration-eligible, and the Yankees seem not to be warming to the
notion of paying an inconsistent 5-7 pitcher $7 million a season.
(He makes $5.95 million now).
</P>
<P>
   Yet, to listen to the talk-show misguided, the Rangers should
take those troubles off the Yankees' hands and, at the same time,
solve Joe Torre's left-field problems.
</P>
<P>
   That's funny. And while they're at it, maybe the Rangers can
sign Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   That's not so funny. In fact, I think Tom Hicks should put his
best man right on it. Forget the ``Sign Verbeek'' bumper stickers.
Sign Junior. Shucks, sign his dad. Sign his five-year-old kid.
</P>
<P>
   This being July, those clearly were the two most provocative
baseball rumors of last week _ Greer for Pettitte, and the chatter
about Griffey being anything but a Seattle Mariner.
</P>
<P>
   The latter surfaced while the Mariners were here last weekend,
when a scan of public records disclosed that club management was
putting a Junior squeeze on its obligations to pay cost overruns at
Safeco Field.
</P>
<P>
   They played the Griffey Card, in other words. Mariners chairman
John Ellis said in a published memo that if the city's Public
Facilities District insisted upon making the team pay for an
estimated $60 million of the $100 million in excess costs, then
don't be surprised if Junior and Alex Rodriguez aren't around after
the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   They're bluffing, some people think. As columnist Steve Kelley
of The Seattle Times put it, ``If they really wanted to scare
Seattle, they should have threatened to bring back ... Heathcliff
Slocumb.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was first approached about the veiled threat last
weekend in Arlington, Griffey was miffed that his name was again
being used as leverage. He sounded tired of it. In recent weeks, he
also has sounded tired of living at the edge of the baseball earth
_ ``Anywhere we go, it's a long flight,'' he has said _ and of
Mariners management's on-again, off-again commitment to reaching a
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Both Griffey's and Rodriguez's contracts expire at the end of
the 2000 season. It would be a stunning surprise if the Mariners
kept both.
</P>
<P>
   If pitcher Kevin Brown was worth $105 million over seven
seasons, what would an everyday future Hall of Famer such as Junior
be worth? Griffey will be 31 when he plays for his next team, and
he is destined to become baseball's first $20-million-a-season
player.
</P>
<P>
   And worth every penny, of course. In Seattle, people drive from
Alaska to watch Ken Griffey Jr. play.
</P>
<P>
   Colleague Terence Moore wrote in The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution last week that ``somebody who definitely
knows'' says that Griffey already has told Mariners officials not
to expect him back after 2000. Moore said that Junior has four
teams on his wish list.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly, Griffey is tired of not winning enough, tired of the
tedious travel to and from Seattle, and tired of not being closer
to his wife Melissa, their two kids and their home in Orlando, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, in other words, has ``Atlanta Braves'' written all over
him. But don't forget Cincinnati, where he grew up and where his
dad is a coach and possibly the next manager. The Griffeys could be
Press and Pete Maravich all over again.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rangers? As always, money talks. Hicks is not afraid to
spend some to make some. How full can a ballpark get, watching its
superstar center fielder go after Hank Aaron's home-run record?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it also doesn't hurt that Griffey is fond of Johnny
Oates, Hicks' manager.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, they're quibbling this summer over who's going to
pay for the extra trimmings on $517-million Safeco Field. In the
meantime, a bargain named Griffey could one day slip away.
</P>
<P>
   Greer-for-Pettitte? It'll never happen.
</P>
<P>
   Junior, not a Mariner? Come on down.

GEORGIA, ARIZONA GIRLS TEAMS REIGN IN AAU
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Georgia Magic coach Michael Green decided to
borrow a plan from football yesterday, and it helped his team
capture the Amateur Athletic Union 18-and-under Girls National
Basketball Championship.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few hours after being blown out, 85-59, by the Alabama
Roadrunners, the Magic pulled off a 70-66 victory over the
Roadrunners to claim the national championship at Mansfield High
School's north campus.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Green's key players had suffered injuries _ Ashley
Hesprich sustained a split chin when she slipped on a wet spot and
fell to the floor, and Nadine Morgan tore a knee ligament. Then the
Magic fell behind by more than 20 points late in the second half.
So, Green decided to forgo an attempt to rally and instead
regrouped his team for another shot at the Roadrunners in the
double-elimination tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as if someone had pulled the spirit out of us,'' Green
said. ``I made a decision to back up and punt.''
</P>
<P>
   The strategy worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was embarrassing to be beaten like we were earlier today,
but we reserved our energy and concentrated on beating them this
afternoon,'' said Mary Beth Lycett, who broke a 63-63 tie with two
baskets, including a 3-pointer, in the final 1 minute, 37 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Lycett's 3-pointer came with 24 seconds left in the game. She
called it the biggest shot of her life, and her coach agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she hit that, I knew we had the ballgame,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   Lycett finished with four 3-pointers, 14 points and grabbed
seven rebounds. Christi Thomas led Georgia with 23 points and nine
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Smith kept the Roadrunners' hopes alive with her fifth
3-point shot of the game with 12 seconds left to close the gap to
68-66. But tournament most valuable player Megan Isom sealed the
victory for Georgia with two free throws with six seconds to go.
 &LR; subheds:17-and-under Arizona Elite 77, Cedar Falls (Iowa) 73
Jessica Combs didn't have the tournament she would have liked, but
she made up for it in the final three minutes of the championship
game. Playing with four fouls, Combs scored eight of her 13 points
in the final 2:54, including going 6-for-6 at the free-throw line,
to rally Arizona Elite to the 17-and-under national title after it
had trailed the Cedar Falls Deery Tigers most of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona took the lead for the final time when Lacy Tolbert hit a
3-pointer with 45 seconds to play to make it 75-73. Kyra Melville
and Lindsey Taylor each added a free throw in the final half a
minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our motto coming in was one game, one day at a time. They
didn't want to come back and play again this afternoon,'' Arizona
coach Cassandra Yancy said after her team went through the
double-elimination tournament bracket 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   Elite used a 15-4 run to take a 60-59 lead with 7:32 left in the
game. Cedar Falls answered with a 12-6 run, however, before Arizona
had a closing run of 11-2.

LILLY USES HER HEAD IN VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ For Kristine Lilly, it was ``just a header.''
</P>
<P>
   As simple as that.
</P>
<P>
   For her American teammates, Lilly's dramatic goal-line save of a
Fan Yunjie header in the 100th minute of the Women's World Cup
final may have been the game's deciding moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the service and I watched the ball and thought I'd get a
head on it,'' Lilly said. ``It just bounced off my head and that
was that.''
</P>
<P>
   To some of her teammates, Lilly was doing a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kristine filled her role on that play,'' defender Brandi
Chastain said. ``She was where she had to be and made the play she
had to make.''
</P>
<P>
   But, to U.S. goalkeeper Brianna Scurry, Lilly's effortless play
was extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a little miracle today,'' Scurry said. ``I was like,
`Uh-oh. The ball is behind me.' I didn't know Lilly was behind me,
but I'm glad she was.''
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the play highlighted the tenacity of Team USA's
defense in a hard-fought game that ended in a 0-0 tie with China
before 90,185 who braved sweltering temperatures and high humidity.
</P>
<P>
   The game was ultimately decided on penalty kicks 5-4. The
outcome saved the reputation of a backfield that had been much
maligned leading up to the final match.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the best defensive effort we've had this
tournament,'' defender Kate Sobrero said. ``I think we played great
defensively, we gave great coverage, we had some great individual
performances.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's strategy was to get the ball to Mia Hamm and Tiffeny
Milbrett on offense and let them create opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to attack,'' head coach Tony DiCicco said. ``To
their credit, they are a very good defensive, too.''
</P>
<P>
   As the game wore on and the heat began to take its toll, the
defense realized it was time to take control, Sobrero said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't talk about it, we just knew,'' she said. ``There was
no way that some country was going to come in here and take the
World Cup away from us in our own country. That's all we thought
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in America, and if a breakdown happens (the defense was)
going to get killed for it. Winning was all we cared about.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco said he was proud of how the team pulled together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought our defensive tactics and that part of our game plan
worked very well today,'' he said. ``But, I wish there had been
some goals so the crowd could enjoy the great attacking players on
the field.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Lilly's effort: ``Well, Kristine is one of the best
players in the world. She scores goals and denies top players. . .
. Full credit to Kristine Lilly.''

JETS PLAYERS ATTACK PATRONS, INJURE POLICE IN BAR BRAWL  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two New York Jets players and a former teammate were
arrested early Saturday after a brawl in a Long Island bar in which
a man and a woman were punched and two police officers were injured
by flying glass from the shattered window of their patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police in Long Beach, most of the damage was
done by John (Jumbo) Elliott, a left tackle who was once a
contender for football's Hall of Fame, and Matthew O'Dwyer, a right
guard who recently signed a two-year, $2.7 million contract with
the Cincinnati Bengals.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, 34, was charged with assault, disorderly conduct,
public lewdness and harassment, and O'Dwyer, 26, was accused of
disorderly conduct, harassment, assault and criminal mischief, the
police said. The Jets right tackle, Jason Fabini, 24, was also
arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, but played only a
minor role in the melee, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   All three players were released on bail, with Fabini paying
$100, while Elliott posted $10,000 and O'Dwyer posted $50,000, all
in cash, the police said. The suspects were scheduled to enter
pleas to the charges Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Long Beach bars have long been popular hangouts and watering
holes for Jets players, many of whom live in the area and train at
Hofstra University in nearby Hempstead. The three suspects, all
offensive players, were apparently celebrating O'Dwyer's move to
Cincinnati, where he was scheduled to join the Bengals Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Joseph Kearnes of the Long Beach City Police Department said
the incident early Saturday at Bogart's, a restaurant and sports
bar at 124 West Park Avenue, was both ``unusual'' and
``disturbing'' in its violence. He said a fight led to a call to
the police about 12:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were all drunk and started a melee in the bar,'' he said.
``They started pushing customers around and one guy did some things
in a bathroom. They are all big guys and they got out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets roster lists all three players as 6 feet 5 inches to 6
feet 7 inches tall and weighing 300 pounds of more.
</P>
<P>
   Kearnes said the episode began when Elliott entered the bar's
women's bathroom and began to urinate in a sink, in front of a
woman. When she protested, he punched her in the chest, the police
said, then walked back into the bar, where police said he punched a
man who approached him. Patrons at the bar said that one of the
other players then threw a beer bottle at a waitress, and the third
player pushed another woman to the floor.
</P>
<P>
   After several police officers arrived, Elliott and Fabini were
taken into custody without incident but O'Dwyer became combative,
Kearnes said. In a patrol car, he kicked out the rear window,
sending glass into the eyes of two officers outside the car, the
police said. Both officers had to be taken to a hospital to have
glass surgically removed from their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   A manager reached at the bar by phone Saturday refused to
comment about the events there. Elliott could not be reached by
telephone Saturday, nor could the agents for him or the other two
players.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dwyer's father, Gerald, who was reached at his home in
Lincolnshire, Ill., defended his son, saying the charges sounded
``out of character.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to believe, because he is usually
cool-headed,'' the father said. ``He doesn't drink that much and
he's working very hard right now to stay in shape. He was leaving
tomorrow and had just sold his house in Long Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the accusation that his son kicked out the window
of a police car, the elder O'Dwyer said, ``They might have pushed
him; he can get angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Parcells, the Jets coach, could not be reached for comment
Saturday, and two of the team's spokesmen did not return calls to
their office phones. Jack Brennan, a spokesman for the Bengals,
said only that if O'Dwyer ``has a problem with the legal system, he
will have to deal with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott and Fabini have been well-regarded players for the Jets
and were two of the pivotal factors in protecting the team's
quarterback, Vinny Testaverde, during what the quarterback recently
called his ``magical season'' last year. Testaverde said the two
players had given him the best protection of his career, helping
him to lead the Jets to their first conference championship since
1983.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott has had previous problems off the field. In September,
he was fined $375 and had his driver's license suspended for 90
days after he was convicted of driving while impaired and making
unsafe lane changes on the Long Island Expressway in Nassau County,
not far from where he lives.
</P>
<P>
   O'Dwyer, who has often been seen partying at Manhattan
nightspots, was also instrumental in the Jets' success. A weight
lifter who can bench-press 465 pounds, he was known as both the
strongest player on the Jets offensive line and a source of
penalties for his team because of a tendency to hit opposing
players after the whistle had blown. ``I've always been taught to
finish the play,'' he answered when once asked about that tendency
by a reporter. But he was recently praised by Parcells as the
player he most admired for reining in his temper.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending July 3 at
almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000 other
retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all such

changes in book buying.

   &UR; STARTING OUT IN THE EVENING &LR;  By Brian Morton. Berkley, $12.95.
Leonard Schiller is an out-of-print novelist in his 70s whose
intensely ordered life is shaken by the arrival of a young woman
who wants to write a master's thesis on his work. Last year in The
New York Times Book Review, William H. Pritchard called this a sad
novel that nonetheless ``works toward affirming and enhancing life
.... As a piece of writing, it's nothing less than a triumph.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COLD NEW WORLD: GROWING UP IN A HARDER COUNTRY &LR;  By William
Finnegan. Modern Library, $14.95. These four bleak portraits of
young people left behind by America's bustling economy explore how
and why they came to be drawn into lives ruled by drugs, crime,
gangs and extremism. ``The cumulative effect is to create an
unusual kind of sympathy,'' Jack Hitt wrote last year. ``Finnegan
convincingly connects the wayward events in these people's lives to
the messages and forces they detect around them.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A HOPE IN THE UNSEEN: AN AMERICAN ODYSSEY FROM THE INNER CITY
TO THE IVY LEAGUE &LR; , by Ron Suskind (Broadway, $13), is a more
optimistic dispatch, based on a Pulitzer Prize-winning series in
The Wall Street Journal, that chronicles the struggle of a poor
black teen-ager to lift himself from his blighted Washington high
school into Brown University. In 1998 the reviewer Sara Mosle
called this an ``extraordinary, formula-shattering book.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SOME TAME GAZELLE &LR;  By Barbara Pym. Moyer Bell, $11.95. The
author's first novel, originally published in Britain in 1950, is
about two middle-aged sisters living in an English village: One is
hopelessly in love with the local vicar; the other has a thing for
young curates. In 1983 Michael Gorra, reviewing the first American
edition, said the story ``has all the quiet skill, the tough,
reasonable wit and ... the calm integrity of Pym's best work.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GENUINE REALITY: A LIFE OF WILLIAM JAMES &LR;  By Linda Simon.
University of Chicago, $18. This biography of America's most famous
philosopher (and the brother of Henry James) reveals how his ideas
were linked to his own experiences, including his troubled
relationship with his father, and how he spent a lifetime coping
with severe depression. The author ``vivifies William James in such
a way that his life and thought come freshly alive for the modern
reader,'' David S. Reynolds wrote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; ALICE JAMES: A BIOGRAPHY &LR; , by Jean Strouse (Harvard
University, $18.95), the youngest of the James siblings is shown to
have been a formidable figure in her own right: Even though
mysterious illnesses rendered her an invalid for most of her life,
she was a gifted, enigmatic woman whose intellectual powers
intensified over time. In 1980 the reviewer Diane Johnson called
this a ``judicious and beautifully written biography.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; LOVES THAT BIND &LR;  By Julian Rios. Vintage International, $12.
The narrator of this Spanish novel recounts his amorous exploits in
a series of letters addressed to an unnamed lover who has abandoned
him in London. Last year the reviewer Abigail Lee Six admired the
author's ``virtuoso use of language: multilingual puns, neologisms
galore, dazzling networks of extended metaphor.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WILL THIS DO? THE FIRST FIFTY YEARS OF AUBERON WAUGH: AN
AUTOBIOGRAPHY &LR;  Carroll &AMP; Graf, $13.95. The son of Evelyn Waugh
recalls life with father, who not surprisingly was exasperating and
extremely hard to please, as well as the rest of his childhood and
his own literary travails. The result is ``a modest but
terrifically entertaining book that's funny, acerbic and a little
sad,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote in The New York Times in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE LONG FALLING &LR;  By Keith Ridgway. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin,
$13. The murder of an abusive husband by his long-suffering wife in
rural Ireland is portrayed as an understandable act that raises a
disturbing question: Is the taking of another's life ever
justifiable? Last year the reviewer Rosemary Mahoney called this
first novel skillfully drawn and ``at times excruciatingly
suspenseful.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HULLABALOO IN THE GUAVA ORCHARD &LR;  By Kiran Desai.
Anchor/Doubleday, $12.95. In this opulent Indian novel, a young man
climbs a guava tree to escape his fellow humans and finds himself
revered as a prophet by both the local villagers and the local
monkeys. ``It's a parable, an allegory, a bittersweet reminder of
the chaos of India,'' Zia Jaffrey wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ABOUT THIS LIFE: JOURNEYS ON THE THRESHOLD OF MEMORY &LR;  By Barry
Lopez. Vintage, $13. These essays cover a lot of geographic and
imaginative territory, from Hokkaido and Antarctica to the author's
childhood and the subject of air freight, but at their core is a
fascination with the role of landscape in one's life. ``Lyrical
prose is Lopez's trademark,'' Sara Wheeler wrote in 1998. ``I
enjoyed this rich book hugely.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TRANSLATOR &LR;  By Ward Just. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $14.
The hero of this novel is an expatriate German in Paris who can't
shake his past _ and his memories of World War II _ when he's
called on to help an old friend at the end of the Cold War. ``Just
plots his ironies with a diabolical cunning and patient
thoroughness that make them seem inevitable,'' George Stade wrote
last year.
