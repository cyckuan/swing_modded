JOHANNESBURG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's ruling
African National Congress (ANC) Saturday called on the African
people to strive for their full emancipation.
</P>
<P>
Africans have stood by as the rest of the world moved forward
"while we regressed towards becoming a historical curiosity," ANC
said in a statement released at its 88th anniversary celebrations
in Thohoyandou in the Northern Province.

<P>
Much work remained to be don  The ANC attributed corruption, tyrannical regimes, poverty and
disease to the fact that the people of Africa have not been fully
emancipated yet.
</P>
<P>
Corruption in government and the private sector should be
tackled on a sustained basis to ensure that the corruption
inherited from the apartheid system did not become entrenched in
South Africa's demotions to enrich
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"We must intensify the struggle to ensure that by the end of
the year 2000, all countries on our continent are at peace and
that none of our countries is ruled by a military regime," the

<HEADLINE> 40 More Detained for Questioning in Religious Rioting in Upper Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Forty more people have been
detained for questioning over recent clashes between Coptic
Christians and Muslims in a southern Egyptian village which have
claimed 20 lives.  Twelve people were detained in Kosheh, where
at least 19 Coptic Christians and one Muslim were killed in the
religious violence on January 2, and 28 others were taken in
custody in neighboring Dar es-Salam, according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that 41 people in Kosheh of Suhag
Governorate, 400 kilometers south of Cairo, had already been
detained for questioning.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry said last Thursday that two Muslims from
Kosheh had been arrested for allegedly murdering eight Copts, and
another two were arrested for the alleged murder of another Copt.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a reconciliatory committee, led by Suhag Governor
Abdel Aziz Bakr, has been working to restore stability to the riot-
torn village, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The governor has pledged to cooperate with the police and the
judiciary in the investigation and to punish those responsible for
the incidents. He also offered compensations to shop owners whose
property was looted or burned by the rioters.
</P>
<P>
A quarrel over money between merchants Rashed Fahim Mansur, a
Coptic Christian, and Fayez Awad Hassan, a Muslim triggered the
worst religious rioting in Egypt in 20 years, in which 33 others
were also injured and properties destroyed.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Manufacturing Sector Output Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Output in Zimbabwe's
manufacturing sector declined by about 10 percent in the first
nine months of 1999 because of weakening demand, high interest
rates and rising costs of imported inputs, according to the
Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The sector's contribution to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP),
which averaged 18 percent during the period 1990-1998 and peaked
at 20.5 percent in 1990, has been on a gradual decline.
</P>
<P>
In its latest economic highlights released here on Saturday,
the central bank noted that the sector had the potential to steer
the economy towards a sustainable growth path despite the current
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"The sector's growth potential can, however, be revived by the
restoration of sound macro-economic arrangements," said the bank.
</P>
<P>
Negative trends affecting the sector require bold and decisive
action to stem widespread de-industrialization and enable
manufacturers to play an important role in the development of
Zimbabwe, it said.
</P>
<P>
It said: "To strengthen the sector, as a major contributor to
foreign exchange earnings and to economic growth, the
introduction of incentives to benefit all manufacturers is
necessary."
</P>
<P>
"Such incentives would enable the sector to counter the
negative effects of current macro-economic instability," the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector has strong linkages with agriculture,
 particularly in sub-sectors such as food, drink and tobacco,
textiles and ginning, clothing and footwear, wood and furniture
and paper and printing.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign Minister
Seyoum Mesfin said here Saturday that the Ethiopian government is
always committed to peace and does not need a push for peace.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum made the remarks  The Ethiopian foreign minister pointed out that the U.S.
Republican had misrepresented the facts about the OAU peace
process.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia has not rejected the OAU peace plan. Ethiopia has
accepted the OAU framework agreement and the modalities," Seyoum
noted.
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that Ethiopia has problem with "the
technical arrangements which failed to be consistent with the two
basic documents -- the framework agreement and the modalities."
</P>
<P>
"The technical arrangements, as far as Ethiopia is concerned,
amounts to appeasement," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Ethiopia cannot countenance the appeasement of aggression at
the expense of its sovereignty and dignity as a nation," Seyoum
said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister reiterated that the return to the status
quo ante is Ethiopia's bottom line, noting it is a principle which
is not in the interest of Ethiopia, but it is in the interest of
all.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum said ,"it is unthinkable for Ethiopia to compromise its
national interest in order to make third parties happy."
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia and Eritrea have been at war since May 1998. The OAU
has been taking the lead to seek a peaceful solution to the
Ethio-Eritrean conflict.

sacking all presidential advisers and consultants with no regular
functions in a bid to improve the government's popularity.
</P>
<P>
In his televised "Report to the Nation," Estrada said that the
cabinet revamp was in response to the call from the people, as
conveyed to him in the results of recent surveys, particularly on
the popularity rating of the members of his official family.
</P>
<P>
"My gift to our people is this: in the new millennium, I give
you a new and honest government. This is also what I have heard (

TEHRAN -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on
Saturday called on both the moderate and conservative authorities
to solve their disputes over the forthcoming Majlis (parliamentary)
elections slated for February 18.
</P>
<P>
"In case of any differences of opinion between the Interior
Ministry as the executive body and the Guardians Council as the
supervisory body of the elections, they should solve them among
themselves," Khamenei said at the prayers congregation to mark the
end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark after moderate leaders voiced deep concern
over the moves of the powerful conservatives, who dominate most of
the country's state organs, to bar prominent reformists from
running in the parliamentary polling through screening
qualifications of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to reformist President Mohammad Khatami last
week, more than 30 moderate leaders called on him to ensure the
fairness of the coming elections, which would determine the new
power balance between the hard-liners and reformists. (Iran-

<HEADLINE> Zambia Refutes Report of Supporting Angolan Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Saturday denied the
reported massing of troops along its common border with Angola in
order to fight alongside the Angolan rebels.
</P>
<P>
Chief government spokesman Newstead Zimba dismissed the report
as "false, baseless and malicious".
</P>
<P>
Zimba said in a statement that his country has never
compromised its neutral stand regarding the conflict in Angola,
adding that Zambia has never and will never support the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in the
on-going civil war.
</P>
<P>
South African Broadcasting Corporation Friday reported that
Zambia has stationed its troops on the border and that the Angola
government is preparing to attack Zambia in retaliation for the
country's alleged support for UNITA.
</P>
<P>
It has been a cornerstone of Zambia's foreign policy to help
resolve conflicts in the region through political means, hence,
the country has continued respect and adherence to the United
Nations Security Council resolutions on sanctions against UNITA,
said Zimba.
</P>
<P>
Zimba said the civil war in Angola has had a negative effect on
the security, stability and economic development of Zambia, adding
that it would be "inconceivable" that Zambia could engage in
activities that are detrimental to the interests of Angola and the
region.
</P>
<P>
One year ago Angola accused Zambia of providing military and
logistic support to UNITA, but Zambia strongly denied the charge
and the bilateral relations soured.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the mediation by the Organization of African
Unity and the Southern African Development Community, the
relations have improved since mid-1999.

<HEADLINE> China's First Private Fossil Museum Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China's first private fossil
museum, the "Wenya Museum" opened this morning in the city of
Jinzhou in the northeast province of Liaoning.
</P>
<P>
The three-story museum exhibits several hundred samples of
reptile, bird, amphibian, insect and plant fossils owned by Mr. Du
Wenya, a private collector.
</P>
<P>
The most precious among those samples are a bird fossil which
archeologists believe to be older than the archaeopteryx, and a
nine meter high fossil dating back some 120 million years.
</P>
<P>
Most of the samples originated from Jurassic Period, about 140
million years ago. Some of them come from the United Kingdom and
the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Du has invested his lifetime savings and a bank loan in the
Museum, totaling ten million yuan(1.2 million U.S. dollars "I have
never thought about the economic returns," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government encourages private museums which are not
profit-oriented, said Ma Zishu, deputy director of the State
Administration of Cultural Heritage.
</P>
<P>
Ma also believes that the establishment of Wenya Museum will
help promote scientific knowledge among China's youth.

<P>
In addition, China plans to develop an annual gas output of 100
billion cu m by the year 2020, equivalent to 100 million tons of
crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that China's proven natural gas reserves will
increase by an annual average of 120 billion cu m between 2001 and
2020, with gas accounting for 8 percent of China's energy
consumption, as against the present 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
China has started a nationwide gas pipeline construction in a
bid to speed up gas development and utilization.
</P>
<P>
Priority will be given to laying gas pipelines extending from
major gas production bases of the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia region,
Sichuan province and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, to
developed areas in the north and northeastern parts of China, as
well as to the Yangtze River and Zhujiang River deltas.
</P>
<P>
A senior Chinese oil official said that the increasing
globalization of the world's economy and fast development of
science and technology will see oil markets around the world
expanding and competition becoming acute. China will work hard to
tap its oil and gas resources.

<HEADLINE> China Reaches Goal of Zero Growth in Fishing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Latest statistics issued from
the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture shows that the output of China
's marine fishing dropped 0.17 percent to 33.48 million tons by
the end of November last year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1998, the Ministry first announced the plan of "
zero growth" for fishing in 1999 to protect fishing resources and
the environment.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry's Fishery Bureau took a series of measures to
limit the extent of fishing and the number of fishing ships.
Meanwhile, the Ministry is helping fishermen to turn to sea and
fresh water aquatic breeding and helping them to engage in other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 fishing ban imposed by the Bureau along China's coasts
has produced remarkable social, ecological and economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jian, director of the Bureau, said at the National Work
Conference on Agriculture that China will continue to implement "
zero growth" for 2000 based on 1999's figures as well as the
fishing ban.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the Bureau will strictly control the number of
fishing ships entering coastal waters and will not approve of the
building and importing of such vessels.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China will see strong growth in
oil production in the new century, with natural gas production
entering its peak developmental stage, said a senior official in
charge of China's energy development.
</P>
<P>
China produced more than 160 million tons of crude oil in 1999,
making the country the world's fifth largest oil producer for 13
consecutive years, said Chen Geng, deputy-director of the State
Petroleum and Chemical Administration.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar on China's Petroleum Development Strategy
in the 21st Century, the official said that China has very rich
oil and gas resources, adding that by the end of last year, oil
resources were 20.3 billion tons while gas resources were 2.2
trillion cu.m.
</P>
<P>
China has enormous potential for oil and gas development. A
China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) spokesman said that China is
set to develop a number of large oil and gas fields to increase
its annual oil and gas output equivalent to 300 million tons by
2010. These oil and gas fields will be located in the Songliao
Basin in the northeast, around the Bohai Sea, in the west and
northwest.

<HEADLINE> Headway in Curbing China's Worsening Environmental Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China said today it had made
initial success in its nationwide efforts to curb the worsening
environmental pollution, which has reached an alarming level after
the rapid industrialization in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua,director of the State Environmental Protection
Administration (SEPA), told a national conference on environmental
protection that pollution situation on national scale has stopped
worsening for the first time in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
By the end of November, 1999, the total volumes of 12
pollutants discharged into the air, waters and land across China,
except solid industrial wastes, were well below the ceiling levels
for 1999 set by the central government, the director said.
</P>
<P>
The pollution situation in some cities and industrial areas has
improved as a result of pollution control efforts jointly made by
governments at all levels, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tough measures have been taken in China's major polluted
regions during the past three years, including closure of tens of
thousands of small polluting factories and mines across the
country that failed to meet the State pollutants discharge
requirements.
</P>
<P>
The regions include Huaihe River Basin, home to about 100
million people, Haihe River Basin in north China, Liaohe River
Basin in northeast China, and Dianchi lake in southwest Yunnan
Province, Taihu Lake and Chaohu Lake in east China.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, one of the world's top 10 cities facing serious air
pollution, has made initial progress in pollution control,
particularly in air pollution, after it was singled out by the
Chinese Government two years ago to cut air pollution.
</P>
<P>
"Fiscal expenditure in pollution control projects in 1999 is
estimated at about one percent of China's gross domestic product (
GDP)", he said.
</P>
<P>
China has also closed down 53 small polluting coal-powered
stations, and 6,400 mines, which are capable of producing 26
million tons of coal with high sulphur content each year, in its
campaign to control sulphur dioxide and acid rain in 175
prefectures and cities.
</P>
<P>
And eight provinces in China has begun to limit the consumption
of coal with high sulphur content.
</P>
<P>
All those measures have helped cut annual emission of sulphur
dioxide by 800,000 tons, the sulphur dioxide content in the air
over 47 cities have met the State environmental protection
requirements.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress, more needs to be done, Xie warned.
</P>
<P>
"In some regions, the pollution situation is still worsening,
and the total volume of pollutants discharged from household and
farming is on the rise, while the total volume of industrial waste
discharge is stabilizing or falling," Xie said.
</P>
<P>
"And construction of waste water treatment plants in urban
areas is far from satisfactory," he said, referring to the
situation that in many urban and rural areas much of waste water
is discharged untreated into rivers, lakes or seas due to a lack
of waste water treatment facilities.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Keeps Eye Open on Foreign Markets: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Finance Minister
Daim Zainuddin Saturday expected his country's economy to improve
further this year as compared to last year, but said the
government would always be cautious of the economic developments
in other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, the economy was better than we had expected. We
hope it will further improve this year," he told reporters at the
Hari Raya (Festival Day) open house of Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad at his official residence in Putrajaya near here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The government is monitoring the economic situation and the
performance of foreign markets, particularly of the United States
and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, there seemed to be not much problems but we
must keep tab of what's happening in the United States and Japan.
We cannot predict what will happen in foreign countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is able to face whatever happens in foreign countries,
the minister said, adding what's important is the people must be
united and work hard.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economy, after a lower contraction of 1.3 percent in
the first quarter of last year, grew by 4.1 percent in the second
quarter for the first time since the financial crisis struck in
July 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanded by 8.1 percent
between July and September last year, paving the way for further
improvement for the last quarter of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The Rating Agency of Malaysia (RAM) recently predicted that
Malaysia's GDP growth for the whole of 1999 would be 4.6 percent
against the government's forecast of 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Ram also forecast that the Malaysian economy would grow by 6.1
percent in 2000 against a 5.0 percent growth predicted by the
Treasury.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Opposition Urged to Shun Confrontation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"On this auspicious night of the holy Eid-ul-Fitr, I appeal to
all to shun the path of Hartal (destructive strike), confrontation,
terrorism, bloodshed, agitation and poll-boycott and resolve all
issues amicably," the prime minister said when addressing the
nation over Bangladesh Television Friday evening on the eve of the
holy Eid.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also made a call to work together to carry
forward the pace of development of democracy to the new millennium
for"bringing smiles on the faces of common people of the country."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the holy Eid appears at a moment when
the country is being swept by a severe cold wave causing untold
sufferings to the poor people and her government distributed
blankets and other winter clothes among the needy people.
</P>
<P>
She called upon the whole society to extend their helping hands
to the cold-hit and other poor and distressed people of the
country for ameliorating their sufferings.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister regretted that even in this sacred
month of Ramadan, the opposition alliance tried to disrupt normal
life by calling hartals. It punched a savage blow to the business
transactions of the traders and caused untold sufferings to the
common people, she said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Parliament Objects Plan to Increase Fuel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's National Assembly will
not support the government's plan to raise fuel prices, Chairman
of Senate Committee on Labor and Productivity Shettima Mustapha
has said.
</P>
<P>
Mustapha made the remarks on Friday in capital Abuja in
reaction to the government's insistence on the deregulation of the
prices of petroleum products, the Guardian newspaper reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said the statement made by President Olusegun Obasanjo on
deregulation and hike in fuel prices is not a law. The budget for
the year 2000 is yet to be deliberated by the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"I am sure that the Senate would not support increase in fuel
prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he appealed to the Nigerian Labor Congress (NLC) and other
union members to repose confidence in the Senate and shelve any
plan for strikes on the matter.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo announced at the end of last year that his government
would deregulate oil price to reduce government's huge expenditure
on subsidy and fight oil smuggling.
</P>
<P>
The president said Nigeria, Africa's biggest oil producing
country, is losing about 1.7 billion U.S. dollars annually for
retaining the current oil price.
</P>
<P>
"If we do not increase the price of fuel, it becomes much more
lower than what our neighbors sell at. This will lead to a lot of
smuggling of our products", Obasanjo explained.

Pakistan sponsored the hijacking of an Indian Airlines jet, said

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Reduce Grain Acreage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China will reduce its grain
acreage this year by about three million hectares to 110 million
hectares, said Liu Jian, vice-minister of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to reduce its acreage of early rice and
winter and spring wheat as well as corn, while increasing the
quality of rice and corn and beans in the northeast.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important step in further restructuring the
production mix and improving the quality of crops," Liu said on
the last day of the National Work Conference on Agriculture. The
acreage of cotton, sugar-bearing crops and tobacco will also be
reduced. This year, cotton acreage will drop about 300,000
hectares to 3.3 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
Since last year, China has adopted a series of measures to
control the acreage of grain, cotton and sugar-bearing crops and
other staple crops. The measures have produced good results, said
Liu.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has set the goals for China's agriculture and
rural economy in 2000, including 490 million tons of grain, 3.2
million tons of cotton, 60 million tons of meat and a four-percent
increase for farmers' net income.

<HEADLINE> HK Chief Executive Confident About Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR), on Saturday
expressed his confidence about the SAR's sustainable economic
growth in 2000 and promised that the government will work hard to
reduce the unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
In a radio phone-in program, Tung said Hong Kong's economy has
been recovering very well with a 4.5 percent growth registered in
the third quarter of 1999, and the fourth quarter looking also
promising.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Hong Kong is experiencing another economic
transformation as the result of the economic globalization as well
as the changes brought about by high technology, especially
information technology.
</P>
<P>
The development of other cities in terms of infrastructure and
human resources has also put Hong Kong under challenges and
pressures, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he is pleased that Hong Kong retains its advantages
in finance, tourism, shipping and air transportation after the
Asian financial crisis, and many transnational corporations still
base their regional headquarters in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will benefit from China's entry in the World Trade
Organization, he believed, adding that the Hong Kong-Walt Disney
deal to establish a theme park and the innovative technology will
surely help boost tourism and the economic transformation of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken control of the general situation, although the
economy is undergoing the transformation. I'm very optimistic
about the future," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the 230,000 unemployed people in Hong Kong, Tung
said the government has the responsibility to offer them education
and training courses to help them find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, he said, the government must create a
favorable business environment to help the economic recovery, thus
increasing employment rate.

<HEADLINE> China to Face Challenges From Joining WTO (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- China is going to encounter
numerous challenges once it becomes a WTO member such as
attracting talents, trying to keep a number of businesses open and
controlling the unemployment rate, said Li Yining a renowned
professor of economics in Beijing University and member of China'
s lawmaking body the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
"We should start to reconsider present laws in terms of
attracting talents and supporting domestic private firms," Li said
at the "Symposium on WTO and China's Legal Profession" which began
here today.
</P>
<P>
"Opportunities and challenges will emerge, but we must make the
most of every opportunity," Li told a group of 600 lawyers.
</P>
<P>
China has signed an agreement with the United States on China's
accession to the WTO. The European Union is working closely with
China's bid to become a WTO member. It is widely expected that
China will soon become a formal member of the organization.
</P>
<P>
After China joins the WTO, more foreign companies will come to
China luring local expertise with handsome salaries, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Chinese companies will give stock rights to their much wanted
technical workers because they could not afford too much pay
rises, Li said.
</P>
<P>
These changes will require amendments to the existing Corporate
Laws and the formulation of new laws governing firms that are not
floated for public purchase, Li added.

<P>
To prepare domestic firms for China's entry into the WTO, Li
also called for the government to open wider its domestic
industries such as telecommunications and banking to domestic
companies, before they are opened to foreign firms.
</P>
<P>
China should turn its personal bank savings into investment.
According to Li this will greatly help the growth of private and
state-owned Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Li also predicts that unemployment will rise after China's
entry into the WTO, because more agricultural workers will be
forced to move to cities in search of work while more urban
workers are expected to be laid off.
</P>
<P>
The most effective channel to absorb manpower is to develop the
non-public sector, Li said, noting that there are already laws to
stimulate their growth for 2000, but follow-up measures in bank
loans and eliminating unfair taxation laws must be made as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
Government officials, scholars and lawyers all expressed
optimism in today's meeting over the long term prospect of China's
entry to the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"More than 90 percent of China's trade partners are its members.
China's entry would dismantle trade tariffs and be good for
everyone concerned," said Zhang Yuqing, an official with the
Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In the not so distant future, foreign firms will not be a
threat to Chinese firms because market potentials will still be
enormous, according to Yu Ning, vice-president of the All-China
Association of Lawyers.

<HEADLINE> mee0108 hke -- Barak, Arafat Discuss Israeli-Palestinian Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 8 (Xinhua)-- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
on Saturday urged Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak not to forget
the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks while Israel conducting
peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made this call in a telephone conversation with Barak,
who is in the Shepherdstown, West Virginia, the United States, for
holding peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
"Arafat called Barak Saturday morning and informed him not to
forget the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks and urged Barak
to take measures to move the Israeli-Palestinian track forward," a
senior Palestinian official said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders discussed in detail about the peace process, and
Arafat stressed the importance for moving both the Israeli-
Palestinian and Israeli-Syrian tracks forward, the official added.
</P>
<P>
In their conversation, the two leaders also exchanged views on
Israel's troop redeployment in the West Bank, and Barak promised
that Israel will implement the signed agreements with the
Palestinians regarding the transfer of more West Bank territories
to the Palestinians, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed its second troop redeployment Friday and handed
over 5 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under the newly signed Sharm El Sheikh peace deal, Israel has to
hand over another 6.1 percent of the West Bank to the Palestinians
by January 20.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also agreed to meet again after the planned
meeting in Washington between U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli and the Syrian negotiating teams started their
second round of talks at Shepherdstown earlier this week and both
sides are studying the "working document" presented to them Friday
by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The document provides a summary of the issues to be decided and
it is designed as a procedural tool to focus the substantive
discussions and to help solve the differences that now exist,
according to White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.

<HEADLINE> mee010804 hke -- Iranian Supreme Leader Urges Settlement of Disputes Over Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei on Saturday called on both the moderate and
conservative authorities to solve their disputes over the
forthcoming Majlis (parliamentary) elections slated for February
18.
</P>
<P>
"In case of any differences of opinion between the Interior
Ministry as the executive body and the Guardians Council as the
supervisory body of the elections, they should solve them among
themselves," Khamenei said at the prayers congregation to mark the
end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark after moderate leaders voiced deep concern
over the moves of the powerful conservatives, who dominate most of
the country's state organs, to bar prominent reformists from
running in the parliamentary polling through screening
qualifications of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter to reformist President Mohammad Khatami last
week, more than 30 moderate leaders called on him to ensure the
fairness of the coming elections, which would determine the new
power balance between the hard-liners and reformists.
</P>
<P>
"You should give warnings to all election officials to abide by
the law, in order to prevent any tensions or riots," the letter
said.
</P>
<P>
Local dailies reported that the conservative Guardian Council,
which is empowered to supervise elections, has tightened the
screening process with more strict conditions, such as
participation in pro-Islamic demonstrations and mass Friday
prayers.
</P>
<P>
The executive boards for election matters assigned by the
moderates-controlled Interior Ministry have allowed 6,459
candidates out of 6,860 applicants to run for the February
parliament elections, the sixth one since the Islamic revolution in
1979. 
</P>
<P>
The number of candidates might decline after the supervisory
boards assigned by the Guardians Council review the qualification
of candidates.
</P>
<P>
Khamenei said that all people are obligated to act "in
accordance with the laws and regulations endorsed by Majlis and the
Guardians Council."
</P>
<P>
He condemned any attempt to bring certain charges against the
legal authorities invested with the management of elections.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives expect to maintain their majority in the
Majlis while the moderates hope to grasp more seats in the
legislative body so as to pave the way for the political reforms
advocated by Khatami.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Saturday that he is now leaving it to the
Congress to continue the process of pursuing economic reforms
through charter changes.
</P>
<P>
In his "Report to the Nation" address here, Estrada said that
his commitment to putting in place urgent economic reforms via
charter changes "has not in any way diminished" and that his
support for it remains strong.
</P>
<P>
But with he completion of the work of the Preparatory
Commission on Constitutional Reforms, Estrada said that he has
accomplished much of what he has intended to do about charter
changes, such as allowing foreigners to purchase land and own
majority shares in the Philippine industries.
</P>
<P>
"My passion for seeing these amendments through has not cooled.
But it is a conviction and a passion that must for the moment
yield to more urgent, short-term concerns; to efforts that are
more likely to produce results in less time and at less cost to
national unity," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, for the moment, and in response to clear signals
from the people, my government is redirecting its efforts at
getting priority legislation passed and urgent programs
implemented," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Estrada expressed confidence that a brighter
future lies ahead for Filipinos this year as shown by a fast-
recovering and strengthening economy.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country's gross national product grew by 3
percent in the first three quarters last year, and for the whole
year, the economy maintained a single-digit inflation rate of 6.6
percent, and exports increased by 19 percent compared with 1998.

<HEADLINE> Capriati Beats Hingis to Win HK Women Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Former American Olympic
champion Jennifer Capriati outpowered world top player Martina
Hingis of Switzland in full sets here Saturday to win the Hong
Kong Millennium Cup women's tennis tournament.

<P>
World ranked 23 Capriati beat Hingis, top seed of the four-day
exhibition tournament, 7-6 (7-4), 4-6 and 6-3 in 1 hour and 55
minutes.
</P>
<P>
"I am quiet happy to beat world top player today, I hope I can
beat number one player in the coming grand slams and other
tournaments, " said Capriati.
</P>
<P>
"I regained some of my strengh from the victory, " said
Capriati, who had been world top ten in four straight years in the
past early ninties.
</P>
<P>
Coming to the Hong Kong tournament to prepare for the coming
Australian Open, the 23-year-old American came back with her
powerful ground strokes and returns to win five games in a row in
the first set and finally took the decider and the set 7-4 in

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Political Motivation behind U.S.-Iran Soccer Match </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 8 (Xinhua) -- President of the Iranian Soccer
Federation Mohsen Safaee Farahani on Friday denied any political
agenda involved in the forthcoming soccer match between the
Iranian and U.S. national teams, the Islamic Republic News Agency
(IRNA) reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an exclusive interview with IRNA in Oakland, the
United States, Farahani said that accepting the U.S. soccer
invitation by the Iranian soccer authorities was merely aimed at
promoting soccer in the two countries
</P>
<P>
The current triple match tournament (attended by U.S., Iran and
Mexico) is to promote the Iranian team's capabilities and to
prepare them for Asian championships and eventually World Cup 2002,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian soccer official said Iran's national team visited
Canada six months ago to face Canada, Guatemala and Ecuador and
the current trip to the U.S. is a continuation of the plan.
</P>
<P>
However, the ground-breaking visit of Iranian national soccer
team to the United States since the 1979 Islamic revolution was
seen by public opinion as a "soccer diplomacy" between the two
countries to pave the way for better relations in the future.
</P>
<P>
The hostilities between Iran and Washington have been cooled
down following their "wrestling diplomacy," which was kicked off
in January, 1998 after the moderate Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami called for exchanges between Iranian and American
nationals to break down the "high wall of distrust" between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
Head of the U.S. Soccer Federation Bob Cantigo Golia on Tuesday
also denied any political motivation behind the U.S.-Iran match,
saying that the U.S. soccer team views the game as an opportunity
to win.
</P>
<P>
Golia told IRNA that the reason for having arranged such a
match was upgrading of sportsmanship and the reason that U.S.
soccer team has chosen Iran in the preparatory games is because
Iranian national soccer team played well in the 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the acceptance of Iranian teams in the United
States, Farahani said that the U.S. authorities have so far met
conditions agreed upon and the 30-men Iranian delegation has not
faced any problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iranian players are in good shape and pre-
scheduled training and exercises programs have been met.
</P>
<P>
According to the schedule, the Iranian team will face Mexican
national team at the Oakland stadium on Monday and then face the
Ecuadorian national team in Los Angeles on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
It will finally play against the U.S. national team at the Rose
Ball stadium in Pasadena on January 17.

<HEADLINE> mee010802 hke -- Turkey Plans to Speed up Pipeline Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government has
submitted to the Grand National Assembly (parliament) a bill for
restructuring the Energy Ministry in a bid to accelerate a major
oil and gas pipeline scheme, reported Turkish Daily News on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The bill outlines plans to establish a transit pipeline
authority, under which a pipeline department and a transit oil
pipeline board will be supervising the working schedule of the
Baku-Ceyhan pipeline scheme, which was designed to transport
Caspian energy resources to the world market via Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, Georgia and Azerbaijan signed an agreement in Istanbul
last November to establish a 1,730-kilometer pipeline running from
Baku, Azerbaijan, to Ceyhan, Turkey. The 2.4-billion-U.S. dollar
project is expected to be completed in the year 2004.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline-related issues are currently managed by a variety
of public institutions. Once the authority is set up, said the
bill, oil companies, the Azerbaijani government and the pipeline
operating firm will find a proper authority to address.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline department will be authorized to monitor
international arbitration cases and pipeline insuring transactions.
</P>
<P>
The pipeline board will be in charge of helping the government
design strategies and policies to protect national interests.
</P>
<P>
To meet its rising demand for oil and natural gas, Turkey will
have to import huge volumes of oil and gas form the oil- and gas-
rich Caspian states.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Australia's Acceptance of Kalejs Sparks Criticism By Qi Zijian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Australia's acceptance of
alleged Nazi war criminal Konrad Kalejs has sparked strong
protests and criticism.
</P>
<P>
Kalejs, an 86-year-old Latvian who took Australian citizenship
in 1957, was accused of being an officer in a World War II death
squad responsible for killing 30,000 civilians in Latvia
</P>
<P>
He flew into Melbourne, the Victoria state, Friday night after
being thrown out of Britain.
</P>
<P>
People rallied at the Melbourne airport to protest against
Australia's acceptance of Kalejs.
</P>
<P>
The country's federal Opposition and the Jewish groups have
united in their calls for stringent investigations into Kalejs's
war record, spurred by the revelation that past scrutinies were
not exhaustive.
</P>
<P>
The Opposition called on the government to "find the political
will" to urge the federal police to reopen their inquiry into
Kalejs.
</P>
<P>
"They've got to do more than just welcome Mr. Kalejs back,"
said the acting Opposition leader Simon Crean. "There is now new
evidence came to light, since the war crimes unit was wound up."
</P>
<P>
The Opposition also wanted Prime Minister John Howard to take
direct responsibility for a fresh investigation into the Latvian-
born Australian citizen.
</P>
<P>
Federal labor MP Michael Danby, who has been leading the
Opposition's protests against Kalejs, said Howard should assume
control of the matter.
</P>
<P>
At the very least, Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone should
request that Australian federal police investigate new evidence
against Kalejs and see if he could face criminal trial in
Australia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jewish student leaders in Melbourne said on Friday night they
wanted "justice" for the 30,000 murdered Latvian civilians, who
were primarily Jews, and the 6 million "brothers and sisters" who
were killed in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
"We have come here today to send an unequivocal message to our
federal government," said Australian Union of Jewish Students
spokesman Lior Harel.
</P>
<P>
The community would not welcome to Australia a man awarded a
service medallion by the SS (Nazi shock troops and concentration
camp guards), he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the heat was turned up internationally. Lord
Greville Janner, the former secretary of the British Parliament's
war crimes group, called on Australia to "actively go and seek new
evidence" against Kalejs.
</P>
<P>
Israel's Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center urged a change in
Australian law to deal summarily with suspected war criminals.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think (Kalejs) deserves to be left alone," said Efraim
Zuroff, director of the Simon Wiesenthal Center.
</P>
<P>
"We urge the Australian government to renew its investigations
and adopt a policy of denaturalization and deportation which has
been successful both in the United States and Canada," he said.
</P>
<P>
As an Australian citizen since 1957, Kalejs has twice been
deported to Australia - from the United States in 1994 and Canada
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He left Australia in June 1998 and was last month found living
in a retirement home in Leicestershire, Britain.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Australia's acting Prime Minister John Anderson
refuted the claims Australia lacked the political will to pursue
Kalejs.
</P>
<P>
He said the case had been "pretty closely examined" by the
special investigations unit and others and it had been decided at
the time there was insufficient evidence to proceed with.
</P>
<P>
But if fresh evidence were available, "it ought to be produced
and action can be taken," he said.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone Saturday confirmed the
government was trying as a matter of priority to set up a formal
extradition relationship with the Latvian government, to which it
had sent "significant material" in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of Friday night's return to Australia of Kalejs,
Vanstone said the Australian government had been unfairly and
unjustly maligned and it was time to "call a halt."
</P>
<P>
"I'm very angry and very annoyed that Australia's reputation is
being maligned and I understand that many, many other Australians
would feel the same way," she said.
</P>
<P>
"No war criminal is welcome in Australia anywhere other than in
an Australian jail," she said. "But who is a war criminal is
something that will be decided not by ministers, not by
governments, not by commentators, not by the media and not by
overseas commentators.
</P>
<P>
"It is a matter to be judged by the courts and I've already
indicated that a premature move to prosecution of any criminal can
lead, where the criminal is guilty, to a most unjust result," she
said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Delivers Ultimatum to DTV Broadcasters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAS VEGAS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking U.S. official
Friday delivered an ultimatum to TV companies and consumer
electronics makers across the country, saying if they fail to
resolve a standards dispute that has delayed the roll-out of new
digital TV sets, they will face law.
</P>
<P>
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman William
Kennard, speaking at the ongoing 2000 Consumer Electronics Show
here, gave the two sides until April to develop a way for new
digital TV sets to connect with cable systems.
</P>
<P>
"The FCC has exercised restraint in this matter. Your time and
our patience is running out," Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
"The commission has tried to let you solve this problem. But so
far you have not finished the job. The American public will not
let the commission wait much longer for you to agree on standards,
and the law gives the commission clear responsibility to act if
you do not." he added.
</P>
<P>
Digital technology allows broadcasters to air movie-quality,
high-definition shows or send as many as six ordinary shows over a
single TV channel. The FCC has mandated that TV broadcasters, set
makers and network operators move toward new digital standards.
</P>
<P>
But the transition has been slow for many reasons, in part
because TV set makers have not reached agreement with cable
operators over an expensive piece of interface hardware that
attaches to either TV sets or cable TV set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
The argument boils down to who should pay for the high cost of
adding the interface, the set-top boxes or TV set makers. As a
result, none of those televisions can be plugged into cable, the
medium through which most Americans still get their programming.
</P>
<P>
Broadcasters are also worried about protecting digital programs
-- capable of being reproduced in nearly exact copies -- from
being illegally copied and pirated overseas.
</P>
<P>
But Kennard noted the industry has been promising since 1994 to
resolve these issues, and he pointed to the makers of DVD players
who were able to solve their differences over standards and
copyright issues, then come up with cost efficient products.
</P>
<P>
The first high-definition television began selling in late 1998,
and more than 100 TV stations reaching 50 percent of the American
people now offer the option of receiving high-quality digital TV
signals. But the pictures are eroded through cable converters to
quality not much better than traditional analog TVs, Kennard said.
</P>
<P>
To address the problem, the chairman said he had directed FCC
to draft proposed rules on compatibility standards and would move
toward making those rules law if digital television is not moving
forward by April.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Central Bank has lifted
some restrictions on the European Union (EU) investments in Cypriot
companies, as part of the island's integration process with Europe,
the Cyprus Mail newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In its statement on Friday, the Central Bank allowed the EU
investors to obtain more than 50 percent of the share of a Cypriot
company.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners were previously restricted to a maximum of 49 percent
share in a company of certain sector in Cyprus with the Cypriot
partner retaining 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank also lifted restrictions on how much an EU resident is
allowed to invest in a Cypriot company listed on the Cyprus Stock
Exchange (CSE), allowing for up to 100 percent participation.
</P>
<P>
However, existing regulations regarding other foreign ownership
such as property will still apply to all foreigners, and foreigners
are not allowed majority share in Cypriot banks.
</P>
<P>
Restrictions on Cypriot nationals investing abroad have also
been partially lifted, in terms of direct investment in foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
Cypriots will now be free to invest any amount in direct
investment in foreign companies without being subject to exchange
control restrictions. But investment in stocks or bonds are
restricted by the Central Bank.
</P>
<P>
Restrictions on deposits by Cypriots in foreign banks will also
remain in force.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Estrada Revamps Cabinet to Save  Lost Popularity  by Pan Jiaxu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada announced Saturday the long-expected cabinet revamp, a
first-ever move he has taken to reverse his plunging popularity.
</P>
<P>
In his televised "Report to the Nation," Estrada appointed
Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Pardo as new finance secretary
to replace Edgardo Espiritu, who resigned three days ago.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Manuel Roxas II was named to succeed Pardo, and former
Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim was appointed as secretary of Interior
and Local Government to replace Ronaldo Puno.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president surprisingly sacked nearly 100
presidential advisers and consultants in the revamp.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, the president said, "In the new millennium, I
give you a new and honest government. This is... the call of the
people. This is also what reached me through the ratings in the
latest survey on my government."
</P>
<P>
Indeed, the plunging popularity of Estrada's administration and
infighting among cabinet members were widely believed to be the
driving forces in the president's decision to reshape the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
A survey conducted by the Social Weather Station in December of
1999 showed that the president's net satisfaction rating had
dropped to positive five.
</P>
<P>
The positive five percent satisfaction rating, representing the
difference between the president's approval and disapproval
ratings, was an all-time low for Estrada.
</P>
<P>
This figure is also a substantial drop from the 28 percent net
satisfaction rating he received in a survey conducted by the same
pollster during September and October, 1999.
</P>
<P>
In June of 1999, Estrada's net satisfaction rating was 65
percent. In the first quarter of last year, it was 67 percent, his
highest rating since he became president on June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the latest ratings of the rest of the cabinet also
significantly went down, except for newly-appointed Chief Director
Panilo Lacson of the National police, who won a wide respect from
his tough measures against criminals.
</P>
<P>
Critics said the sagging popularity indicates that the
administration before the revamp lacked satisfying efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The weaknesses of the Estrada's administration listed by
critics include lack of direction on the economy; inertia in
pushing through economic reforms; attendency to coddle cronies and
an erratic governing style.
</P>
<P>
The criticism was echoed outstandingly by the infighting among
members of the country's economic team.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, reports said outgoing finance secretary Espiritu and
Philippine Central Bank governor Rafael Bueaventura had clashed
over monetary and fiscal issues.
</P>
<P>
Former trade and industry secretary Pardo, on the other hand,
had disagreements with Espiritu over a loan issue that involved
the Social Security System.
</P>
<P>
Together with the new appointment, Estrada announced the
establishment of a five-member Economic Coordinating Council
headed by the president himself.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the powerful council, which is designed to
decide over the country's overall economic policies, was also
reportedly one of the points Espiritu and Pardo disagreed on.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports quoted Espiritu as saying that the creation of
the economic "super body" would be unfair to cabinet members in
charge of economic matters.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the revamp will hopefully end infighting in the
cabinet, adding that the new administration, with its highlighted
focus on economic development and social stability, will help
shore up the president's popularity.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, they pointed out that the cabinet reshuffle indicates
that Estrada is showing signs of "heeding the calmor" following
the piling pressure from the social community for change.

<HEADLINE> Philippine President Vows Crackdown on Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada vowed here Saturday to give Filipinos a country that is
peaceful and safe, rid of official corruption.
</P>
<P>
In his televised "Report to the Nation," Estrada asked his
relatives and friends not to use his name for their vested
interests.
</P>
<P>
He said that business confidence in the country will improve if
peace and order is maintained and corruption in the bureaucracy,
which has robbed the country of 40 billion pesos (1 billion U.S.
dollars) annually, has been stamped out.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to improve on our gains in the peace-and-
order front. The peace and order situation in the country has
improved considerably. Before, criminal activities were widespread
and happened almost everyday. But now, these crimes rarely take
place," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
"But for our society to fully get rid of criminals, we must
first cleanse our police forces of scalawags," he added.
</P>
<P>
Putting graft and corruption directly in the line of fire, the
president repeated his order to all heads of government offices to
check corruption in their turfs or face responsibility for the
unlawful activities of their subordinates.
</P>
<P>
As for his relatives and friends who plan to use their
relationship to him to advance their personal agenda, Estrada said
he will not hesitate to sever his ties with them if they do that.
</P>
<P>
In his report, Estrada also announced a cabinet revamp,
replacing three secretaries and sacking all presidential advisers
and consultants with no regular functions.
</P>
<P>
The move, analysts said, is aimed at improving his popularity
and stimulating the country's economic recovery.

HARARE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A Moslem cleric from South

<HEADLINE> Writethru: Estrada Reshuffles Cabinet to  Re-energize Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Saturday reshuffled his cabinet by replacing three cabinet
members and sacking all presidential advisers and consultants with
no regular functions in a bid to improve the government's
popularity.
</P>
<P>
In his televised "Report to the Nation," Estrada said that the
cabinet revamp was in response to the call from the people, as
conveyed to him in the results of recent surveys, particularly on
the popularity rating of the members of his official family.
</P>
<P>
"My gift to our people is this: in the new millennium, I give
you a new and honest government. This is also what I have heard (
and it) has been the call of the people. That message has reached
me through the ratings in the latest survey on my government," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the Social Weather Stations last
December, around 44 percent of Filipinos are satisfied with
Estrada's performance, down 56 percent from last October and 78
percent from last June.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Estrada appointed Trade and Industry Secretary
Jose Pardo as new finance secretary to replace Edgardo Espiritu,
who resigned three days ago.
</P>
<P>
Estrada named Rep. Manuel Roxas II to succeed Pardo, and
appointed former Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim as Secretary of Interior
and Local government to replace Ronaldo Puno.
</P>
<P>
In a shocking announcement, the president sacked nearly 100
presidential advisers and consultants with no regular functions.
</P>
<P>
He followed up the shocking announcement with a stern order to
all his former advisers and consultants to discard their official
stationeries and other paraphernalia bearing their names.
</P>
<P>
"I now ask them to destroy and discard all their calling cards
and stationeries bearing their titles as such," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also replaced several heads of government
agencies. Bureau of Internal Revenue chief Beethoven Rualo was
replaced by Dakila Fonacier, a businessman; Bureau of Customs
chief Nelson Tan was replaced by Ramon Farolan, who had served the
post once; and Florecita Flores was named the chief on Investment.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Estrada announced the creation of the Council
of Senior Economic Advisers composed of leaders in the private
business sector, and the Economic Coordinating Council composed of
the president, and the government's key economic managers.
</P>
<P>
"I've created a high-powered Council of Senior Economic
Advisers composed of five internationally-respected leaders of
private business sectors ...They have consented to be at the
service of the president whether individually or collectively,"
Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
This is the first major cabinet reshuffle made by Estrada since
he took office in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle, which is part of Estrada's bid to improve his
popularity rating, also aims to bolster the government's
performance and stimulate the country's economic recovery process,
analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Coffee Output up by 20 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenya produced a total of 66,504
tons of clean coffee in 1999, an increase of 20.92 percent over
the previous year, Chairman of the Mild Coffee Trade Association
of Eastern Africa F. J. Mwangi has said.
</P>
<P>
Mwangi said the 1998/1999 season yielded 191,972 bags of coffee
sold at an average price of 116.70 U.S. dollars compared to
1997/1998 season in which 789,827 bags were sold at an average
price of 221.69 dollars.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increase in production to favorable weather
conditions after prolonged drought in 1997 and the El-nino rains
of 1998, the East African Standard newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mwangi noted that the prices were at their lowest ebb due to
the coffee glut created by the South and Central American coffee
producers.
</P>
<P>
However, Kenyan coffee continues to sell well above the other
mild Arabic coffee at the overseas market due to its unique
quality, he added.

<HEADLINE> Allied Forces in Congo Set to Break Rebel Siege of Ikela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The Allied Forces in the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are on the verge of
breaking the rebel siege of Ikela, a strategic town 200 kilometers
southwest of rebel-held Kisangani, the daily Herald reported here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Allied Forces headquarters in Kinshasa announced on Friday
that they had recaptured three towns of Bokungu, Yalusaka and
Madombe.  The takeover of the towns by rebels in November
last year had isolated Ikela from other Allied Forces positions.
</P>
<P>
The capture of the towns by rebels was in contravention of the
July 10 Lusaka cease-fire agreement, and efforts to negotiate the
opening up of the main supply route to Ikela had been in vain, a
headquarters spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Allied Forces said this left them with no option except to
use force to open up the supply route along the Tshuapa River.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said it was only a matter of time before the
Ikela route was cleared.
</P>
<P>
The war in the DRC, which began in August 1998, has also sucked
in Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia to help the Central African
country repel the rebels backed by Uganda and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
All sides in the war signed the cease-fire deal in Zambia's
capital Lusaka in July and August last year.
</P>
<P>
Implementation has, however, dragged and both sides have
reported widespread breaches of the truce.

<HEADLINE> AOL Demonstrates Internet Service on TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAS VEGAS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Internet giant America Online
Inc. (AOL Friday showed a service that lets people use the
Internet on their television sets at the ongoing 2000 Consumer
Electronics Show (CES) here.
</P>
<P>
The new service, called AOLTV, would be transmitted through
cable set-top boxes made by Philips Electronics and Hughes
Electronics Corp.'s Direct TV satellite television.
</P>
<P>
"This is the biggest thing for us in 2000," said Carlos A.
Silva Jr., vice president of the AOL devices division's product
studio. "We are aiming on bringing the best of AOL to the TV set."
</P>
<P>
The new service, which will debut later this year, essentially
allows you to surf the Web with your TV. AOL's service will also
allow its members to chat with "buddies," as well as send and
receive e-mail.
</P>
<P>
"All of our members tell us they want another way to be
connected, besides the PC," said My-Chau Nguyen, vice president of
marketing for the AOL devices division.
</P>
<P>
The Dulles, Va.-based company has been moving aggressively to
bolster its "AOL Anywhere" strategy to extend its reach beyond the
personal computer (PC). In December, it bought MapQuest, a leader
provider of maps on the Internet that helps users look up
directions and can be used with hand-held computers. The company
also has developed software to adapt its interactive calendar and
other features such as e-mailing to portable devices.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say AOL has two goals with its AOL Anywhere program -
to be among the first to take advantage of consumers' desire to be
connected on the go and to encourage subscribers to stay online
longer, which could allow the service provider to boost rates it
charges companies for ads.
</P>
<P>
While AOL stressed how the service was different from
Microsoft's Web TV Networks Inc., industry experts say
demonstrations left no doubt that Microsoft and AOL are once again
ready to go head-to-head.

<HEADLINE> Worldwide Chip Market Experiences Double-Digit Growth in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Semiconductor revenue
surpassed 160 billion U.S. dollars in 1999 worldwide, up 17.6
percent over that of the previous year, according to a preliminary
report released Friday by U.S. market research firm Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time since 1995 that the worldwide
semiconductor market has experienced double-digit growth, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
One of the key factors for the industry growth was the firming
up of the market for dynamic random access memory (DRAM),
Dataquest said.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan earthquake also had an impact on the market, as it
forced spot market prices to treble in a matter of days, and
although they fell back quite rapidly, once the full effect was
known, the main impact was to accelerate the rate of rise of
contract pricing," the company added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association reported earlier
this week that worldwide chip revenue hit a record high of 14.2
billion dollars in November 1999, up 24.8 percent over the same
month in 1998. According to the trade association, the growth was
primarily driven by wireless communications, and then DRAM, PC and
server demand.

BUDAPEST -- Hungary will strengthen its relations with the
countries in the southeast Mediterranean region and a diplomatic
strategy for this purpose is under consideration, a foreign
ministry spokesman said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman, Horvath Babor, said that as these countries are
becoming increasingly important in the strategic concept of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the European Union
with the advent of the new millennium, Hungary as a NATO member
which also aspires to join the EU should take this opportunity to
enhance cooperation with them. He said that such cooperation
should cover not only political ties but also the economic, trade,
educational and cultural fields and the fight against drug
trafficking and organized crimes. (Hungary-Mediterranean Countries-

<P>
AUCKLAND, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Second-seed Anne Kremer awarded
Luxembourg its first title as she overcame Zimbabwe's Cara Black 6-
4, 6-4 in the final of the Auckland Tennis Classic here on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kremer, 24, stunned her 20-year-old opponent, who was playing
her first final, by establishing a 4-1 lead in both sets.
</P>
<P>
She broke Black in the first and third games and by the end of
the fourth game she led 4-0 before the Zimbabwean finally snapped
into action.
</P>
<P>
Black rallied to win the next four games to level at 4-4 before
Kremer broke her serve in the ninth game to take the first set.
</P>
<P>
Kremer broke Black again in the first and fifth games to take
another 4-1 lead, and was again levelled at 4-all after losing her
sixth and eighth games.
</P>
<P>
However, Black, 20, simply did not have the strength in her
serve or the right length on her strokes to maintain the pressure
and Kremer broke her in the ninth game before closing out the
match.
</P>
<P>
"This will be pretty big news back home," the delighted Kremer
said after the one hour 22 minute game.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Don Nelson wasn't too happy
with Karl Malone elbowing one of his players. The NBA wasn't happy
with either one's behavior.
</P>
<P>
Nelson, the coach of the Dallas Mavericks, was suspended for
one game by the NBA today for bumping referee Scott Wall in his
haste to confront Malone, the power forward of the Utah Jazz.
Nelson and Malone each were fined $10,000.
</P>
<P>
With 3:51 remaining in the second quarter of Thursday's game in
Dallas, Malone grabbed a rebound and elbowed Mavericks center
Shawn Bradley in the face in an effort to creat space. Bradley was
knocked to the floor and remained there for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
Midway through the third quarter, Nelson argued a call and was
ejected after receiving two technical fouls. Already on the court,
he used the opportunity to confront Malone and bumped Wall when
the referee intervened.
</P>
<P>
Nelson cannot coach the Mavericks in Saturday's home contest
against the Atlanta Hawks.

the Bulls recorded their second win in as many meetings with the

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Calls for Self-Reliance in New Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Africa should try to
develop its economy and democracy to win a smooth development in a
more competitive new century following a political independence in
the last century, Tanzanian Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye said.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a grand party held here Friday in
celebration of the new millennium attended by local ministers,
diplomats and heads of international organizations.
</P>
<P>
"There are many areas where Africa didn't do very well
including economic development, sustainable food self-sufficiency,
democracy and good governance, poverty and accumulation of debts,
peace and security," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye warned that if Africa continues to move as it has done
in the past in the new millennium, it will be left behind even
further and become truly a continent of contradictions and
miseries.
</P>
<P>
"The world will be more and more cruel and very unsympathetic
to the poor and disadvantaged," he said. "Africa must manage her
resources better for her people and must learn to be self
sufficient in their necessities rather than thinking that there
are people somewhere who have the responsibility of feeding them."
</P>
<P>
Sumaye called on African governments to form strong economic
blocks to compete favorably with other economic blocks in the
world.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the developed countries to relieve the debt
burden upon the African countries which has reached unmanageable
proportions.
</P>
<P>
"The HIV/AIDS scourge is so deadly to African economies that if
serious steps are not taken in time, some countries may literally
be wiped out," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The few rich who control most of the wealth in the world are
getting richer and the many poor are getting poorer and these two
phenomena are bound to accelerate in the new millennium," he
added.

<HEADLINE> hke01081--2ndlead:Estrada Sacks All presidential Advisers,  Consultants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Saturday announced a major cabinet reshuffle, replacing
three cabinet members and sacking all presidential advisers and
consultants.
</P>
<P>
In his televised "Report to the Nation," Estrada appointed
Trade and Industry Secretary Jose Pardo as new finance secretary
to replace Edgardo Espiritu, who resigned three days ago.
</P>
<P>
Estrada named Rep. Manuel Roxas II to succeed Pardo, and
appointed former Manila Mayor Alfredo Lim as Secretary of Interior
and Local Government to replace Ronaldo Puno.
</P>
<P>
In a shocking announcement, the president sacked nearly 100
presidential advisers and consultants in the revamp.
</P>
<P>
He followed up the shocking announcement with a stern order to
all his former advisers and consultants to discard their official
stationery and other paraphernalia bearing their names.
</P>
<P>
Beleaguered by allegations of cronyism, Estrada refuted them
with the announcement.
</P>
<P>
The president also replaced several heads of government
agencies. Bureau of Internal Revenue chief Beethoven Rualo was
replaced by Dakila Fonacier, a businessman; Bureau of Customs
chief Nelson Tan was replaced by Ramon Farolan, who had served the
post once; and Florecita Flores was named the chief on Investment.
</P>
<P>
This is the first major cabinet reshuffle made by Estrada since
he took office in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle is part of Estrada's bid to improve his
popularity rating, which plunged recently, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
According to a survey by the Social Weather Stations last
December, around 44 percent of Filipinos are satisfied with
Estrada's performance. That is down from 56 percent last October
and 78 percent last June.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet revamp also aims to bolster the government's
performance and stimulate the country's economic recovery process,
analysts said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Experts Predict 1 Billion Wireless Users by 2003 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAS VEGAS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Wireless technology, fueled by
the Internet and increasing consumer demand for many forms of data,
will have dramatic growth in the U.S. in the coming years, experts
said at the ongoing 2000 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
There will be 1 billion wireless users by 2003 and as many as
400 million using wireless devices to access the Internet by 2004,
according to a group of panelists including six corporate
executives and an industry analyst.
</P>
<P>
They said wireless devices would perform a wide range of
functions, including peer-to-peer communications, digital chats,
enterprise mail, brokerage and banking transactions as well as
paging and voice communication. Opinions differed on exactly what
devices would be necessary to deliver the wide range of services.
</P>
<P>
"I do not believe all of this can be stuffed into any one
telephone," said Bill Lenahan of Bell South Wireless Data Services.
"People will have to carry two devices," he predicted.
</P>
<P>
Mark Lowenstein, a Yankee Group analyst, said that the industry
will become increasingly innovative with hardware. One device
will be a telephone. The other will be a personal digital
assistant or, perhaps, a "mobile companion."
</P>
<P>
Lowenstein suggested that "CES is going to take center stage
for hardware for wireless," adding that many believe this wireless
explosion is already developing.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 CES wireless product area features a host of advanced
technologies from many of the world's leading manufacturers
including Ericsson, Motorola, Nokia and Samsung. Wireless
products at the show range from telephones and pagers to hand-held
GPS receivers and wireless Internet devices.
</P>
<P>
Bo Dimert of Ericsson predicted that disparate mobile
communications hardware in the near future will be capable of
seamless communications -- a phone, a headset, a printer, a
keyboard, etc. -- that all work together but are connected without
wires.
</P>
<P>
Roxanne Jozwick of AT&AMP;T Wireless noted that there are more
mobile than wireline phones in Finland and suggested that a
growing number of Americans are relying on wireless systems as
their primary telephone service.

<HEADLINE> Tax Evasion Conviction in Oil Smuggling Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A major oil smuggling case
involving the evasion of 7.14 million yuan in customs taxes
reached a verdict in south China's Guangdong Province before the
new year when the Guangdong Provincial Supreme Court sentenced
Yuan Manzhang to eight years imprisonment for smuggling 90,000
tons of low-sulfur oil.
</P>
<P>
Yuan declared to the customs that the unit price of the oil was
67 U.S. dollars for the shipment from a Singaporean oil company,
instead of the import price of 104 U.S. dollars last February when
he was the deputy-director of the Fuxing Oil Refinery in the city
of Zhongshan in the province.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the court said that this was one of the largest
oil smuggling case in China, and the smugglers used complicated
tactics to evade taxes.
</P>
<P>
The goods were transported to the port of entry in Huangpu in
Guangdong aboard a ship registered in the Marshall Islands, and
Fuxing Oil entrusted a shipping company to contact customs for the
shipment.
</P>
<P>
The court has retrieved the goods and fined the Fuxing Oil
Refinery 15 million yuan.

owned cellphones. The figure climbed to 30 percent at the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
The local telecommunications giant, Telecom, still leads the
market in mobile phones with about 677,000 customers, gaining 37.5
percent more customers in the year to September 1999.
</P>
<P>
Most of the growth is in prepaid cellphones where people pay in
advance for their call time and do not have monthly bills,
according to Vodafone New Zealand Managing Director John Rohan.
</P>
<P>
He said there had been a sharp rise in cellphone connections on
Christmas Day and Boxing Day, as the product had become a popular
gift.
</P>
<P>
Vodafone and Telecom have been in keen competition. After
Christmas Vodafone ran a promotion encouraging people to swap
Telecom cellphones for its phones. Telecom then ran a promotion to
counter that.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank: Ecuador to Maintain Economic Stability in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The macroeconomic goal for Ecuador
in the fiscal year 2000 is to maintain economic stability, the
Central Bank of Ecuador (BCE) said Friday in its Monetary Program
for the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
BCE general manager Virginia Fierro said that the national
inflation rate is targeted at a level of 65 percent at the end of
this year, which means a slight increase over the 1999 yearend
level of 60.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The general manager said that this year's economic growth will
be 2.2 percent and fiscal deficit will drop from more than 7
percent to 2.5 percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). To
achieve these targets, money supply will increase 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The stability of the economy, according to Fierro, will be
based on the control of monetary disorder that bothers the country
every day.
</P>
<P>
She also said that an additional amount of 200 million U.S.
dollars is reserved to stabilize the currency exchange rate,
because the BCE will no longer intervene with measures contrary to
the free exchange market to prevent the devaluation of sucre,
Ecuador's currency.
</P>
<P>
The BCE's policy affects the Ecuadorian exchange market
dramatically. Friday opened in Quito with a dollar quotation of
17,000 sucres for buying, with the expectation that the BCE could
take new economic measures that supposedly would anchor the U.S.
dollar at 20,000 sucres.
</P>
<P>
However, the price rose again later in the morning when it was
clear that the BCE authorities confirmed that no anchor would be
applied to the dollar and that the BCE would not intervene in the
free exchange market in any manner.
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed on Friday at 23,500 sucres for buying and 26,
500 sucres for selling, while in Guayaquil it was quoted at 24,000
sucres for buying and 25,000 sucres for selling.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Urges Japan to Stop Whale Hunting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Argentine government
Friday urged Japan to stop hunting whales in the Southern
Hemisphere waters, charging that Japanese whaling ships killed
more than 400 cetaceans a year for what they called scientific
research.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued by the Foreign Ministry, the Argentine
government said, "The hunt of specimens by the Japanese whaling
fleet in such a big number does not respond to critical research
needs."
</P>
<P>
It also recommended that the Japanese whaling ships should make
their research through means that will preserve the life of the
marine mammal.
</P>
<P>
It said that although the Convention for the Regulation of the
Hunt of the Whale, to which Argentina and Japan are signatories,
authorizes the members of the International Whaling Commission (
CBI) to hunt the animals for scientific purposes, the Argentine
government maintains its position in favor of the conservation of
the species.

<HEADLINE> Course of Yellow River to Remain Unchanged for 100 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 8 (Xinhua) -- The course of the Yellow River,
China's second longest, will remain unchanged for another 100
years, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River rises in northwest China's Qinghai-Tibet
Plateau and surges eastward like a giant dragon across the
northern region of the country.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that the course of the river changed 26
times over the past 2,000 years. Each time, the change caused huge
economic losses and hundreds and thousands of people were forced
to abandon their homes.
</P>
<P>
The river's present course was formed in 1855, and some experts
have suggested changing this course artificially to prevent
flooding because there is too much silt at the lower reaches of
the river.
</P>
<P>
China is now working on ways to harness and develop the Yellow
River to ensure its safety.
</P>
<P>
The valley of the 5,464-km-long river is regarded as the
birthplace of the Chinese nation, and the area now has a
population of 107 million and an economy accounting for 15 percent
of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
According to the present plan, China will build water control
projects at the lower reaches of the river before 2010 to
reinforce and widen the river's course.
</P>
<P>
An ecological environment project at the upper and middle
reaches of the river will be created to reduce the amount of silt
washed into the river by 800 million tons by 2050.
</P>
<P>
Three water conservancy projects, including the Xiaolangdi,
Qikou, and Guxian, will help control silt at the middle reaches of
the river by 2030. When these projects are completed, 40 billion
tons of silt will be discharged from the river.
</P>
<P>
At present, the 1,400-km-long embankment at the lower reaches
of the river can withstand flooding equal to the heaviest in the
past 60 years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, two flood diversion areas at the lower reaches of
the river will help divert waters during flood season, and the
water and soil conservation projects at the upper and middle
reaches will help prevent 300 million tons of silt from being
washed into the river annually.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that more than 3 million people will have to be
relocated if China wants to change the river's course at a cost of
billions of yuan.
</P>
<P>
Besides, if the present course is changed, railways, roads,
bridges and power grids that have been built over the past decades
would be submerged.

<HEADLINE> Desert Control a Pressing Task at Yellow River Source </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to remote satellite sensing mapping, the ratio of
desert land at the head of the Yellow River, which covers 3.8
million ha of land in northwest China's Qinghai Province, has
risen from 3.9 percent in the 1970s and 1980s to 20 percent now.
This is partially attributable to the sandstorms that are common
in this region for much of the year.
</P>
<P>
A quarter of the 4,077 lakes in Madoi County at the river's
source have now dried up, and as much as 88 million tons of silt
from Qinghai wash down the Yellow River annually, making it one of
the muddiest in the world.
</P>
<P>
China's central government and the Qinghai provincial
government have decided to plant trees and grass on 333,3000 ha of
poor land now being used for crop cultivation over the next 10
years to improve the ecological environment of the region.
</P>
<P>
A campaign to comprehensively treat desertification will be
launched in Gonghe County, the most severely-affected area at the
source of the Yellow River.

<P>
BEIJING, January 8 (Xinhua) -- A central government loan
earmarked for environmental improvement has helped this capital
city establish new waste-water treatment plants.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from related offices, some 600 million
yuan (about 72 million U.S. dollars) have been used to harness 43
kilometers of rivers, 1.24 million square meters of lake areas,
and 38 kilometers of pipes to channel waste water.
</P>
<P>
The loans for waste-water treatment have increased the city's
treatment capacity from 500,000 tons to today's one million tons,
covering most of Beijing's downtown area and the eastern suburbs.
</P>
<P>
The capital city has also used the government loans to clean up
the moat surrounding the Forbidden City .
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over 86 percent of the 3.9 billion yuan in
loans in 1998 were used in the construction of 12 infrastructure
projects, including waste-water and garbage treatment, and
highways. These loans from the central government have inspired
the local government and enterprises to invest another 15.8

<HEADLINE> American Cancer Society Affirms Value of Mammography Screening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, January 7 (Xinhua) -- In a statement disputing a
Danish study, the American Cancer Society (ACS) Friday affirmed
the value of mammography screening and recommended an annual
mammogram for women aged 40 or above.
</P>
<P>
The study by Danish researchers, published in the January 8
issue of the British journal The Lancet, suggests that using
mammography to screen for breast cancer is not justified.
</P>
<P>
The authors conducted a meta-analysis of eight mammography
screening studies primarily done in Europe. According to the
authors, the studies had inadequate randomization of subjects,
which compromised the usefulness of the data.
</P>
<P>
"The American Cancer Society is in complete disagreement with
conclusions drawn by the Danish team," said the statement issued
by ACS chief medical officer Harmon J. Eyre.
</P>
<P>
According to Eyre, in the early 1980s when only 13 percent of
American women were getting mammograms, the average size of breast
cancer tumors was about 3 centimeters. By the late 1990s, 60
percent of women in the United States were having regular
mammography and the average size of tumors had decreased to 2
centimeters.
</P>
<P>
The stage of disease at diagnosis has shifted dramatically in
the 1990s, Eyre noted, so that in most new cases today, the cancer
has not spread to the adjacent underarm lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
"Most significantly," said the statement, "the death rate from
breast cancer in the United States has been falling steadily for
the past 10 years due in great part to mammography."
</P>
<P>
"Evidence in the United States where mammography has been done
for a longer period of time than in Europe and where women are
generally screened at shorter intervals using better quality
equipment, shows vastly improved diagnosis and prognosis," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that mammography is beneficial because it finds breast
cancer early when a woman has more treatment options, the ACS
recommends that women aged 40 or older have an annual mammogram,
annual clinical breast examination by a health professional, and
should perform monthly breast self-examination.
</P>
<P>
The ACS is the U.S. nationwide community-based voluntary health
organization.

<HEADLINE> Kanu to Negotiate with Nigerian National Coach  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has
asked Nigerian striker Nwankwo Kanu to negotiate a solution with
his national team coach so he can play in the FA Cup against
Leicester City on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerians want the 3.5 million pounds marksman to join
their squad on Saturday and are threatening to demand that he
foxes at Highbury, Wenger now says he cannot take that risk.
</P>
<P>
"We are not stupid enough to take a risk like that," the
Frenchman said.
</P>
<P>
"It seems the rules are against us for the sake of 24 hours but,
for two reasons, I have not given up on Kanu being available to
play on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"One is that he wants to play for us and the second is that I
still hope Nigeria will acknowledge how much we have done at
Arsenal to restore their top player since he came here," Wenger
said.
</P>
<P>
Kanu has not played for the Nigerian side since the 1998 World
Cup finals but since his emphatic arrival at Highbury has been
handed the national captaincy.
</P>
<P>
Now Wenger is relying on a personal call by Kanu to charm
Nigeria's head coach, Dutchman Bonfrere Joe into giving him an
extra day's grace in London.
</P>
<P>
"But if he can't persuade them he will have to go to join
Nigeria before our game on Sunday. It is possible that Leicester
can knock us out of the FA Cup if we don't play well, but we can't
risk a stupid rule knocking us out."
</P>
<P>
The Nigerians are preparing for the African Nations Cup, which
starts on January 14, and are insisting Kanu abides by Fifa rules
which stipulate national coaches are entitled to recall players 14
days before the start of major tournaments.

<HEADLINE> Vialli May Face Defamation Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- English soccer club Chelsea
manager Gianluca Vialli may end up in a Rome court on charges of
defamation for his 1998 remarks branding former AS Roma coach
Zdenek Zeman "a terrorist".
</P>
<P>
Zeman raised suspicions of doping at Italian giants Juventus by
saying that he was surprised at the muscle development on both
Vialli and the club's current star, Alessandro Del Piero.
</P>
<P>
Vialli responded to the comments as he left the pitch after an
August 7 friendly between Chelsea and Serie A club Parma in
Palermo,saying: "He's a terrorist, because he's destabilizing the
world of (Italian) football... he should be banned for one or two
years."
</P>
<P>
Zeman, now in charge at Turkish club Fenerbahce, appointed
lawyers to take action against Vialli about the comments which
were made on live television and then reported in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
After examining the lawyers' complaints, Rome's state
prosecutor Silverio Piro believes there are grounds for a case and
has now recommended that Vialli be taken to court for his comments,
according to Italian news agency ANSA.
</P>
<P>
That recommendation has been made to examining magistrate,
Laura Capotorto, who will decide whether to order a trial or to
dismiss the case.

<P>
LAGOS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Texaco, an American petroleum
giant, said Friday that it has discovered a large oil field in
its Agbami field off the Nigerian coast.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcast Company Friday quoted a high-ranking
official of the company as saying that the finding was one of the
biggest ever made in deep water along the West African coast.
</P>
<P>
A senior vice-president of the company, John O'Connor, said
that this would lead to a world-class project and significantly
increase Texaco's future production.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening ethnic crisis in Nigeria's oil producing
Niger delta, Western oil firms in recent years have been stepping
up their efforts to explore the off shore oil deposit of the West
African country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's off-shore oil deposit is said to be one of the
largest in the world and promises to be a dominant oil producing
area in the whole Africa.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Russian Forces Preparing for Decisive Strike Amid Holiday Lull </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian units, besieging the
Chechen capital Grozny, Saturday were regrouping and preparing for
a final offensive against the rebels after the Kremlin announced a
partial suspension of aerial and artillery strikes over the city
on Orthodox Christmas, said Russian military sources.
</P>
<P>
"Troops maintained their blockade of various localities,
including Grozny, conducted intelligence operations, regrouped
forces and equipment and proceeded with preparations of forces for
military action in mountain areas," the Interfax news agency
quoted a statement from Russia's Mozdok base, just outside
Chechnya, as saying.
</P>
<P>
No more than 1,000 gunmen remain in Grozny, said Lieutenant
General Gennady Troshev, deputy commander of the Russian Allied
Army Group in the Northern Caucasus, late Friday.
</P>
<P>
The break in the operation will be used for the regrouping of
federal troops and for getting prepared for a decisive offensive
on the separatists, said Troshev.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about a possible date of the offensive, he said, "The
strikes will be launched after the military makes sure that there
are no civilians in Grozny."
</P>
<P>
Serious differences emerged among militants in Grozny, who are
blocked by the federal units and divided into three divergent
groups. There are more gunmen, who are willing to stop fighting,
than those preferring to go on with it, according to the Russian
Federal Security Service branch in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are experiencing an acute shortage of food and
ammunition. "Gunmen in Grozny feel that they are kamikazes. They
cannot help realizing that their last hour is coming," General
Troshev said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, official reports said troops were in place a few
hundred yards from key points in Grozny and were pressing on in
other areas of the separatist region, particularly in rebel
mountain strongholds to the south, despite thick fog.
</P>
<P>
Artillery strikes hit villages in mountainous areas about 15
miles south of Grozny. More than 20 air missions were conducted
despite inclement weather, said the headquarters of the Russian
Combined Grouping in the North Caucasus, cited by the Interfax.
The situation in Chechnya remains complex, it said.
</P>
<P>
The anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya has entered a phase,
at which foreign mercenaries fighting on the rebel side have
started to quit combat areas, said the headquarters, adding that
about 200 mercenaries are planning to enter the neighboring
federal republic of Dagestan in the guise of civilians to travel
to Turkey via Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
"We have reports that Shamil Basayev, an influential Chechen
field commander, has been wounded," said Troshev. "The leaders of
the militants -- Basayev and Hattab -- are now in the highland
area of Chechnya. They continuously move from one place to another,
fearing for their lives," he added.
</P>
<P>
As federal troops continue their counter-terrorist operation in
Chechnya, life goes back to normal in its northern parts freed
from rebels. Work is under way in most settlements to restore the
economic and social infrastructure, said a Russian military press
service Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Hold Second Debate in Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Vice President Al Gore
and his Democratic rival for presidential nomination Bill Bradley
Saturday had the second debate in a week in Iowa, where the party
caucuses will be held on January 24.
</P>
<P>
In the debate, Al Gore said that he's not in a Washington
bunker trying to fend off the scandals of the past, but he's on "
the front lines in the battle for our future."
</P>
<P>
He said the Clinton administration has delivered new jobs,
reformed welfare, and strengthened the economy, and that his goals
as president would produce more progress.
</P>
<P>
"That's not a bunker," Gore said. "Those are the front lines in
the fight for our future."
</P>
<P>
On health insurance, Former New Jersey Senator Bradley again
accused the vice president of misrepresenting his position by
saying it would undermine Medicare and do away with Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
"I'd replace Medicaid with something better," Bradley said,
accusing Gore of always conveniently ignoring that.
</P>
<P>
Both candidates talked tough on farm policies important in Iowa,
demanding that foreign markets be opened to genetically modified
commodities.
</P>
<P>
"We can't let Europe and Japan determine our farm policy," said
Gore.
</P>
<P>
"The problem with agriculture in America is serious, in Iowa it
's dead serious," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
Bradley said family farmers have had no help and "no safety net
whatsoever," from the current administration, vowing to change the
policy to help small farmers if elected president.
</P>
<P>
Gore challenged Bradley that he wants to come back to Iowa and
debate Bradley on agricultural policy.
</P>
<P>
The debate, held in a public TV station before an audience of
300, was televised nationally by CNN and C-Span.
</P>
<P>
The presidential campaign heated up in the United States after
the new year holiday as the candidates of both Democratic and
Republican parties have held two debates separately.
</P>
<P>
New polls indicated that Vice President Gore has shored up his
lead over former Senator Bradley among Iowans while Texas Governor
George W. Bush holds a comfortable lead over five other Republican
candidates for the presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
The polls, taken recently among 500 Republicans and 501
Democrats planning to vote in the party caucuses, found Gore with
support of 54 percent, and Bradley of 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bush was the favorite of 45 percent of the Republicans polled,
down from 49 percent in a similar poll conducted in November, but
firmly led millionaire publisher Steve Forbes who was second at 18
percent.
</P>
<P>
The caucuses, to be held in more than 2,000 locations across
Iowa State, launch the presidential nominating season.
