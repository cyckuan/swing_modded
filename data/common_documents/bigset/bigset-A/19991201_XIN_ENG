<HEADLINE> Iran Spends Heavily on Combating Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking officer of the
Iranian security forces said on Tuesday that his country has spent
one billion U.S. dollars on combating drug trafficking since the
Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Deputy commander of the security forces Brigadier General
Mohsen Ansari said at a seminar of anti-drug officials that
the security forces have been on the forefront of the fighting
against drugs with over 2,700 personnel killed in the process.
</P>
<P>
He said his forces seized over 137 tons of various narcotics
last Iranian calendar year (ended March 20) and the figure
reached 167 tons in the first eight months of this Iranian year,
the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total drug hauls this year, 97 tons was seized from
the traffickers in the three provinces of Sistan-Baluchestan,
Khorasan and Kerman, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a rise in poppy cultivation and processing
laboratories in the region, Ansari said 34 heroin
processing laboratories are active in Pakistan and Afghanistan,
and although international organizations are aware of their
existence, there are no efforts to eradicate them.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the Iranian health ministry and welfare
organization to enforce laws and regulations enacted with regard
to drug use, adding the rehabilitation centers should not be
closed down.
</P>
<P>
The commander put the number of addicts in Iran at about
1.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Gaddafi Calls for Intensifying African Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TRIPOLI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
Tuesday urged unity among African countries, saying this is the
precondition for national progress and economic development, and a
powerful weapon to halt conflicts on the continent.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi made the remarks at a big gathering in Tripoli to
celebrate Patriotic Movement of Salvation, led by Chadian
President Idriss Deby, being in power for nine years.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi said any conflicts on the African continent is the
treason to the African unity for they can only cause more
sufferings for the African people and are to the advantage of
African countries' enemies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on the African countries to adopt positive
approaches to solve their disputes so as to achieve security and
stability on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
On the relations with Chad, Gaddafi said this is first time for
a country to mark its national day on the Libyan territory, which
ultimately manifest the unity between Libya and Chad.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi also criticized the intervention by the U.S.-led West in
the internal affairs of Africa, saying the African people can
safeguard their independence and democracy and they categorically
reject external interference and hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Chad President Deby expressed thanks to Gaddafi
for his support and help for the Chadian people in their fights
against invasion and efforts to develop national economy,
especially in oil tapping.
</P>
<P>
Deby and his party arrived here earlier in the day.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Criticizes Israeli Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat on Tuesday lashed out at Israel's
settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government is continuing to build settlements in
the occupied Palestinian territories, Arafat said upon arrival at
Cairo for a short visit.
</P>
<P>
The latest was the building of 1,084 housing units around
Bethlehem, Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader warned that the Israeli settlement
policy will jeopardize the ongoing negotiations for a final peace
agreement between the Palestinians and Israel.
</P>
<P>
The signed peace deals between the two sides oblige Israel to
halt its settlement activities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
The future of the Jewish settlements will be decided in the final
status talks. But Israel has so far failed to honor the accords.
</P>
<P>
Israel's decision came at a time when Muslims and Christians
are planning to celebrate the new millennium in the West Bank
town, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's move indicates that "it wanted to impede the planned
celebrations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat added that Israel also continues to build settlements in
Jerusalem, describing the activity as an attempt to judaize the
holy city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians want the traditional Arab East Jerusalem as
the capital of their future independent state. But Israel claims
that Jerusalem is its "undivided and eternal capital." The final
status talks also include this thorny issue.
</P>
<P>
Arafat frequently visits Egypt to consult with President Hosni
Mubarak and seek his advice. Egypt, the first Arab country to sign
a peace treaty with Israel, plays an active role in mediating the
Arab-Israeli peace talks.

<HEADLINE> French Defense Minister Says Kosovo Serbs Face Ethnic Cleansing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- French Defense Minister Alain
Richard said on Tuesday that France prefers to see a division of
Kosovo rather than an elimination of the Serb community there
faced with ``another ethnic cleansing.''
</P>
<P>
At a conference on Central European security hosted by the
Institute of High Studies of National Defense, Richard said that
France prefers a re-grouping of the Serbs into certain areas of
Kosovo to protect them from the Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when answering a question posed by former
Albanian Defense Minister Alfred Moisiu on what he thought about
the risks a division of Kosovo could bring about.
</P>
<P>
Richard said that ``another ethnic cleansing'' is taking place
in Kosovo, this time against the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
``Our choice has been between the risk of a division of Kosovo
because the frightened Serb population are regrouped in a certain
number of areas to avoid the massacres, and the elimination by
terror of the Serb community,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda Launch East African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARUSHA, Tanzania, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Presidents of Kenya,
Uganda and Tanzania signed here on Tuesday the treaty for the
establishment of the East African Community (EAC) to replace the
existing East African Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The new regional body is expected to expand and deepen
economic, political and social cooperation among the three
neighboring African states for their mutual benefit at a higher
level, according to the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The treaty says that a Customs Union will be established as the
entry point of the Community, followed by a Common Market,
subsequently a Monetary Union and ultimately a Political
Federation of the East African States.
</P>
<P>
The main organs of the EAC include the Summit of Heads of
State, the Council of Ministers, the Coordination Committee,
Sectoral Committees, the East African Court of Justice, the East
African Legislative Assembly and the Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Held in the downtown Sheikh Amri Abeid Stadium, the colorful
signing ceremony was attended by leaders of the Great Lakes region
states including Burundian President Pierre Buyoya and
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity Salim Ahmed
Salim.
</P>
<P>
Before the signing ceremony, presidents Daniel arap Moi of
Kenya, Benjamin Mkapa of Tanzania and Yoweri Museveni of Uganda
held a summit meeting in the Arusha International Conference
Center.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders appreciated the finalization of the
negotiations of the treaty, approved the treaty and the action
plan for its implementation, according to a joint communique.
</P>
<P>
They also underscored the role of the private sector in the
realization of the objectives of the community.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches at the signing ceremony, the three presidents
said that the new EAC will work closely with other African
regional organizations toward the achievement of the proposed
African Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
They also reaffirmed to promote peace and security and observe
the principle of peaceful resolution of conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The 26-point action plan provides for ratification of the
treaty within six months, procedures for admission of new members
and constitution of new organs and their rules of procedures
within a specific period ranging from six months to four years.
</P>
<P>
The plan also insists on conclusion of protocols for
establishment of the customs union, standardization, quality
assurance, metrology, testing and development of an east African
industrial development strategy.
</P>
<P>
Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda founded in 1967 the first East
African Community, but it collapsed in 1977 mainly due to the
divergence of economic policies and ideologies pursued by the
member states.
</P>
<P>
The three states decided on November 30, 1993 to set up the
Permanent Tripartite Commission for East African Cooperation in an
effort to revive the defunct EAC.
</P>
<P>
They also launched on March 14, 1996 the Secretariat
headquartered in Arusha, northern Tanzania, to coordinate and
promote the economic, political and social development in the
three countries with a total population of about 81 million and
territories of 1.8 million square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> EU Adopts Electronic Signature Directive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s
telecommunications ministers adopted Tuesday a new legal framework
guaranteeing EU-wide recognition of electronic signatures.
</P>
<P>
The Electronic Signature Directive was cleared during an one-
day meeting of EU Council of ministers. The European Commission,
the EU's executive branch, said this is the first example of its "
flexible and integrated" efforts towards developing a European
framework for the progress of electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
EU's 15 member states now have 18 months to implement the law
which is expected to enhance Internet security and help Europe
make good the e-commerce gap between the regional bloc and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
In the past, only hand-written signatures have been legally
valid but this legislation extends that recognition to electronic
signatures and applies the Internet market principles of free
movement of services and home country control to e-commerce, the
European Commission said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This framework provides the security that the market for
online transactions demands and strengthens the EU's position in
the face of international competition in this new global market,"
it added.
</P>
<P>
Electronic signatures allow someone receiving data over
electronic networks, via the Internet for example, to determine
the origin of the data and to check that the data had not been
altered.
</P>
<P>
The directive is not designed to regulate everything in detail
but defines the requirements for electronic signature certificates
and certification services so as to ensure minimum levels of
security and allow their free movement throughout the Internet
market, the EU executive said.

<HEADLINE> China Ready to Work Together with Other Asian Countries: Zhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Singapore, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
said here Tuesday that China stands ready to continue to work
together with other Asian countries and safeguard the healthy
atmosphere and momentum of dialogue and cooperation with a view to
maintaining peace, stability and prosperity in the region in the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the statement while delivering a speech at the
"Singapore Lecture," which is the 17th of a series hosted by
Singapore's Institute of Southeast Asian Studies and designed to
provide an opportunity for distinguished statesmen and leaders to
reach a wider audience in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said China, as one of the initiators of the Five Principles
of Peaceful Co-existence, has developed ties of
good-neighborliness and friendship with other Asian countries
strictly according to the principles of mutual respect, treating
each other as equals, seeking common ground while shelving
differences and conducting mutually-beneficial cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The ever-growing ties between China and other Asian countries
have shown that as long as these principles are upheld, all
countries in Asia can live together in peace and harmony despite
differences in the size, historical background, social system,
level of development, cultural tradition and value, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
He said good-neighborliness, friendship and peace represent the
common interests and needs of China and ASEAN countries, adding
that the rejuvenation of China's economy cannot be achieved
without the development of Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said the government and people of China stands ready to work
together with other Asian countries and people in the following
aspects:
</P>
<P>
-- To continue to develop the partnership of
good-neighborliness and mutual trust between China and other Asian
nations in line with the purposes of the Joint Statement issued by
Chinese President Jiang Zemin and leaders of ASEAN nations in 1997
and the documents governing the cross-century development of
bilateral relations signed between China and some Asian countries
and on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Co-existence;
</P>
<P>
-- To pay close attention to the trend of economic
globalization and respond to it in an active and prudent manner by
choosing a development road suited to itself and proceeding from
its specific national conditions;
</P>
<P>
-- To endeavor to improve the hi-tech level and increase the
ability for technical innovation by giving top priority to
accelerating scientific and technological progress and innovation
in the development strategy and laying emphasis on the fundamental
role of education and actively recruiting professionals with

</P>
<P>
-- To establish a full-fledged and sound financial system that
is efficient and reliable so as to eliminate the latent dangers
that might lead to a financial crisis, and to continue to
intensify the financial reform;
</P>
<P>
-- To give play to the proper role of the market and the
government with a view to realizing economic reinvigoration so as
to increase economic vitality and efficiency and strengthen macro
control of the national economy;
</P>
<P>
-- To continue to tap the potentials for mutually beneficial
cooperation between China and ASEAN countries in areas such as
trade, investment, science and technology, agriculture, tourism,
machinery and electronics, telecommunications, medicine,
environmental protection and human resources development.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu said China hopes to establish contacts with the
ASEAN Free Trade Area and the ASEAN Investment Area and is ready
to provide funding support to the development of the Mekong River
basin area.
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed that China welcomes ASEAN entrepreneurs to
China for economic, trading and investment activities, and in
particular, their participation in the all-out development
strategy of China's western region and will continue to encourage
and support Chinese enterprises to invest and set up factories in
ASEAN countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also stressed that China faithfully observes the political
consensus reached with ASEAN , ready to continue to safeguard the
healthy atmosphere and momentum of dialogue and cooperation and
properly address differences and disputes through friendly
consultations on an equal footing.

developments in China and put forth his views on the development
prospects for China and Asia. He was given a standing ovation when
he was stepping onto the podium.
</P>

Singapore Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong chaired the
lecture which was attended by more than 1,200 people, including
Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, government ministers,
well-known business leaders and foreign ambassadors.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Calls for Iranian Steps in Solving Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Tuesday urged
Iran to take steps to resolve the dispute with the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) over three Gulf islands.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to mark what the Arab League said the 28-year
occupation of the islands by Iran, the pan-Arab organization
demanded the Iranian government "take functional steps that will
translate its declared good intentions" over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Iran sent troops to the islands of Greater Tunb, Less Tunb and
Abu Musa after British withdrawal in 1971. The UAE also claims
sovereignty over the islands near the strategic Straits of
Hormuz. But the two countries have said they are ready to solve
the dispute through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged Iran to respond to UAE's initiative to
solve the problem through international arbitration, a way the
league said is in line with good neighborliness, mutual interests
and international laws.
</P>
<P>
Iran, however, prefers direct negotiations with the UAE.
</P>
<P>
A peaceful solution to the dispute will have a positive impact
on the security and stability in the strategically important Gulf
region, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The league said in the statement that it made the call out of
keenness on improving the Arab-Iranian relations.

<HEADLINE> Musharraf Rules out Putting Kashmir on Back Burner </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervaiz Musharraf has ruled out the possibility of putting
the Kashmir issue on the back burner and said it was the main
impediment in the improvement of relations between Pakistan and
India.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe in distorting views for the sake of diplomacy.
Kashmir is the core issue. Now if anyone thinks it is not, I
really don't know how to convince them otherwise," he said in an
interview with the Times Asia magazine.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question regarding the "new approach" for
improvement of relations with India, Musharraf said: "If you mean
to put Kashmir aside, how can you do that?"
</P>
<P>
"We are killing each other on the Line of Control. People are
dying in Kashmir and I go happy and smiling and grinning and meet
all the Indian leaders? We are talking something and thinking
something else in our hearts. So are they," he said. "I'm not like
that. I can't do that. If there is some tension in my heart, it is
on my face. I'm not a believer in these things."
</P>
<P>
On the Kargil conflict this summer, the chief executive said:
"I was chief of the army staff, so I take full responsibility for
whatever my army does or does not do."
</P>
<P>
However, he said the Kargil issue has to be seen in the total
perspective of Kashmir and such actions and far-reaching decisions
were not taken by one man alone. "Everyone was on board, including
the (deposed) prime minister who was very much aware of the whole
package."
</P>
<P>
"As far as my attitude toward India is concerned, I've been
very realistic," he said. "We have fought wars over Kashmir and
every day there is an exchange of fire along the Line of Control.
I surely believe there has to be peace in the region and we have
to resolve all our issues with India."
</P>
<P>
"That is the only way this region can progress economically.
It's the poorest region in the world. But can we do anything
without progress on Kashmir? No, we can't, it's just not
realistic," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Kashmir has to be addressed "because this is the issue
that is hampering any kind of agreement between the two
countries."
</P>
<P>
He said it would be very disappointing if U.S. President Bill
Clinton would bypass Pakistan on his planned South Asia visit next
year. "I feel that by coming here, the president of the United
States will have a positive impact. His visit will affect the
whole region. Sidelining Pakistan would be counter-productive.
There would be a gap in his understanding. The people of Pakistan
would be terribly disappointed."

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Confirms Plan to Visit West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
on Tuesday confirmed to visiting Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat that he plans to visit the West Bank early next year.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is being treated at the Central Clinical Hospital for
suspected pneumonia. He said in a telephone conversation with
Arafat that he would visit the city of Bethlehem in early January
as part of Orthodox celebrations to mark the 2000th anniversary of
Christ's birth.
</P>
<P>
"The president confirmed that he would visit holy sites in
Palestine as earlier planned," the Interfax news agency quoted
Arafat as saying at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin reiterated Moscow's support for the Palestinians' right
to self-determination and the creation of their own state, Kremlin
spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here Monday on a two-day working visit, has
left Moscow Tuesday for Cairo, Egypt. He also held meetings with
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and Foreign Minister Igor

<HEADLINE> Quebec Court Rules on Use of Chinese Language in Chinese Hospital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Quebec Superior court has
ruled the Chinese language can be a job requirement for nurses at
the Montreal Chinese Hospital, the local newspaper Gazette
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Under a ruling made on November 18 by Justice Irving Halperin,
the hospital could demand a knowledge of Chinese as a job
requirement for nurses.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that the hospital not only has the right but the
duty to defend its own best interests, with a goal toward
protecting its patients' welfare and protecting their rights,"
wrote Halperin.
</P>
<P>
About 63 percent of patients at the Montreal Chinese Hospital
are unilingual Chinese, who say, "the staff are very nice, but
they don't always understand them (the patients)."
</P>
<P>
In one case, the Montreal-based Gazette reported, May Poon's
elderly mother wanted to go to the toilet, but nobody understood
what she was saying.
</P>
<P>
Poon is one of several Chinese Montrealers who feel that more
staff at the hospital should speak either the Cantonese or
Toisanese dialects, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Greece Blasts Turkish PM's Statement on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday criticized the
statement made by Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit concerning
the neighboring country's stance on Cyprus and the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that Turkey's position was undermining its
own European prospects.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was not being asked to make any concessions but it was
being asked to respect international law and international
treaties, he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman pointed out that Athens would set out its
position on the issue of Turkey's European Union (EU) candidate
status at the December Helsinki summit on the basis of
developments expected during the discussion on this issue.
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been at
odds over their disputes in the territorial waters, air space
limits and the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea, and the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
Athens has said that it is now ready to support Ankara's EU
accession due to the recent improvement in the relations between
the two neighbors, but it is also awaiting the goodwill gestures
from Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit reportedly said Monday that Turkey did not intend to
make concessions neither on Cyprus nor the Aegea Sea.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Athens will possibly veto Turkey's
EU candidacy if the substance of its demands is not met.

<HEADLINE> Wide Gap Exists in World on Telecom Networks: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Minister of Post,
Telegraph and Telephone Mohammad Reza Aref said here on Tuesday
that despite great progress in the field of communications
technology, there is wide gap in the world in terms of access to
telecom networks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural session of the 8th General Assembly
Conference and 23rd meeting of Asia-Pacific Telecommunity (APT),
Aref said the current gap at the international level caused the
United Nations administrative committee to declare emergence of a
new kind of poverty called information poverty in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the beginning of 1998, 15 percent of
the world population had 65 percent of telephone lines and
84 percent of mobile telephone subscribers, 91 percent of fax
users and 97 percent of internet subscribers were from the
developed countries, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister called on the Geneva-based International
Telecommunication Union and the Bangkok-based APT to work to
narrow the gap between the rich and poor nations in terms of
communication technological know-how.
</P>
<P>
The conference attended by 34 countries and 40 private
companies will run for six days until December 6.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has
agreed to provide about 20 million U.S. dollars in grant
assistance for the implementation of a basic and primary education
program in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
The program, which is being implemented over a period of five
years beginning the fiscal year 1999/2000, aims to enhance the
enrollment of primary schools, improving learning achievement, and
building institutional capacity in planning, monitoring and
improving the performance of primary level of education.
</P>
<P>
The program is expected to benefit about 3.3 million children
in government-aided schools and 300,000 children in alternative
schools.
</P>
<P>
Upon the completion of the program in 2004, net enrollment
ratio and primary cycle completion ratio are expected to reach 90
percent and 75 percent from the present levels of 79 percent and
41 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The program is financed by a consortium of donors, including
the World Bank, Denmark, Finland, Norway and the European Union.
Other donors providing support to the sub-sectors include Japan,
the Asian Development Bank and the United Nations Children's Fund.

<P>
DHAKA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The chiefs of four opposition
parties in Bangladesh met for the first time here Tuesday to work
out strategies to intensify their on-going movement to unseat the
government.
</P>
<P>
During the much talked about meeting, the four leaders decided
to further consolidate the unity of the opposition alliance and
intensify their movement to compel the government of Sheikh Hasina
to step down.
</P>
<P>
"A patriotic government will have to be formed on the basis of
the broad-based unity of the people to face the challenges of the
new century," said a Joint Declaration signed by Khaleda zia of
the Bangladesh Nationalist party, Ershad of Jatiya Party, Golam
Azam of Jamaat-e-Islami and Azizul Huq of Islami Oikhy Jote
(Islamic Solidarity Front).
</P>
<P>
The Joint Declaration highlighted politicization by the
government, its failure to meet election pledges, "anti-people and
anti-national" Ganges Water Sharing Treaty signed with India and
deterioration of law and order.
</P>
<P>
The declaration called on people across the country to form
committees focused on forcing the government to resign and hand
over the power to a caretaker government.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Expects European Defense Concretized in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder expected on Tuesday that an autonomous defense capacity
of European Union (EU) countries will be concretized during France
's rotating EU presidency in the second half of 2000.
</P>
<P>
In a speech addressed to the French National Assembly,
Schroeder said that the decisions concerning the definition of the
policy of security and defense of EU would be adopted under the
French presidency, so that EU could have an increased capacity of
military action.
</P>
<P>
"That will be an important step in which we will fully support
France," said the chancellor, who was here to attend the 74th
Franco-German summit.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder and French President Jacques Chirac announced on
Tuesday that France, Germany, Britain and Italy have agreed upon a
plan on military structures for the future European defense force
within the EU.
</P>
<P>
"In concertation with our British friends, Germany and France
will make sure that these efforts be achieved under the French
presidency,'' said Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
The Franco-German declaration followed the one made by France
and Britain last Thursday in London, which calls for the
establishment of an autonomous European force of from 50,000 to 60,
000 men, who are capable of dealing with crises without
participation of the United States.
</P>
<P>
Such a European force is aimed at reinforcing the ``European
pillar'' of NATO, said officials in Paris, Berlin and London.

<HEADLINE> WHO Chief Calls for Health-Related New Global Trading System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The head of the World Health
Organization (WHO) has called on trade ministers and negotiators
to strive for an international trade system that promotes human
progress for all.
</P>
<P>
In a statement made public here Tuesday when representatives
from 135 members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) began their
four-day conference in Seattle, WHO Director-General Gro Harlem
Brundtland said that those in charge of global trade must place at
the core of their attention the striking market failure that one
third of the world population still lack access to essential drugs.
</P>
<P>
In the poorest parts of Africa and Asia, the WHO chief noted,
over 50 percent of the population are deprived of access to the
essential drugs. "This is simply not acceptable," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The last WTO round provided the Agreement on Trade Related
Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). It provides scope
for the protection of public health," she recalled. "WHO member
states have been urged to explore and review their options under
international agreements, including trade agreements, to safeguard
access to essential drugs."
</P>
<P>
Brundtland said that WHO would monitor the implementation of
the TRIPS agreement and advise countries on policies which will
help protect and enhance their public health policies.
</P>
<P>
She urged the governments, which are both WTO and WHO members,
"to honor their commitments to make health central to human
development".
</P>
<P>
"Issues such as removal of trade barriers, standards for food
safety, and access to drugs are key ingredients for measuring
progress in health and development," she stressed. "Health is not
a side-effect of trade, it is a yardstick to monitor human
progress."

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges to Help Avert Russia's Isolation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In reporting on the situation in the Caucusus, Ranieri said
Chechyna at present poses the chief danger to relations between
the Kremlin and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
"An isolated Russia constitutes a much greater threat than a
Russia aware of its role as a continental power ready to shoulder
the obligations that derive from international cooperation," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's passage from a military to a regional policy in
Chechnya is "inevitable", he claimed.
</P>
<P>
Europe must follow this tack, in keeping with the approach
adopted in Istanbul earlier this month by the 54-nation
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
The OSCE committed itself to "prevent the explosion of violent
conflicts wherever possible" through the "development of its peace-
keeping role".
</P>
<P>
Ranieri stressed, however, that despite the wish to avert
Moscow's isolation, "it is evident" that should the military
offensive continue unabated, international financial organizations
and the EU would have to review their joint cooperation strategy
with Russia.

<HEADLINE> Problems Between Turkey, Greece Should be Resolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem said on Tuesday that problems between Turkey and
Greece should be resolved through "peaceful methods."
</P>
<P>
Cem made the remarks in a written statement concerning the
incoming European Union (EU) summit in Helsinki, Finland, which
will discuss if to give Turkey candidacy for EU membership, the
Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that "Turkey does not have any territorial ambitions
from Greece. It is possible for the two neighboring and allied
countries to change the Aegean Sea into a sea of friendship and
peace by acceptable means. This should be the common target of the
two countries."
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both NATO members, have been locked in
disputes for decades over territorial waters, air space limits,
delimitation of the continental shelf in the Aegean Sea, and the
Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
On Turkey's application for entry into the EU, Cem said in the
statement that progress in Turkey's full EU membership would make
a considerable contribution to the security in the region where
Turkey is located.
</P>
<P>
But he pointed out that the Cyprus issue and the relations
between Turkey and EU are two separate issues.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey is absolutely opposed to evaluation of the relations
with the EU within the context of Cyprus," he added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the land
in the wake of a pro-Athens coup. Turkey and Greece supported
their own ethnic side.
</P>
<P>
Problems including Turkey-Greece relations have affected
Turkey's efforts to join EU which Turkey has applied for since
1987. But Cem emphasized that inclusion of Turkey into EU is a
prior target of Turkey but not an obsession.

Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, the two countries' leaders are expected to

Vietnam's debts to it, which total 150 million U.S. dollars, to
re-invest in tea and coffee growing and processing in Vietnam for
export to Algeria.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam and Algeria have signed a number of cooperation
agreements in trade, economy, science and technology, culture and
information, an agreement on visa exemption for diplomatic and

YANTAI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A total of 60 bodies of the
victims of the Dashun shipwreck have been found from the wrecked
ship since some 100 divers joined the recovery efforts three days

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- A total of 1,766 Greek
Cypriots Tuesday went to the Turkish Cypriots-controlled northern
part of Cyprus to visit the monastery of Saint Apostolos Andreas,
in the eastern tip of the island.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by U.N. peacekeepers, clutching candles in their
hands, they crossed into the northern Cyprus to pray at the
monastery on the occasion of the saint's day. The journey to the
monastery by bus took about three hours.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated
south and the Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Before 1974, thousands of pilgrims visited the monastery on
the saint's day.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Greek Cypriots paid several visits
to the northern Turkish Cypriot area on special religious days,
such as Easter Sunday or Assumption day.
</P>
<P>
Similar trips were also arranged for Turkish Cypriots over
the past few years to places of worship in the
southern area, which is controlled by the Cyprus government.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM Blasts West Over Chechnya, Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov on Tuesday blasted the West for exerting pressure on Russia
over Chechnya and conniving with genocide against Serbs in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He said Western countries were trying to force Russia out of
the Caucasus and the Caspian region.
</P>
<P>
Moscow "will resolutely resist" such attempts, Ivanov told a
press conference.
</P>
<P>
"An evident battle for spheres of influence is underway in the
Caspian region and the Caucasus," the minister said. "Individual
states located thousands of kilometers from these strategically
important regions have declared them to be zones of vital interest.
"
</P>
<P>
"Attempts are being made to supplant Russia and other states,
particularly Iran, in those regions. But those are the countries
for which the Caspian region and the Caucasus are indeed vitally
important," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Moscow views the policies of several Western
countries toward the events in Chechnya "as an attempt to limit
Russia's capabilities in the Caucasus."
</P>
<P>
Russian federal troops are in the middle of a major campaign to
root out rebels in the breakaway republic. The military actions
were taken following armed Chechen incursions into neighboring
Daghestan and a spate of terrorist bombings that killed over 300
people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov also criticized a project on the planned Baku-Ceyhan oil
export pipeline as another attempt at forcing Russia out of the
Caucasus. The pipeline would bypass Russia and Iran in
transporting Caspian oil to the West.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan signed an agreement
on the U.S.- supported deal in Istanbul, Turkey, during the mid-
November summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe (OSCE).
</P>
<P>
The project is "not viable according to analyses by several
Western experts, and is only being implemented under strong
pressure from the U.S.," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
On Kosovo, the foreign minister said Western countries are
conniving with genocide against non-Albanian residents in the
Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
"Flagrant genocide is being carried out towards ethnic
minorities in Kosovo," he said, noting that some 200,000 Serbs and
other non-Albanians have recently left the region.
</P>
<P>
"Neither Washington, nor Berlin, nor London has voiced any
condemnation of the terrorists' outrages," Ivanov said. "They try
to create the impression that all is normal in Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"Such appeasement of Albanian separatists is fraught with dire
consequences for the Balkans," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said Russia will shortly call a session of the U.N.
Security Council to consider the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"As a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, Russia no
longer intends to tolerate the present situation in Kosovo and
expects the Council to take measures for implementing its
Resolution 1244," he told reporters following a meeting with his
Greek counterpart, George Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
In addition to raising the Kosovo issue at the U.N. Security
Council, Ivanov said, Russia "will use other means at its disposal
to solve the problem," Interfax reported.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Rises Sharply In November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, November 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. consumer confidence
index rose more than five points to 135.8 in November, up from 130.
5, in October following four monthly declines in a row, The
Conference Board said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, the U.S. prominent research group, said
in a survey that the latest index reading was driven by growing
optimism about economic conditions over the next six months.
</P>
<P>
"A booming economy and a strong job market have consumers in a
confident, free-spending mode," said Lynn Franco, Director of The
Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. "This is reflected in
robust retail spending both on-line and in person. With increasing
numbers of consumers expecting their incomes to rise, it's not
surprising that $4,000 leather bags and 3,000 cashmere coats are
selling briskly, along with $15 Pokemon toys and $25 computer
mouses."
</P>
<P>
Consumers' expectations were up sharply from October, the
research group said, adding that nearly 28 percent of all
consumers anticipate an increase in their incomes, up from 24
percent last months and a smaller percentage of respondents expect
business conditions to worsen.
</P>
<P>
The outlook for the labor market was also more optimistic than
last month and 16.4 percent of consumers expect more jobs to be
available in the coming six months, up from 15.9 percent in the
previous survey, it said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator
because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the nation's
overall economic activity. The consumer confidence index has a
base of 100, set in 1985.

<HEADLINE> . Greece Ready to Tackle Y2K Problem, Says Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Greece is fully prepared to
tackle any possible problems caused by the millennium bug or Y2K
in computer and electronic systems in the public sector at the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Greece's Interior Minister
Vasso Papandreou said Tuesday that all the procedures required to
make systems year 2000 compliant have been taken by the country's
Public Power Corporation, Public Gas Corporation and Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization.
</P>
<P>
Data current to end-October shows that Greece's national
carrier, the Olympic Airways, is 99 percent year 2000 compliant,
as are the Greek Railways, the Athens and Piraeus Water and Sewage
Company, the stock market and public administration.
</P>
<P>
Greece has contingency plans ready in the event of any problem,
she said, adding that a special operations room has been set up at
the secretariat general for civil protection specifically to deal
with problems related to Y2K.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the secretariat general for consumers said Tuesday
that it will launch an information campaign in December to
reliably inform consumers about the dangers and myths of the
millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
The campaign will include television and radio spots, the
publication of leaflets, brochures and posters, and the holding of
a special talk on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the campaign is to avoid unnecessary rumor-mongering
about the effect of Y2K on the consumer, and how consumers can
best deal with practical problems they face in tackling the Y2K
problem in relation to personal computers, household appliances
and other small electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
Greece is reportedly among the "moderately prepared" countries
for the millennium bug.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Sets Principles for Negotiations with Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese parliamentary
committees Tuesday convened to lay down the principles
the country will hold in the future negotiations with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Under the chairmanship of House Speaker Nabih Berri and with
the presence of Prime Minister Salim Hoss and Defense Minister
Ghazi Zuetir, the committees of foreign, and security and
defense affairs issued a statement after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The statement said in the future negotiations with Israel,
Lebanon will demand its long-time enemy to implement all
international resolutions calling for an Israeli withdrawal from
occupied Arab lands, including south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been keeping a rein of parts of Lebanon since 1978
and set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in 1985
with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon will be opposed to any agreement regarding Palestinian
refugees at its expense, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Some 360,000 registered Palestinian refugees are living in 12
camps across Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese government fears that Palestinian Authority will
settle those refugees in the country in turn for Israeli
acceptance for the establishment of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
The statement added that Lebanon will also ask Israel to
free all Lebanese held in Israeli jails and compensate for
the damages inflicted during the Israeli agressions to the
country and stop plundering Lebanon's water.
</P>
<P>
In a related development in the same day, European Union
(EU)'s Middle East peace envoy Miguel Angel Moratinos held
talks with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and Hoss.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the diplomat said the aim of his visit
is to assess the prospects for reviving peace talks on the
Lebanese and Syrian tracks.
</P>
<P>
"We have entered the last stage of the peace process and
it is time for the concerned parties to make difficult
decisions," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos, who came here Monday night, visited Syria and
Jordan last week for the same purpose.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Leaves for U.S. to for Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides Tuesday said although there is a hardening of the
Turkish stance, an international interest still runs high to solve
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Clerides made the remarks before his departure to the
U.N. headquarters in New York for the proximity talks scheduled on
December on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Refraining from expressing optimism for the talks sponsored by
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, Clerides said that he will go
to New York for discussions and expects to see if there will be
any response.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Clerides was accompanied by Foreign Minister Ioannis
Kasoulides, government spokesman Michalis Papapetrou,
Undersecretary to the President Pantelis Kouros, Attorney-General
Alecos Markides and other officials.
</P>
<P>
The proximity talks will be directed by Annan and by his
representative, Peruvian diplomat Alfonso de Soto.
</P>
<P>
There is little optimism among Cyprus' political circles for
the talks because of Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash's
insistence on the recognition of breakaway republic before direct
talks, which broke down two years ago, can resume.

<HEADLINE> Security Council to Address Root Causes of Armed Conflicts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Tuesday adopted a presidential statement, voicing its
willingness to attach great importance to addressing the root
causes of armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council stresses the importance of a coordinated
international response to economic, social, cultural or
humanitarian problems, which are often the root causes of armed
conflicts," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement came at the end of an open debate held by the
Security Council to discuss the 15-nation Council's role in the
prevention of armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"Recognizing the need for the development of effective long-
term strategies, it emphasizes the need for all United Nations
organs and agencies to pursue preventive strategies and to take
action within their respective areas of competence to assist
Member States to eradicate poverty, strengthen development
cooperation and assistance and promote respect for human rights
and fundamental freedoms," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Council emphasizes the need fully to respect and implement
the principles and provisions of the Charter of the United Nations
and norms of international law, in particular in this context
those related to prevention of armed conflicts and settlement of
disputes by peaceful means," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It will give special attention to the humanitarian
consequences of armed conflicts," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council emphasizes the important role of the
Secretary-General in the prevention of armed conflicts," the
statement said. "The Council expresses its readiness to consider
appropriate preventive action in response to the matters brought
to its attention by States or the Secretary-General and which it
deems likely to threaten international peace and security."
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will also consider other preventive
measures such as the establishment of demilitarized zones and
preventive disarmament, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council recognizes the link between the prevention
of armed conflicts, the facilitation of the peaceful settlement of
disputes and the promotion of security for the civilian population,
in particular the protection of human life, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council recognizes the important role that
regional organizations and arrangements are playing in the
prevention of armed conflicts, including through the development
of confidence-and security-building measures," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"It emphasizes the importance of cooperation between the United
Nations and regional organizations in preventive activities in
accordance with Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations,
" the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Council welcomes meetings between the United Nations,
including the Security Council, and regional organizations, and
encourages participants to continue to focus those meetings on
issues related to prevention of armed conflicts," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will also consider the possibility of a
meeting at the level of Foreign Ministers on the issue of the
prevention of armed conflicts during the Millennium Assembly,
which is to be held in September 2000.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. Charter, the Security Council has the primary
responsibility for the maintenance of world peace and security, it
therefore, should bear major responsibility in the prevention of
armed conflicts in the world at large.

<HEADLINE> Angola Introduces Bill to Deter Oil Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has
drawn up a specific environment protection bill to prevent
ecological disaster caused by the oil production in the country, a
government official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Petroleum Botelho de Vasconcelos said the National
Assembly is expected to approve the bill as the ruling People's
Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA) takes over two-thirds of the
parliamentary seats.
</P>
<P>
It is "extremely important" for the oil producing country to
enact the environment protection law because the oil production,
which is Angola's pillar industry, is prone to bring about
environment pollution, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Although there is no any major ecological disaster happened in
Angola, the government should take precautions against it and
protect the environment for the people, he added.
</P>
<P>
The bill stipulates provisions of the environment protection
for oil producing sector, under which specific institutions will
be set up to cope with major environmental disasters.
</P>
<P>
Angola is the second largest oil producer in Africa with a
daily output of 750,000 barrels, which are mostly from the
off-shore oil fields in the provinces of Zaire and Cabinda.

</P>
<P>
In a statement to mark the World AIDS Day which falls on

work together with the public at large in the fight against the
pandemic.
</P>
<P>
A five-year national program has been formulated to tackle the

HIV/AIDS, Negaso said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said, preparations were well underway to establish
a governmental secretarial office and national council charged

<HEADLINE> Iranian Parliament to Probe into Serial Political </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (parliament)
has formed a 15-strong investigation team to probe into the
serial political killings of writers and intellectuals late last
year.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a group of parliamentary reporters, Ali Movahedi
Savoji, chairman of the Majlis commission of councils and internal
affairs, said on Tuesday the investigation team is expected to
start work next week.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 parliamentarians from different political factions
signed a petition earlier this year asking for an
investigation of the spate of political murders last year, he
said.
</P>
<P>
In November and December last year, the leader of the Iran
Nation Party Darius Forouhar and his wife were stabbed to death
at home and at least three dissident writers were mysteriously
killed in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Intelligence Ministry announced in January that some
of its own agents were involved in the political murders.
The revelation triggered an intense political quarrel between the
conservative and moderate factions and forced former Intelligence
Minister Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi to resign.
</P>
<P>
Former Deputy Intelligence Minister for Political and Security
Affairs Saeed Emami was believed to be the mastermind behind
the political killings. But Emami committed suicide in prison
June by taking in depilatory substance while taking a bath.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Judicial Organization of the Iranian Armed
Forces Mohammad Niazi said earlier that a total of 23 people
have been arrested in connection with the political killings
while 33 others have been summoned for questioning.
</P>
<P>
However, some local dailies alleged that Emami was not the
highest agent behind the political killings, because he had no
right to issue religious verdicts against dissident writers.
</P>
<P>
Savoji said that according to the Majlis statute on the
subject, all the agencies and institutions which are in
possession of papers and documents concerning the serial murders
have to deliver them to the investigating team.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the investigating team would refrain from
divulging certain confidential and secret information, but a
major part of the subject should not be considered as secret.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome any assistance on the part of the colleagues and
officials in performing this mission," he said.

LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- As the formal process begins of
transferring power to a Northern Ireland Assembly, the Irish
Republican Army said on Tuesday that it is unhappy with the
decommissioning timetable.
</P>
<P>
The republican paramilitary group released a statement
describing the Ulster Unionists' effective February deadline for
decommissioning as a "clear departure" from the agreement reached
in the recent Mitchell review.
</P>
<P>
However, it confirmed it would still be sending a
representative to meet the international body on decommissioning,
the crucial concession it made during the talks chaired by former
US senator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
The transfer of power from London to Belfast is expected to be
completed by Thursday. It comes after Monday's formation of a
cross-party government-in-waiting at Stormont, Belfast.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British politicians gathered on Tuesday to rush laws
through parliament to cement a fledgling Northern Ireland
government and bolster new hopes of peace.
</P>
<P>
In a historic step towards devolution, Westminster MPs will
pass legislation to switch home rule powers to an assembly in
Belfast.
</P>
<P>
A process which usually takes months will be sped through in
two days, allowing Protestants and Catholics on Thursday to take
up the reins of power held by British ministers for the first time
in 27 years.
</P>
<P>
Peers in the House of Lords passed the motion on Tuesday
afternoon, sending it to the main legislative chamber, the House
of Commons, to discuss until midnight.

<HEADLINE> Russia Condemns U.S.-British Bombing of Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Tuesday condemned the
United States and Britain for their bombing of Iraq civilian sites
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The continued bombing represents "a glaring violation of the
fundamental norms and principles of international law and morality,
" the ministry said in a report carried by the Interfax news
agency.
</P>
<P>
On November 28, Anglo-American aircraft attacked civilian
targets near the Iraqi town of Mosul, wounding eight peaceful
civilians, including women and children, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said claims by Washington and London that "their actions are
legitimate... hold no water" because the so-called no-fly zones
have been arbitrarily set without U.N. Security Council approval.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry also regards as inconsistent suggestions
that the strikes are in "self-defense."
</P>
<P>
What this amounts to, the report said, is "the arbitrarily
assumed right to patrol the air space of a sovereign country."

<HEADLINE> NATO to Reconsider Candidates in 2002: Cohen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense
William Cohen said here Tuesday that NATO would make a new
appraisal of the candidates toward their integration with the
Alliance in the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
Cohen made the remark soon after the Bucharest meeting of
defense ministers of southeastern Europe. "By then, we will
collaborate with Romania in order to help it attain its goal,"
Cohen added, explaining that Romania still had to make important
steps on the way to NATO integration.
</P>
<P>
Cohen listed the main targets Romania had to attain in view of
its integration with the Alliance: the building up of a market
economy, the achievement of a stable democracy, the implementation
of civil control of the Army and the ability to demonstrate it
would provide security in the region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of defense appreciated Romania's wish and
actions for integration in the Euro-Atlantic structures,
emphasizing the country's efforts on this line, in spite of the
difficulties it had to cope with.

<HEADLINE> Russia accepts OIC Delegation on Chechnya: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Iran said on Tuesday that
Russia had agreed to an Iranian proposal to allow an Iran-led
Islamic delegation to Moscow for talks on the Chechen issue.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Republic News Agency reported that Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov has informed Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi of Russian cabinet's consent with proposal over telephone
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet accepted the proposal in light of the friendly
relations between Iran and Russia and the fruitful negotiations
held in Tehran during my stay in Iran," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov also voiced Moscow's readiness to receive Iranian
humanitarian assistance to the Chechen refugees who fled the
Russian military operations in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with Ivanov when he paid a
one-day visit to Iran Sunday, Kharrazi said that he has proposed a
visit by a delegation of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) to Moscow to discuss the Chechen issue and Ivanov
promised to convey the proposal to the Russian cabinet soon.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced Tehran's readiness to provide humanistic
assistance to Chechen refugees who fled their hometowns during
recent Russian military operations in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Iran, Ivanov stressed that Chechen issue was
an internal affair of Russian Federation, denying any attacks on
Chechnya and massacre of civilians.
</P>
<P>
Before anything else it should be said that no such attacks
have been or can be made on Chechnya because the territory is part
of the Russian Federation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that Russian operations are not against Muslims,
but terrorists, irrespective of their nationality or religious
affiliation.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Hails Rebirth of East African Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has hailed the remarkable progress East Africa has
achieved in resurrecting the regional community, according to a
press release issued by the Presidential Office Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony of the treaty for the rebirth
of the East African Community (EAC) in Arusha, Tanzania Tuesday
afternoon, Museveni said by signing the treaty, the three East
African countries have expressed their readiness to exploit
together available opportunities for the development of the
people.
</P>
<P>
The development of modern economy demands bigger markets for
processed products. The three countries of Tanzania, Kenya and
Uganda in the region have fulfilled the demands of the Lagos Plan
of Action which called for bigger markets to facilitate
development, he observed.
</P>
<P>
He said that the EAC, now with a population of about 100
million, will necessitate the enactment of policies that can help
people get out of poverty and facilitate private entrepreneurs to
do trade and business.
</P>
<P>
He also thanked the leaders of the member states for making a
step forwards in the political federation of East Africa, saying
economic integration measures should be the basis of steps towards
political integration.
</P>
<P>
At the function, the Ugandan president emphasized the
importance of economically empowering the people so that they get
out of poverty and benefit from an expanding market.
</P>
<P>
The former East African Community was founded in 1967 and fell
out in 1977.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's signing of the treaty is regarded as a big step
towards the re- creation of the regional bloc which is expected to
bind the three countries more closely in politics, economy,
culture and defense.

<HEADLINE> Bolivia to Refuse Political Asylum to Oviedo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Bolivian government said
Tuesday that it will reject any request for political asylum from
Paraguay's former coup leader General Lino Oviedo.
</P>
<P>
Peru's Information Minister Jorge Landivar told the press that
their main interest is "to keep on good terms with Paraguay."
</P>
<P>
According to reports, Oviedo's lawyers have initiated contact
with the Bolivian authorities with a view to possible political
asylum for Oviedo in Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Argentina and Paraguay became tense after
Argentina's refusal to extradite Oviedo to Paraguay on September 2.
Oviedo has resided in Argentina since his self-exile on March 28.
</P>
<P>
The Bolivian minister said, "It is probable, without stating
specific reasons, that an application for asylum from Oviedo will
be refused."
</P>
<P>
Oviedo's supporters believe his asylum status in Argentina may
be disrupted on December 10 after the entry of the new president-
elect, Fernando de la Rua.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay is accusing Oviedo of being one of the intellectual
authors in the murder of the former vice-president, Jose Maria
Argana, which was carried out on March 13, in Ascuncion.

<HEADLINE> Likud Party May Join Israeli cabinet: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 30 (Xinhua) -- After Prime Minister Ehud
Barak met with Likud party's leader Ariel Sharon Tuesday night,
rumors spread fast that the major right-wing opposition party may
be invited to join the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Barak briefed Sharon on the latest
developments in the peace talks with the Palestinians, his recent
visits to the U.S. and Britain, and the potential terror attacks
against Jewish interests abroad, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time Barak met with Sharon since he took
office in July. Israeli political analysts speculated that Barak
might invite the Likud party to balance the power structures in
the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Barak formed a ruling coalition after the general election
victory, which controls 73 seats in the 120-member Knesset
(parliament).
</P>
<P>
But the 5-seat-holder ultra-Orthodox party of United Torah
Judaism has quit the coalition in September. Another
ultra-Orthodox Shas party, which controls 17 seats, also has
threatened to quit to protest against the government's accusation
of its educational network.
</P>
<P>
In order to reach a framework agreement in final-status
negotiations with the Palestinians by next February and final
peace treaty by September 2000, Barak needs a more solid and
broad base in the cabinet to support his peace efforts.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects U.S. Allegation on Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Asefi said that the Islamic Republic of Iran has been
among victims of terrorism, the Islamic Republic News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Such baseless propaganda campaign of the U.S. is a threadbare
tactic which has proved to be futile two decades after the
establishment of the Islamic Republic of Iran in 1979, he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin on Monday accused
Iran of reneging on promises to abandon support for terrorism in
an attempt to destroy hopes among Arabs and Israelis for a
comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said senior Iranian officials have publicly
denounced terrorism and it is "reasonable for us to expect that
the actions and policies of the Islamic Republic (of Iran)
should reflect these statements."
</P>
<P>
He accused Iran of encouraging terrorist activities involving
the Iran-backed Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas and several radical
Palestinian groups, including Hamas in the Palestinian West Bank
and Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
"We have made clear to Iran that there cannot be an
improvement in relations until Iran takes meaningful steps to
end its support for terrorism and cooperates in the fight
against terrorism," Rubin said, "there cannot be a lifting of
the sanctions we imposed in the absence of meaningful steps
to those ends."
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian spokesman said that Iran supports the
Palestinian nation in their efforts to restore their rights
and liberate their own land.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. claim against Iran is repeated at a time when
the Israeli prime minister openly opposes the return of the
Palestinian refugees to their homeland, he said.
</P>
<P>
Asefi underlined that ignoring the natural rights of the
Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland along with
keeping silence vis-a-vis the Israeli expansionist policies,
brings into question the U.S. sincerity in its support for
peace in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Conditionally Approves Exxon, Mobil Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government
approved Tuesday the 81-billion-U.S.-dollar merger of Exxon and
Mobil, creating the world's largest privately owned petroleum
company.
</P>
<P>
In a 4-0 vote, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) approved an
agreement under which the new company will sell more than 2,400
service stations mostly in the Northeast, California and Texas to
ensure retail competition where the two companies have large,
overlapping market shares.
</P>
<P>
The new company will be called Exxon-Mobil and be based in
Irving, Texas.
</P>
<P>
When Exxon, the country's largest oil producer, and Mobil,
which is the second largest, announced the merger a year ago,
federal regulators and members of Congress voiced concern about
potential anti-competitive problems, especially in retail gasoline
sales in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
To address those concerns, the two companies agreed to demands
by the FTC that they sell off about 15 percent of their retail
outlets -- or 2,413 service stations -- mostly in New England, the
mid-Atlantic states, Texas and California -- where the two
companies in some areas control 20 to 35 percent of the retail
market.
</P>
<P>
Exxon also will have to sell a refinery near Benicia,
California, some petroleum terminal areas and pipeline assets, the
FTC said.
</P>
<P>
Without such divestitures, the merger "would significantly
injure competition" in the areas of retail sales and in oil
refining in California, the FTC concluded.
</P>
<P>
While the FTC order reflects the most extensive divestitures in
the agency's history, they still represent only a small portion of
the two companies' nearly 16,000 gasoline stations and 138 billion
dollars in combined assets.
</P>
<P>
The two companies have said the merger was needed to reduce
costs and compete with the huge, low-cost government-owned oil
companies in Saudi Arabia, Iran, Mexico and Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Savings from the merger are projected at 2.8 billion dollars a
year and about 9,000 jobs will be cut from the combined firm's 123,
000 employees worldwide.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Tuesday that it had no objection to moves by Germany and France to
develop a force within NATO as that would relieve the United
States of lion's share of the military burden.
</P>
<P>
"We're encouraged, we're supportive, we're welcoming of efforts
by key European allies, those who have the capability or the
potential to improve their capability," State Department spokesman
James Rubin said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany issued a communiqu on Tuesday at a one-day
summit that the two countries support a new force that would
intervene in circumstances that did not affect the Atlantic
alliance as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The circumstance were not spelled out, nor was how much say
other NATO members would have in the new force's missions.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany also want to boost Europe's military air
capabilities and recommended creation of a European air transport
command.
</P>
<P>
"In general, we support a stronger European defense that will
strengthen the trans-Atlantic relationship. That was a key goal
laid out at the NATO summit, the 50th anniversary, last spring,"
Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> WTO Ministerial Opening Delayed Due to Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The opening ceremony of the
World Trade Organization (WTO) Ministerial Conference had to be
delayed due to large-scale demonstrations here in downtown Seattle,
and anti-riot police fired tear-gas to disperse crowds of
protesters who have blocked all entrances to the venue of the
trade summit.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of protesters have gathered since early this morning
around the Paramount Theater, where the opening ceremony was
originally to be held at 10:00 this morning,. The opening session
has been postponed as many delegates have been unable to break the
pitch line and get into the conference hall.
</P>
<P>
Many of the 2500 foreign and local correspondents have also
been kept way from the Media Center at the Washington State
Convention and Trade Center, since almost all entrances to the
Media Center were blocked by the demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, mainly college students, unionists, human
rights advocates and green party activists, chanted anti-WTO
slogans, and sang and danced at the major intersections in the
downtown area, preventing delegates and journalists from getting
into the meeting venue.
</P>
<P>
A foreign diplomat complained that he had to walk for 20
minutes to get into the conference hall, an experience he had
never had before in his career.
</P>
<P>
There are reports that a Colombian delegation headed by foreign
trade minister Martha Lucia Ramirez was attacked by demonstrators
who banged on the roof of their car.
</P>
<P>
"Delegates are being assaulted and they're being bussed to the
convention center, " Reuters quoted a policeman as saying.
</P>
<P>
The situation got intensified at noon, as some demonstrators
smashed shop windows on the street, and in some areas police
scuffled with protesters, and were forced to use pepper spray to
push away the protesting crowd.
</P>
<P>
"The free trade policy of the WTO hurt workers in this country,
and we're worried that our living standards would be lowered down
as more imports from foreign countries flush in," Ryan Fleglo, a
college student protester, told Xinhua corespondent, who
maneuvered to get into the Media Center after milling round for
almost one hour outside the building.
</P>
<P>
Unionists have tried hard to add the matter of labor standards
to the WTO ministerial agenda, an issue that has been opposed by
most developing countries as a hidden protectionism by rich
countries.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said on Tuesday he sympathized with
protesters at the WTO meeting in Seattle and that trade agreements
should take into consideration labor and environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
An Asian journalist said that the U.S. condolence makes one
doubt that it is trying to make use of the public protest as a
leverage to gain up-hand on such contentious issues as labor and
environment in the new round of trade talks.

UNITED NATIONS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council on Tuesday extended the mandate of the United
Nations Civilian Police Mission in Haiti (MIPONUH) for a further
period of three months until March 15, 2000.
</P>
<P>
 In its resolution unanimously adopted, the Security Council
said the mission was extended in order to ensure a phased
transition to an International Civilian Support Mission in Haiti(
MICAH).
</P>
<P>
 The Council requested the U.N. Secretary-General to
coordinate and expedite the transition from MIPONUH to MICAH and
to report to it on the implementation of this resolution by March
1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
 Speaking after voting on the resolution, Chinese delegate
Cheng Xu said China has always supported the efforts made by the
United Nations in assisting Haitian people to get over their
political crisis and start the economic reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
 China supports the proposal made by the U.N. Secretary-
General to set up MICAH and China hopes that the General Assembly
will make a decision on the relevant resolution at an early date,
the delegate said.
</P>
<P>
 Cheng said China believes that when the overall situation in
Haiti is stable, the United Nations should focus its efforts to
help Haiti to fight poverty and restore its economy, and therefore,
China has always held the view that MIPONUH should consider
completing its work in consideration of the overall situation so
that relevant agencies can play a bigger role in the peace-
building field.
</P>
<P>
 China sincerely hopes that Haiti can keep the situation
stable and with the help of the international community, march
towards peace, stability and development, he added.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Dismisses Hubbub over Panama Canal Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton said
on Tuesday that he did not believe Hong Kong-based Hutchison
Whampoa's control of the Panama Canal could hurt national security
once the United States cedes control at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. politicians have recently raised a hubbub that
Hutchison Whampoa is a company that has ties to Beijing and its
win of the right of management of the ports at both ends of the
canal could harm U.S. security.
</P>
<P>
Retired Adm. Thomas Moore, a former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, even made sensational remarks earlier this week
that China was plotting to take over the canal once the United
States relinquishes control and use the area to launch a nuclear
attack on America.
</P>
<P>
Clinton dismissed all those notions, saying he would "very
surprised if any adverse consequences flowed from the Chinese
running the canal."
</P>
<P>
"I think the Chinese will in fact be bending over backward to
make sure that they run it in a competent and able and fair manner,
" Clinton told a news conference at the White House.
</P>
<P>
"This is like them -- is like China coming into the World Trade
Organization. I'll think they'll want to demonstrate to a distant
part of the world that they can be a responsible partner," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He also said he was confident the Panamanian government would
run the canal in an appropriate fashion and reiterated his support
of the handover on Dec. 31, which would end a 96-year U.S.
military presence in Panama.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's the right thing to do," Clinton said. "I think
that the new government of Panama is committed to maintaining the
canal in an appropriate way and keeping it open and working with
us to do so and having good relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said Former President Jimmy Carter and Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright will head a U.S. delegation to attend the
ceremony of handover of the canal.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Milestone in East African Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARUSHA, Tanzania, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Tanzania and
Uganda signed a treaty here Tuesday to revive the defunct East
African Community (EAC), making a big stride forward on the
tortuous road of regional integration.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni fixed their signature
on the 153-article treaty which will decide the destiny of 80
million people residing in an area of 1.8 million square
kilometers facing the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The three Kiswahili-speaking states have enjoyed a long history
of cooperation featured by the Customs Union between kenya and
Uganda in 1917, which Tanzania (then Tanganyika) joined in 1927.
</P>
<P>
Beginning from this, the three neighbors then moved forward to
form the East African High Commission (1948-1961), the East
African Common Services Organization (1961-1967) and the
well-known East African Community (1967- 1977) or EAC.
</P>
<P>
However, the first EAC, in spite of its unremitting exploration
for regional cooperation and development, collapsed in 1977 as
great changes took place due to both internal and external factors
which were not supportive of regional integration at that time.
</P>
<P>
As the time entered the 1990s when a trend of regional
cooperation ran high, Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda were encouraged
to revive the defunct EAC by setting up a Permanent Tripartite
Commission for East African Cooperation on November 30,1993.
</P>
<P>
The commission launched a secretariat at its headquarters in
Arusha on March 14,1996 to coordinate and boost economic,
political and social development in the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Since its founding, the commission had tried to address the
shortcomings inherent in the past cooperation initiatives by
implementing practical policies including a Development Strategy
(1997-2000).
</P>
<P>
It also, among other measures, issued the East African
passports to facilitate the inter-state movement of people,
achieved agreement on unity of the customs by 2000 and adopted a
pact on defense cooperation, forging ahead into finalization of
the reestablishment of a new community.
</P>
<P>
As a milestone in regional integration, the new EAC will expand
and deepen its economic, political and social cooperation among
the partner states for mutual benefits at a higher level.
</P>
<P>
Under the Treaty for Establishment of the East African
Community, a Customs Union will be set up, followed by a Common
Market, a Monetary Union and ultimately a Political Federation of
the East African States.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these ambitions, the EAC pins hope on its main
organs including the Summit of Heads of State, the Council of
Ministers, the Coordination Committee, the Sectoral Committees,
the East African Court of Justice, the East African Legislative
Assembly and the Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
In order to avoid the same old road to ruin, the new EAC is
determined to base its strategy on a people-centered, private and
market economy, discarding the practice of governmental control
over every field.
</P>
<P>
It will spare no efforts in mobilizing the enthusiasm of all
sectors, all organizations and all social strata to promote
development in all fields and absorb foreign investment in an
enabling environment.
</P>
<P>
To carry out the role of guidance, coordination and promotion
on basic strategies, the EAC has prepared a 26-point action plan
on the implementation of the treaty with a period of six months to
four years.
</P>
<P>
In their speeches after the signing of the treaty, the three
presidents reaffirmed that the new EAC will work closely with
other African regional organizations towards the achievement of
the proposed African Economic Community.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the promotion of peace and security and
observance of the principle of peaceful resolution of conflicts in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that abounding with natural, material and
human resources, the three East African states have, through more
than 30 years' efforts, laid down a primary economic structure
linked by a network of roads, railways, waterways and airlines as
well as seaports, which will contribute to their future
development.
</P>
<P>
With a solid economic foundation in Kenya, a steady economic
development in Tanzania and an up-and-coming economic growth in
Uganda, the EAC partner states can well complement each other in
their common development, they said.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that a reviving EAC, with its door opening to
other states, will also contribute to the development in the Great
Lakes region and the African continent as a whole.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets End In Mixed Mood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The London stock market's three-
day closing highs ended Tuesday as the FTSE-100 remained stuck in
negative territory.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark index was set lower by a poor performance on Wall
Street Monday night and by nerves ahead of next week's interest
rate decision by the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
The index failed to register the bullish mood of U.S. blue
chips and fell 1.4 percent, snapping a three-day winning streak,
to end at 6,597.2, a fall of 95 points.
</P>
<P>
The telecom sector wiped 32 points off the index, Cable &AMP;
Wireless was one of biggest losers of the session as it slumped 9.
6 percent. British Telecom fell 4.2 percent, while Vodafone closed
almost flat.
</P>
<P>
Heavyweight banking and drug stocks were all weak, with HSBC
down 4.3 percent, and SmithKline Beecham down 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC 40 ended off its session lows, but still fell
0.6 percent, or 32 points, to end at 5,341.62, its second
consecutive negative close after a series of record finishes.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax ended high right at the close, having spent
most of the session well inside negative territory. The index
finished 7 points higher at 5,896.04.
</P>
<P>
Heavyweight Deutsche Telekom was largely responsible for the
late turnaround of the index as it shrugged off earlier losses in
excess of 3 percent to close 0.5 percent higher.

<HEADLINE> Final Compensation Approved For Cermis Disaster Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Final approval was given Tuesday
to compensation for the families of the 20 people killed in
February 1998 when a U.S. Marine jet sliced a ski-lift cable in
northern Italy, sending a cable-car hurtling to the ground.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Senate defense committee gave its definitive green
light to a law earmarking 76 billion lire (about 40 million U.S.
dollars) for the indemnity which will see each victim's family
receive up to 3.8 billion lire (about 2 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Today we have honored a commitment," said Italian vice-Defense
Minister Massimo Brutti, "a terrible injustice was inflicted on
innocent people and the state must do what is in its power."
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the London Convention covering NATO
operations and liabilities in a NATO country, compensation for the
disaster will be paid by the Italian Defense Ministry and then
shared between Italy(25 percent) and the U.S. (75 percent), the
country whose military personnel were responsible for the act.
</P>
<P>
The measure passed Tuesday also envisages the appointment of a
special commissioner to assess and authorize other claims.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first major step on the way to winning a just
compensation for the damages," said Alessandro Comola and Alberto
Mioni, lawyers for the families of the three Italians killed.
</P>
<P>
The disaster occurred when the tail-fin of a U.S. Marine EA-6B
Prowler surveillance plane sliced the Cermis ski-lift cable during
a ground-hugging training flight out of the NATO air-base at
nearby Italian northeastern town of Aviano.
</P>
<P>
As well as the three Italians, seven Germans, five Belgians,
two Poles, two Austrians and one Dutch citizen were killed in the
incident.
</P>
<P>
There have also been separate claims for compensation from the
town of Cavalese in the Dolomites, where the disaster happened and
from the owner-operator of the ski-lift, which runs up the flank
of Mount Cermis.
</P>
<P>
These claims, totaling some 44 billion lire (about 23 million U.
S.dollars), will be handled separately.

<HEADLINE> China Imports More Engineering Plastics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- China has become the world's
largest engineering plastics importer as its automobile and
telecommunication industries consume a growing amount of
engineering plastics.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show the country has imported some 1.5 million tons
of engineering plastics annually over the past four years. The
figure is expected to increase to 1.8 million tons next year,
according to sources from the First China International Exhibition
on Engineering Plastics which opened in Shanghai today.
</P>
<P>
Engineering plastics are high technology chemical materials
widely used in industry, agriculture, national defense and in the
daily lives of the Chinese people. The plastics play an
increasingly important role in the manufacture of automobiles,
electronics, construction, and post and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Yang Weicai, chairman of the China Engineering Plastics
Industry Association, said that China's current domestic
production cannot meet the growing demand for the material.
</P>
<P>
The five-day exhibition aims to promote technology and trading
of equipment and related products. The latest engineering plastics
technologies, processing equipment are on display as well as
analysis and testing apparatus from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Chemicals giants such as Du Pont and BASF are attending the
Exhibition.

<HEADLINE> Shares Fall in Tokyo on Weak Information, High-tech Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed lower in
Tokyo Wednesday, dragged down by weak information, telecom and
high-tech issues.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 62.28 points, or 0.34
percent, from Tuesday's close to end at 18,495.95.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 30.22 points or 1.84 percent to 1,
611.31.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to 710.05 million shares
from Tuesday's 673.53 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Share prices were lower in 15 of the 33 business sectors.
</P>
<P>
The electric machinery sector fell 2.65 percent, reflecting
Tuesday's plunge in the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
The information and telecom sector, which faced selling
following its recent sharp gains, was the biggest loser, declining
7.86 percent, traders said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the biggest winner was the pulp and paper industry,
surging 6.10 percent, as they can import materials for their
products cheaply under the strong yen, they said.
</P>
<P>
Of the issues listed on the First Section, gainers outnumbered
losers 666 to 554 despite the falls in the Nikkei and the TOPIX
indexes, with 119 issues closing unchanged.

<HEADLINE> Feature: AIDS Virus Grips India's Urban Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Geeta's life changed two
years ago after her marriage with a bank clerk who had infected
with the dreadful acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS).
</P>
<P>
Geeta, 28, a dweller in India's largest commercial city of
Numbai, had known the result when she went to a nearby hospital
for HIV test which, as she had expected, showed positive.
</P>
<P>
She is only one of millions of Indians infected by the fatal
human immune deficiency virus (HIV), which makes body's immune
system incapable of fighting diseases and infections.
</P>
<P>
While the government put the figures of HIV positive at 3.5
million, a report prepared jointly by the United Nations Program
on HIV/AIDS and the World Health Organization (WHO), said India is
home to about 4 million HIV-infected people, accounting for about
12 percent of the global burden of 33.6 million.
</P>
<P>
Even Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee admitted that AIDS has
become the most serious health problem the country is facing
today.
</P>
<P>
HIV has a significant grip on urban population in some southern
and western states of India with one pregnant women in 50 testing
positive for HIV, said the report entitled "AIDS epidemic updates:
December 1999."
</P>
<P>
HIV infection has also shot up in Northeastern parts of the
country, mainly through drug users who share the same syringe and
men who pass it to their wives.
</P>
<P>
What is more alarming is that 50 percent of those infected are
under the age of 24, said the National AIDS Control Organization
under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the World AIDS Day Wednesday, Minister of
State for Health and Family Welfare N. T. Shanmugarm urged in a
newspaper report to educate people, especially the young, about
the ways and means to protest themselves and their dear ones from
this dreadful infection.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all the people working on the AIDS control
program to work together, share knowledge and experience for the
control of HIV and AIDS before it is too late.
</P>
<P>
Having expanded and improved its surveillance system, India now
has a clearer idea of HIV prevalence, said the U.N. report
published here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, it stated, irrational fear and discrimination against
HIV positive patients have made prevention difficult in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Many hospitals reportedly turned away infected patients or
attended to them badly with many health workers felt that treating
HIV patients was a waste of time and money as they would
ultimately die.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, women, generally wives infected by their husbands,
were stigmatized and were frequently blamed by their in-laws for
the fate of their infected spouse, even in cases where they
themselves are not infected.
</P>
<P>
India witnessed 179,000 deaths due to AIDS last year out of the
total death toll of 2.285 million worldwide, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
News media here complained that India, with a population of one
billion, has been extremely laggard in putting a proper system to
manage AIDS or HIV in place and the knee-jerk response of the
authorities and the general public to the disease has only
resulted in driving them underground.

<HEADLINE> Kitchenware Revolution Taking Place in Urban China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Most urban Chinese families
have bid farewell to their old kitchens where boilers, bowls and
other kitchenware were scattered against smoke-blackened walls and
a wood board for preparing food was placed beside a brick-laid
stove.
</P>
<P>
Along with a nationwide sweeping pursuit for modern kitchens,
an increasing number of stores selling kitchenware and offering
kitchen designing service are emerging in every Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
In Zhengzhou City alone, more than 20 such stores have appeared
over the past two years. Zhengzhou is the capital of the
underdeveloped Henan Province in central China.
</P>
<P>
European, American, Australian and Korean kitchenware displayed
in the stores attracts an increasing number of customers everyday.
</P>
<P>
Shen Yong, the boss of Chuang Jun Kitchen Designing Center in
Zhengzhou, told Xinhua that he started his store three years ago,
when many local residents knew little about kitchen designing and
rarely frequented his store.
</P>
<P>
Today, some 50 customers come to the store everyday, said Shen.
Customers carefully choose kitchen cabinets and other kitchenware.
They are very particular about kitchen cabinet materials,
insisting that they must be fire-proof and waterproof.
</P>
<P>
"Most customers hope their kitchen can artistically reflect
their personality," he said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Fang,, a forty-year-old editor of a local magazine, could
not contain her excitement as she showed off her newly refurbished
kitchen: "I never imagine cooking could be so enjoyable."
</P>
<P>
Liu said she used to hate cooking and would often dine out with
family members and friends.
</P>
<P>
Her mother was also excited at the new kitchen: "I used to
endure at least two hours of smoke and hot temperatures to cook a
meal, but these new appliances have reduced my cooking time.
Everything is so convenient now."
</P>
<P>
Shen Yong said his shop uses computers to design kitchens for
customers, then sends the drawings to special kitchenware
factories in cities such as Shanghai and Guangzhou for order.
</P>
<P>
There are over 200 kitchenware factories in Shanghai and more
than 60 in Dongguan City of south China's Guangdong Province.
These enterprises have opened many chain stores in major cities
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Haier Group, China's largest home appliance producer, also
entered the this profitable market two years ago. Currently it has
nine distribution centers and 21 subsidiary stores throughout
China. In Zhengzhou, Haier receives order worth about 400,000 yuan
(48,192 U.S. dollars) every month, said a company official.
</P>
<P>
"Twenty years ago, most people were living a hand-to-mouth life
and could not even contemplate refurbishing their kitchen," said
Lu Jian, the boss of a kitchenware store in Zhengzhou.
</P>
<P>
But since the market reforms initiated in the late 1970s, many
urban families have turned their attention to house refurbishing
with the improvements in their living standard.
</P>
<P>
"Kitchen of course should not be ignored," Lu added.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Newspapers Hail EAC Rebirth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 1 (Xinhua) -- Major newspapers in Kenya
Wednesday highlighted the signing the East African Community (EAC)
treaty and hailed it as "a milestone for the three African
nations."
</P>
<P>
The papers said the treaty is a major step toward a new
regional body aiming to eventually achieve economic and political
integration.
</P>
<P>
The presidents of Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania signed the EAC
treaty in Tanzania's northern town of Arusha Tuesday amid sounds
of festive music and the sight of hundreds of balloons floating
skywards.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial entitled "Let's keep the EAC train right on
track", the Daily Nation said it heralds a major turning point in
relations between the three east African neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says the new treaty provides for a common east
African passport and flag, economic and monetary integration,
among other joint projects, reflecting "the wishes of the people
to enhance their social, cultural, political and economic
well-being."
</P>
<P>
The East African Standard newspaper said that the new treaty
saw the rebirth of the East African Community which was disbanded
22 years ago.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the treaty would combine the advantages of the
three countries together as Kenya is strong in manufactured goods
and industry, Tanzania's mineral and power sectors are stronger,
and Uganda has advantages in agricultural sector and energy
potential.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Times said the treaty would boost the regional trade,
urging the commitment to the implementation of the stipulations of
the treaty.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Turkish Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
news items in leading Turkish newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit said that the country's
power shortage problem would be solved as the Blue Stream project
is to go into effect.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the Institute of State Planning (DPT) is
supervising the financial resources of Turkey, but we need to act
bolder."
</P>
<P>
Ecevit noted that Russian natural gas reached Turkey through a
pipeline traversing Ukraine, Moldavia, Romania and Bulgaria, and
these countries sometimes consume more than their share and this
has caused the power shortage problem in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Daily News:
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey's overdependence on Russia, its major natural gas
supplier, has left the country in the dark and cold and may cause
further havoc this winter unless Ankara acts quickly to diversify
its gas sources.
</P>
<P>
Power cuts were imposed Monday in Ankara for two hours a day to
save energy after the supply of Russian gas fell.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned Turkish Pipeline Company said due to cold
weather in Russia and Ukraine, Moscow had only been able to
supply Turkey with 20 million cubic meters of gas per day, down
from the usual 27 million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The interruption left Turkey's gas-fired power plant short of
energy and thus led to water shortages in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Moody's, an institution for evaluating ratings of
creditability of banking, has increased the creditability grade of
Turkish banks to "positive", thus enabling Turkey to attract more
easily foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Turkish banks have suffered from creditability losses after the
country's 1994 economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Leaves Singapore for Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
left here on Wednesday afternoon for Vietnam, the last stop of his
four-ASEAN nation trip, after ending a successful official visit
to Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Zhu arrived in Singapore on Monday after his official visits to
Malaysia and the Philippines where he also attended the informal
summit meetings between ASEAN and China, Japan and South Korea,
and between ASEAN and China.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay in Singapore, the Chinese premier
held talks with Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong. The two
leaders reached a consensus on further enhancing the two
countries' cooperation in various fields and exchanged views on
regional and international issues of common concern.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also called on Singapore President S.R. Nathan and met with
Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew and the two sides held friendly
talks.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday at the 17th Singapore Lecture which saw the
attendance of his Singapore counterpart Goh Chok Tong and other
senior government officials, Zhu delivered a policy speech
entitled "China and Asia in the New Century."
</P>
<P>
He was also briefed Tuesday by senior officials from the
Temasek Holdings (Pte) Ltd, a Singapore government-linked company,
on matters concerning the operation of the company.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday morning, Zhu toured public housing complexes built
by the Singapore government specially for ordinary Singaporeans
and visited some Singaporean families there.
</P>
<P>
Then he paid a visit to Jurong Island, a 7-billion-Singapore-
dollar (about 4.8 billion U.S. dollars) project undertaken by the
Singapore government to merge seven southern islands into a single
land mass to develop a world-class chemical hub.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two countries shared the confidence that Premier
Zhu's visit will surely further push forward the development of
Sino-Singapore relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu left Singapore with an entourage which included Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan, Special Assistant Liu Huaqiu and Vice
Governor of People's Bank of China Yan Haiwang.
</P>
<P>
Seeing the Chinese premier and his wife Lao An off at the
Changi International Airport were Singapore Minister without

<HEADLINE> China to Destroy World War II Gas Bombs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Twenty four gas bombs left
behind by Japanese invaders in China during World War II will be
destroyed in Heilongjiang Province, northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The gas bombs were discovered in a rolling mill in Lindian
County, about 70 kilometers away from the oil-producing city of
Daqing. One of them, 155 mm in diameter, is the first of its kind
ever found in China.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the Shenyang Military Area Command said that the
poison gas may have leaked from some of the deformed dud gas bombs.
</P>
<P>
Documents in the Lindian County Archives Bureau show that in
November 1931, Japanese planes dropped bombs on Lindian County.
Many civilians died and property was destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Inhaling the poisonous gas could cause people to choke to death
or cause incurable skin diseases and cancer.
</P>
<P>
Workers of the Lindian Rolling Mill found Japanese bombs in
1992 when collecting scrap iron and steel. They have discovered
two tons of bombs since them.
</P>
<P>
But no one knew that there were gas bombs buried under until
May this year when people were astonished as experts from the
Shenyang Military Area Command excavated them.
</P>
<P>
According to the military experts, the bombs were covered with
layers of rust and contained either mustard gas or chlorine. The
rest of the two tons of bombs have been transported by carriage to
a county suburb and detonated after being buried in two three-
meter-deep pits.

More than 2,000 Chinese have been injured by chemical weapons
left behind by Japanese troops and some of them have died due to
the chemical weapons, according to a 400-page report from the
Heilongjiang People's Publishing House, "History of Japan's
Chemical War".
</P>
<P>
Japan began its chemical weapons research in 1915 and used
chemical weapons on a large scale during China's War of Resistance
against Japan (1937-1945).
</P>
<P>
After World War II, many chemical weapons were left behind in
China by Japanese troops, and the location and exact number of the
chemical weapons are still unknown, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
For the past four decades, chemical weapons have been
discovered in many places in China. In 1991, about 50 gas bombs
excavated at high school in Hebei Province, north China, injured
some 20 students.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Parliament Backs Amnesty Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Members of Parliament (MPs) in
Uganda Tuesday overwhelmingly supported the Amnesty Bill 1999
intended to pardon rebels fighting the government and their
collaborators.
</P>
<P>
The House, presided over by Deputy Speaker Edward Ssekandi, was
 characterized by passionate appeals for openness and
reconciliation, the New Vision daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bill provides for the re-integration of rebels into society
 through an Amnesty Commission and a Demobilization and
Resettlement Team, both to be appointed by President Yoweri
Museveni.
</P>
<P>
The bill, moved by Minister of Internal Affairs Edward
Rugumayo, is intended to replace the 1987 Amnesty Statute that has
since expired.
</P>
<P>
Some MPs argued that the amnesty should include government
soldiers who committed atrocities against sections of the
population and all persons who have been tried or convicted for
treason.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Parliamentary Affairs Rebecca Kadaaga said the bill
was preceded by a wide consultative process and the victims
expressed readiness to forgive everybody for the sake of peace.
</P>
<P>
During a tour of the north region earlier this year, President
Museveni said that he would pardon the rebels if they come out
peacefully and surrender to the government. With the steps taken
to normalize relations with Sudan, the rebels in the north would
be left with squeezed space for operation and survival.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has now two main rebel groups fighting the government.
The Allied Democratic Forces and Lord Resistance Army maim, abduct
and kill in the western and northern parts of the country
respectively.

HARARE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Parliament of Zimbabwe passed a
bill Tuesday to set up a National AIDS Council to provide for
policy direction and coordination in the fight against HIV/AIDS,
the Herald daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Steering the National AIDS Council Bill, Minister of Health and
Child Welfare Timothy Stamps said a number of non-governmental
organizations and community-based care groups are complementing
the efforts of the government.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen members appointed by President Robert Mugabe will
control the council. They come from health care, industry and
commerce, media, religion, traditional medicine, trade unions and
law.
</P>
<P>
The president is scheduled to launch a national AIDS policy
Wednesday, also the International AIDS Day, seeking to put checks
and balances on dealing with the pandemic, the paper said.!!
</P>
<P>
But to contain the further spread of HIV/AIDS and enhance the
fight against the pandemic, there is need to centralize the
efforts of all the non-governmental organizations to maximize
utilization of resources.
</P>
<P>
This requires the setting up of a high profile body to
coordinate efforts to fight HIV/AIDS, Stamps said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe is second to Botswana on the world list of countries
worst affected by AIDS.  Cumulative AIDS cases in Zimbabwe
since 1985 are estimated to be 650,000. About 1.4 million adults

<HEADLINE> Africa Benefit From Regional Coop Against Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 1 (Xinhua) -- African countries have benefited
from regional cooperation through joint crime fighting operation
targeted at areas such as car thefts, illegal trafficking in
firearms and drug trafficking, an International Police (Interpol)
official has said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-president of African region of the Interpol, Augustine
Chihuri, said this at the fourth African regional meeting on the
Traffic in Stolen Motor Vehicles which was attended by 16 African
and three European countries in Harare Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the regional operations have not completely wiped out
car thefts, they have instilled fear in the hearts of the most
hardened criminals, said Chihuri, who is also Zimbabwe's
Commissioner of Police.
</P>
<P>
"This fear is an important crime fighting tool because
criminals must be kept on their toes all the time," Zimbabwean
media Wednesday quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"They have to realize that no country is prepared to be a haven
for crooks and that the interests of one country are entwined with
those of the next," Chihuri said.
</P>
<P>
He urged participants at the meeting to come up with concrete
measures in the areas of extradition, repatriation, gathering of
intelligence and border controls.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized the need for other relevant government
departments such as customs, immigration and vehicle registration
to attend meetings of this nature.
</P>
<P>
The private sector, such as manufacturers, car hire companies
and the insurance industry also had to be part of the meetings, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Each one of us has a role to play in providing vital
identification information on cars and the upgrading of
anti-vehicle theft devices, as well as providing the necessary
sponsorship to come up with crime fighting platforms such as this
meeting," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Development Community (SADC), through
Interpol, this month agreed to introduce a single clearance
vehicle certificate by the turn of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
It was hoped the move would curb the proliferation of cases
involving cross border vehicle theft in the region.

<P>
ULAN BATOR, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Ulan Bator Court ruled
Tuesday to maintain the judgment by the city's district court of
two-year imprisonment to the country's former intelligence agency
director for abuse of power, a news report said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On September 21, the district court sentenced Jaalkhuu Baatar,
former director of the Central Intelligence Agency of Mongolia, to
two years in jail because he had been found to abuse his power in
1996 to order the surveillance and wiretap over some members of
the State Great Hural (parliament), newspaper Daily News reported.
</P>
<P>
Baatar then appealed to the Ulan Bator Court on October 20.
</P>
<P>
This has been the first case in the history of Mongolia to
sentence a leader of the country's security department.
</P>
<P>
In November 1996, the parliamentary group of the Mongolian
People's Revolutionary Party sued Baatar for his order to wire tap
and supervise some of the party leaders and members and asked the
Great Hural to investigate the major general.
</P>
<P>
The government dismissed Baatar in December after an
investigation and changed the name of the Central Intelligence
Agency into the National Security Protection Agency.

items of ancient painted pottery excavated from the site of the
Liuwan ruins since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
The third will be the Tubo Culture Museum, which features a
store of valuable relics uncovered from ancient tombs built during
the rule of Tubo, a regime established by ethnic groups in the
Qinghai-Tibet Plateau between the 7th and 9th century.
</P>
<P>
Besides grasslands and lakes with hundreds of bird species,
Qinghai also hosts numerous Buddhist temples, monasteries and
other sites of historical interest.

HANOI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese President Tran Duc
Luong and his wife left here Wednesday for a five-day official
visit to India at the invitation of Indian President K.R.
Narayanan.
</P>
<P>
The visit, which is the first by a Vietnamese president to
India since the two countries established diplomatic ties in 1972,

Ties between Vietnam and India were kicked off with a Vietnam
visit by India's first prime minister J. Nehru as early as in
October 1954 and an India visit by Vietnam's first president Ho
Chi Minh in February 1958.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have signed cooperation agreements on trade,
avoidance of double taxation, encouragement and protection of
investment, civil aviation, ore mining, culture, science,
technology, environment and traditional medicine.
</P>

to the country's former intelligence agency director for abuse of
power, a news report said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
On September 21, the district court sentenced Jaalkhuu Baatar,

<HEADLINE> China to Tackle Yellow River Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Danger lurks in the quiet river waters, warns Eh Jingping,
director of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee.
</P>
<P>
China mobilized millions of people and spent a large sum of
money to prepare for floods forecast for this summer on the Yellow
River.
</P>
<P>
Eh said that the small amount of rain this summer produced no
flooding on the Yellow River, but this doesn't mean severe floods
will not occur again.
</P>
<P>
In the coming century the river will face three major problems -
- floods, dry patches, and environmental deterioration, with
floods being the Number One threat, Eh said.
</P>
<P>
A plan to tackle major problems of the Yellow River and guide
the solutions for the 21st century has been established by Eh's
committee and is being discussed by hundreds of renowned
scientists.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, a sand control system will be completed by 2030
based on water conservancy projects built at Xiaolangdi, Qikou and
Guxian in the middle reaches of the Yellow River. In the lower
reaches, focus will be on dike construction and silt elimination.
</P>
<P>
China's second longest river and the "cradle of Chinese
civilization," the Yellow River winds through nine provinces. Some
107 million people live in the river basin areas.
</P>
<P>
In the past 2,000 years, floods have burst through the
riverbank 1,500 times, each time leaving tens of thousands of
people homeless and causing enormous economic loss.
</P>
<P>
Due to heavy sand deposits, the riverbed at some parts of the
lower reaches has risen to become higher than the horizon line,
possibly leading to some of the worst floods.
</P>
<P>
In the first five decades of this century, seven such bank
bursts were recorded, with the most serious leaving three million
people homeless in 1937.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of New China in 1949, the government has
spent about one billion US dollars on the Yellow River treatment.
Since then, the banks have remained intact.
</P>
<P>
About 1,400 km of riverbanks have been raised and reinforced in
the lower reaches, where no bank burst has occurred in the past 53
years.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation on the river is not yet stable.
</P>
<P>
Xu Fuling, a veteran expert in flood control, said that "
because of silt and environmental degradation, some parts in the
lower reaches are as dangerous as they were 150 years ago when the
river last changed its course."
</P>
<P>
Besides unpredictable floods, the problem of dry river patches
has drawn much attention. Since the early 1990s, some parts of the
river have dried up every year, with the longest period being 226
days in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Although the river was dry for only 42 days this year, thanks
to a use-conservation program which ordered the provinces along
the upper reaches to use less water, experts say the problem still
exists.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow River contains two percent of China's water
resources, but it feeds 12 percent of the total population and
irrigates 15 percent of all arable fields in China.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Wine Maker to Share Market With Remy Martin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Yaoling" wine, made by Wei's Wild Grapes Winery in the Yao
Autonomous County of Du'an, is now the most popular alcoholic
drink among millions of tourists who come to Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
Du'an County is one of the poorest places in China. However,
Wild Grapes Winery is one of the county's major revenue makers.
</P>
<P>
The winery sells more than 2,000 tons of wine a year. In 1993 a
businessmen from Hong Kong suggested that the wine be sent to an
international wine fair held in Hong Kong after he accidentally
tasted the wine and liked its aroma.
</P>
<P>
The factory was too poor to send a representative from the
winery to Hong Kong so workers at the winery packed two boxes of
wine bottles and sent them to an international fair in Hong Kong.
The wine received first prize at the fair.
</P>
<P>
"Ever since then, wine produced at my factory sells like hot
cakes," said Wei. The wine, made from wild grapes, is now
available in big hotels in Beijing and Guangzhou. Because of the
special raw materials used, production capacity is greatly limited
and so demand always exceeds supply.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, a group of Frenchmen had the chance to taste the wine
and were deeply impressed. Believing that the Chinese-made wine
was a potential competitor, the group of Frenchmen even bought a
return ticket for Wei to visit France. Wei brought along with him
six bottles of wine. The French people were eager to find out how
Wei made his wine.
</P>
<P>
Wei tactfully told his French hosts that the technology used in
his factory was not vastly different from that used to make French-
made cognacs. However, the pollution-free wild grapes grown in the
mountains of Du'an County and a special barm made all the
difference.
</P>
<P>
Wei has been working with professors from the Northwest China
University on propagating the wild grapes unique to the big
mountains of Du'an County. If experiments succeed, the wild grapes
will be grown in more areas of Guangxi.
</P>
<P>
Wei's dream is to build a larger winery and that more people
around the world can taste his wine. He hopes that in the next few
years his winery will be able to market 5,000 tons of wine
annually.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Grand Master Breaks World Simultant Chess Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Grand Master Super
Utut Adianto broke the world record playing a marathon 28.5-hour
simultant chess game against 833 players in Surabaya, capital of
Indonesia's East Java province.
</P>
<P>
Utut broke the world record playing for two days, totaling 28.5
hours, non stop at Taman Surya in Surabaya on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He recorded 637 wins, 185 draws and 11 defeats.
</P>
<P>
Utut's record outpassed Bojan Kurajica of Yugoslavia who played
against 666 players. The longest time record is held by Swedish
UlfAnderson who played for 26 hours.
</P>
<P>
But Utut said that he does not want to play any more
simultantgames because he felt tired afterward.
</P>
<P>
"Should there be an offer for me to play another simultant game,
I certainly will refuse it. I am already fed up playing long games,
" Utut was quoted by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He added that it would be the last time he would play a
simultant game.
</P>
<P>
"The game is too much for me because I have to force my brain
to play for 28.5 hours. I didn't have any sleep throughout the
play," he said.
</P>
<P>
Coach Imam Buchori said that Utut could have played 30 hours
but Utut was offered by the organizer to accept draws against 130
players.
</P>
<P>
"Utut had to obey to the rules and only played 28.5 hours,"
Imam said.
</P>
<P>
Soeprapto, chairman of the East Java office of the Indonesian
Chess Federation, said that Utut's success would be put in the
Indonesian Record Museum and that it would be proposed to the
Guinness Book of Records to obtain acknowledgment as a world
record.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Should Industrialize Fast-food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, December 1 (Xinhua)-- China needs to develop a fast-food
industry for its own traditional cuisine, some experts and chefs
suggested during the just-closed Fourth National Culinary Contest.
</P>
<P>
The top three winning dishes were Beijing Quan Ju De roast duck,
Tianjin Gou Bu Li steamed stuffed buns, and Lanzhou hand-pulled
noodles -- all well-known traditional Chinese meals that the
experts recommended to be fast-food test items for the Chinese
public.
</P>
<P>
Strict requirements in the cooking techniques and preserving
methods have prevented China from developing the fast-food
industry. But during the culinary contest, experts emphasized that
30 percent of all the entry dishes could pass fast-food official
health requirements.
</P>
<P>
They said that China must industrialize its fast-food sector to
compete with overseas favorites such as Kentucky Fried Chicken and
McDonald's.

BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- China has promoted the use of

<HEADLINE> WTO Third Ministerial Conference Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Representatives from 135
members of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Tuesday opened its
Third Ministerial Conference here despite huge protests in
downtown Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Outside Washington State Convention and Trade Center, the WTO
conference hall, thousands of demonstrators built human chains to
block all accesses to the opening ceremony which was forced to be
delayed for nearly 6 hours.
</P>
<P>
Inside the conference hall, representatives of WTO members were
listening speeches given by Mike Moore, director-general of the
WTO, as well as ministers from selected nations around the world.
Those speakers tried to narrow differences among the 135 members
that have been quarreling over the text of a statement setting
forth the body's future plans.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the WTO is to create a prospering global economy
with an increased flow of goods and services around the world.
But critics argue most of the planet's population will not benefit
from WTO actions and may, in fact, be harmed by them.
</P>
<P>
Moore said peaceful protests around Seattle and other cities
along the U.S. West Coast may lead to important reforms and great
achievements in the United States, but warned "violence and
destructive behavior have never been part of that process."
</P>
<P>
He urged all the people to show maximum restraint in the coming
days as the ministers seek to reach an outcome which benefits
working families across the world.
</P>
<P>
Moore denied the criticism that the WTO is not democracy,
saying that all the ministers, appointed by their head of
governments, were voted by their peoples.
</P>
<P>
He claimed the negotiating groups are in full swing, and hoped
the conference in Seattle will be a success.
</P>
<P>
Following his opening remarks, ministers from Tanzania and
Singapore began to address the delayed conference.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Foreign Trade Gap Widens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh registered an external
trade deficit of 2.694 billion U.S. dollars in the 1998-99 fiscal
year, 14.5 percent higher than the previous fiscal year, The
Financial Express reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Bangladesh Bank's annual report for 1998-99, the
newspaper said the deteriorating balance of payment in the
external trade last year was principally due to the devastating
flood sweeping the country from July to September 1998 and the
subsequent huge import of food grains.
</P>
<P>
The export earning of Bangladesh in the 1998-99 fiscal year was
5.324 billion dollars, an increase of merely 2.9 percent over the
previous fiscal. The country enjoyed an export rise of 16.8
percent in fiscal 1996-97.
</P>
<P>
The import expenditure in the 1998-99 fiscal was to the tune of
8.018 billion dollars, 6.6 percent higher than that of the
previous year. The country's import expenditure recorded an
increase of 5.1 percent in the 1996-97 financial year.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Maritime, Aerospace Show Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Langkawi International
Maritime and Aerospace Exhibition '99 known as LIMA '99 officially
opened Wednesday in Malaysia's northern resort island of Langkawi.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 local and international companies are participating
in the five-day event.
</P>
<P>
A number of contracts, purchase orders and memoranda of
understanding are expected to be signed during the exhibition for
both the aerospace and maritime industries, between foreign and
local companies, according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Opening the five-day exhibition, Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad called upon the aerospace and maritime industries
to aggressively embark upon "smart partnerships" with
international companies to boost their development in the country.
</P>
<P>
The aerospace and maritime industries are technology-intensive
industries with high value-added and are undoubtedly a catalyst
for the development of new technologies and for industrial growth,
he said.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that foreign industries will strive to develop
and achieve meaningful and sincere smart partnerships in every
sense of the word, with the growing local aerospace and maritime
industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that in this way, they not only could secure stronger
and longer lasting business partnerships and access to the
burgeoning market in the region, but could also take advantage of
Malaysia's competitive rates, skills and disciplined work force.
</P>
<P>
"I would also like to note here, that some of our local
companies have started to progress into designing and
manufacturing their own products. Therefore, our local efforts
must be integrated further with some international interest and
participation through 'smart partnerships', so as to create a 'win
win' situation for those involved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the global marketplace, only the strong survives," Mahathir
said. "To succeed, we need to find our own niches. We need to
build upon our strengths. We should think of strategic
partnerships or even mergers in order to be more competitive."

<HEADLINE> WHO Warns of Spread of HIV in Western Pacific </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Despite the low rate of HIV
infection in the western Pacific region, the World Health
Organization (WHO) warned of rapid spread of the virus if
intensive efforts are not undertaken in this part of the world.
</P>
<P>
The warning was given in a press release issued Wednesday by
WHO Regional Office for the Western Pacific, which called for more
attention to the rapid increase in heterosexual transmission of
HIV.
</P>
<P>
According to the Manila-based office, about 17 percent of
reported AIDS cases and 43 percent of reported HIV infections have
occurred in the 13 to 29 age group in this region.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the office noted, this year's World AIDS Day, which is
observed every December 1, calls for a world AIDS campaign with
children and young people.
</P>
<P>
A decade ago, the office said, HIV transmission was essentially
among men who have sex with men, but the mode of transmission
shifted to injecting drug users and now to heterosexual
transmission.
</P>
<P>
There are about 35 million new cases of sexually transmitted
infections each year in this region, among which chlamydial
infection, often asymptomatic, has reached epidemic levels.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, it is estimated, more than 1 million people
will be HIV-positive in the region.
</P>
<P>
Shigeru Omi, WHO regional director for the Western Pacific,
said half of all new HIV infections are among young people under
25 years of age.
</P>
<P>
"This is why we must ensure that preventive programs meet the
needs of young people," he added.
</P>
<P>
Omi said the WHO will continue to support member states in the
region in promoting education and services for the young.
</P>
<P>
"We will also enhance partnerships with young people, parents,
communities, leaders and decision-makers so that we can provide a
healthier and better future for our next generation," he said.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand PM-Elect Outlines Agenda for New Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Incoming New Zealand Prime
Minister Helen Clark has sped up her Labor Party's coalition talks

with the Alliance, promising that the deal will be ready for
formal
signing by Monday, just nine days after the general election.
</P>
<P>
According to the provisional results of last Saturday's
election,
the Labor Party and its partner the Alliance won a combined total
of
63 seats in the 120-seat parliament, enough to form a coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
The final results of the election will come out after the
special
votes are counted by December 7. Usually the final count will not
change the overall situation too much because the preliminary
results
covered about 90 percent of all votes cast at the election.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party and the Alliance have virtually agreed on a 20-
strong cabinet, with four slots going to the latter. The caucus of

the Labor Party will select its 16 ministers next Tuesday, with
portfolios to be allocated the next day, according to the local
media
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Clark was quoted as saying the cabinet lineup will be announced

next Thursday and sworn in the following day. She hinted that all
cabinet ministers will sit together in the parliament, unlike the
separate blocs of the previous government.
</P>
<P>
"We're looking for a much more integrated appearance to the
cabinet than was achieved with the last coalition," she said.
</P>
<P>
According to Clark, the new cabinet will meet for the first
time
on December 13 and the parliament will resume on December 21 for
the
traditional speech from the throne and passage of tax-raise
legislation and a bill banning party-hopping by MPs.
</P>
<P>
On the negotiations she has held with Jim Anderton, leader of
the
Alliance, Clark said the two parties do not need to put much in
writing because their relationship is so "harmonious."
</P>
<P>
The Labor Party does not envisage a winner-takes-all approach
but
wants to proceed by consensus and to allow flexibility for
conflicting policy stances, she said.

<HEADLINE> Ancient Foundation of Aristocrat's Dwelling Uncovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 1 (Xinhua)-- A large foundation of a dwelling
believed to have been inhabited by aristocrats in the Western Zhou
Dynasty (1100 B.C.-771 B.C.) was discovered recently at the
Zhouyuan Site here, which has been confirmed as the birthplace of
the ancient Zhou people.
</P>
<P>
Covering an area of nearly 300 square meters, the foundation is
21 meters long and 15 meters wide.
</P>
<P>
It has eight one-meter-wide stone bases on which are piled
several layers of blue stones.
</P>
<P>
Two paths lead out from the front of the main entrance, each
two meters wide, which especially caught the attention of
archeologists. The paths are paved with cobblestones that form
flower designs -- a rare sight in Zhou Dynasty archaeological
finds, they said.
</P>
<P>
The experts believed that the construction scale and design of
the foundation suggest aristocrats lived in the house in the Zhou
Dynasty.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Sees WTO Talks as Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEATTLE, United States, November 30 (Xinhua) -- George Yong-
Boon Yeo, Singapore's trade and industry minister, said Tuesday
that the on-going trade talks of the World Trade Organization (WTO)
would bring a better life to over two billion people in the former
centrally-planned economies and in the developing world.
</P>
<P>
"China's entry into the WTO is an expression of this hope," Yeo
said at the opening session of the WTO's third ministerial
conference here.
</P>
<P>
"In 10 to 20 years, the recently concluded negotiations between
China and the United States on China's accession will be seen as a
major historical turning point for China, for the Pacific (region)
and for the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a 10-point statement, the Singaporean minister also urged
developed countries to take into account the interests of
developing nations.
</P>
<P>
"In coming to an agreement, it is of paramount importance that
the interest of the developing countries should not be ignored."
</P>
<P>
Developing countries should not be pressured at the last moment
to accept an agreement that they did not help to put together, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Yeo believes that opening up the agricultural sector will mean
a lot for many developing countries. As for the others, greater
market access in labor intensive sectors will enable hundreds of
millions to pull themselves out from abject poverty.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the WTO conference in Seattle is supposed to be
to create a prospering global economy and to increase the flow of
goods and services around the world.

<HEADLINE> Southwest China City Attracts More Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment in Chengdu,
capital of southwest China's Sichuan Province, has increased over
the past four years thanks to its improving investment environment
and various preferential policies.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months of this year, the city's overseas
investment reached a record 190 million yuan (about 22.9 million U.
S. dollars), up 43 percent over the same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors were attracted by reports of high economic
returns, according to a local official. The registered capital of
a Singapore-funded firm, for example, increased by 10 times after
three years' operation.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 alone, 18 multinational corporations channeled funds to
Chengdu, and 47 corporations have branches in the city.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 9.98 million, Chengdu is the second
largest city in southwest China after Chongqing in terms of GDP.
Chengdu's GDP stood at 13.4 million U.S. dollars in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Shipwreck Victims Appropriately Compensated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANTAI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- While rescuers and divers are
desperately searching for those missing from the Dashun shipwreck
last month, measures have been taken to handle various other
problems arising from the tragic accident near the coastal city of
Yantai.
</P>
<P>
So far, hundreds of relatives of victims have arrived in Yantai,
in east China's Shandong province, and families of more than 40
people killed in the accident have signed compensation agreements.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the investigation team sent by China's State
Council said survivors and victims' families of the shipwreck will
be compensated appropriately according to law.
</P>
<P>
A special compensation plan has been formed offering favorable
settlements for those people, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The ship Dashun, owned by the Yantai Yanda Automobile Ferry
Company, was carrying 262 passengers and 40 crew members on
November 24 when it caught fire and was forced to reverse its
course toward the port of Dalian in Liaoning Province, northeast
China. The ship sank at about midnight the same day.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the
State Council and the Central Military Commission have attached
maximum importance to the rescue work. President Jiang Zemin and
other Chinese leaders have issued instructions for the recovery
effort.
</P>
<P>
As soldiers and civilians rushed to join rescue operations on
the scene, 15 local hospitals prepared to treat survivors.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 local people have been mobilized to help
accommodate victims' relatives arriving in the city.
</P>
<P>
Officials from Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang and Jiangsu
provinces have also traveled to Yantai to handle possible problems
concerning victims from their provinces.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica's Poas Volcano in Activity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Volcanology and
Seismological Observatory of Costa Rica (Ovsicori) warned Tuesday
that there is a danger of further emissions of gases from the
volcano Poas, which is situated some 30 kilometers north of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
"Since September, Poas' volcanic activity has increased,"
volcanologist Vilma Barbosa told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The column of smoke and ashes emitted reached a height of two
kilometers, and its contaminating effect has been increased since
the dry season set in as from November and will continue until
next April.
</P>
<P>
Without the rainfall diluting the chemical concentration, the
dry season will aggravate the effects caused by the gases on both
vegetation and human beings, mainly on the respiratory system and
skin for human beings, she said.
</P>
<P>
"It is possible that communities located to the southeast of
the volcano will be affected by sulfur fumes as a consequence of
the wind," said Barbosa, who is in charge of the volcano for
Ovsicori.
</P>
<P>
She said the volcano may continue to be highly active, but she
did not say anything about the possibility of a large eruption of
the volcano.

<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's banks have lost 130
million U.S. dollars so far this year, due to the grave economic
situation, said the Banking Superintendents Office Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The losses in the banking sector between January and November
rose over 170 percent, compared with 48 million dollars of the
same period in 1998, said a statement from the office here.
</P>
<P>
The statement attributed the result mainly to the rise of
terminated portfolios, caused by the incapacity of payment of the
productive apparatus.
</P>
<P>
Among the 33 banks at present operating in the country, 10
registered losses and most of the remainders, which have made
profit, are controlled by the Agency of Deposit Guarantee (AGD) of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Mario Canessa, the President of the Association of Private
Banks, said that the increase of the inflation rate and the high
cost of the dollar on the exchange market have affected the banks
and the financial sector negatively.

<HEADLINE> WTO Membership to Bring Opportunities for World's Banks: HSBC Banker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 1 (Xinhua)-- "We believe that China's entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will bring more
cooperative opportunities to both Chinese and overseas banks,"
said Eddie Wong of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Co. Ltd. (
HSBC) today.
</P>
<P>
Wong, the business president of the China area, said at a HSBC
Economic Seminar here recently that cooperation among Chinese and
overseas banks will bring about better services for investors and
attract more international capital to China.
</P>
<P>
Realizing that there will be great competition among overseas
banks after China enters the WTO, Wong is still quite confident
about the bank's future development in China.
</P>
<P>
The HSBC is the only bank among the most popular 40 overseas-
funded companies in China, according to a national survey
conducted earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"The HSBC will move its headquarters to Shanghai before long,"
said Wong, who looks upon Shanghai as his hometown.
</P>
<P>
Wong also spoke of China's great achievements and said he
believes the country will hold a significant position in the world
economic system in the coming era.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, jointly organized by the HSBC and Shanghai Fudan
University, will hold four more seminars in the next two years,
and many of the world's economists and other financial experts
will be invited to attend and lecture on economic theory and
practice.
</P>
<P>
The first lecture of this year's seminar was given today by
Paul Schultz, an economist from Yale University in the United
States on the topic Production and Allocation of China's Human
Resources.

QUITO, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Seven Canadians and an American
kidnapped on the Ecuadorian-Colombian border 80 days ago were
released on Tuesday, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The hostages were released after a ransom of 3.5 million U.S.
dollars from the Canadian Embassy and the petroleum company, the
City Corp, was paid following negotiations with the kidnappers,
who agreed to cut the original demand of 20 million dollars of
ransom to the current amount, sources said.
</P>
<P>
After the payment was made, the hostages were released and then
taken to Quito where they were interviewed by local police before
they were allowed to return to their hometowns.
</P>
<P>
The Canadians were kidnapped on September 11 this year by a
guerrilla group during a trip in the Ecuadorian Amazon basin, with
three Spaniards, one American and a Belgian, but the identity of
the kidnappers still remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniards and the Belgian were released two months ago

BUENOS AIRES, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The number of AIDS cases
in Argentina reached over 15,000 in June this year, while that of
HIV positives rose to 110,000, according to the latest bulletin "
AIDS in Argentina".
</P>
<P>

number of people taking AIDS tests this year has increased to 40
or 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The experts urged the government to enhance the fight against
the disease, saying that it should be a state policy to carry out
proper prevention programs.

Worldwide AIDS epidemic has caused the deaths of 16 million
people since its discovery in 1980, while a reported 33 million

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 1 (Xinhua)-- "We believe that China's entry
into the World Trade Organization (WTO) will bring more
cooperative opportunities to both Chinese and overseas banks,"
said Eddie Wong of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Co. Ltd. (
HSBC) today.
</P>
<P>
Wong, the business president of the China area, said at a HSBC
Economic Seminar here recently that cooperation among Chinese and
overseas banks will bring about better services for investors and
attract more international capital to China.
</P>
<P>
Realizing that there will be great competition among overseas
banks after China enters the WTO, Wong is still quite confident
about the bank's future development in China.
</P>
<P>
The HSBC is the only bank among the most popular 40 overseas-
funded companies in China, according to a national survey
conducted earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
"The HSBC will move its headquarters to Shanghai before long,"
said Wong, who looks upon Shanghai as his hometown.

Wong also spoke of China's great achievements and said he
believes the country will hold a significant position in the world
economic system in the coming era.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, jointly organized by the HSBC and Shanghai Fudan
University, will hold four more seminars in the next two years,
and many of the world's economists and other financial experts
will be invited to attend and lecture on economic theory and
practice.
</P>

The first lecture of this year's seminar was given today by
Paul Schultz, an economist from Yale University in the United

CANBERRA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- A 700-billion-Australian dollar (462 billion U.S. dollars)
industry in financial services is emerging in Asia that should
provide rich pickings for Australian companies, says a federal
government report.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Democrat leader Meg Lees Tuesday hardened the
party's opposition to the federal government's industrial
relations reform and rejecting every one of its key elements.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Health Minister Michael Wooldridge is examining a
proposal for a major overhaul of the Pharmaceutical Benefits

</P>

The Australian Financial Review:

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Bangladesh Opposition Vow to Oust Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Chiefs of the four parties of
the Bangladeshi opposition alliance finally sat together on
Tuesday evening vowing to "oust the government" and forming a
patriotic and strong government on a "broad-based unity."
</P>
<P>
"The combined effort of our four parties is to form a strong
patriotic government respectful to the constitution for facing the
challenges of the 21st century," said a joint declaration issued
after a much-talked-about summit, the first of the opposition
alliance since it was formed early this year.
</P>
<P>
Chairperson of the major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist
Party Khaleda Zia, Jatiya Party President H.M. Ershad and Golam
Azam and Azizul Haq, chiefs respectively of the Jamaat-e-Islami
and the Islami Oikya Jote (Islamic Solidarity Front), signed the
four-page declaration after the meeting of more than one hour.
</P>
<P>
Political observes here said the summit and the declaration
showed that the four parties have finally agreed on a same
platform in their joint movement to oust the government.
</P>
<P>
The declaration called upon all to form "all-party action
committees" in every locality, village, town and port across the
country for expediting the victory of the anti-government movement
and vowed to "collectively declare that the on-going movement will
get further momentum till the final victory."
</P>
<P>
It is obvious that the four parties have decided to launch
their future movement under a coalition leadership, by discarding
their previous separate campaigns to topple the government,
according to observes.
</P>
<P>
As the party chiefs pledged to form a strong patriotic
"broad-based unity," the observers believed that the four parties
must have reached consensus on whether to contest the next
parliamentary elections jointly or separately and on how to share
power if and after their movement is successful.
</P>
<P>
The declaration is equivalent to an election platform, as the
four leaders promised in it to repeal the Special Powers Act, give
autonomy to radio and television, curb terrorism and extortion,
establish economic uplift and modernize the defense, they said.

<P>
ROME, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Some 30,000 condoms will be
handed out free in Milan Wednesday as one of the initiatives
thought up by Italian authorities to mark World Aids Day.
</P>
<P>
All over the country there will be concerts, publicity events,
public information slots on the radio and a general mobilization
of volunteer groups working with Aids victims and against the
spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Some 44,000 cases of Aids have been recorded in Italy since the
start of the epidemic. In the world as a whole some 50 million
people have contracted the HIV virus and 16 million have died.
</P>
<P>
The initiatives planned for Wednesday, as well as encouraging
prevention through the use of condoms, will revolve around the
invitation not to isolate Aids-sufferers but to allow them to
continue a normal life.
</P>
<P>
Campaigners, wearing the customary red ribbon in the button
holes, were already out Tuesday in many cities, including southern
city of Palermo, where hundreds of people gathered for a meeting
attended by Italian Health Minister Rosy Bindi.
</P>
<P>
Part of Bindi's address touched on the new anti-Aids vaccine
developed by Italian researchers.
</P>
<P>
Testing has already begun on five healthy Italians, and the
final stage, which will provide definitive answers concerning the
vaccine's effectiveness, will take place in Uganda, which has one
of the highest levels of Aids cases in the world.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRAZILIA, November 32 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian Health Ministry
on Tuesday announced a national campaign for the prevention of
Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).
</P>
<P>
With the slogans "Prevention is the beginning of dialogue" and
"Speak live and learn with AIDS", the campaign is aimed at the
youths and adolescents of the country, stimulating parents and
their children to talk about the disease, and will be launched on
December 10.
</P>
<P>
According to the Health Ministry, the more the family speaks
openly about the disease, the more children will understand the
forms of prevention against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the distribution of 250,000 posters, the
campaign will also show two films on national television, one
aimed at boys and the other girls.
</P>
<P>
According to information from the Health Ministry, the number
of people infected has remained stable over the last three years
in Brazil, where there are half a million carriers of the Human
Immune Deficiency Virus (HIV), and 163,000 cases of full blown
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that while there has been a drop in the number
of male heterosexual and homosexual cases in the country, the
disease is increasing among women of the lower class.
</P>
<P>
On the world-wide list of countries with the highest incident
rate, Brazil is placed 46th, using the incident rate of people
affected per 100,000 inhabitants.

Bourguignon, president of Club Med chosen for his role as a

down as a result of burgeoning business commitments.

<HEADLINE> Secret Graves Discovered in Northern Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican authorities
have discovered two secrete graves on the outskirts of Ciudad
Juarez, on the U.S. border, where the bodies of perhaps 100
victims of drug cartels may be exhumed.
</P>
<P>
At least 22 Americans are on the list of over 100 people who
have disappeared and may be discovered in the two graves, said
Mexican Attorney General Jorge Madrazo Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Around 200 police and military personnel from Mexico as well as
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and U.S. forensic
scientists were sent to Ciudad Juarez in the State of Chihuahua
Monday evening, 1,483 kilometers northeast of the Mexican capital.
</P>
<P>
The attorney general of the Mexican Republic (PGR) said in a
statement Tuesday that he had requested help from the FBI to
recuperate evidence and the remains of the Mexican and U.S.
victims on the outskirts of Ciudad Juarez.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican authorities believe that the bodies are victims of
the drug traffickers of the Juarez Cartel.
</P>
<P>
Over the last four years, and possibly longer, people have
disappeared from Ciudad Jaurez without a trace, including both
Mexican and U.S. citizens, said the statement from the PGR.
</P>
<P>
The ranches where the bodies have been found are called Campo
de Tiro and Paso del Norte, around 20 kilometers from Ciudad
Juarez.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports, a witness being protected by the
FBI, who supposedly worked for the drug cartels and participated
in the murders, gave information leading to the discovery of the
clandestine graves.
</P>
<P>
So far 10 bodies have been exhumed, but it is unknown whether
the remains will be examined in Mexico or the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The north of Mexico, on the U.S. border, is one of the places
with the highest frequency of drug related activities, with
constant seizures of drugs by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
For years, Ciudad Juarez has been headquarters for the Juarez
Cartel, a drug gang formerly run by Amado Carrillo Fuentes .
Carrillo was the country's No. 1 cocaine trafficker before he died
in 1997 after plastic surgery. In the wake of his death, dozens of
people were killed in the city in what police believe was at least
in part a battle for control of the cartel.

<HEADLINE> Britain to End Beef-On-Bone Ban Before Christmas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Tuesday it was
to lift its ban on beef-on-bone, hoping the move would convince
France and Germany to lift their embargoes on imports of British
beef.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the House of Commons, Agriculture Minister Nick
Brown said the decision was made following the advice of the chief
medical officers in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Brown said he aimed to have the nationwide ban lifted in time
to put cuts of meat such as T-bone steak back on menus in time for
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
"This lifting of the ban has been long awaited and I'm
delighted it can go ahead," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the product would be on sale again from 17
December.
</P>
<P>
Although the ban will be lifted on sales direct to consumers
and restaurants the ban on the use of some bone products in
processed food will remain in place.
</P>
<P>
Brown said the end of the ban would be a "welcome boost to the
beef industry in what continue to be difficult times."
</P>
<P>
The announcement came the day after the government's medical
advisers in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland met to study a
final academic report from Oxford University on the risk of
contracting BSE, or "mad cow disease", from beef bones.
</P>
<P>
Lifting the restriction is expected to boost Britain's efforts
to persuade France and other countries to lift their domestic bans
on British beef.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair will on Wednesday hold a "beef summit
" at Downing Street to devise a strategy to promote British beef
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the world's leading expert on assessing the risk of
BSE said the ban should be lifted immediately.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hands Over Last Military Base to Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Army Tuesday
handed over their last military base on the banks of the Panama
Canal to the Panamanian authorities after more than a century of
military presence in the Central American country.
</P>
<P>
The Fort Clayton Base had for over 80 years been the
headquarters of the South Command of the North American military
for its operations in Southern and Central America.
</P>
<P>
During an emotional civic ceremony, Edward Schuman, the
commander of the South Command, handed over the symbolic key to
the Panama Canal to Panamanian President Mireya Moscoso.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Schuman said that although the canal has been
handed back to Panama, its protection will still be one of the
priorities of the U.S. military authorities.
</P>
<P>
However, Mireya Moscoso said that U.S. military personnel would
never again be allowed to enter Panamanian soil.
</P>
<P>
Moscoso also denied that her government was at present holding
secret negotiations with the United States to prolong their
presence in Panama under the pretext of continuing the fight
against the drug traffickers and the threat from the Colombian
guerrilla movement.
</P>
<P>
By 1979 the U.S. had handed over a total of 13 military bases,
including the Howard air base, where the U.S. military were tying
to establish a Multi-Lateral Anti-Drugs Center (CMA) during the
Balladered government.
</P>
<P>
The Fort Clayton Base is the last of 14 bases to be handed over
to Panama since 1979 under the 1977 Panama Canal treaty signed by
U.S. President Jimmy Carter and the then Panamanian strongman Omar
Torrijos.
</P>
<P>
Only about 300 U.S. military personnel remain in Panama, and
they will gradually leave by the time of the final handover of the
canal at midday on Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
Panama plans to use 325 acres for a "Knowledge City" complex of
schools and research institutions.
</P>
<P>
The first U.S. soldiers permanently assigned to Panama arrived
in 1911 to guard construction efforts of the Panama Canal, which
was opened in 1914.
</P>
<P>
Until the mid-1990s, more than 10,000 U.S. troops had been
based in Panama. At the height of the U.S. presence, during World
War II, about 65,000 U.S. troops were based in the country.

ADDIS ABABA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- More than 4.85 million
Ethiopian children will be inoculated against poliomyelitis in
early December, Ethiopia News Agency (ENA) reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, some 152,000 people would also be vaccinated
against measles and diptheria respectively, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian Health Ministry announced early this month that
two rounds of nationwide campaign against polio and measles were
to be conducted before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
About 11 million children are targeted during the 1999 polio
immunization campaign, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
According to an official of the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF), the UNICEF has contributed about 8.7 million U.S.
dollars towards the Ethiopian immunization campaign.

<HEADLINE> Italian Premier to Visit Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Italian Premier Massimo D'Alema
is scheduled to arrive in Tripoli Wednesday to become the first
Western head of government to visit Libya in years and seal
sharply improved bilateral relations which have ensured for Italy
an avant-garde role in Libyan ties with Europe and the rest of the
world.
</P>
<P>
Italian news agency Ansa reported Tuesday that some diplomatic
sources affirmed that D'Alema's arrival will mark another decisive
step in returning Libya to the international community.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, they recalled the process begun in the
spring when Libyan leader Muammar Gheddafi turned over to the
Netherlands two countrymen suspected in the bombing of a Pan Am
flight over Lockerbie which killed all 270 people aboard, thus
ending a decade of United Nations sanctions against his nation.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the Italian premier's visit began in the
summer when, in early August, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini paid his second visit to Libya in four months to continue
Italy's leadership in easing its troubled North African neighbor
back toward what diplomats call "normalization" with the rest of
the world.
</P>
<P>
At the same point, a 5.5 billion U.S. dollars deal was signed
by the Italian petrochemicals group Eni and the Libyan state oil
company NOC to extract gas in Libya and pipe it to Italy's south
island of Sicily, an accord described at the time as the clearest
recent sign that the two nations intended to continue making
bilateral relations both warmer and more profitable.
</P>
<P>
One of the leading items was intended to totally end problems
linked to Italy's colonial past in the country, from 1911 until
the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, Italy agreed to carry out any mine clearing
operation which might be needed.
</P>
<P>
D'Alema will reach Tripoli in Wednesday afternoon for a meeting
with Prime Minister Muhammad Abhad al-Manqush.
</P>
<P>
As is customary, the Italian premier's encounter with Gheddafi
will not be confirmed until the last minute for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Certain to come under review is Italy's status as Libya's
leading trading partner, and accounts for 20.3 percent of exports
sent to the country and takes up 41.3 percent of Libyan exports.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the value of this trade was reported at 5.515 trillion
lire (about 3 billion U.S. dollars) in Libyan exports to Italy and
1.727 trillion (about 0.9 billion U.S. dollars) in Italian exports.

<HEADLINE> Zambia, Tanzania Sign Transport Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambia and Tanzania signed a
road transport agreement here Tuesday to promote, facilitate and
regulate road services between the two countries and in transit to
third party countries.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is also aimed at ensuring fair competition
between transporters of both the two countries in the carriage of
goods and passengers, a news release said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will simplify the existing administration
requirement in the interest of road transportation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, a joint committee and a joint route
management group will be set up to oversee the implementation of
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
At the signing ceremony, Zambian Communications and Transport
Minister Nkandu Luo urged the officials from the two countries to
quickly meet so that the implementation can commence as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
"Transporters from the two countries have been making
representations about lack of harmonization which has resulted in
discrimination in some cases. There is therefore urgent need to
remove these disparities," she said.
</P>
<P>
The importance of harmonized regional road transport in
fostering trade and economic development in the region cannot
overstated, the Zambian minister said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian Communications and Transport Minister Ernest Nyanda
said the success in expanding trade and economic relations between
the two countries has to be speared by efficient transport.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the economic and commercial
relations between the two countries will be strengthened in the
spirit of regional cooperation.

Integral to that battle would be overcoming illiteracy,

The president said that the most important task is not
rebuilding the physical infrastructure wrecked during the war of
destabilization, but rebuilding the social fabric of the country.
</P>
<P>
He blamed Renamo (Resistencia Nacional de Mocambique) for the
violent incidents that had marred the campaign, particularly the
attack on the Frelimo offices in the District of lle, Zambezia

<P>
NEW YORK, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell
broadly Tuesday in fears about the U.S. runaway economic growth
and on profit-taking as well.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 70.11 at 10,877.
81, expanding its loss of 40.99 points Monday.

s 500 index fell 18.92 at 1,388.91 and the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 85.21 or 2.4 percent at 3,336.16.

during the trading.
</P>
<P>
Recent Report of a booming start to the holiday shopping
season have convinced some investors that consumer spending
remains unchecked despite three interest rate hikes this year in
an effort by the Federal Reserve to cool off the U.S. economy.
The worries were fueled by a Conference Board report that consumer
confidence rose sharply in November after a four monthly declines.
</P>
<P>
Profit-taking also dragged the market lower. Investors sold
technology stocks to lock in profits from their stunning run in
the past few weeks. The Nasdaq index rose 12.1 percent for the
month of November and 56 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 5.32 at 631.18 and the Russell 2000 index

<HEADLINE> Riot Police Clash with WTO Demonstrators in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Riot police clashed with anti-
capitalist demonstrators hurling bottles, cans and sticks in
central London on Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
A transport police van was overturned and set on fire by
demonstrators and several people were injured.
</P>
<P>
The violence broke out after approximately 1,000 people
gathered outside Euston railway station for a rally.
</P>
<P>
Around 500 protesters, some of them wearing masks, broke away
from the main demonstration and surged towards police.
</P>
<P>
Officers, some with riot shields, closed a section of Euston
road and surrounded the station.
</P>
<P>
A sizable police presence was blocking their way into the rail
terminal and attempting to keep the demonstrators within a
controlled area at the station.
</P>
<P>
But some protesters were attempting to break through the police
lines into Euston Road.
</P>
<P>
The trouble followed a day of peaceful protests in London.
</P>
<P>
A police spokesman said at least three people were arrested and
several bystanders were injured when the anarchists hurled bottles,
iron bars, paving stones and other debris as police moved forward
to push them back from the station entrance.
</P>
<P>
A similar protest on June 18 turned into London's most violent
for a decade as protesters burned cars, smashed offices and
battled with riot police.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's protest was, until the Euston Station outbreak, more
restrained at areas in London's City financial district and at the
headquarters of Citibank in Lewisham, south London.
</P>
<P>
But at about 7 p.m. protesters brandishing placards saying "
Kill Capitalism" and "WTO equals World Thieves Organisation"

SEATTLE, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The third ministerial meeting
of the World Trade Organization (WTO) started here Tuesday after a
few hours of delay caused by protesters who block every
intersection to the venue of the meeting.

<P>
An opening ceremony was canceled and the meeting went directly

<HEADLINE> EU Waits For France Response on Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
Tuesday that it is still waiting for French response to the
commission's initial legal steps against it despite its failure to
report about the timetable of lifting the ban on British beef.
</P>
<P>
The European Union (EU)'s executive branch had not yet received
France's response to a letter it sent two weeks ago asking the
French government to justify its failure to lift the ban. The
deadline for such a reply was set on November 30.
</P>
<P>
But a commission spokesman said the EU executive will not press
ahead with the next step in its legal action for the moment
because the beef dispute seems increasingly likely to be resolved
diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
"We're expecting the reply very soon, presumably after the
French food agency meets later this week," Luc Veron, the
spokesman told a news briefing at the EU executive's headquarters
in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
"Things are apparently going rather smoothly...This is not on
the agenda for tomorrow's Commission meeting, which is already an
indication that we do not intend to take any step tomorrow," Veron
added.
</P>
<P>
Under EU legal procedures, France should respond by November 30
to the Commission's request. The next step could be a so-called "
reasoned opinion" through a letter before taking France to court.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the French government has indicated that the ban
could be lifted as early as this week, after intensive diplomatic
contacts between Britain, France and the EU executive.
</P>
<P>
British beef exports were banned in March 1996 because of fears
that the so-called mad cow disease would spread brain disease in
humans. But France keeps the ban despite the all-clear from the EU
and the EU commission started to take the legal action two weeks
ago to force it to overturn the embargo.

<HEADLINE> African Decade of the Disabled Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 30 (Xinhua) -- The African Decade of Disabled
People was launched in Ghana's capital Accra on Tuesday, calling
on governments to do more to improve the quality of life of the
disabled on the continent.
</P>
<P>
The decade, which begins from the year 2000 to 2009, is being
launched under the auspices of the Pan African Federation of the
Disabled (PAFOD) as part of the International Day of the Disabled
which falls on December 3, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Charles Appiagyei, president of the Physically Disabled of
Ghana, performed the launch.
</P>
<P>
By and large, the United Nations Decade of the Disabled has a
global approach to the problems of disability and the solutions
offered were general and global, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is therefore the need for a decade of disabled people
in Africa which would have an African approach to the problems of
disability and thus develop African solutions to the problems,"
Appiagyei said.
</P>
<P>
He said wars and other forms of violence, poverty and
epidemics are among some of the reasons for the increasing
incidence of disability on the continent.

<HEADLINE> Graham: Do Away with Don </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 30 (Xinhua) -- Tottenham Hotspur manager
George Graham reckons that refereeing standards in Europe are much
better than the top echelon in England and that Premiership
referees' officer Philip Don should be made redundant.
</P>
<P>
Graham was furious with Paul Alcock's handling of Spurs' game
at Newcastle on Sunday when six Tottenham players were booked. He
called the Surrey official - the man infamously pushed over last
season by Italian star Paolo di Canio - "the worst I've seen this
season."
</P>
<P>
But the outspoken Scot now admits: "I don't blame him (Alcock) -
not entirely, anyway. I blame the system in which referees have to
operate."
</P>
<P>
He continued: "They are too worried about having to do things
to please assessor in the stand. It is like Big Brother watching
them.
</P>
<P>
"Premiership referees have had their sense of responsibility
and ability to use common-sense taken away from them. I honestly
feel sorry for them because, to be a referee, they must love the
game but now they are officiating with fear.
</P>
<P>
"They seem to feel they have to do everything to the letter of
the law or they will get low marks from the assessor and will be
taken off the Premiership list.
</P>
<P>
"This has to change and the first thing I would do is dispose
of the role of referees' officer.
</P>
<P>
"The appointment of Philip Don was supposed to improve
relations between clubs and referees, but I am afraid it is not
working. I cannot see what good he has done."
</P>
<P>
Former FIFA referee Don is currently in Milan assisting with
the world governing body's experiments to test of feasibility of
having two referees on duty in top matches. A recent dry-run of
the idea in a friendly match in Italy had to be abandoned after
crowd trouble saw the game called off.

<HEADLINE> New Progress in Debt-to-Equity Swap </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Four creditors led by China's
State Development Bank (SDB) signed a debt-to-equity swap
agreement today with Weihe Chemical Fertilizer Plant from Shaanxi
Province in northwest China. The debt-to-equity agreement is worth
some 2.052 billion yuan (247 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the SDB will convert 1.267 billion yuan of
its credit to equity while the three asset management companies of
Cinda, Huarong and Great Wall will convert 601 million yuan, 111
million yuan and 73 million yuan respectively.
</P>
<P>
The fertilizer plant was completed in May this year and funded
by Japanese government loans and domestic complementary investment.
Heavy debts means that the plant will not be able to make profits.
</P>
<P>
After the implementation of the debt-to-equity swap, the asset
to liability rate of the enterprise will be lowered from 103
percent to 58 percent. The plant is expected to become profitable
soon after the swap.
</P>
<P>
Being China's largest policy-oriented bank, the SDB has so far
signed debt-to-equity swap agreements with 18 enterprises
involving total debts of some 20 billion yuan.

<HEADLINE> Iran for Friendship with All Countries: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad
Khatami said on Wednesday that Iran has stretched out its hands in
friendship and brotherhood towards all the countries of the world,
especially those belonging to the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
That is the reason why Iran has proposed the theory of "dialog
among civilizations," which has been welcomed by the world
community, Khatami said at the inaugural session of the 5th
Conference of Islamic Information Ministers.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has named the year 2001 as "the year of
dialog among civilizations" based upon Khatami's proposition, made
soon after he assumed power in August 1997.
</P>
<P>
The moderate president has been pushing forward a policy of
detente in foreign affairs to break Iran's isolation, and
advocating dialog in order to ease tension and reduce mistrust
with world countries, especially its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
In carrying out the dialog, Khatami said, Islamic countries
enjoy a lofty position, and communication systems constitute the
main instrument for the dialog.
</P>
<P>
Underlining the importance of information, Khatami said that
information and knowledge are one of the principal foundations of
power and prestige.
</P>
<P>
"As we stand at the threshold of the third millennium, we have
no choice but to incorporate these very notions into the inventory
of our current needs and requirements," he said, quoted by the
official Islamic Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Khatami noted that the instruments and mechanism to materialize
the dialog among civilizations will be a balanced system of mass
media, long-distance communication systems and a computer network,
which will bring about desired mutual understanding, development
of rational criticism, and a much greater power of choice in the
societies.
</P>
<P>
Information ministers and deputy minister from 50 Islamic
countries as well as Secretary General of the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) Ezzidine Laraki attend the two-day

<HEADLINE> Debt-Equity Conversion Proceeding Well With Major Chinese Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The debt-equity conversion job
of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) has been
going well in the last two months, a top bank official said in
Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Jianqing, ICBC's vice-president, said that his bank has
established debt-equity conversion organizations both in the
headquarters and local branches, with risk management, planning
and loan management staff.
</P>
<P>
The bank has also formed a standard working procedure in debt-
equity conversion with officials at different levels undertaking
clearly defined responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
The ICBC has organized working conferences at different levels
so that its officials will be familiar with the government's debt-
equity conversion policy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that many state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have been
losing money because they have carried out major technical
upgrading projects with bank loans or relied on bank loans to
start their businesses. These loans have turned into heavy debts
and reduced profitability. Converting their bank debts into
equities held by the bank asset management companies would
remarkably lower their debt level and financial costs.
</P>
<P>
For example, the first 42 enterprises recommended to ICBC had
an average debt asset ratio of over 60 percent in 1998. It is
estimated that this figure would drop by 9.5 percentage points
after the debt-equity conversion practice.
</P>
<P>
Jiang further pointed out that the 42 firms recorded a loss of
1.04 billion yuan in 1998, while their interest rate payment would
decrease by 1.78 billion yuan after the debt-equity conversion.
Debt-equity conversion would get rid of bad assets and thus
improve asset quality, profitability and also reduce operation
risks of banks.

<HEADLINE> Savimbi Can't Go Abroad: Ex-rebel Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A repentant ex-chief of the
rebel UNITA security department has said that Jonas Savimbi can't
go abroad if he still wants to keep his military strength and
safeguard his forest regime.
</P>
<P>
"If he goes abroad, his troops and followers will immediately
surrender," said Anacleto Chingufo, chief of the department of
security of the National Union for Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA) from 1991 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
As for the whereabouts of the UNITA rebel leader, Chingufo said
that Savimbi should be somewhere between Andulo and the River
Kwanza.
</P>
<P>
Chingufo also said that at this moment, Savimbi has few cadres,
and those young people following him to the forest areas have
realized that the war is inglorious.
</P>
<P>
"They didn't come here (to surrender) just because they can't
flee away from the control of the security forces of the UNITA,"
the Angolan media Wednesday quoted Chingufo as saying.
</P>
<P>
After a 38-day general offensive against the rebels in the
central highland starting from mid-September, Savimbi and his
followers have been driven into mountainous areas. Although the
Angolan government said that it has known the trace of the rebel
leader, Savimbi disappeared.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Vietnam Makes Progress in Ensuring Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- After over a decade of pursuing
the economic renovation and open-up policy, Vietnam has been able
to maintain a stable growth in agricultural production,
particularly in food production, while making progress in ensuring
food security.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam used to suffer from chronic grain shortage. In 1987,
the country's total grain yield was only 17.5 million tons. In
March 1988, there were 9.3 million of people in 21 provinces in
the north suffering from serious shortage of food. The Vietnamese
government had to import more than 700,000 tons of grain that
year.
</P>
<P>
There had been a great improvement in the country's grain
production in 1988, when Vietnam's total grain output reached
19.58 million tons, over 2 million tons higher than that of 1987.
</P>
<P>
The average yearly growth rate of Vietnam's total grain output
increased by 5.6 percent from 1988 to 1997. Vietnam's total grain
yields were 31.3 million tons last year and 33.8 million tons this
year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam began exporting rice in 1989. On the average, it
exported more than 1.7 million tons annually from 1989 to 1998. In
1998, Vietnam became the world's second biggest exporter of rice
with more than 3.8 million tons shipped abroad. Vietnam will
export 4.4 million to 4.5 million tons of rice this year.
</P>
<P>
The development of Vietnam's food production has contributed
greatly to the stabilization of the country's socio-economic
situation and the improvement of the living conditions in the
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese people had only 267 kilos of grain per capita in
1980 and 332 kilos per capita in 1989. In 1998, Vietnamese people
enjoyed more than 400 kilos of grain per capita.
</P>
<P>
However, Vietnam is still not safe from famine. According to
reports from different areas in the country, in early 1999, as
many as 2.3 million people in 34 cities and provinces were still
suffering from chronic hunger.
</P>
<P>
Hence, the threat of famine still remains a scourge, haunting
many communities in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese government now considers food security as one of
top priorities in the process of industrialization and
modernization.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has launched a movement for reducing poverty and
eradicating hunger, under which hunger will be basically
eradicated in the country in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Inflation in November Rises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's national inflation
in November rose to 0.25 percent from 0.06 percent in October,
National Bureau of Statistic (BPS) announced on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of BPS Sugito Suwito said the increase of inflation
was triggered by the rise of consumer price index, particularly
food commodities.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation in November is higher than October. Food commodities
such as meal and eggs are the largest contributors for November
inflation. Generally food commodities suffered an inflation of
1.17 percent in November," Suwito said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
But he also said some commodities such as rice, cooking oil,
vegetables, fruit and gold declined.
</P>
<P>
"The descent of these commodities has held inflation level in
November not to be higher than 0.25 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that inflation growth for 1999 calendar year
(January to November) was 0.27 percent, while for the 1999/2000
fiscal year (ending at March 31) inflation was recorded minus 3.68
percent.
</P>
<P>
BPS reported that year to year inflation was 1.58 percent or
sharply declined from 78.31 percent in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
"The increasing of food commodities price is also supported by
the upcoming fasting month due to fall in the second week of
December," Sugito said.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Police Raids Religious Group For Alleged Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Japanese police raided on
Wednesday the facilities of a religious organization suspected of
swindling billions of yen from its followers.
</P>
<P>
The searches in nine prefectures hit 74 of Ho-no-Hana
Sampogyo's facilities, including the organization's head office in
Fuji, Shizuoka Prefecture, and its offices in Tokyo's Shibuya Ward,
police sources said.
</P>
<P>
It was the largest search conducted on a religious group in
Japan since April 1995, when investigators raided 120 facilities
of Aum Shinrikyo in 27 prefectures.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, 1,100 people have filed suits against Ho-no-Hana
Sampogyo and its leader Hogen Fukunaga in 10 district courts,
seeking a total of 5.5 billion yen (about 54 million dollars) in
compensation.
</P>
<P>
Fukunaga and other leaders of the religious group are suspected
of falsely diagnosing serious ailments such as cancer based on
inspections of the soles of people's feet and of claiming that
payments of millions of yen would cure the illnesses.
</P>
<P>
Police based Wednesday's searches on allegations that Fukunaga
and other senior group members cheated three housewives out of 22
million yen (215,000 dollars) from November 1994 to June 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, the senior members of the group told
the alleged victims that their family members would suffer from
cancer unless they underwent expensive five-day training sessions
at the group's Fuji headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The suspects defrauded some followers out of several million
yen each by selling hanging scrolls, ornaments and other goods,
after warning the followers that they will die young, or their
company will go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said the group has collected about 61 billion
yen (595 million dollars) from its 30,000 followers.
</P>
<P>
The group, founded by Fukunaga in around 1980, was recognized
in 1987 as a religious group eligible for preferential tax
treatment by the prefectural government.

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Proposes Legislative Amendments to Counter Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong government
plans to propose a number of amendments to two ordinances to
further enhance the effectiveness of the confiscation and anti-
money laundering provisions.
</P>
<P>
The Drug Trafficking (Recovery of Proceeds) Ordinance (DTRPO)
and Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance (OSCO) provide for,
among others, the tracing, restraining and confiscation of
proceeds derived from drug trafficking, organized crimes or
specified offenses as well as the criminalization of dealing with
the proceeds of drug trafficking and other indictable offenses.
</P>
<P>
To adequately reflect the gravity of the money laundering
offense, it is proposed that a person who commits an offense under
this new section should be liable on conviction upon indictment to
a fine of 1 million HK dollars (128,000 U.S. dollars) and to
imprisonment for five years, or on summary conviction to a fine of
250,000 HK dollars (32,000 U.S. dollars) and to imprisonment for
two years.
</P>
<P>
To deter people from dealing with property known or believed to
represent proceeds of a drug trafficking, or indictable offense,
and to reflect the gravity of the offense, it is proposed that the
maximum term of imprisonment be increased from 14 years to 20
years.
</P>
<P>
Proposed amendments also include, among others, a penal
provision to deter people from knowingly deal in any realizable
property in contravention of a restraint or charging order.
</P>
<P>
A Drug Trafficking and Organized Crimes (Amendment) Bill 1999,
which has included the proposed amendments, will be gazetted on
December 3, and tabled at the Legislative Council for First
Reading and Second Reading debate on December 15.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Arabica Coffee Output to Rise by 2,500 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 1 (Xinhua) - Production of arabica
coffee in Tanzania is expected to increase by 2,500 tons to 48,500
this season from last year's 46,000 tons, the Tanzania Coffee
Board said.
</P>
<P>
The coffee board attributed the possible increase to Tanzanian
government's efforts to revive the crop in areas where production
was affected by El Nino rains last year and the acreage expanded
by investors, the Financial Times reported Wednesday..
</P>
<P>
For the past three years the coffee sector including the coffee
board, cooperative societies and private companies devoted
considerable energy to improving the crop in the peasant or
household level.
</P>
<P>
Among strategies employed to revive the crop include
establishing coffee plots and distributing seedlings to farmers as
well as assuring farmers on price trends and how to solve other
problems, said the coffee board.
</P>
<P>
Coffee has been the major export in Tanzania's foreign trade
for the past two or three decades with an annual earning of 400
million U.S. dollars through a direct export of over 100,000 tons
of green coffee per year.
</P>
<P>
Coffee production has slumped in recent years because of bad
weather conditions and mostly, economic factors.
</P>
<P>
Despite that, the crop still stands as the leading single
export crop in Tanzania, no doubt due to its quality and quantity
amid some of the biggest, most competitive world markets.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Export Rises, Import Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 1 (Xinhua)-- The value of Indonesia's export
has slightly risen in October to 4.587 million U.S. dollars or
2.13 percent higher than September, the National Bureau of
Statistic (BPS) reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But it said that from January to October, the country's export
value was 39.625 million dollars or down 3.53 percent compared
with that of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
"The descent of the country's export value was triggered by the
fall of non-oil and gas export value," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Non-oil and gas export value in October was 3.541 million
dollars or suffered a descent of 1.1 percent compared the previous
month, while cumulative export value from January to October went
down to 7.12 percent compared to the same period of 1998," it
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chairman of BPS Sugito Suwito said the country's
import value in October was 2.028 million dollars or lower than
September which reached 2.127 millions dollars.
</P>
<P>
Suwito said from January to October, import value reached to
19.742 million dollars or declined by 12.55 percent compared to
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
"But import of consumption goods from January to September rose
to 1.880 million dollars or 39.18 percent higher compared to the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the same time, he said the country's economy growth is
expected to grow by 0.12 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
But the International Monetary Fund (IMF) predicted that
Indonesia's economy growth rate in 2000 will be two percent.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Awareness Campaign Launched in China on Int'l Aids Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Alarmed by the vast number of
people in China unaware of the AIDS/HIV virus, Chinese officials,
media and medical experts launched a campaign today on
International AIDS Day to alert people to the dangers of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 government officials and experts gathered in
Beijing to discuss awareness and prevention measures at the Great
Hall of the People. China's first national web site on AIDS/HIV
prevention was launched as well today.
</P>
<P>
"What worries me most is that many Chinese know nothing about
AIDS," said Professor Zhang Konglai from the Beijing Union Medical
College, who called for authorities to adopt more flexible
policies toward prevention of the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
Recently, local media have tried hard to break the traditional
Chinese taboo of talking about sex and sexual transmitted diseases
in public.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Youth Daily, for example, reported on a 17-year old HIV
carrier, while on the Internet edition of the People's Daily,
there was an on-line discussion.
</P>
<P>
A HIV carrier, who wished to be identified only by his surname
Song, joined the on-line discussion and said, "I feel free to
express what I think and really hope that people will become more
tolerant of AIDS suffers."
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Health has drafted the Regulations on
Prevention and Control of AIDS and is awaiting the approval of the
State Council. The draft includes articles on protection of rights
of the patients and carriers.
</P>
<P>
But it is far from an easy job to talk about sex in public
without resistance in the country.
</P>
<P>
Following a disputed advertisement advocating the use of
condoms shown on China Central Television (CCTV), a manufacturer's
plan to distribute condoms among Beijing university students has
also met with resistance.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that by the end of September, the
number of HIV carriers reported in China was 15,088. Some local
experts, however, put the figure at more than 400,000, 70 percent
of them 30 years of age.
</P>
<P>
China reported its first AIDS case 14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Compared to the global figure of 50 million AIDS patients and
HIV carriers, China is still regarded as a low-infection area.
However, experts warn that if effective measures are not taken,
China may be devastated by the disease in the new century, with
the number of Chinese HIV carriers skyrocketing to 10 million.
</P>
<P>
"China is in a grave situation and the work ahead is very
difficult and complex," said Yin Dakui, a deputy health minister.
</P>
<P>
There are a large number of Chinese people who are vulnerable
to AIDS/HIV, the official said, referring to tens of millions of
transient people, including drug addicts, commercial blood dealers
and prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
Last week, some Chinese AIDS/HIV researchers announced they
will apply for official approval on carrying out China's first
AIDS vaccine on human body next year.
</P>
<P>
The AIDS campaign is expected to receive positive reaction,
especially in large cities where people are better educated and
cultured.
</P>
<P>
Fu Yan, a nurse who has taken care of AIDS patients for years,
urged people to be more aware of the disease and pay greater
attention to the care of AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
"We must act now for the sake of our offspring and the future
of the nation," she added.

<HEADLINE> ADB to Provide Bangladesh with Loan of 157m U.S. dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
is processing a loan of 157 million U.S. dollars for the proposed
Dhaka Power System Upgrade Project to make the city
self-sustainable in power, an ADB official said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The loan negotiations for the project have been completed and
are due for consideration by the ADB's board of directors later
this month, Khalid I. Rahman, manager of the Energy Division
(West) of the ADB, said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
There would be no crisis of power in Dhaka after 2005 if the
project is implemented, said Rahman, who led a mission of the
ADB's power sector at a donor coordination meeting held here on
November 28-30.
</P>
<P>
Dhaka has a high system loss of 25 percent, which needs to be
corrected for making the power sector financially viable, he said.
He stressed the need for improving efficiency and ensuring good
administration to achieve the target of reducing the system loss
to 18 percent by 2003.
</P>
<P>
The ADB has provided assistance to generation, transmission,
and distribution projects in Bangladesh, but its main focus has
been the Dhaka area where 40 percent of the country's electricity
is consumed, according to Rahman.
</P>
<P>
The ADB is one of the largest development partners of
Bangladesh's energy sector, which has so far received 1,070
million dollars in loans and 13 million dollars in technical
assistance grants from the bank.

<HEADLINE> The Demise of Planned Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- It was common under China'
s planned economic system that every work unit, or "danwei" in
Chinese pronunciation, had to build residential buildings for its
staff.
</P>
<P>
Tens of millions of government-subsided residential buildings
emerged in the last 50 years, each belonged to a certain "danwei",
which might be a government department, a factory, a hospital or a
school.
</P>
<P>
Under the planned economy, a "danwei" consisted of two parts:
the work area, and the staff's living quarters as welfare
facilities.
</P>
<P>
"These living quarters provide almost everything for its staff
members, including housing and dormitories, eateries,
kindergartens and department stores," said Li Shuqin, a
sociologist with the Hebei Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
However, the "danwei" model, which usually cost a work unit
heavily every year for maintenance and service, is being shattered
as housing reform is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
The market economy has been transforming the landscape of big
cities as a growing number of commercial apartment blocks have
been built for ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has allowed the people to purchase
their residential quarters at a "charitable price".
</P>
<P>
"For the first time, Chinese citizens have the chance to own
their own homes," said Li.
</P>
<P>
This not only means that a president of a company or a minister
of a government department will no longer take care of housing for
his employees. It also helps the work units reduce their financial
burdens for maintaining the staff living quarters.
</P>
<P>
From this year, the government allows citizens who have already
bought the work unit apartments to resell them to anybody they
want. Reselling work unit apartments has reached feverish pitch
across the country.
</P>
<P>
In Hebei Province, north China, most citizens have sold the
houses to people from other units or cities and provinces at a
market price, instead of to their units at a government price.
</P>
<P>
On the day when the government announced the decision in
Beijing, more than 10,000 people applied for selling their work
unit apartments.
</P>
<P>
"We want to buy a newly-built commercial house as the old
apartment that belongs to our `danwei' has poor facilities," said
a middle aged man, who gave his first name as Cao.
</P>
<P>
Many young people who could not wait for their work unit to
assign them an apartment are eager to buy or rent "danwei"
apartments because they are relatively cheap.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuxin, who works with Beijing Telecom, said that the
housing reform enables people to move around more freely. "If I
have money, I can choose where I live; And if I am unhappy with my
boss, I can resign without worrying about whether he will
confiscate my room".
</P>
<P>
However, some people have a mixed feeling about work unit
assigned housing.
</P>
<P>
"In my assigned apartment everything is cheap and looked after
by my work unit. And it is just several steps from my office. All
the neighbors know each other and often have happy gatherings,"
said Zhang Jun, a doctor at the Shijiazhuang No. 5 Hospital, who
moved to a new residential area this year.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the new apartment block everything is market-
oriented and more expensive. Every face is unfamiliar and he
usually feels lonely.
</P>
<P>
To most urban Chinese, to find a new home outside the work unit
is still a novel experience. Most people have to continue to live
in their work unit apartments for the moment until they get enough
to buy new houses.

TOKYO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- European silver medalists Russia
outplayed hosts Japan in three sets to secure the World Cup men's

<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
and visiting Indonesian President Abdurrahman Wahid agreed in
talks this afternoon to develop a long-term, stable, good-
neighborly and trusting relationship that covers all forms of
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The fact that President Wahid chose China as the destination of
his first state visit since he assumed office demonstrates that he
attaches great importance to developing relations with China,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
"We are highly appreciative of the fact," the Chinese president
added.
</P>
<P>
The relations between China and Indonesia generally have
witnessed smooth development since the two resumed bilateral
diplomatic ties about ten years ago, Jiang said, citing the mutual
exchange of visits and bilateral cooperation in economy, trade,
technology, culture and other areas.
</P>
<P>
The two countries understand and support each other and have
maintained close cooperation in international affairs since the
Asian financial crisis erupted, Jiang noted. This bond signifies
that it serves the fundamental interests of the peoples of the two
countries to safeguard Sino-Indonesian friendly and cooperative
relations.

Jiang emphasized that China and Indonesia, both big countries
in Asia, have no conflict in their fundamental interests. Great
potential in many fields exists in Sino-Indonesia cooperation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
China is ready to work with Indonesia to further enhance
bilateral cooperation, Jiang stated, saying that the two sides
should conduct multi-faceted exchanges, increase mutual
understanding and strengthen bilateral collaboration in economy,
trade, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the two nations should take the
advantage of their natural and human resources and advance
bilateral trade and investment on the basis of mutual benefit.
China and Indonesia should also reinforce their cooperation in
international and regional affairs, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
China and Indonesia are both developing countries and the two
share similar or identical views on some major international
issues, Jiang continued, adding that China is willing to increase
consultations with Indonesia in the United Nations and other
multilateral international occasions, to jointly defend the
interests of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that China supports the effort made by Wahid's
administration in safeguarding the country's unification and
territorial integrity. The stability and prosperity of Indonesia
is conducive to the peace and development in the region, and China
hopes that Indonesia would continue to play an active role in
regional affairs and contribute to advancing Sino-ASEAN
cooperation, Jiang said.

China, and believes that with China's entry into the WTO, its
international status will be greatly upgraded, and its role in
world affairs will also increase, he said.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia hopes to develop overall cooperative ties with China,
he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Wahid invited Jiang to visit Indonesia at a convenient time,
and Jiang expressed his gratitude.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said the Indonesian government would not fail to let
Indonesians of Chinese origin share equal rights with other ethnic
groups and to be fully integrated into society.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed appreciation over Wahid's positive attitude on
the issue. He stressed Chinese Indonesians have long been a member
of the Indonesian society and made great contribution to the
country's economic construction, and they should enjoy equal
rights and obligations with rest of the citizens.

Prior to the talks, Jiang presided over a welcoming ceremony in

<HEADLINE> Mandela Succeeds Nyerere as New Burundi Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ARUSHA, Tanzania, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela was designated here on Wednesday as the
new facilitator of the Burundi peace process at a summit of the
leaders of the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Mandela succeeded the late facilitator Julius Nyerere to
provide political leadership on the tortuous peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, Tanzanian founding president, died of leukemia in a
London hospital on October 14 at the age of 77.
</P>
<P>
The regional leaders urged all the parties to the bloody
Burundi conflicts including the government to genuinely extend
maximum cooperation to Mandela so as to enable him accomplish his
mission.
</P>
<P>
They also underscored the importance of accelerating the
momentum of the negotiations until concluding a final peace
agreement that will ensure lasting peace, genuine democracy and
security for all.
</P>
<P>
The summit was attended by presidents of Uganda, Tanzania,
Kenya, South Africa and Burundi and prime ministers of Ethiopia
and Rwanda as well as foreign minister of Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Also participating were the Secretary-General of the
Organization of African Unity Salim Ahmed Salim as well as the
representative of the UN Secretary-General Berhanu Dinka.
</P>
<P>
The summit decided to meet every three months to receive the
negotiations progress, reiterating its firm position that there is
no alternative to a negotiated settlement to the Burundi conflict.
</P>
<P>
A minute of silence was observed by all delegations in
recognition of the commendable dedication and selfless efforts
exerted by Nyerere in search for a permanent solution to the
Burundi conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The summit noted that the negotiations have reached an advanced
stage and substantial progress has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
It decided to maintain Arusha in northern Tanzania as the venue
of the peace negotiations and also to continue with the
negotiation infrastructure already in place so as to maintain the
gained momentum and make use of the experience already realized.
</P>
<P>
The summit also reviewed the political and security situation
in Burundi,
</P>
<P>
noting with regret that despite the efforts made at the
regional, continental and international levels, the political and
security situation has not improved significantly as fighting
continues unabated.
</P>
<P>
Since June of 1998, several rounds of talks have been taken
under the guidance of Nyerere in Arusha, gathering all the
warring faction leaders at the same table to seek long-lasting
peace.
</P>
<P>
However, the death of Nyerere has stalled the proposed peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
A tiny landlocked country in the Great Lakes Region, Burundi
was dragged into bloody conflicts since October 1993 when the
first free elected ethnic Hutu President Melchior Ndadaye was
assassinated by the ethnic Tutsi-dominated Army.
</P>
<P>
So far some 150,000 people, mostly civilians, have been
allegedly killed during the endless ethnic conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Countdown Starts for Russian Parliamentary Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, December 1 (Xinhua) -- With State Duma elections just 18
days away, campaigning is in full swing for Russian political
parties' bid to vie for more seats, if at all, in the next lower
house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Although more than 5,000 candidates will take part in the race,
only a fraction of them will make it to the 450-seat chamber that
is expected to impact the country's political landscape in the
first four years of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
As federal troops are in the middle of an offensive against
rebels in the breakaway republic of Chechnya, a campaign that
would be completed at the earliest in one month's time as
predicted by Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev Wednesday, only 447
seats will actually be contested.
</P>
<P>
For the time being, the Communist Party, Fatherland-All Russia
and the Yabloko bloc look set to clear the hurdle of 5 percent of
the votes and finish at the top three. The Unity movement, whose
standing keeps rising with the full backing of the Kremlin and
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, is also expected to grab some seats.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Our Home is Russia, Union of Right Causes and the
Zhirinovsky Union, a bloc grouping Alexander Zhirinovsky's Liberal
Democratic Party and two other smaller parties, may or may not
garner the 5 percent of votes necessary to enter the State Duma.
</P>
<P>
According to opinion polls, the Communists and Fatherland-All
Russia will collect 30 percent and 20 percent of the votes
respectively, which points to a new State Duma dominated by
leftist and centrist forces.
</P>
<P>
As the outcome of the Duma elections would dictate the future
of Russia and sway the results of next year's presidential race,
various political forces have intensified their efforts in
consolidating their positions or clutching an eleventh-hour turn
for the better.
</P>
<P>
The Kremlin establishment, with much at stake for its future
and that of the country, has all along maintained an active role
in steering the elections to its advantage, despite its technical
status as "an outsider."
</P>
<P>
It has mobilized the media and other leverages in a campaign
against Fatherland-All Russia, which is considered hostile to the
Kremlin and seen as the most probable winner in both the
parliamentary and presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Fatherland-All Russia, which enjoyed a comfortable lead
initially, appeared to be losing ground in the face of fierce
assaults from the Kremlin. The bloc's leaders, former Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov, have seen
their prestige dropping, especially in comparison with Putin's
skyrocketing approval rate amid the military actions against
Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
Despite the setback, observers say, Fatherland-All Russia's
chance of winning first or second place in the elections remains
unshakable.
</P>
<P>
Unity, a bloc hastily established, reportedly at the behest of
the Kremlin, is one of the measures designed to counter the
leftist and centrist forces.
</P>
<P>
To make up for Unity's "congenital defects," the Kremlin has
asked Putin, who is enjoying record approval rating among the
Russians, to throw his weight behind the movement to somewhat
improve its standing.
</P>
<P>
However, whether Unity would become a force that achieves
steeper ascent is far from clear.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Communists seem to be reaping the benefits of
the struggle between the Kremlin and Fatherland-All Russia,
inching back toward the top in recent opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Yabloko group, long branding itself as "a
rightist opposition" to the ruling establishment, is expected to
win more votes after former Prime Minister Sergei Stepashin joined
its ranks.
</P>
<P>
By and large, as Russia is a country where the president
wields the most formidable powers, the ultimate "showdown" will
come next June when the Russians decide who will replace President
Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Some provisions of the Russian constitution, however, have
made the parliamentary elections a forerunner to the presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
Under the Russian basic law, the president cannot dissolve the
parliament in his final six months in office. This rids Yeltsin of
a vital card in dealing with the new State Duma.
</P>
<P>
If the leftist and centrist forces dominate the new lower
house of parliament as is widely predicted, the Kremlin's plan to
maintain Putin or any other person of its choice at the head of
the government and subsequently succeed Yeltsin would be thrown
into doubt.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng, Peres Vow to Cement Sino-Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEL AVIV, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Both China and Israel enjoy
great potential for development and the prospect for bilateral
cooperation is very bright, said visiting top Chinese legislator
Li Peng.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress of China, made the remarks during a meeting
with Israeli Minister of Regional Cooperation and former prime
minister Shimon Peres Tuesday night, one day before he ended a
week-long official goodwill visit to Israel.
</P>
<P>
China and Israel have their own advantages in development and
China is willing to work together with Israel on the basis of
mutual respect and mutual benefit in order to further friendly
cooperation between the two countries, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li spoke highly of the great contribution Peres had made to the
development of Sino-Israeli friendship during his tenure of office
as Israel's prime minister and foreign minister. Peres is now
honorary chairman of the Council for Promotion of Israel-China
Relations.
</P>
<P>
Peres said that during his visits to China in 1993 and 1997, he
had been deeply impressed by the great achievements the Chinese
people have made in the last 50 years, including the stability of
the society and the vigor of the economy.
</P>
<P>
What impressed him the most, however, is the spirit of
dedication of the Chinese people, Peres said, adding that this
spirit is the very reason for the vast development taking place in
China during the last five decades.
</P>
<P>
Peres extended his congratulations on the signing on November
15 of the bilateral agreement between China and the United States
on China's accession to the World Trade Organization. China's
ultimate entry to the world's largest trade body will be a big
development in the global economy and trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of development, Peres said Israel has succeeded in
developing its economy by relying on science and technology amid
miserable natural environment. The agricultural production has
increased by 17 times in the last few years thanks to the
introduction and development of the green house technology, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The problem Israel faces now is not the lack of new
technology, but the necessity for the people to realize the
potential importance of the hi-tech, Peres said.
</P>
<P>
Agreeing with Peres, Li said China also realizes that the only
solution to the development of agriculture is science and
technology. Although much progress has been made in agri-tech,
biology engineering and water-saving projects, China still has a
lot to do in developing science and technology, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In the last few years, China and Israel have engaged in
effective cooperation in the field of agriculture with some
projects having achieved very good results, Li said. He expressed
his hope that the two sides will further strengthen cooperation in
agriculture and hi-tech.
</P>
<P>
Li praised Peres for the great efforts he had made for the
advancement of the Middle East peace process. As a permanent
member of the U.N. Security Council and a country keeping friendly
ties with both Israel and its Arab neighbors, China has been
paying much attention to the peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
China is glad to see that positive signs have emerged in the
peace process in the last few months and sincerely hopes for an
early solution to the lasting Israeli-Arab conflicts for the
benefits of both the Israeli and the Arab people, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Li left Israel Wednesday for Oman, the last leg of his ongoing
Afro-Asian tour, which has already taken him to Mauritius, South
Africa, Kenya and the Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Cites Driving Forces for Economy in New Millennium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Wednesday stressed the need to strengthen agriculture,
science and technology and culture, which he said will be the
driving forces to propel the country into the mainstream of the
global economy in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Estrada emphasized the point in a speech delivered here at the
Rizal park Wednesday evening before switching on the 30-foot high
giant lantern, kicking off a series of activities welcoming the
21st century.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said promoting the country's culture will enable
peoples everywhere in the world to see the real Philippine
picture, while science and technology will transform the nation's
industries for the benefit of the people.
</P>
<P>
But he said all these developments will depend on a successful
implementation of their agriculture programs, because the majority
of Filipinos, especially the disadvantaged sector in the rural
areas, are farmers.
</P>
<P>
"If we can unify and enhance these forces, the new millennium
will bring us more opportunities and prosperity," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
The coming of the new millennium, Estrada said, "should serve
as an inspiration to us Filipinos for these signals -- the
worldwide dawning of economic prosperity and hope with the
changing faces in business, commerce and technology."
</P>
<P>
"Here in our country, the new millennium means new challenges
for us to face the problems that come our way," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president was welcomed by a brass band upon his arrival at
the stage opposite the Rizal Monument, where he switched on the
giant lantern, dubbed Millennium Filipino.
</P>
<P>
The lantern, on top of which stands a countdown clock read as
the 31st day before the year 2000, marked the opening of the
Philippine celebration to welcome the coming of the new century
and the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Among those who were attending the ceremony were Senate
President Blas Ople, Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon, Manila
Mayor Joselito Atienza, as well as some foreign diplomats.

Computer systems in all the sectors critical to the nation's
well-being are in an advanced state of readiness to take the new
year in their stride, he said in a statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, there will be anxious eyes monitoring all the critical
sectors from our Y2K Control Center in Kuala Lumpur, but not with
the expectation of any major difficulties," he said.
</P>
<P>
The critical sectors identified by the Malaysian government
include energy, communications, water supply, banking, insurance
and capital market, transportation, health, oil and gas, sewerage
and government.
</P>
<P>
Each of the nine sectors has its own contingency plans that
have been tested and are in place, while an overall contingency
plan has been developed, looking at the state of preparedness from
a nationwide perspective and catering for the unlikely need to
manage and contain events to uphold public order and national
security, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Well before new year's eve, all the work will have been
completed, with tested contingency plans in place to deal with any
unexpected problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government, which recognized the need for decisive action
early, set aside 850 million ringgit (223.684 million U.S.
dollars) for solving Y2K problems while having agreed to provide
additional funding if it became necessary, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the sectors themselves would be
spending a further 1,100 million ringgit (263.157 million U.S.
dollars) to ensure Y2K preparedness.

<HEADLINE> OIC Delegation to Visit Moscow Monday: Iranian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi has announced that he would lead a delegation of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) to visit Moscow on
Monday to discuss the Chechen issue with Russian officials.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi told a press conference Wednesday that his trip was
not aimed at mediation but fact-finding, and his delegation had no
plan on mediation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Islamic countries are concerned about the
situation in Chechnya, adding that the OIC and its current
chairman Iran feel a strong responsibility to employ any possible
means to stop war and bloodshed in the region.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction over the opportunity Russia has
provided for Iran and the OIC to discuss the Chechen issue, the
minister also hoped that by becoming further acquainted with the
facts in Chechnya, resolution could be found to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov informed Kharrazi on
Monday night that Russian cabinet had agreed to the proposal by
Kharrazi on a visit by an Iran-led Islamic delegation to Moscow
for talks on the Chechen issue.
</P>
<P>
"The cabinet accepted the proposal in light of the friendly
relations between Iran and Russia and the fruitful negotiations
held in Tehran during my stay in Iran," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference with Ivanov during his
one-day visit to Iran on Sunday, Kharrazi said that he proposed a
visit by an OIC delegation to Moscow and Ivanov promised to convey
the message to the Russian cabinet.
</P>
<P>
However, Ivanov stressed that the Chechen issue was an internal
affair of the Russian Federation, denying any attacks on and
massacre of civilians in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Before anything else it should be said that no such attacks
have been or can be made on Chechnya because the territory is part
of the Russian Federation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said that Russia's military actions in Chechnya are not
against Muslims, rather terrorists, regardless of their
nationality or religious affiliation.

<HEADLINE> India Imposes Customs Duty on Two Wheat Varieties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government
Wednesday imposed a 50 percent customs duty on common and "dhurum"
varieties of wheat in a bid to stimulate the offtake of wheat from
the central pool.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Yashwant Sinha announced the imposition of the
duty, effective Wednesday, in a statement to parliament.
</P>
<P>
With the availability of relatively cheaper import, he said,
the offtake from the central pool had been low despite
liberalization done through the open market sale scheme.
</P>
<P>
Between May and November this year, almost 1.5 million tons of
wheat reached Indian ports. The landed cost of wheat was much
lower than the open sale rate fixed for the Food Corporation of
India.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Minister of Culture and
Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani on Wednesday called for
cultural exchanges among Islamic countries in the age of
"globalized" economies and communications.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural session of the fifth Conference of
Islamic Information Ministers held here, Mohajerani expressed hope
that the conference would gain a deeper understanding about
impediments on the way of expanding information and cultural
exchanges among Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
"Nowadays, information and communication sectors of our
countries face challenges of globalization of economies and
communications," he said, quoted by the Islamic Republic News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
"No one can deny the improvement in communications and sectors
of information production and dissemination of the Islamic
countries," he said. However, the role which has been playing by
the Islamic states in the global communication does not match the
significance of the Islamic culture and civilization.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the stability, security and development of
Islamic countries would be guaranteed through adoption of balanced
and comprehensive strategies in the fields of information and
knowledge and the related technology.
</P>
<P>
In the age of "globalized" economies and communications, he
said, there is no alternative but employment of modern
communications technology, promotion of cooperation among news
agencies and mass media of the Islamic states, as well as
adoption of measures to portray a more appealing image of Islam
and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Mohajerani called for a revision and contemplation on the
Islamic information strategy to study its executive methods and
settle financial problems facing the information sector.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the two-day conference would work out
guidelines for further activating the Islamic States Broadcasting
Organization and find a way to increase TV and radio programs
exchange or establish a joint bank of Islamic states' TV
products.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Teenagers with HIV Virus on Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Teenagers with the HIV virus
account for at least 75 percent of the 5,000-plus carriers in
southwest China's Yunnan Province, the area with the most serious
incidence rate of the disease in the country.
</P>
<P>
The province kicked off a month-long poster design contest
today, which is World AIDS Day, aiming to increase AIDS awareness
among the younger generation.
</P>
<P>
International organizations, such as the Medecins sans
Frontiers (MSF), or Doctors Without Borders, have also become
involved in China's AIDS-prevention activities.
</P>
<P>
The number of reported HIV cases has grown steadily since 1989,
when the province first found HIV carriers among the drug addicts
in its western border area adjacent Myanmar, said local public
health officials.
</P>
<P>
And the situation has worsened since 1996. The disease has
spread from border areas to cities and towns, they said, adding
that unsafe sex has become another main cause.
</P>
<P>
The 5,104 HIV cases, and the 157 AIDS cases in the province by
1998 accounted for 44.3 percent and 57.3 percent respectively of
the country's total.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- China, with more than 400,000
HIV carriers, has become one of the Asian countries most seriously
plagued by the AIDS disease, according to the Ministry of Health.
</P>
<P>
China ranks the fourth in Asia in numbers of HIV-positive cases,
following India, Thailand and Myanmar, and 17th in world, Vice
Minister of Health Yin Dakui said at a national meeting to
coincide with World AIDS Day today.
</P>
<P>
China had 15,088 confirmed carriers of HIV by the end of
September, but estimates that more than 400,000 people have been
infected with the virus.
</P>
<P>
The World Health Organization and Joint United Nations Program
on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) have repeatedly warned that Asia might
replace sub-Saharan Africa as the most AIDS-ridden area in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"China is in a grave situation and the tasks ahead are very
hard and complicated, due to an enormous number of drug users and
people with multiple sex partners, plus over 100 million transient
people each year, and commercial blood-sellers, who all are
vulnerable to HIV/AIDS," Yin said.
</P>
<P>
Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), which are described as "
the shadow following HIV/AIDS," have been rapidly spreading across
China in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The reported STD cases amounted to 570,000 in the January-
September period of this year, almost equal to the annual figure
of last year, the MOH said, fearing that the real number may be
eight to ten times higher.
</P>
<P>
The national meeting, which was co-sponsored by the MOH and
ministries in charge of public security, education and publicity,
aimed to summarize the work of HIV/AIDS and STD control.
</P>
<P>
The work related to policy-making, education, and intervention
measures targeting at high-risk people will be discussed during
the two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
More than 110 units and 480 individuals specializing in the
field were awarded at the meeting here today for their outstanding
contributions.

<P>
CAIRO, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
on Wednesday held talks with visiting Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat on the latest developments of Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters before leaving Cairo for Gaza, Arafat
said the talks focused on the dispute between the Palestinians and
Israel over Israeli troop withdrawal from another 5 percent of the
West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side has proposed some changes for the maps of
withdrawal put forward by Israel, but Israel has failed to
respond, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of trying to avoid giving a reply.
</P>
<P>
Prior to each of the previous withdrawals, the two sides would
give their own suggestions and demands, and sign the maps after
discussions, Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
But this time, Israel decided the areas itself without
consulting the Palestinians, he said, stressing that it is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Under the Sharm el-Sheikh Memo signed in September, the
withdrawal should take place on November 15. But the Palestinians
rejected the Israeli maps, saying the areas are too sparsely
populated and not contiguous.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Cairo on Tuesday after a visit to Moscow. He
met with Egyptian Prime Minister Atef Obeid Tuesday night on ways
of promoting bilateral economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Obeid said after the meeting that the two sides hoped to
increase their trade volume to 500 million U.S. dollars in the
coming years.

The ribbon is intended to highlight the necessity of a national

He was greeted at the royal airport by Hamoud al-Harthy,
president of the state council of Oman, and other members of the
council.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day visit here, Li is expected to hold talks
with Hamoud al-Harthy and meet with Abdullah al-Qatabi, president
of the Consultative Assembly of Oman.
</P>
<P>
China-Oman relations developed smoothly during the past 21
years. In 1987 their foreign ministry officials launched an annual
consultative mechanism, and bilateral trade reached 746 million
U.S. dollars in 1998 as China became the fourth largest buyer of
Omani oil. That year China imported 5.8 million tons of oil from
the Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
Oman is the last leg of Li's six nation Asian-African tour
which he said is designed to "deepen understanding, enhance trust,
promote friendship and expand cooperation." The tour has taken him
to Mauritius, South Africa, Kenya, Palestine and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Tougher Rules Urged in Canada for Use of Pesticides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Tougher rules are being urged in
Canada for better protection of children from exposure to
pesticides.
</P>
<P>
"There is definitely cause for concern" about lax pesticide
controls, according to the Ontario College of Family Physicians
and the Canadian Environmental Law Association (CELA).
</P>
<P>
A 80-page study by CELA is being submitted to the House of
Commons, pointing out that most of the promises made since 1994 to
tighten the rules have been broken.
</P>
<P>
The study warns of a link between pesticide exposure and
reproductive effects ranging from decreasing fertility to
increased risk of spontaneous abortion.
</P>
<P>
"There appears to be a higher risk for some childhood cancers
such as leukemia and brain tumors associated with prenatal and
early exposure to certain pesticides," says the study released
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The CELA study, which was conducted last year, demands that
some 40 of the 7,500 pesticides registered in the country be
banned because they contain severely toxic agents known as
carcinogens.
</P>
<P>
The study also called for revisions to the registration
process, improved inspection of the use of pesticides and more
public access to pesticide information.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Russia on Wednesday lodged an
official protest against the U.S. over an espionage incident by a
staff member of the U.S. Embassy in Moscow, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A representative of the U.S. Embassy was called to the Russian
Foreign Ministry where he was handed a note of protest, Interfax
said, quoting a source with the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. diplomat, identified as 33-year-old Cheri Leberknight,
was caught on the spot while receiving classified military-
strategic materials from a Russian citizen on Monday, FSB
spokesman Alexander Zdanovich said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Interfax said the Russian Foreign Ministry has demanded
Leberknight, a second secretary of the military political section
of the U.S. Embassy, leave Russia.
</P>
<P>
The incident came at a time when Russian-U.S. relations were
at the lowest since the end of the Cold War, but Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov expressed the hope Tuesday that it "will not
impact on the development of bilateral relations."

<HEADLINE> Safety Should Be Top Priority in Production: Vice-Premier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- In a televised State Council
conference here today, Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo urged that
effective measures should be taken to prevent major accidents in
production.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to implementation of State Council directives on
production safety, accidents and the number of casualties across
China have dropped this year compared with last year's same period,
Wu said.
</P>
<P>
But since October, he noted, accidents resulting from personal
negligence and poor project quality have been on the rise, he
recalled.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the
State Council have always attached great importance to safety in
production, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier stressed that safety needs to be integrated
with production and efficiency. It is of vital importance to
balance safety with production, economic growth and people's
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
He outlined six tasks for the safety education:
</P>
<P>
-- Leading officials at all levels should respect safety in
production;
</P>
<P>
-- A nationwide check-up on safety in production will be
conducted beginning today;
</P>
<P>
-- Measures will be taken to prevent possible hidden dangers
caused by major accidents;
</P>
<P>
-- All accidents will be investigated and those who are mainly
responsible will be punished according to law;
</P>
<P>
-- A responsibility system will be instituted in all production
units; and
</P>
<P>
-- An educational campaign on safety in production will be
launched in all departments and areas.

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Spokesman Denies "Over-Spending" by Bureaux </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Hong Kong
Finance Bureau spokesman Wednesday ruled out "out-of-control"
spending by any bureaux or departments.
</P>
<P>
"Any suggestion that excessive spending by bureaux and
departments has led to the recorded deficit of 50.1 billion HK
dollars (6.4 billion U.S. dollars) for the first seven months of
this financial year is erroneous," the spokesman said in response
to media inquiry on a press report about "over-spending" by some
bureaux.
</P>
<P>
"To the contrary, total spending by bureaux and departments
under the General Recurrent Account for the first half of this
financial year of 92.8 billion HK dollars (11.9 billion U.S.
dollars) was only 46 percent of the approved provision of 200
billion HK dollars (25.6 billion U.S. dollars) for the year," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman explained that expenditure for each bureau and
department was authorized in accordance with provisions in the
Public Finance Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
The Annual Expenditure Estimates are approved by the
Legislative Council upon enactment of the Appropriation Ordinance.
</P>
<P>
"No changes can be made to the approved estimates in the course
of the year except with the approval of the Finance Committee or
under authority delegated by the Finance Committee. Changes to the
estimates approved under delegated authority are reported
regularly to the Finance Committee," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Our system of controlling and managing government expenditure
is both open and transparent. We are fully accountable to the
Legislature on the use of public funds," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the increase in spending by some bureaux in the
first six months of 1999-2000 over the same period in 1998-99, the
spokesman explained that the 1999-2000 expenditure estimate was
planned on the basis of growth, not cutbacks, to meet increases in
demand.
</P>
<P>
The year-on-year growth for individual bureaux or departments
is affected by their planned initiatives, many of which are
accounted for in the 1999-2000 Estimates approved by the
Legislative Council.
</P>
<P>
"By definition, non-recurrent expenditure is incurred for one-
off items and is lumpy in nature. You need to spend this year but
probably not the previous year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the public has a right to know the fiscal
position. Hence we are publishing the financial results in a
timely manner. To facilitate reporting, we are happy to render
assistance to the media in helping them understand the financial
and accounting arrangements," the spokesman added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- About 200 young people
participated in the "AIDS I Care Party" on the World AIDS Day
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The party was organized by the Hong Kong Advisory Council on
AIDS, Red Ribbon Center-UNAIDS Collaborating Center for Technical
Support and CABLE TV to tie in with this year's World AIDS
Campaign theme -- Listen, Learn, Live! World AIDS Campaign with
Children and Young People.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the party at Kowloon Shangri-La Hotel, Executive
Council member Rosanna Wong Yik-ming shared her experience on ways
to put across sex education and AIDS prevention messages to young
people.
</P>
<P>
She also appealed to all, especially the young, to help
disseminate positive messages on AIDS and accept HIV-infected/AIDS
patients.
</P>
<P>
As part of the World AIDS Campaign this year, a Japanese drama
series that puts across positive AIDS messages like safe sex and
acceptance of HIV-infected/AIDS patients was broadcast on CABLE
Cineplex in November this year.
</P>
<P>
CABLE TV received overwhelming responses, and viewers of the
drama were invited to take part in the party to exchange views on
the drama.
</P>
<P>
Participants were asked to write their wishes or thoughts on
HIV/AIDS on a card. They also played games centering on HIV/AIDS
issues and the drama.
</P>
<P>
Popular artist Miss Miriam Yeung, Hong Kong UNAIDS Ambassador,
was presented a trophy by Ms Wong for her participation. Miss
Yeung urged participants not to discriminate against HIV-infected/
AIDS patients.

<HEADLINE> Financial Secretary Outlines Chances and Challenges for HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is out of recession
but still faces opportunities as well as challenges, Hong Kong
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a luncheon speech at a forum, Tsang said Hong Kong has
recorded a GDP growth for the first time since the final quarter
of 1997, and investment is starting to flow back as confidence
levels edge upward.
</P>
<P>
The government has revised upward its GDP estimate for 1999 to
a growth rate of 1.8 percent, instead of the earlier 0.5 percent,
based on the strong performance in the third quarter's GDP, Tsang
said.
</P>
<P>
"So, technically, we are out of recession", the finance
secretary proclaimed.
</P>
<P>
What enables Hong Kong to tide over the Asian financial crisis
is Hong Kong's long-standing policy of fiscal prudence, he said.
"By keeping the expenditure within the trend rate of growth over
time, we have built up sizable fiscal reserves," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, Hong Kong has a shrinking revenue base,
partly as a result of the tax concession the government has made
over the years and partly as a result of the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is facing a sizable deficit this year and the deficit
next year was forecast at some 5.6 billion HK dollars (717.9
million HK dollars), according to Tsang.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's tax base is shrinking, Tsang said, noting that in
the current fiscal year, around 70 percent of the yield from
salaries tax is being shouldered by 15 percent of salaries tax
payers, and the situation is similar for profit tax.
</P>
<P>
The government, which is expecting structural changes in the
revenue base, may no longer rely so much on land-related revenue,
as the land supply and demand stabilize, Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
"We have to look at broadening our tax base to find other
stable sources of revenue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said it is his duty and the legislature's to bring Hong
Kong's financial position back into the black over the medium
term.
</P>
<P>
"This is also essential when if we are to maintain our
international credit rating, which underpins investors' confidence
in Hong Kong and the borrowing capability of local business,"
Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Though Hong Kong's economic growth figures are encouraging,
Tsang said the region is still vulnerable to external factors,
most notably from Japan and the United States, where the interest
rate trend could still impact on the stock market.
</P>
<P>
Another issue that needs to be addressed is Hong Kong's
long-term competitiveness, he said. "This will become even more
pronounced with the further opening up of the Mainland after its
accession into the WTO, a situation that will lead to increased
international competition in the nation's lower cost internal
markets."
</P>
<P>
Tsang warned that though Hong Kong may have the best services,
the best facilities, and the best expertise in brokering deals for
companies wanting to open up in China's mainland, if the costs are
high, Hong Kong "will be in danger of losing out to some other
regional cities."
</P>
<P>
He suggested that in some cases, Hong Kong's property prices,
rents and labor costs should have to be pegged back more if Hong
Kong is to provide real competition for its East Asian neighbors.

<HEADLINE> Feature: AIDS Virus Grips India's Urban Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Geeta's life changed two
years ago after her marriage with a bank clerk who had been
infected with the dreadful acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS).
</P>
<P>
Geeta, 28, a dweller in India's largest commercial city of
Numbai, had known the result when she went to a nearby hospital
for HIV test which, as she had expected, showed positive.
</P>
<P>
She is only one of millions of Indians infected by the fatal
human immune deficiency virus (HIV), which makes body's immune
system incapable of fighting diseases and infections.
</P>
<P>
While the government put the figures of HIV positive at 3.5
million, a report prepared jointly by the United Nations Program
on HIV/AIDS and the World Health Organization (WHO), said India is
home to about 4 million HIV-infected people, accounting for about
12 percent of the global burden of 33.6 million.
</P>
<P>
Even Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee admitted that AIDS has
become the most serious health problem the country is facing
today.
</P>
<P>
HIV has a significant grip on urban population in some southern
and western states of India with one pregnant women in 50 testing
positive for HIV, said the report entitled "AIDS epidemic updates:
December 1999."
</P>
<P>
HIV infection has also shot up in Northeastern parts of the
country, mainly through drug users who share the same syringe and
men who pass it to their wives.
</P>
<P>
What is more alarming is that 50 percent of those infected are
under the age of 24, said the National AIDS Control Organization
under the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the World AIDS Day Wednesday, Minister of
State for Health and Family Welfare N. T. Shanmugarm urged in a
newspaper report to educate people, especially the young, about
the ways and means to protest themselves and their dear ones from
this dreadful infection.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to all the people working on the AIDS control
program to work together, share knowledge and experience for the
control of HIV and AIDS before it is too late.
</P>
<P>
Having expanded and improved its surveillance system, India now
has a clearer idea of HIV prevalence, said the U.N. report
published here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, it stated, irrational fear and discrimination against
HIV positive patients have made prevention difficult in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Many hospitals reportedly turned away infected patients or
attended to them badly with many health workers felt that treating
HIV patients was a waste of time and money as they would
ultimately die.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, women, generally wives infected by their husbands,
were stigmatized and were frequently blamed by their in-laws for
the fate of their infected spouse, even in cases where they
themselves are not infected.
</P>
<P>
India witnessed 179,000 deaths due to AIDS last year out of the
total death toll of 2.285 million worldwide, according to WHO.
</P>
<P>
News media here complained that India, with a population of one
billion, has been extremely laggard in putting a proper system to
manage AIDS or HIV in place and the knee-jerk response of the
authorities and the general public to the disease has only
resulted in driving them underground.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Prepare Equipment for 500 Congo (K) Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council on Tuesday night asked U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to make preparations to equip up to 500 U.N. military observers,
should a decision be taken to send such a mission to the war-torn
Democratic Republic of Congo.
</P>
<P>
In a unanimously adopted resolution, the 15-member Council said
that the actual phased deployment of observers, together with
support and protection personnel, would be subject to another
resolution.
</P>
<P>
The Council stressed its intention to take such a decision
promptly on the basis of further recommendations by Annan ,taking
into account the findings of a U.N. technical team that has
visited the area.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. observer mission would help monitor a peace agreement,
signed in the Zambian capital of Lusaka in July to put an end to a
many-sided conflict in the central African country, formerly Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The observers might also serve as a forerunner of a U.N.
peacekeeping force of thousands of troops, though this is not
spelled out in the council resolution.
</P>
<P>
The fighting in Congo (K) pitted the government of President
Laurent Kabila, supported by Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola, against
rival rebel factions, backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special envoy for Congo (K) is Kamel Morjane, who was
appointed by Annan earlier this month and has been Tunisia's
representative to the United Nations in Geneva since October 1996.

<HEADLINE> Week-long Youth Festival Begins in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A week-long National Youth
Festival '99 marking the achievements and successes of the youth
development began in Bangladesh on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the festival in the capital city, Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina said the government would utilize the merit, vigor
and strength of the youths for making a prosperous nation to face
challenges of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
She said the government was determined to train the youths as
skilled forces capable of fighting poverty and unemployment so
that the nation could step into the next century as a
self-respected prosperous one.
</P>
<P>
Highlighting achievements of her government during the past
three and a half years, she said 900,000 unemployed youths were
imparted training, soft loans of nearly 2.3 billion taka (46
million U.S. dollars) were disbursed, and self-employment for
22,597 youth was created.
</P>
<P>
Youth training programs had been expanded from 230 centers to
470 centers since the Awami League took office in June 1996, she
said, urging the youths to rise above narrow political differences
and to devote themselves to nation-building tasks.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on Tuesday, State Minister for
Youth and Sport Obaidul Kader said nearly 250,000 unemployed
youths each year were being given skill development training
through mobile programs in the country.
</P>
<P>
The overall youth development programs included skill
development training, motivation of the unemployed youths to
self-employment with credit, and poverty alleviation of the rural
landless and unemployed people, he said.

<HEADLINE> TD Bank Expects Bigger Income for Canadians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD Bank)
is expecting the standard of living in Canada to bounce back to
the level of late 1980s within a few years.
</P>
<P>
"We expect gains of between 1.5 and 2 percent per year in real
personal disposable income per person over the next few years --
the best performance since late 1980s," the Globe and Mail
newspaper Wednesday quoted a TD Bank senior economist as saying.
</P>
<P>
People living in Newfoundland, Ontario and Alberta will
experience the largest jumps in personal income, with Albertans
doing the best, according to the bank.
</P>
<P>
In the country's richest province of Ontario, surging exports
have added an extra 1 billion Canadian dollars (about 678 million
U.S. dollars) to the province's revenue this year.
</P>
<P>
Much of Canada's growth is considered benefiting from the
surging U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The high-tech boom that has made millionaires throughout
California's Silicon Valley has also spilled into Canada, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The latest example comes from Burnaby, British Columbia, where
45 employees at Siara Systems will share a windfall from a merger
deal between their U.S. parent company and another U.S.-based high-
tech firm.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervaiz Musharraf stressed here Wednesday that the top
priority of the planned economic package should be self-reliance
by reducing the internal and external debt.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with members of the newly established Economic
Advisory Board which is preparing the economic package, Musharraf
said the package should benefit the common man and specifically
concentrate on the economic imbalances in the provinces to promote
national cohesion.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan needs to restore investor confidence by
introducing credible, consistent and continuing economic policy.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the new Pakistani government led by
Musharraf is to announce the much-awaited economic package on
December 15.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the nation after the military coup on October
12, Musharraf put the recovery of the economy on top of his

<HEADLINE> Reform Begins in China's University Logistics Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has started to reform
logistics services in its universities, aiming to set up a market-
oriented service network in three years that will satisfy the
needs of the higher education institutes in the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The reform aims to relieve the present college administrations
of logistical responsibilities related to student services, and to
set up groups to provide the schools with daily necessities such
as edible oil, grains, vegetables and paper.
</P>
<P>
Such measures will reduce service costs and also enable faculty
members to concentrate more fully on teaching, and thus improve
the country's educational level, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
The city also plans to build dormitories covering an area of
one million sq.m outside the university campuses to solve student
housing problems, and to open chain stores at schools. University
clinics and kindergartens will also be changed into independent
organizations, offering service to both the schools and the
communities.
</P>
<P>
The reform process is to be completed by 2002.

<HEADLINE> Iran Repeats Call for U.S. Sincerity in Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi reiterated here on Wednesday that the United States
should take concrete steps to show its sincerity in improving
relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Kharrazi said the statements
by U.S. officials during the past two years showed some changes
from the U.S. side, but the statements were contradictory and
were not enough to satisfy Iran.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has not shown a national will to improve relations
with Iran," he said, and the contradictory statements by
U.S. officials indicated differences inside the U.S. government
toward Iran.
</P>
<P>
The "wall of distrust" still exists between Iran and the
U.S. since Washington did not take specific steps to show a
national will to have ties with Iran, Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
He underlined Washington should make some fundamental changes
in its policies toward Iran with specific actions, adding
specific actions surely will bring about some development.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi noted that the U.S. should lift sanctions on Iran,
stop pressures on countries having economic cooperation with
Iran, particularly on the issue of transferring Caspian energy
through Iranian territories, put an end to interference in Iran's
internal affairs and support to the anti-Iran terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few months, several senior U.S. officials
extended overtures to Iran for "unconditional dialog" to improve
relations between the two countries which were severed in
1980.
</P>
<P>
However, Iranian officials repeatedly claimed that the U.S.
must take positive steps to change its hostile policy toward
Iran, otherwise any talks on relations would be "meaningless."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi also rejected a U.S. call for sending consulate
officials to Iran, saying that there is no suitable condition
for the U.S. to take such a step.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. recently proposed to send a consulate official to the
Swiss embassy in Tehran, which takes care of the U.S. interest in
Iran, with an aim to facilitating travels of Iranian and American
nationals between Iran and the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin on Monday
once again accused Iran of reneging on promises to abandon
support for terrorism in an attempt to destroy hopes among
Arabs and Israelis for a comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
"We have made clear to Iran that there cannot be an
improvement in relations until Iran takes meaningful steps to end
its support for terrorism and cooperates in the fight against
terrorism," Rubin said, "there cannot be a lifting of the
sanctions we imposed in the absence of meaningful steps to those
ends."
</P>
<P>
Rubin's remarks were rejected by Iranian Foreign Ministry
spokesman Hamid Reza Asefi on Tuesday. He said Iran itself has
been among the victims of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Asefi underlined Iran supports the Palestinian nation in their
efforts to restore their rights and liberate their own land,
saying that ignoring the natural rights of the Palestinian
refugees to return to their homeland along with keeping silence
vis-a-vis the Israeli expansionist policies, brings into question
the U.S. sincerity in its support for peace in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Leaves for Africa to Discuss U.S., U.N. Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. permanent
representative to the United Nations, Richard Holbrooke, Wednesday
heads for Africa on a tour to review the U.S. and U.N. role in a
continent riven by civil strife and stalked by AIDS, the No.1
killing disease in the world.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who became the head of the U.S. Mission to the U.N.
in early September, is due to arrive in the West African country
of Mali on Wednesday before moving on to Angola on Thursday,
Namibia on Friday and South Africa on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The main themes of the tour would be relations with the U.N.
and the United States, peace in Congo (K), the scourge of HIV and
AIDS and environmental protection, a spokesman for the U.S.
Mission here said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is also due to meet U.N. representative in Angola, a
country rich in oil and diamonds where fighting has flared again
last December between Angolan Government troops and rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), which has been
fighting for 25 years shortly after Angola's independence.
</P>
<P>
The envoy is expected to express U.S. support for a resolution
on ongoing civil strife in the former Zaire, and will visit most
of the countries involved in the war in Congo (K), where a many-
sided ceasefire is threatened.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke will also visit Rwanda and Uganda, which support
rebels of Congo (K), as well as Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe which
back Congolese President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution on Tuesday night,
asking U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to prepare equipment for
500 observers in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is scheduled to end his tour in Tunisia on December
11-12.

HONG KONG, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong-Japan and Japan-

promote trade, investment, tourism and understanding between the
two economies.

administrative and managerial capacities.

The committees agreed to convene their next joint plenary
session at a time convenient for both sides in Japan in 2000.

<HEADLINE> Intermediary Agencies to be Rectified </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 1 (Xinhua) -- China will sort out and rectify
its intermediary agencies in an attempt to give full play to their
role in maintaining market and economic order.
</P>
<P>
According to a circular issued by the General Office of the
State Council here today, the scope of the current rectification
covers all intermediary agencies and their trade organizations,
including accounting firms, financial consulting companies,
taxation and law offices, assets and price evaluation firms, and
project cost auditing organs.
</P>
<P>
The work will be done in three stages. First, all intermediary
agencies will be sorted out. Second, agencies to be retained will
separate their operations from government administration. Third,
management of intermediary agencies will be standardized and
unified.
</P>
<P>
A leading group composed of 10 government departments including
the Ministry of Finance, State Development Planning Commission and
Ministry of Supervision has been set up to oversee the
rectification work which will run through late 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to incomplete statistics, China had 20,000 economic
intermediary agencies with 160,000 professionals and 300,000 staff
members by the end of 1998.

<HEADLINE> India Opposed To New Round Of WTO Talks: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 1 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee said Wednesday that New Delhi did not favor a
wide-ranging new round of negotiations within the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee told parliament that India was also opposed to the
linkage of seven issues including labor and environment with
trade.
</P>
<P>
However, he said in a statement in response to questions raised
by the opposition that India was prepared for a few new items
being taken up for negotiations provided implementation issues
arising from the Uruguay Round were also resolved to its
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
On a reported deal between New Delhi and Washington at the
ongoing WTO ministerial meeting at Seattle, he said India was also
opposed to linking trade with core labor standards, environmental
issues, Coherent Global Architecture, investment issues,
non-governmental organizations' involvement in WTO negotiations
and competition policy.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, some opposition members staged a noisy
walk-out after kicking up a row alleging that India and the U.S.
had entered into a "clandestine deal at Seattle" and demanded a
statement from Vajpayee to clarify the government's position on
the issue.

ISLAMABAD, December 1 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for Pakistan's
Information Ministry expressed his "deep regret" over the raid by
some unidentified persons on the office of a Turkish news agency
here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman assured the Turkish News Agency that strict
action would be taken against the culprits and that no such
incident would take place in future.

No such incident could ever have an adverse effect on the close
and brotherly relations between the peoples and the governments of
Pakistan and Turkey, he added.

Police sources said five people who identified themselves as
officers of the Intelligence Bureau raided the office of Turkish
Zaman International Agency and kept the entire staff under
detention.

Zaman's bureau chief Halit Esendir said the five people kept
the entire staff under detention and even did not allow them to

They were apparently unarmed, but threatened to abduct if the
staff members did not cooperate, Esendir said.

It is still unknown what is the motive for the raid incident.
