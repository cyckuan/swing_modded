<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- Jason Kidd scored 12 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter
and the Phoenix Suns handed the Denver Nuggets their sixth straight loss, 101-99
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Kidd and Cliff Robinson, who also had 24 points, hit key shots down the
stretch.
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Gugliotta added 21 points and 15 rebounds for Phoenix, and Kidd had 12
assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver was led by Antonio McDyess with 26 points and Raef LaFrentz with 22.
</P>
<P>
	   The well-rested Suns, who hadn't played since beating the Nuggets 113-100 in
Phoenix on Sunday, led 93-86 with 4:05 left after Robinson's 3-pointer and
Kidd's layup.
</P>
<P>
	   Denver's Bryant Stith countered with a 3-point basket and a layup, cutting
the deficit to 93-91.
</P>
<P>
	   After a second critical offensive foul against McDyess, Kidd bowled over
Nick Van Exel on a drive to the baseline and hit a 15-footer with 57 seconds to
go.
</P>
<P>
	   After one free throw by McDyess, Robinson hit a 17-footer from the corner
for a 97-92 lead with 28 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   LaFrentz had a 3-pointer and George McCloud three free throws, but Kidd was
4-for-4 from the line in the last 17 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   The Suns hit 21 of 22 free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson had nine points in the first quarter, helping fuel a 12-1 run that
gave the Suns a 21-12 lead. Denver committed nine turnovers compared to
Phoenix's two, but the Nuggets managed to trim the deficit to 27-21 at the end
of the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   LaFrentz then scored 14 points in the second quarter, including 12 in a row,
and the Nuggets' 21-7 flurry produced a 42-34 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Phoenix answered with its own 11-2 spurt, capped by Kidd's layup, for a
45-44 lead with 3:22 left in the half. But 3-pointers by McCloud and Van Exel
helped give Denver a 57-53 lead at intermission.
</P>
<P>
	   Gugliotta had eight points and six rebounds in the third quarter, when the
Suns used a 10-0 run to help forge an 80-75 lead entering the final period.

<HEADLINE> McCain lawyers begin fight to stay on New York primary ballot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - While admitting they don't have enough signatures in
some districts to meet New York requirements, lawyers for Sen. John McCain still
defended petitions intended to qualify the Republican presidential contender for
the GOP primary ballot in New York.
<P>
	   State Republican leaders, who support Texas Gov. George W. Bush, have
challenged McCain's petitions in 16 of New York's 31 congressional districts,
claiming he failed to obtain the required number of signatures from party
members.
</P>
<P>
	   Should all the challenges be upheld, McCain would find himself competing for
delegates in less than half the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Board of Elections held a hearing on those challenges on Friday.
McCain has also filed a federal court lawsuit in an attempt to assure his
appearance on New York's March 7 primary ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   With polls showing McCain running ahead of Bush in New Hampshire, the battle
over the New York primary ballot has taken on extra significance.
</P>
<P>
	   Board member Evelyn Aquila, a Democrat from Brooklyn, heard preliminary
arguments from both sides Friday and inspected signatures and addresses on
McCain's petitions. She will make a recommendation to the full board on Tuesday
on the petitions' validity and the board is expected to decide that same day
which, if any, of the McCain petitions should be thrown out.
</P>
<P>
	   On the four-member Board of Elections - two Democrats and two Republicans -
three votes are required to declare petitions invalid.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York, GOP candidates must get a certain number of signatures from
party members to qualify for separate convention delegate slates in each of the
state's 31 congressional districts in which they wish to compete. In effect,
there are 31 separate GOP primaries in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "Although the election law of the state of New York has established a
minimum number of signatures required, the McCain campaign ... is challenging
the number of signatures as an unconstitutional burden," McCain lawyer Henry
Berger said.
</P>
<P>
	   "We will stipulate ... that the number of signatures in the volume is less
than that required by New York election law, but we believe that it meets the
constitutional requirements to place Sen. McCain on the ballot," Berger added.
He did not explain why he felt the campaign had met the "constitutional
requirements."
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously, we dispute the unconstitutionality of the election laws but
that's for another venue," Jeffrey Buley, a lawyer working at the direction of
state GOP Chairman William Powers and who filed most of the challenges against
McCain's petitions, said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's lawsuit will be heard in federal court at the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
	   In some districts, McCain's campaign has conceded being short by hundreds of
signatures. In others, like the Bronx, McCain had enough signatures, but the
signers weren't from that congressional district as required by election law,
Buley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Commissioner Aquila noted that congressional district can end in the middle
of a street, throwing neighbors into different districts without them even
knowing it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel so badly for people when this happens," she said. "They think
they're signing for someone and then it ends up not counting."

<HEADLINE> Upstate braces for weekend cold, recovers from Thursday snow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The air felt as cold as 50-below zero overnight, but
many residents statewide were still steaming.
<P>
	   The chairman of the Onondaga County Legislature is one of them. Bill Sanford
says oil companies are ripping off New Yorkers this winter during this
particular cold snap. He said gasoline prices have jumped to $1.40 and more per
gallon with another increase expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Heating oil prices have risen from 65 cents a gallon in November to $1.11 a
gallon, he told WIXT-TV in Syracuse. That's the kind of unanticipated jump in
price that drives up the cost of all governments that have to heat all those big
buildings, and gas up all those vehicles.
</P>
<P>
	   One big fuel retailer in the state, Agway, says the price increases aren't
gouging, but the result of slowed OPEC oil productions and U.S. exports rising
to Europe where there is record demand.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the reason, the prices are likely to keep resident hot under the
collar when they get bills that cover this weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's high looks like a typo: 8 degrees. Despite sunny skies, winds will
drive the wind chill down to 20- and 40-below zero before they subside in the
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   "Upstate New York was lucky during the first part of the winter because most
weather fronts were moving from east to west," Hugh Johnson, a meteorologist
with the National Weather Service, said. "Now the weather is moving from the
Northwest - Alaska and parts of western Canada - to the East."
</P>
<P>
	   Throughout central and western portions of the state, lows are expected to
dip into the negative digits on Saturday to as low as 15 below with the
possibility of some snow on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Albany, Ron Russeau, the operations manager for Central Service Center
Towing, said that his company had taken about 400 calls a day for the last three
days.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most of my people have been working 18 hour shifts, and I've got all of my
18 trucks on the road," Russeau said. "With the weather getting even colder,
we're expecting even more jump starts and tows over the weekend."
</P>
<P>
	   In Syracuse, where thermometers hit zero during the day Friday, schools
canceled classes and local hospitals publicly advised parents to keep their
children indoors as strong winds made it feel more like minus 15 to minus 30.
</P>
<P>
	   "I would really not recommend that children be outside on a day like today,"
said Dr. Deborah Mann at University Hospital. "They are a greater risk of
developing both frostbite and hypothermia. They are not as self-aware as adults
are. They may not come in when they have warning signs."
</P>
<P>
	   Ken Pearson was making a quick dash from his office to an ATM machine down
the street. The block was deserted except for Pearson. He was bundled up to the

some people who welcomed subzero temperatures. Bill Mikolay was one.
</P>
<P>
	   He had been patiently waiting this winter for Oneida Lake to freeze over to
go ice fishing. The last open water on the lake finally turned to ice this week,
marking the second-latest date in the past 25 winters that the lake has frozen
over for the season, according to the Cornell University Biological Field
Station. The latest date was two years ago when the lake didn't freeze
completely until Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   "It seems the longer you wait the better it feels," Mikolay said as he
headed out to his fishing shelter. "Every moment is precious, it seems, across
the lake."
</P>
<P>
	   In Rochester, temperatures are expected to take a nose dive again, dropping
to zero and below today. The wind chill will make it feel even colder.
</P>
<P>
	   Friday's cold followed about 7.5 inches of snow at the Greater Rochester
International Airport on Thursday. The snow slowed traffic on area expressways
to a crawl.
</P>
<P>
	   At Fort Drum, near Watertown, Army Cpl. Jeremy W. Peters slid a black wool
Army ski mask over his face Friday morning to block out the 1-degree weather
before running 3 miles with his squad for physical training.
</P>
<P>
	   "You've got to make sure all exposed skin is covered," said Peters.
</P>
<P>
	   Soldiers and commanders said they take extra precautions when the
temperatures dip as low as they've been the last few days. Besides his ski mask,
Peters wore three layers of shirts, sweatshirts and thermal underwear beneath
his gray Army jogging suit and a wool cap over the mask. He also had Gortex
gloves.

<HEADLINE> Records of dormitory fire drills sought by investigators  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - Seton Hall students said they couldn't recall
having fire drills, and school officials have admitted there were none last
semester at the freshman dormitory where students died in an early morning fire
on Wednesday.
<P>
	   Investigators attempting to determine the cause of a fire that killed three
Seton Hall University freshmen in the Boland Hall dormitory are seeking records
about the building, including reports on whether required fire drills were
conducted, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The six-story dormitory housed 640 freshmen where the fire broke out around
4:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Six of the 58 injured students remained hospitalized Friday, including four
in critical condition with serious burns.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes at the 10,000-student Roman Catholic school are to resume Tuesday
afternoon, following a memorial service in the morning.
</P>
<P>
	   University spokeswoman Lisa E. Grider said Boland had no drills in the fall
semester.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were fire education programs, where the (resident assistant) posts
the fire evacuation plan and talks in a meeting with students," Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   She could not immediately say how many programs had been conducted, or
whether the school had records on fire drills.
</P>
<P>
	   Two sophomores on the campus Friday were dismissive of university fire
procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   "We didn't have any drills when we lived in Boland last year," said Vordana
Ruggeri, 19, of Somerset, who now lives in Xavier Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Added Bobb Barber, 19, of Millville, "They don't even wake us up when the
alarm goes off."
</P>
<P>
	   Students have evacuated Boland during the 18 alarms that have rung at the
hall since September, but in only one instance was there a fire, in a nearby
trash bin, Grider said.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if the planning sessions and 18 alarms gave students sufficient
emergency practice, Grider said, "Put that information to your readers, and let
them decide for themselves."
</P>
<P>
	   False alarms are no replacement for organized, planned drills, said William
Cane, director of the state Division of Fire Safety.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would be monitored by the administration, or the fire official, or
both," said Cane.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the fire education programs could be considered part of a drill.
</P>
<P>
	   College dormitories in New Jersey have been required since at least 1995 to
have two fire drills a year and maintain reports about the drills for the local
fire official, under the state Uniform Fire Code, Cane said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since January 1999, those reports had to be filed with the local fire
official, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cane said his office has not yet inspected the university's records
subpoenaed by an Essex County grand jury, so he could not say whether the papers
included reports of drills.
</P>
<P>
	   In South Orange, the fire official is also the fire chief, Jeffrey Markey,
said township attorney Edwin A. Matthews.
</P>
<P>
	   Matthews could not say if Markey ever received reports on fire drills. He
declined to make the chief available for an interview, citing Markey's role in
the continuing investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   The grand jury has subpoenaed fire inspection records and engineering plans
for Boland Hall, said Charlotte L. Smith, executive assistant Essex County
prosecutor. She would not discuss the contents of the records.
</P>
<P>
	   No cause has yet been determined for the fire, and no charges or arrests
have been made, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith did not know whether investigators had identified or located three
young men who were asked to leave the dormitory 45 minutes before the fire
alarms sounded. A dorm staffer, realizing they were not residents of Boland
Hall, kicked them out of the lounge.
</P>
<P>
	   Boland Hall is one of two university dormitories without sprinklers. The
fatal fire prompted Gov. Christie Whitman to say she would consider legislation
requiring sprinklers in all college dormitories.
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall is also considering installing sprinklers in Boland, Grider has
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Funerals are scheduled Monday for the three victims: Frank S. Caltabilota of
West Long Branch, John N. Giunta of Vineland and Aaron C. Karol of Green Brook.
All were 18-year-old freshmen.
</P>
<P>
	   The school postponed athletic events after the fire. The men's basketball
game at Syracuse was rescheduled for 7 p.m. on Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   ----
</P>
<P>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Essex County prosecutor's office has a toll-free hotline
for anyone with information on the cause of the fire. The 24-hour number is:
1-800-375-3829.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Starts Library Fund Raiser  </HEADLINE>
   By AARON J. LOPEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Buoyed by a $250,000 donation and the support of
the school board, a group of Columbine High School parents started a
fund-raising campaign Friday to replace the library where two gunmen killed
eight classmates and themselves.
</P>
<P>
	   The group wants to raise $3.1 million before the one-year anniversary of the
nation's worst school shooting. The Jefferson County School Board on Thursday
approved tearing down the library and building a new library wing.
</P>
<P>
	   Twelve students and a teacher died after Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold,
armed with guns and homemade bombs, opened fire at Columbine on April 20.
</P>
<P>
	   The library, where most of the victims, died was never reopened, and its
doors were walled off with lockers. A temporary library was set up in a trailer.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You know what would be incredible is to stand up on April 20 and say,
'We've got $3.1 million,''' said Dawn Anna, whose daughter Lauren Townsend was
killed in the rampage.
</P>
<P>
	   The largest donation so far, $250,000, came from Sharon Magness, whose late
husband Bill Magness co-founded cable giant TeleCommunications Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The parents group, Healing of People Everywhere, also has received more
$30,000 from Public Service Co. and from the Denver Rocky Mountain News.
</P>
<P>
	   The group estimates it will need $300,000 to begin the design process,
$777,500 to raze the library and $2 million to build a new 14,000- to
15,000-square foot library, which it hopes to have open by the 2001-02 school
year.

<HEADLINE> Junta Announced in Ecuador  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's military chief announced late Friday a
three-person ``government junta'' to replace President Jamil Mahuad, who went
into hiding after a rebellion led by Indians and backed by the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad insisted he would not resign -- but he abandoned the palace where he
worked and lived in the afternoon after refusing a request from the military
high command to step down.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking in the name of the junta, Gen. Carlos Mendoza, the head of the
joint military command who was named defense minister last week, said: ``It is a
government of the Ecuadorean people. We cannot speak of left or right.''
</P>
<P>
	   Shortly before midnight the three members of the junta emerged from a
meeting at the national palace to present themselves to the news media as
Ecuador's new leaders. In addition to Mendoza, the members are Antonio Vargas,
leader of an Indian federation that organized the protests, and Carlos
Solorzano, a former Supreme Court judge.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of people streamed onto the plaza in front of the national palace,
mingling with soldiers in combat gear and celebrating, some waving the red flag
of an extreme-left party.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a day of political chaos, with Indians demanding Mahuad's resignation
and forcing their way into Congress and the Supreme Court. After first backing
Mahuad, the military later in the day decided to support the protest, saying it
was the only way to prevent ``a social explosion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad has refused to step down, saying during a nationwide television
broadcast that anyone who wanted to overthrow him would have to do it by force.
Late Friday, Interior Minister Vladimiro Alvarez said in a television interview
that ``the president has no intention of leaving the country.''

<HEADLINE> Bomb Victim Sought Restraining Order  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA VOZZELLA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEDFORD, Mass. (AP) -- Sandra Berfield was so afraid of someone who had been
stalking her that she slept with a knife and installed a surveillance camera in
her apartment, according to newspaper reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Berfield may have let her guard down when she opened a package left on
her doorstep Thursday in the Boston suburb of Everett. The bomb inside exploded,
killing her.
</P>
<P>
	   Police searched the home of a man she had accused of stalking her, Steven
Caruso, 44, but authorities refused to name him -- or anyone else -- as a
suspect Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Elliot Levine, an attorney for Caruso, denied that his client had stalked
Berfield. He also denied that Caruso had anything to do with Berfield's death.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He is absolutely shocked and proclaims his innocence,'' Levine told the
Boston Herald.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Berfield, 32, first sought a restraining order against Caruso in October
1998. In court documents, she wrote that she believed he had slashed her car's
tires and poured antifreeze in the gas tank. She also accused him of stalking
her at home and at the restaurant where she worked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was told that I wouldn't wait on him anymore ... because he was scaring
me and making me uncomfortable,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Caruso denied the allegations, saying they arose from ``hysteria.'' But he
was ordered to stay away from her home as well as where she worked, Bickford's
restaurant in Medford and Josie's Bar in Everett.
</P>
<P>
	   Caruso was charged with malicious destruction of property for the damage to
Ms. Berfield's car. Before his trial, his bail was revoked after Ms. Berfield
said he was lurking outside the restaurant. He was convicted last May and
sentenced to six months in jail, plus a year's probation, but was released in
July.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Berfield's friends said she was always looking over her shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You could see it,'' said Daniel Menendez, the general manager at
Bickford's. ``You could see it in her eyes, the way she speaks, the way she
acts, the way she walks.''
</P>
<P>
	   She would go to the restaurant's windows to see if her alleged stalker was
there, Menendez said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Boston Globe reported that Ms. Berfield had installed a video camera in
her apartment in an attempt to catch Caruso in front of her building after her
car had been vandalized. The Boston Herald reported that she slept with a knife.
Prosecutors wouldn't comment on either report.
</P>
<P>
	   Caruso wasn't at his home in the suburb of Medford on Friday, and his
whereabouts were unclear.
</P>
<P>
	   Friends and co-workers described Ms. Berfield as giving and kind.
</P>
<P>
	   At Bickford's, where she waited tables for 12 years, she befriended a
homeless man and would buy him meals out of her tips on a regular basis,
Menendez said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She would do things that people wouldn't even think of doing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Berfield lived alone. She had a 12-year-old daughter who died about
three years ago from spina bifida. She often participated in fund-raisers for
the disease, including a local walk-a-thon.

    CALGARY, Alberta (AP) -- Valeri Bure scored twice, including the
game-winner, as Calgary beat Nashville 5-4 on Friday night for the Flames'
NHL-record ninth overtime victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Calgary improved its overtime record to 9-1-5, breaking the NHL record of
eight victories set by Winnipeg in 1987-88.
</P>
<P>
	   Marc Savard set up the winning goal 3:06 into the extra session, breaking
into the Nashville zone and passing across to Bure, who beat goalie Mike Dunham
for the Calgary forward's 24th goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   Nashville appeared to take a 5-4 lead with 2:52 left in the third period
when Cliff Ronning fired a shot from the high slot past Fred Brathwaite. But
referee Bill McCreary ruled that Sergei Krivoskrasov interfered with Brathwaite.
</P>
<P>
	   Jarome Iginla had a goal and two assists, and Bobby Dollas, Jeff Shantz also
scored for Calgary. The Flames have won seven straight at home and are 13-1-1 in
their last 15 games at the Canadian Airlines Saddledome.
</P>
<P>
	   Drake Berehowsky had two power-play goals for Nashville, and Vitali
Yachmenev and Mark Mowers also scored.
</P>
<P>
	   Iginla tied it at 4 at 10:27 of the third period. Savard made a perfect pass
between his legs to Iginla, who was wide open in front of the goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Nashville took a 4-3 lead 1:44 into the third when Mowers fired a wrist shot
from the top of the faceoff circle past Brathwaite. Mowers has two goals in two
games since being recalled from Nashville of the International Hockey League.

<HEADLINE> Junta Announced in Ecuador  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's military chief announced late Friday a
three-person junta to replace the unpopular president, who fled after a
rebellion led by Indians and backed by the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   President Jamil Mahuad insisted he would not resign -- but he abandoned the
palace where he worked and lived in the afternoon after refusing a request from
the military high command to step down.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking in the name of the junta, Gen. Carlos Mendoza, the head of the
joint military command who was named defense minister last week, said: ``It is a

</P>
<P>
	   Shortly before midnight the three members of the junta emerged from a

Ecuador's new leaders. In addition to Mendoza, the members are Antonio Vargas,
leader of an Indian federation that organized the protests, and Carlos
Solorzano, a former Supreme Court judge.
</P>
<P>
	   Thousands of people streamed onto the plaza in front of the national palace,
mingling with soldiers in combat gear and celebrating, some waving the red flag
of an extreme-left party.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a day of political chaos, with Indians demanding Mahuad's resignation
and forcing their way into Congress and the Supreme Court. After first backing
Mahuad, the military later in the day decided to support the protest, saying it
was the only way to prevent ``a social explosion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad had insisted he would not step down, saying during a nationwide
television broadcast that anyone who wanted to overthrow him would have to do it
by force. Late Friday, Interior Minister Vladimiro Alvarez said in a television
interview that ``the president has no intention of leaving the country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ecuador's economic woes appear to have led to the unusual Indian uprising.
Last year, inflation reached 60 percent, the highest in Latin America, and only
one in three in the labor force has full-time work. A vast majority of the
nation's 4 million Indians live in poverty.
</P>
<P>
	   At an emergency meeting of the Organization of American States in
Washington, Ecuador's ambassador, Patricio Vivanco, said Mahuad had abandoned
the presidential palace in Quito and taken refuge at a military base in the
city.
</P>
<P>
	   The OAS unanimously adopted a resolution condemning the attempt to overthrow
the government and expressed full support for Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   South American leaders also lined up in support of Mahuad, issuing
statements condemning attempts to oust him. A statement issued by the U.S.
Embassy in Lima, Peru, urged Ecuador's armed forces and police to uphold Mahuad.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Whatever regime arises from this unconstitutional process will confront
political and economic isolation, bringing more misery to the Ecuadorean
people,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day in Quito, guards stepped aside when hundreds of Indians
accompanied by an unknown number of military officers stormed an empty Congress
building, seized the podium and announced that they had created their own
``Parliament of the People.'' Military leaders said 120 officers were involved
in the rebellion, along with an undetermined number of troops.
</P>
<P>
	   While downtown Quito during the day was in chaos -- with Indians armed with
rocks and clubs paralyzing traffic and menacing pedestrians -- most of the
country and much of the city seemed unfazed and Mahuad said he had no intention
of stepping down.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am not going to abandon you,'' Mahuad, 50, said his nationwide
television broadcast, his only public appearance of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you want to take power through force, gentlemen, take power through
force,'' he said, directing his comments to the military high command, which
only a few minutes before had asked him to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Mahuad left the national palace with close aides and was being
protected by several military officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The actions by the armed forces seemed more a result of their growing
impatience with Mahuad's inability to handle the Indian rebellion, which was
part of a month of broader protests. They backed the attempted takeover mainly
to prevent ``a social explosion,'' said Gen. Carlos Mendoza, who was joint
military commander until becoming defense minister last week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are conscious that we must maintain order and discipline in the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two men were killed and eight were wounded by gunfire during protests and
looting in Quito, Guayaquil, and two smaller cities, the Red Cross said. The two
men who were killed were shot by merchants while allegedly looting a public
market in Portoviejo.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day in Guayaquil, 165 miles southwest of the capital, a group
of leftist-led unions, student organizations and neighborhood associations
seized the provincial government building.
</P>
<P>
	   The protesters are also upset about Mahuad's plans to scrap Ecuador's
currency for the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   In becoming the first South American country seeking to adopt the greenback,
Ecuador was hoping to curb inflation, bring down interest rates to U.S. levels
and spur investment to end the country's deep recession.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics contended that Mahuad's decision to establish the conversion rate at
25,000 sucres to the dollar would have devastating repercussions for the
thousands of Ecuadoreans whose savings are in sucres. A year ago, the sucre was
valued at 7,000 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   The vast majority of Ecuador's Indians live in the Andean highlands and
speak Quichua, a dialect of the language spoken by the Incas.

<HEADLINE> Bush Confident on Iowa, N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SIOUX CITY, Iowa (AP) -- George W. Bush said Friday he is confident he will
prevail in the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary, perhaps sealing the
Republican presidential nomination within days of the first balloting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor and GOP front-runner made his remarks during informal
converations with reporters as he flew aboard their press charter after a
campaign appearance in Council Bluffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa voters go to nominating caucuses Monday; New Hampshire holds its
first-in-the-nation primary on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has expressed similar sentiments about his chances in recent days,
despite attacks from his rivals in Iowa about his abortion stance, and polls
showing Sen. John McCain of Arizona holding an edge in New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, Bush said ``it should be up to each state legislature'' to
decide what limits to place on abortions, adding that the Supreme Court erred by
issuing a ruling on the issue 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bush did not directly call for the outright repeal of the 1973 Roe vs.
Wade decision that legalized abortions, and his comments, in the closing days of
the Iowa caucus campaign, drew a taunting reply from GOP rival Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Come on, even if people disagree with you, they'll respect you for having
a firm stand and believing in principle,'' Forbes said. ``But he ducked it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The volatile issue has flared in recent days, as anti-abortion forces gird
for their annual march in Washington on the anniversary of the court's ruling,
and as Iowa prepares to inaugurate the 2000 presidential campaign with its
kickoff caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who is campaigning as a compassionate conservative, opposes abortion
except in cases of rape, incest and where the life of the mother is at stake.
But he doesn't emphasize the issue. Forbes does, and hopes to parlay his stand
into a second-place finish in next Monday's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Fielding questions on abortion for the second day, Bush was asked to clarify
his statement Thursday that the 1973 decision legalizing abortion ``was a
stretch.'' The Texas governor and GOP presidential front-runner replied: ``I
felt like it was a case where the court took the place of what the legislatures
should do in America.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked further what he thought the state legislatures should do, Bush said,
``It should be up to each legislature.''
</P>
<P>
	   His answer remained basically the same each time Bush was asked if he though
Roe vs. Wade should be overturned. ``This is a case where the court stepped
across its bounds and usurped the right of the legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
	   Aides later said Bush believes states should have the right to impose strict
anti-abortion laws, as they could before Roe vs. Wade. Here in Iowa, Roe vs.
Wade overturned just such a law.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokeswoman Karen Hughes said Bush's remarks were consistent with his
longstated view that the Supreme Court should strictly interpret the
Constitution in all cases including abortion, and that such issues should be
left to state legislatures and Congress to decide.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's ultimate goal is a constitutional amendment banning abortion --
except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the mother's life -- which state
legislatures as well as Congress would have to approve. Bush has said the
country is not ready to pass such a sweeping amendment.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion is a critical issue in the caucuses in Iowa where social
conservatives will make up a large chunk of the vote Monday night. One in 10
Republican likely to attend the caucuses say a candidates' ``pro-life'' views
are most important.
</P>
<P>
	   Seeking a politically safe way to couch his views, Bush has settled on
criticizing the Supreme Court ruling without directly saying that Roe vs. Wade
should be overturned.
</P>
<P>
	   His challenge is to appease conservatives in the primary campaign without
alienating swing voters before the general election in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush got some unexpected support from McCain. The Arizona senator said he
opposes abortion but would accept it in cases of rape, incest or where the
mother's life is in danger. Bush holds the same view.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that Roe v. Wade was a flawed decision, yes, and overreached and
that's why I think it should be repealed,'' McCain said in Greenville, S.C.
</P>
<P>
	   With the first voting of the 2000 election set to begin Monday, Bush and his
rivals are crisscrossing Iowa in search of votes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've got a good chance, but people should not be complacent,'' Bush said
as he strolled down the street in Grinnell. ``That's why I'm working so hard
right now, to make sure people hear the call.''
</P>
<P>
	   In other campaign developments Friday:
</P>
<P>
	   --Bush toured the Teen Challenge of the Midlands in Colfax, a center
sponsored by religious groups that provides alcohol and drug counseling.
</P>
<P>
	   After hearing three men talk about their efforts to overcome their problems,
Bush stood before the entire group and said: ``I used to drink too much. I quit
drinking, and I believe it was because (the Rev.) Billy Graham planted a seed in
my heart. ... I want you to know that your life's walk is shared by a lot of
other people -- even some who wear suits.''
</P>
<P>
	   --The 30-member Republican Governors Association endorsed Bush's tax-cut
plan. The same group recently endorsed Bush's candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   --New Hampshire Sen. Judd Gregg began appearing in an ad praising Bush's tax
plan. Gregg said: ``Now some say Bush's plan to cut taxes is too much. They
believe if you leave money in Washington, it will not be spent. We know
better.''

Two Arrested For Date Rape Kits
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) -- Two brothers were arrested for allegedly using the
Internet to sell $200,000 in kits for making so-called date rape drugs, New
Jersey Attorney General John J. Farmer Jr. said Friday. Jeffrey Suggs, 33, and
Kenneth Suggs, 29, were being held without bond. The two men used the Internet
to advertise kits containing the chemical GHB, or gamma hydroxybutyrate, Farmer
said. The drug is a depressant that has been used in sexual assaults throughout
the country. In sufficient quantities, it causes loss of consciousness and it
usually leaves the victim with little or no memory of the attack. If convicted,
the men face prison sentences of five to 10 years and fines of up to $150,000.

	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers flew to New York from Cuba
Friday to appeal for his return, saying the boy's late mother will not "rest in
peace" until the 6-year-old boy is back in his homeland. "Respect the memory of
my daughter," said the boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez. She and the
boy's paternal grandmother, Mariela Quintana, flew with a church delegation that
has supported Elian's return over the objections of the boy's relatives in
Miami. Those relatives have invited the grandmothers to visit, but the two
refused.

<HEADLINE> Helms' UN Appearance May Help U.S.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- On many levels, Sen. Jesse Helms' appearance before
the Security Council only served to further alienate the United States from the
United Nations, confirming perceptions of American hostility to and disdain for
multilateral diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Helms questioned the very foundations on which the United Nations is
built, saying the United States would respect the organization and its charter
as long as they don't impede on America's rights to do what it thinks best for
the world.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American people will never accept the claims of the United Nations to
be the `sole source of legitimacy on the use of force,' in the world,'' the
Republican senator declared.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a sentiment fell on unsympathetic ears Thursday in the council chamber,
where ambassador after ambassador challenged the influential conservative on
nearly every point of his speech.
</P>
<P>
	   French Ambassador Alain Dejammet reminded Helms how such a mentality had
harmed the world, noting that it was the unilateral U.S. support for South
Africa's apartheid government that blocked the independence of a council member,
Namibia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We did hear you, but the idea in this house is that others must be heard
as well,'' Dejammet said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet however antagonistic Helms' remarks may have sounded to ambassadors, the
senator's performance may actually help the United States begin to mend its
frayed relationship with the organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Holbrooke may well have scored his first diplomatic victory since
becoming Washington's U.N. ambassador by showing the United Nations' 187 other
members just what he is up against in pushing the U.N. agenda in the
Republican-controlled U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Holbrooke has the daunting task of trying to convince those 187 countries to
accept a host of Helms-mandated conditions to free up $926 million in back dues
the United States owes the organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Those conditions include agreeing to reduce the American share of the U.N.
operating and peacekeeping budgets by tens of millions of dollars at a time when
the United Nations is barely scraping by as it is.
</P>
<P>
	   After hearing the senator in person, those ambassadors may well come to the
conclusion that they can't fight the man who has so much control over the U.N.
purse strings, no matter how hawkish his views.
</P>
<P>
	   And many agreed with Helms that the United Nations is imperfect and needs
reform. But they rejected his strategy to condition payment on those reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Under the United Nations Charter, which was ratified by the United States,
a member state cannot attach conditions to its willingness to pay its assessed
contributions to the organization,'' Dutch Ambassador Peter van Walsum said.
</P>
<P>
	   Whether Holbrooke can convince them otherwise will bear out over the next
few months. John Ruggie, one of Secretary-General Kofi Annan's top advisers,
said Holbrooke had a significant challenge ahead of him.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said the fact that the meeting occurred, and that members of Helms'
Senate Foreign Relations Committee visited U.N. headquarters on Friday, was
reason for optimism for both the United States and United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If anything does change it will be that ... the members of the committee
are much better apprised of exactly what's going on here,'' Ruggie said. ``So
that when they do make decisions that affect U.S.-U.N. relations, they can do so
on the basis of much better and firsthand information than they've had in the
past.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If that happens, I think that's a good step.''

<HEADLINE> Secret Nuke Documents Made Public  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government's aggressive push five years ago to
declassify historic papers led to about 1,000 documents containing nuclear
weapons secrets to be mistakenly declassified, the Clinton administration told
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   While the nuclear weapons documents were inadvertently opened to
researchers, only one of the files -- on nuclear weapons deployment in foreign
countries in the 1950s -- was actually examined by any outsiders before the
mistakes were discovered, the Department of Energy said in a report.
</P>
<P>
	   The papers were among millions of pages that were declassified between 1995
and 1998 under an executive order from President Clinton directing federal
agencies to lift the veil of secrecy from documents that are more than 25 years
old.
</P>
<P>
	   The openness campaign was widely applauded as an effort to reverse decades
of secrecy about the nuclear weapons programs at the old Atomic Energy
Commission and about a variety of events from the Vietnam War and UFO research
to the failed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The declassification effort is expected to cover about a billion pages
before it is completed in a few years.
</P>
<P>
	   The classified report sent to Congress just before Christmas details the
findings of a DOE audit of some 948,000 pages of nuclear weapons related
documents that had been part of the three-year declassification effort.
</P>
<P>
	   During the review, auditors found that 14,890 pages containing secret
weapons information were mistakenly declassified and made available for public
view at the National Archives, according to an unclassified summary of the
report.
</P>
<P>
	   The material covers ``about 1,000 documents,'' many of which originated in
the old Atomic Energy Commission but had been transferred to other agencies and
declassified there, said a DOE official, who spoke on condition of not being
identified further.
</P>
<P>
	   Although none was declassified by the Energy Department, the mistakes were
found in DOE audits of the declassification process required by a law passed by
Congress in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Included among the 14,890 pages was information on nuclear bomb tests in the
1950s and 1960s ``that provided insight ... in weapons design technology'' as
well as yields on specific weapon and their deployment and storage, according to
the unclassified summary.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter accompanying the report, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson cited
``the gravity of these inadvertent releases'' and said he was increasing the
number of auditors and expanding training programs for those conducting
declassification at the other agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   While the documents contained information that was in some cases 30 to 40
years old, the report said it still could be useful to someone seeking to build
a crude nuclear device.
</P>
<P>
	   Such information, because it is technically less sophisticated, ``can
provide useful design parameters to emerging (nuclear) proliferant nations and
to terrorist groups,'' the department said.
</P>
<P>
	   The documents were erroneously declassified for a variety of reasons, the
DOE official said. In some cases, reviewers were not adequately trained and did
not recognize the material. In other cases, documents dating back decades were
misfiled or incorrectly labeled.
</P>
<P>
	   Steven Aftergood, who directs the Project on Government Secrecy at the
Federation of American Scientists, said that while the government should pursue
``a vigorous and successful declassification program, nobody wants to see
sensitive nuclear weapons information disclosed.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the fact that DOE is conducting audits that discovered the
declassification mistakes ``suggests the DOE is finding a balance which will
allow declassification to proceed without risking unintentional disclosure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Aftergood's organization obtained a copy of the unclassified portions of the
DOE report to Congress and made it available.

<HEADLINE> Study: Minn. Leader in 2-Job Workers  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN MacDONALD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FARGO, N.D. (AP) -- Deanna Kubas took on a second job seven years ago
because she wanted some extra spending money -- her daytime job as a deputy
court clerk paid enough to cover the bills, but left little extra.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Financially, it was always tight,'' said Kubas, 39, a county court clerk
in Fargo for nearly 16 years. ``Having that second job gave me the extra money I
felt I needed.''
</P>
<P>
	   She's not alone. A new study says North Dakota has the second-highest rate
in the country of workers who take on second jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, the latest year for which figures were available, 10.6 percent of
the state's workforce had more than one job.
</P>
<P>
	   The national rate was 6.3 percent, according to the survey released this
week by the North Dakota State Data Center at North Dakota State University.
</P>
<P>
	   The study was based on results of a comprehensive U.S. Department of Labor
survey of workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota led the nation with 10.8 percent of its workforce collecting two
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
	   Victor Higgins is among the Minnesotans pulling double duty.
</P>
<P>
	   The 37-year-old Minneapolis man puts in more than 60 hours a week between
two part-time jobs. He doubts he could make ends meet on one job alone as he
works to pay rent and save for a car.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's kind of hard,'' he said. ``My rent is $250 and I can barely pay
that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Rathge, director of the state data center, said the figures suggest
that even though jobs may be plentiful, they don't pay very well.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The obvious thing that comes to mind when you see this many people holding
multiple jobs is that one job no longer is cutting it for a lot of people,''
Rathge said Thursday. ``Maybe they don't get to work enough hours or the wages
are low. But in the current job they have, they can't maintain the lifestyle
they want and they feel they have to take on another job.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rathge said the problem is worst in the Midwest and in states whose
economies are closely tied to agriculture. Kansas and Nebraska also had rates of
multiple job holders just above 10 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The study found, however, that in nearly every state, the number of workers
with two or more jobs declined slightly from 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Ramsett, an economist at the University of North Dakota, believes the
lower-paying service industry -- the fastest growing area of job development in
the Midwest -- has a lot to do with the high numbers of multiple jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   While work that pays $8 to $10 per hour may pay the bills in an area of the
country where it's relatively cheap to live, most people ``want to do better
than just survive.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They seek out other employment because there's a desired lifestyle they
seek, but can't achieve with one job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kubas, the Fargo court clerk, said she took the second job as a bookkeeper
for a West Fargo business at a time when she was trying to pay off debts and buy
a new car. Recently married and now a new homeowner, she has kept the job to
help pay bills and for entertainment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My husband and I firmly believe in entertainment,'' she said. ``We like to
gamble and go out and take trips. I doubt we could do that if I gave up my
second job.''
</P>
<P>
	   Higgins, who stocks shelves at a discount store and cleans the bakery at a
supermarket across the parking lot, hopes that he might someday be able to give
up one of his jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The main thing I'm looking for, I want to get a car,'' he said. ``So
that's basically why I'm working two jobs. ... Once I get it at least halfway
paid, I'll probably slack off.''

<HEADLINE> Keyes Winning Conservative Iowans  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MASON CITY, Iowa (AP) -- Alan Keyes paces on stage, daring listeners sitting
in the back rows and squatting in the aisles to tune him out, even for a moment.
</P>
<P>
	   They sit rapt as the GOP presidential contender weaves a complex sermon
deploring the tax code, abortion, President Clinton and a general decline in
morals. Occasionally, they shout ``Amen!'' or applaud.
</P>
<P>
	   These are the Iowans who are supporting Keyes in remarkable numbers as the
first-in-the-nation caucus on Monday approaches.
</P>
<P>
	   While George W. Bush and Steve Forbes, the expected Nos. 1 and 2, squabble
over their projected slices of the vote, Keyes has quietly moved into a tie for
third place, drawing up to 10 percent in some state polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Who are these supporters, and why are they gravitating to long-shot Keyes?
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're just folks who realize that the major challenge we face is a moral
challenge,'' Keyes said Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Those who braved single-digit temperatures outside to see the former U.N.
ambassador in rural Mason City were housewives, factory workers, farmers and
students at the community college where Keyes spoke. ``These are not your
regular Republican activists,'' said Drake University professor Hugh
Winebrenner, a caucus historian.
</P>
<P>
	   Many said they supported Keyes for his assertion that morals should underpin
American culture and politics, and that morals and rights flow from God, not
from citizens or the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked after the address whether she was a Keyes supporter, 33-year-old
Shawna Germundson said, ``Now I am.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's about restoring morality and integrity,'' said Germundson, who
teaches her children at home. ``It's what this country needs after Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He seems like a very strong-minded person who's not going to be swayed one
way or another -- he'll stand his ground,'' said Ken Roeder, a 30-year-old
driver. ``It comes from his heart, he's thought things through instead of
looking at polls.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``For those who want a rock 'em, sock 'em, revivalist kind of talk, and
don't want to worry about electability, Keyes gives them that revivalist
message,'' said Dennis Goldford, chairman of the politics and international
relations department at Drake.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes, a former State Department official and radio host, drew 8 percent of
the vote in the 1996 Iowa caucuses and has spent 59 days here since 1997, by
Winebrenner's count. He is running about even with Gary Bauer, who is courting
the same bloc of Christian conservatives, and with John McCain, the Arizona
senator who is not campaigning in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   And while Keyes professes to disdain the dirty business of politics, he can
promote himself, too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Most people who watched the debates reached a conclusion about who was the
most effective in that regard, and their conclusion didn't hurt us any, let's
put it that way,'' Keyes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many political scientists believe a 10 percent showing by Keyes would say
much about Iowa's conservative politics but mean little nationally.
</P>
<P>
	   Said John W. Schmaltz, a political science professor at North Iowa Area
Community College: ``Realistically, I don't think he can do it beyond here.''

<HEADLINE> Timberwolves 95, Clippers 89  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Sam Mitchell scored 20 points, Kevin Garnett added 18
and Bobby Jackson filled in for Terrell Brandon with 17 points as the Minnesota
Timberwolves held off the Los Angeles Clippers 95-89 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the eighth win in nine road games for the Timberwolves, who took
control with a 15-4 run to start the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers, who have dropped seven straight and 11 of their last 12, lost
despite going into the fourth quarter with a six-point lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota's 15-4 run made it 84-79 with 6:01 remaining. Twice the Clippers
got within two in the final 3:44, the last time on a steal and layup by Derek
Anderson. But Maurice Taylor committed his fifth foul on Joe Smith, who hit both
free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   Jackson had steals and layups on consecutive plays to end the game for the
Wolves, who are 8-2 in January with six wins coming by six points or less.
</P>
<P>
	   Brandon missed his third straight game because of a strained right calf that
he injured a week ago against the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Rookie Lamar Odom led the Clippers with 18 points and 14 rebounds, but
missed a 30-footer in the closing seconds. Anderson and Taylor added 14 points
each.
</P>
<P>
	   After trailing most of the first half, the Wolves briefly regained the lead
late in the third quarter on a dunk by Radoslav Nesterovic. But the Clippers
scored six of the final eight points for a 72-69 lead heading into the final 12
minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clippers gained control early in the second quarter, outscoring
Minnesota 15-4 to take a 39-30 lead. Minnesota got within two before Eric
Murdock scored six straight points to keep Los Angeles in front 44-39. Mitchell
had eight of Minnesota's final 10 points to put the Wolves within five at
halftime.

<HEADLINE> Notes, Quotes From Campaign Trail  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) -- For George W. Bush, it may have been one speech
too many.
</P>
<P>
	   After a day of campaigning that began at 8:45 a.m. Friday and didn't end
until after 10 p.m. on the other side of the state, the Republican presidential
front-runner delivered an address that was, well, a bit confusing.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to a crowd of several hundred in the gymnasium at Iowa Western
Community College, the Texas governor got tongue-tied repeatedly while
delivering his standard stump speech.
</P>
<P>
	   Lamenting the absence of his wife, Laura, Bush said: ``If people can judge
me on the company I keep, they would judge me on keeping really good company
with Laura.''
</P>
<P>
	   Later, speaking about how different the world is today from the Cold War era
of his youth, Bush popped out this verbal cartwheel:
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm also running because I want to keep the peace, to keep the peace. When
I was coming up, with was a dangerous world, we knew exactly who the they were.
It was us versus them, and it was clear who the them was,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   As the audience tittered, he added: ``Today, we're not so sure who the they
are, but we know they're there. We know they don't like America, our culture,
our government.''

<HEADLINE> Elian's grandmothers hope to reclaim him  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers spoke pointedly, and at
times tearfully, in asking the nation to let them take their grandson back to
Cuba.
<P>
	   "I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this tragedy that has
been so hard for us as a family and to ask you that our grandson can return as
soon as possible," Mariela Quintana, Elian's paternal grandmother, said in
Spanish on Friday after arriving at Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the grandmothers were expected to travel to Washington, D.C., for an
afternoon meeting with Attorney General Janet Reno and Immigration and
Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner.
</P>
<P>
	   There, they planned to take another step toward reclaiming their 6-year-old
grandson, who remains with relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said that the grandmothers requested the meeting and that the
administration wants to hear what they have to say. Reno has said Elian belongs
with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, representatives for the grandmothers were unsure what time the
pair would head to the Justice Department in Washington. The weary women planned
a dinner and a night of rest following their flight from Havana and their
airport news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody has a right to make him an American citizen," Mrs. Quintana, the
paternal grandmother, said of Elian. "He was born in Cuba. He lived in Cuba. He
is a Cuban."
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, said through an
interpreter she felt a need to take Elian back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you want to help us ... I want that my daughter (Elian's dead mother)
will be in peace, and she will not be in peace until Elian is home," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Quintana also said that Elian, in telephone conversations with her and
with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, had expressed a desire to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The emotional appeal failed to impress Elian's relatives in Miami. Following
the grandmothers' televised news conference, the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, emerged from his house with Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban
American National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   "Elian saw the images of his grandmothers," Mas said. "He crossed in front
of the television set and continued playing in his room without spending more
than 10 seconds looking at the screen."
</P>
<P>
	   Both reiterated their request that the grandmothers visit Elian in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why don't they come to Miami to hug him and be together with him?" Mas
said. "Instead they're in New York, repeating the propaganda of the Castro
regime. We sincerely hope that they will stop this charade, that they will come
here and be with their grandson."
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers are being accompanied by a three-member U.S. church
delegation. Their grandson has been the subject of both a personal battle for
custody between family members and a political tug of war between the Castro
regime and expatriate Cubans.
</P>
<P>
	   In the airport at Havana, the two women kissed and embraced Elian's father
before boarding the plane without him. They left for New York after meeting over
24 hours with representatives of the National Council of Churches, which favors
the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear how long the grandmothers would stay in the
United States, although trip organizers said it would only be a few days and the
grandmothers' visas were good for two months.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was with his mother as she attempted to flee Cuba in a 17-foot power
boat two months ago. The mother and 10 other Cubans died when the boat capsized.
The boy was found floating on an inner tube 2 miles off Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's relatives in Miami argue he would have a better life in the United
States and have raised legal action to keep him. The boy's father wants him
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Backers of the trip reportedly opted for New York to avoid an emotional
scene in Miami, where anti-Castro protesters have demonstrated in favor of
keeping the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ordered Elian returned. But attorneys for the family in Florida
accused the INS of violating Elian's due process rights and asked a judge to
prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   A statement issued Friday by Bill Bradley's campaign from one of his
cardiologists, Robert H. Heissenbuttel:
</P>
<P>
	   ``Over the past month, Mr. Bradley has had reoccurrence of episodes of
atrial fibrillation which have occurred without known trigger and spontaneously
converted to regular rhythm within hours. These episodes have not in any way
interfered with his busy schedule.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The natural history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation includes sporadic
increase in frequency of episodes, which does not indicate any change in heart
status. Of importance, he only notes irregularity of the pulse and has no other
symptoms. And the rhythm spontaneously reverts to regular. He has been advised
to continue all normal activity without limitations.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Closes in on $30 a Barrel  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Oil prices this week climbed to almost $30 a barrel for the first time since
the Persian Gulf War, raising worries that consumer prices could follow and in
turn drive up interest rates.
</P>
<P>
	   But aside from the costlier heating oil, gasoline and transportation rates,
and the fuel surcharges on airplane tickets, inflation remains tame. And the
U.S. economy has barely blinked at oil's impact.
</P>
<P>
	   The reason: Oil simply doesn't lubricate the new, tech-savvy U.S. economy
the way it once did.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, economists say there will be bigger trouble ahead if oil's rise isn't
stopped soon.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it went to $40 a barrel, it would be disruptive," said Bruce Steinberg,
chief economist for Merrill Lynch. "You can't keep going up endlessly without
having an effect."
</P>
<P>
	   Prices for crude have jumped nearly $5 a barrel in the past week. On Friday,
the near-term March contract was trading at around $29 a barrel on the New York
Mercantile Exchange. Heating oil, spurred not only by oil's surge but a
Northeastern cold snap, has risen 50 percent since the beginning of last week.
</P>
<P>
	   "It doesn't deter me," motorist Chip Tuttle said at a Boston gas station
Friday as he paid $43 to fill his sport-utility vehicle. "The economy is good."
</P>
<P>
	   William Cheney, chief economist for John Hancock Financial Services, said,
"Oil's overall impact on the economy is vastly reduced" from years past.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's due to the increased energy efficiency of companies that use oil
heavily and the increased importance of industries that are not heavily
dependent on it," Cheney said.
</P>
<P>
	   The era of cheap oil began to close last March when the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries -- disturbed by a world glut that drove crude down
to $11.37 a barrel in February -- cut production by 4.3 million barrels a day to
thin supplies and push up the price.
</P>
<P>
	   OPEC's strategy worked. Prices more than doubled, reaching a nine-year high
in November that was set again this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Two decades ago, a similarly huge spike in oil prices created long lines for
gas and sent the U.S. economy into shock. But in 1999, while fuel oil and
gasoline prices climbed sharply, the "core" rate of inflation -- excluding the
volatile energy and food sectors -- rose at its smallest rate in 34 years, just
1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   What happened to inflation?
</P>
<P>
	   Some economists are still warning of dire consequences, especially if oil's
rise continues unabated. Phil Verleger, economist for the Brattle Group, a
consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., sees oil headed to $40 by year's end,
prompting several interest rate increases and a recession by year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   But America has built up a much better resistance to energy shock. The
trouble in the 1970s helped spawn a new energy consciousness and the giant steps
taken by technology steered the economy away from manufacturing and toward
services and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil expenditures, which accounted for 8.5 percent of gross domestic product
in 1981, have fallen to about 3 percent, according to the U.S. Energy
Information Administration.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oil is still probably the single most important price that affects the
well-being of Americans," said Cheney. "When the price goes up ... America is in
a sense a little poorer. But we are much better at adapting to it now."
</P>
<P>
	   Adjusting or not, consumers are being increasingly squeezed by oil's rise.
Among the latest consequences of the increase in prices:
</P>
<P>
	   --The nation's top airlines said this week they are adding a $20 surcharge
to round-trip tickets because of jet fuel costs.
</P>
<P>
	   --Trucking companies are raising rates by up to 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   --Business owners are beginning to pass on to consumers the new, higher
prices charged by shippers.
</P>
<P>
	   --U.S. gasoline prices are rising again.

<HEADLINE> Gore, Bradley Ease Up on Criticism  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLINTON, Iowa (AP) -- Bill Bradley sought a final-weekend focus on tuning
his political organization, but struggled to move the focus of his presidential
campaign beyond discussions of his irregular heartbeat.
</P>
<P>
	   While Bradley sought to discount the condition as merely ``a nuisance,'' he
was dogged throughout the day by shouted questions from reporters and even
polite inquiries from backers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is not a factor in the campaign or in conduct in office,'' said an
exasperated Bradley. ``If I'm sick at my stomach, do I have to tell you I'm sick
at my stomach?''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's rival for the Democratic nomination, Vice President Al Gore, eased
up, though he had previously set aside Friday to tout his health care plan and
was questioned as he toured a hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's out there campaigning, that's the good news,'' said Gore. ``It's a
routine matter.''
</P>
<P>
	   Already trailing in polls in Iowa, and with Gore looking better in New
Hampshire, Bradley found the health issue and his handling of the disclosures
consuming his campaign as it headed into the final weekend before Iowa's leadoff
nominating caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   The subject took center stage when Bradley confirmed he'd had four episodes
of irregular heartbeats since disclosing last month he suffered from that
condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Reporters demanded to know why Bradley hadn't disclosed the episodes when
they happened, and even backers conceded they had worries. At a rally in
Muscatine, Bonnie Weeks told Bradley she'd seen a deluge of reports on
television and asked him to set the record straight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was wondering about his health,'' she said. ``Is he going to be fit if
we elect him?''
</P>
<P>
	   Looking stern, Bradley said there was nothing to fear, which satisfied Ms.
Weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a common condition,'' said Bradley. ``It's a nuisance for me and it
shouldn't be a concern for you.''
</P>
<P>
	   By contrast, Gore spoke to his largest crowd yet Friday night, drawing 1,000
students to Iowa State University to warn against overconfidence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We can't take anything for granted'' in the hours remaining before the
caucuses, Gore said. ``We need to make the best use of every single one of those
minutes and hours to get a big turnout.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley aides had planned a midday briefing, but the candidate appeared
instead in an effort to quell the health issue. Instead, the noisy press
conference found the former New Jersey senator and pro basketball player on the
defensive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No, I'm not worried about it,'' said Bradley. ``This is a common
condition, millions of Americans have it.'' At rallies in vote-rich eastern
Iowa, he urged backers to focus instead on getting their people to the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you make a few more calls and get 10 more people out to your caucus, we
can do better than most people expect,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are three days left and we have a lot of work to do,'' he said. ``We
have some unfinished business.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley sought to quell the uproar over his health late in the day,
releasing a statement from his cardiologist.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These episodes have not, in any way, interfered with his busy schedule,''
said Dr. Robert H. Heissenbuttel. ``He has been advised to continue all normal
activities without limitations.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's really nothing to deal with,'' said spokesman Eric Hauser. ``You
can't control what the heart does, so the timing is irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
	   There's some mystery about what triggers the episodes, and Bradley offered a
layman's theory that a change in soft drinks may have increased his caffeine
intake. That has led him to drop the cream soda he has been drinking since
December. But he said he has no plans to see a doctor for a checkup.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If he has a problem and it's something that won't go away, I think maybe
in the long run he ought to say, 'I've got other things to do. I don't need the
stress of being president,''' Joyce Brown, a 59-year-old Democrat, said between
sips of coffee at a Colfax diner.
</P>
<P>
	   While many argued the furor will have little lasting impact, Bradley aides
were nervous because it was consuming the final days of the caucus campaign.
Aides once worried about dealing with an Iowa loss feared the margin could grow.
</P>
<P>
	   While Gore leads in Iowa, Bradley is much more competitive in New Hampshire,
and Bradley's camp worries about Gore getting momentum with a big Iowa victory.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Seeks More Research Funds  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday he wants to add
nearly $3 billion to federal science and technology research, a broad effort
that he said has already fostered amazing changes in American life and national
wealth.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed increase in next year's budget would add nearly $1 billion to
information technology-related computer research.
</P>
<P>
	   Although he struggles with computer technology himself, Clinton speaks with
enthusiasm about the wonders technology has wrought.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is changing everything about the way we work and live and relate to
each other,'' Clinton said of the Internet, saying the computer network is a
major reason for the nation's continued economic growth, which is on pace to
break all previous records next month.
</P>
<P>
	   His own administration also should get credit for managing a changing
economy well, Clinton told students and faculty at the California Institute of
Technology. But he acknowledged that to a degree, what the government did best
was stay out of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The real reason this thing keeps going on and on and on is all we did in
the government was to set the conditions and provide the tools for the American
people to succeed,'' Clinton said in his address.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The real reason is the exponential growth in information technology and
how it is rifling through every other sector of our economy,'' creating jobs no
one had heard of a few years ago and reinforcing other scientific advances, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president also cautioned of the dark side of scientific and
technological advances.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The same genetic revolution that can offer new hope for millions of
Americans could also be used to deny people health insurance, clone a human
being,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Scientists and public servants must make sure that science serves humanity
and not the other way around, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Just because we can do something doesn't mean we should,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton came to Southern California, a major recipient of federal research
dollars, to detail his plan to add $2.8 billion to the federal budget for
science and technology research -- benefiting studies of cancer, diabetes and
AIDS as well as computer technology, among others. California, with about 12
percent of the nation's population, draws 20 percent of federal research
dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   The president later played golf with actor Jack Nicholson and then made two
rounds of Democratic fund raising among Hollywood supporters. Clinton was
staying at the home of film producer David Geffen.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, administration officials said Clinton, pursuing his goal of
connecting all Americans to the Internet, will propose federal subsidies to
narrow the ``digital divide'' and help millions of low-income families go
online. He has said Internet access and usage should be as commonplace as the
telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   A draft proposal calls for spending as much as $100 million to provide
computers and Internet access in perhaps as many as 9 million households.
Clinton has not yet determined the exact size of the proposal, said
administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The president is expected to announce the proposal in his State of the Union
address Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   That speech is also likely to mention some details of the package he
announced Friday, including:
</P>
<P>
	   --The National Institutes of Health would get an extra $1 billion on top of
an existing budget of nearly $18 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   --The 56-year-old National Science Foundation would get a 17 percent
increase -- its largest budget boost ever. The $675 million would augment an
existing budget of $3.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by Congress, the new money would increase total U.S. spending on
basic scientific and technological research to about $43 billion in 2001, the
White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   University research spending is popular in Congress, in part because it
spreads dollars outside Washington. But Republicans are already warning that
ambitious new spending packages face rough sledding this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP-controlled House Budget Committee estimated that before the latest
science and technology proposals, the White House had called attention to about
50 new initiatives costing nearly $29 billion that it plans to include in the
upcoming budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton university research plan reflects an emphasis on biomedical and
so-called lifestyle research as opposed to more traditional basic research into
mathematics and physical sciences.
</P>
<P>
	   ``University-based research provides the kind of fundamental insights that
are most important in any new technology or treatment,'' Clinton said. ``It
helps to produce the next generation of scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs,
and we intend to give university-based research a major lift.''

<HEADLINE> Canada Doctor Violates Public Trust  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM COHEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MELFORT, Saskatchewan (AP) -- When it finally came time to face his
sentencing, the last step in a 16-month ordeal of shame and sorrow, Raymond
Pannell stood as straight and unwavering as when he used to read the Bible in
the All Saints Anglican Church.
</P>
<P>
	   He showed no outward reaction Friday as Judge Barrett Halderman declared
Pannell, 70, would go to prison for one year for sexually abusing five youths he
treated in the 1970s and 1980s in his former life as a doctor in this small
prairie town.
</P>
<P>
	   Sobs filled the courtroom as Pannell's wife and five adult children huddled
around the tall, thin figure whose face looked gaunt and worn from the strain.
He said nothing a few minutes later when a Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer
led him past reporters waving microphones to a waiting patrol car.
</P>
<P>
	   For Pannell, the prison term completed the fall from community pillar to
disgraced outcast. He already had lost his medical license, his reputation, his
position as lay reader in church and the good will built up by a lifetime of
service.
</P>
<P>
	   His neighbors who went to him for treatment for their families called the
case a shock and a tragedy, but made clear they had little sympathy for Pannell.
The nature of the crimes by a doctor who exploited the faith of the community
angered them.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even if you've known him for years and you like him, you just can't
forgive him for what he's done,'' Mayor Dub Henderson said.
</P>
<P>
	   That's how it is in Melfort, where the rail line that gave it birth still
runs between the grain elevator and the town center, and cars yield to
snowmobiles at some intersections.
</P>
<P>
	   Life is as simple and harsh as the flat, frigid winter landscape, requiring
neighbors to depend on each other and the trust they place in society's eminent
figures -- elected officials, police, teachers and doctors.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid a series of cases in Canada involving prosecutions or lawsuits for
sexual abuse committed at reformatories, foster homes and church schools as far
back as the 1950s, the Pannell case stands out because of his special status in
the community of about 5,000.
</P>
<P>
	   By all accounts, Pannell was a model citizen when he opened his practice in
1954. He treated farm families throughout the region, delivering babies, helping
out even when patients had trouble paying for his services.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a doctor, I think he was really lionized by the community, deservedly
so,'' said Dr. Howard Green, an associate of Pannell's for more than 30 years.
Pannell's solid reputation earned him recognition as Canadian family doctor of
the year in 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   Three years later, Pannell suddenly quit practicing medicine, leaving the
community bewildered.
</P>
<P>
	   The reason was a complaint made to the Saskatchewan College of Physicians
and Surgeons that Pannell sexually abused a young male patient. Facing an
investigation, Pannell agreed to have his medical license revoked. The
investigation was dropped and police were never informed of the complaint.
</P>
<P>
	   But the townsfolk started talking.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As soon as he quit, there were rumors going around,'' said Henderson, the
mayor. ``We knew there had to be some reason why he quit. It was so sudden.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pannell worked selling nuts and as a local handyman. He sang in the church
choir and led church services as a lay reader. Then came criminal complaints
last August and a Royal Canadian Mounted Police investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Faced with four charges of sexual abuse, Pannell pleaded guilty to spare the
victims the pain of having to testify at a trial. When two others came forward
with more charges in December, Pannell again pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the charges involve fondling the genitals or other improper
touching. But one of the victims was an 11-year-old boy who was abused by
Pannell for more than seven years.
</P>
<P>
	   According to information from court hearings, Pannell would schedule the
youth as his final appointment of the day, when no one else was in the office,
and would sometimes take the youth to his home if no one was there.
</P>
<P>
	   The abuse included performing oral sex on the youth and attempting to force
the youth to sodomize him, according to the sentencing decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Stuart Eisner, Pannell's defense attorney, said the doctor had a drinking
problem at the time and was unable to control his sexual urges. He sought a
conditional two-year sentence that would allow Pannell to remain at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Earl Henikath argued for a two-year prison term to send the right
message to the community. In imposing a one-year prison sentence, Judge
Halderman cited the seriousness of the crimes and the mistrust they created.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It permeates the community, and translates into a feeling that no one, no
matter how eminent, can be trusted completely,'' the judge said.
</P>
<P>
	   At the Hi-Lo Motor Inn just past the Dairy Queen, owner Peter Balonyk
remembered how Pannell ``used to be up there reading the Bible'' in church.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And then something like this comes out,'' Balonyk said. ``Oh yeah, you
feel betrayed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Green, the former associate, said the Pannell case forced people to accept
distasteful realities -- such as their doctor could be a sexual predator.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also questioned why some in the community reacted too harshly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Certainly you might say predator (about Pannell), but I think there's a
lot of gay-bashing. It might be ignorance,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Its a tragedy,'' he said. ``There's a lot of pressure in the life of a
doctor. You hear of doctors drinking too much, smoking too much. They're human,
just like anyone else.''

<HEADLINE> Warriors 115, Cavaliers 103  </HEADLINE>
    By DENNIS GEORGATOS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Antawn Jamison scored a career-high 37 points and
had a season-high 18 rebounds as the Golden State Warriors beat the Cleveland
Cavaliers 115-103 Friday night for their second straight win after losing 12 in
a row.
</P>
<P>
	   Donyell Marshall added 25 points and 11 rebounds and Mookie Blaylock had 22
points and 11 assists for Golden State, which beat Cleveland for just the second
time in the past 16 meetings.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cavaliers lost their fourth straight despite a career-high 38 points
from Lamond Murray. Shawn Kemp, outplayed by Jamison, scored 18 points and had
14 rebounds before fouling out with 4:28 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamison established a career scoring high for the second time in as many
outings. He had 32 points in Golden State's win over Orlando on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   After trailing by three at the break, the Warriors outscored the Cavaliers
35-22 in the third quarter to take a 91-81 lead into the final period.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden State used a 7-0 burst capped by a three-point play by Jamison to go
in front 70-65. Cleveland pulled within two on a basket by Cedric Henderson
before Blaylock, who had 14 points in the period, drained a 3-pointer to start a
9-2 burst that carried the Warriors to a 78-70 lead, their biggest to that
point.
</P>
<P>
	   Blaylock's hot shooting continued in the fourth quarter, when he opened the
period by hitting successive 3-pointers to offset equivalent production from
Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
	   Marshall followed by muscling in a putback, and after Miller hit a 12-foot
fallaway jumper, Sam Mack added a 19-foot jumper and a 3-pointer to give the
Warriors a 104-88 lead with 6:27 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleveland could get no closer than eight the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite 23 points from Jamison in the first half, Golden State trailed
59-56.
</P>
<P>
	   A tip-in by Jamison put the Warriors up 54-52 with 1:51 left in the second
quarter but the Cavs then scored seven of the next nine points, starting with a
go-ahead 3-pointer by Murray, who scored 19 of his points in the game's first 24
minutes.

<HEADLINE> FDA Concerns Spark Supplement Recall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A product called Zen that a Florida company sold as a
dietary supplement, but which the government says contains a dangerous and
illegal drug called BD is being taken off store shelves.
</P>
<P>
	   BD is chemically related to the illegal ``party drugs'' and sleep aids GHB
and GBL.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration considers the drugs significant health
hazards, because they have been associated with at least three deaths and 119
other serious side effects, including comas, breathing difficulty, vomiting and
seizures. They are particularly dangerous when used with alcohol.
</P>
<P>
	   Science Enhancement Systems of Delray Beach, Fla., said Friday it had agreed
to recall 5,400 bottles of Zen distributed in 24 states since last April.
</P>
<P>
	   BD, also sold as an industrial solvent, became notorious three years ago
when more than 100 New Year's partygoers in Los Angeles became sick after
consuming drinks containing the chemical.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA last year began hunting for companies that sell the chemicals under
the guise of dietary supplements in a renewed attempt to get them off the
market.
</P>
<P>
	   Zen is a liquid sold in 35-ounce bottles that list the ingredient Sucol B,
which is really BD, the company said. Consumers were advised to return it to the
place of purchase for a refund. Those with questions may call the company at
561-707-1001.

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton tries to outdo Giuliani on abortion rights  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
support abortion rights, but Mrs. Clinton is suggesting she'd yell louder and
fight harder on the issue if elected to the Senate.
<P>
	   "I would want New Yorkers to know that I wouldn't only vote right, but I
would be a strong voice, and I would attempt to organize as much as I could to
make sure that I defended a woman's right to choose," Mrs. Clinton told
reporters after speaking Friday at a National Abortion &AMP; Reproductive Rights
Action League luncheon commemorating the anniversary of the Supreme Court
decision legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton did not mention the name of the mayor, her likely Senate race
opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani, who has spoken in the past at the annual NARAL event, was invited
this year but did not attend, NARAL director Kelli Conlin said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The mayor's position on choice is well known, and it has not changed," said
Kim Serafin, a spokeswoman for Giuliani's likely Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton may have trouble winning votes on the issue, since she and
Giuliani are both strong supporters of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   During 1998's Senate race, abortion rights advocates were galvanized by the
murder shortly before the election of Dr. Bernard Slepian, a Buffalo doctor who
performed abortions. Charles Schumer, a Democratic supporter of abortion rights,
defeated anti-abortion Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in an extremely close
election, largely on the strength of his 3-to-2 ratio advantage among female
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, with two candidates who support abortion rights, the issue may be
less prominent. Although Mrs. Clinton was received warmly by NARAL leaders at
the Harvard Club lunch, the group did not endorse her.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a celebration of Roe vs. Wade, that's what this is all about,"
Conlin said when asked if NARAL were supporting Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Today is the 27th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing
abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Conlin said it was too early to say whether NARAL would make an endorsement
in the Senate race. If the group is satisfied with both candidates' support for
abortion rights, it may remain neutral, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has been under pressure from Conservative Party Chairman Michael
Long to support a ban on late-term abortions but so far has refused to drop his
opposition to such a ban. No Republican has won a statewide race in New York in
25 years without Conservative Party backing.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to give a lot of credit to the mayor, because he's stood up to
Michael Long and he's really defended the principles," Conlin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton said that with the U.S. Supreme Court preparing to hear
arguments on the late-term procedure opponents call "partial-birth abortion,"
the Senate's role in safeguarding abortion rights will be increasingly
important.
</P>
<P>
	   "For women, the Senate will be our court of last resort," she said. "It will
not be enough for any senator simply to cast the right vote and sit down.
Because this is going to be a struggle that will be particularly difficult if we
do not, for reasons that I hope will not come to pass, hold the White House."

<HEADLINE> Bush Confident on Iowa, N.H.  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SIOUX CITY, Iowa (AP) -- With polls showing him leading among likely voters,
George W. Bush pushed on toward Monday's Iowa caucuses amid last-minute
criticism of his abortion stance from his rivals for the Republican presidential
nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor expressed confidence about his chances in the first
voting of the 2000 presidential race during informal conversations with
reporters while flying aboard their press charter Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush reiterated he is optimistic he can beat Arizona Sen. John McCain in the
New Hampshire primary eight days after the Iowa balloting, perhaps sealing the
GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, Bush said his greatest challenge was turning out the vote.
The Iowa caucuses begin at 7 p.m. in dark, wintry conditions that usually test
all but party loyalists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm a little concerned,'' he said during a speech at Iowa Western
Community College in Council Bluffs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm concerned that some of your friends and neighbors are looking at the
polls and saying, `Well, George W. is ahead, he doesn't need my help.' That's
not the way it works. The only poll that matters is the one that happens when
folks show up on caucus night.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also faced questions about his abortion stance for the second
consecutive day.
</P>
<P>
	   He said ``it should be up to each state legislature'' to decide what limits
to place on abortions, adding that the Supreme Court erred by ruling on the
issue 27 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bush, who opposes abortion, did not directly call for the outright
repeal of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortions. His comments
drew a taunting reply from publisher Steve Forbes, his closest rival in Iowa
polls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Come on, even if people disagree with you, they'll respect you for having
a firm stand and believing in principle,'' Forbes said. ``But he ducked it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The volatile issue has flared in recent days, as anti-abortion forces gird
for their annual march in Washington on the anniversary of the court's ruling
and the Iowa caucuses near.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, who is campaigning as a ``compassionate conservative,'' opposes
abortion except in cases of rape, incest and where the life of the mother is at
stake. But he doesn't emphasize the issue. Forbes does, and hopes to parlay his
anti-abortion stand into a second-place finish in the caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor was asked to clarify his statement Thursday that the 1973
decision legalizing abortion ``was a stretch.'' He replied: ``I felt like it was
a case where the court took the place of what the legislatures should do in
America.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked further what he thought the legislatures should do, Bush said, ``It
should be up to each legislature.''
</P>
<P>
	   His answer remained basically the same each time Bush was asked if he
thought Roe vs. Wade should be overturned. ``This is a case where the court
stepped across its bounds and usurped the right of the legislatures,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides said later that Bush believes states should have the right to impose
strict anti-abortion laws, as they could before Roe vs. Wade. The ruling
overturned just such a law in Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's ultimate goal is a constitutional amendment banning abortion --
except in cases of rape, incest or danger to the mother's life -- which state
legislatures as well as Congress would have to approve. But Bush has said the
country is not ready to pass such a sweeping measure.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion is a critical issue in the caucuses in Iowa, where social
conservatives will make up a large bloc of the voters Monday night. One in 10
Republican likely to attend the caucuses say a candidate's ``pro-life'' views
are most important.
</P>
<P>
	   Seeking a politically safe way to couch his views, Bush has settled on
criticizing the Supreme Court ruling without directly saying that Roe vs. Wade
should be overturned.
</P>
<P>
	   His challenge is to appease conservatives in the primary campaign without
alienating swing voters before the general election in November.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush got some unexpected support from McCain. The senator said he opposes
abortion but, like Bush, would accept it in cases of rape, incest or where the
mother's life is in danger.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that Roe v. Wade was a flawed decision, yes, and overreached and
that's why I think it should be repealed,'' McCain said in Greenville, S.C.

<HEADLINE> Sprawl Squeezes Colo. Ranchers  </HEADLINE>
   By JUDITH KOHLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- The cow-town image Denver tries to shake most of the time
gets trotted out and gussied up once a year when the National Western Stock Show
and Rodeo comes to town.
</P>
<P>
	   But after the event ends on Sunday and the cappuccino-sipping cowboys stow
their hats and boots, Tom Compton will return to his ranch in southwestern
Colorado -- a place where he struggles to survive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a great lifestyle,'' he said. ``It's very rewarding in many aspects,
but financially it's not.''
</P>
<P>
	   Faced with encroaching development and rising taxes, ranchers increasingly
are quitting to capitalize on soaring property values as part of the growing
cows-to-condos movement.
</P>
<P>
	   The transformation has joined low cattle prices, high grain prices and
foreign competition as major problems for ranchers.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 1987 and 1997 in Colorado, 1.3 million agricultural acres were
converted to other uses -- an average of 130,000 acres a year, according to
Agriculture Department data.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It can be visualized as a strip of land a mile and a half wide and 130
miles long,'' said Dave Carlson, a resource analyst with the state's own
Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
	   And from 1992 to 1997, the pace picked up in the state, boosting land
conversion to an average of 270,000 acres per year.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal figures do not show what happened to the land, so ``it's not
accurate to infer that all of that change is due to urbanization and second-home
development,'' Carlson said.
</P>
<P>
	   But whatever the transformation, he said, ranchers are feeling squeezed.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Durango area where Carlson lives, as well as near ski resorts,
selling out to developers appeals to many ranchers who are weary of predator
problems, roller-coaster cattle prices and complaints from new neighbors
unfamiliar with country ways.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When you can get $8,000 to $10,000 an acre for a hay meadow, the cattle
prices just can't compete,'' said Kent Lebsack, executive vice president of the
Colorado Cattlemen's Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado's population growth, one of the nation's fastest, causes much of
the pressure, he said. So does demand for more remote cabins and homes as
development pushes farther into the mountains.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of ranchers in Colorado has dropped from more than 20,000 in the
1960s to roughly 10,000 today, Lebsack said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some of it is consolidation,'' he said. ``But we are losing agricultural
acres, we're losing ranches and that land is being converted. The trend
obviously can't continue forever because there won't be any ag land base left.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1995, the association has used a nonprofit, private land trust to help
ranchers stem the losses, working with those who want to preserve their land but
also want a tax break or a chance to benefit from the hot real estate market.
</P>
<P>
	   In the trust, ranchers place a conservation easement on their land,
forfeiting the right to develop or subdivide the property. In return, the
Internal Revenue Service taxes the land based on its lower, agricultural worth
-- rather than its value if developed. The move helps ease inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   The trust holds the land easement, but not the title. Ranchers can get a tax
benefit for giving up development rights, or can opt for money.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The biggest challenge we're coming up with is not people willing to do it,
it's the dollars to make it worth their while,'' said Lynne Sherrod, the trust's
executive director.
</P>
<P>
	   The approach is catching on, with a similar trust forming in California and
frequent queries coming to Sherrod from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   Saving agricultural land means not only maintains habitat for wildlife, open
spaces and scenery, but also preserves an important industry, Sherrod said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Less than 2 percent of us in this nation is feeding the other 98 percent
and exporting food to the world,'' she said. ``When we lose these people, we
lose people out of the communities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Even if we're able to protect and conserve every single acre, what good
will it do if there's nobody left who knows how to raise food?''

<HEADLINE> NFL Rules Against Jets' Belichick  </HEADLINE>
    By BARRY WILNER AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   It looks like Bill Parcells will not succeed himself as coach of the New
York Jets. And it's certain Bill Belichick won't be around when the Jets
announce who their new coach is on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   An NFL source told The Associated Press on Friday night that Parcells
reiterated to Woody Johnson, the Jets' new owner, that he doesn't want to coach
anymore. He also recommended linebackers coach Al Groh to take over the post
that Belichick resigned from on Jan. 4, one day after Parcells stepped down.
</P>
<P>
	   "He simply doesn't want to coach anymore," the source said of Parcells.
"He's sticking by what he decided."
</P>
<P>
	   He's also expected to stick around as the team's chief of football
operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue didn't completely rule in
favor of the Jets, but he did uphold their rights to Belichick through the 2000
season. Tagliabue ruled Belichick breached his contract, which has three years
remaining, when he resigned as coach of the Jets on Jan. 4 and cannot work for
another team this year without the Jets' approval.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Patriots reportedly have been working behind the scenes to free
Belichick from the Jets, Tagliabue's ruling made it clear he expects both teams
to come up with an agreement this month.
</P>
<P>
	   "Taken as a whole, the contract and the related memoranda constitute an
agreement that Mr. Belichick would be the Jets' head coach except when Mr.
(Bill) Parcells served in that capacity," Tagilabue ruled in a grievance filed
by Belichick. "The agreement contemplated that Mr. Belichick would automatically
succeed to the head coaching position if Mr. Parcells was no longer head coach."
</P>
<P>
	   Neil Cornrich, Belichick's lawyer, threatened legal action against the
league.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think the commissioner's decision is unlawful and we are actively
assessing all of our legal options," Cornrich said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The commissioner's ruling and order are clear and self-explanatory,"
Parcells said. "The Jets will have no further comment at this time."
</P>
<P>
	   Belichick is sought by the Patriots for their vacant coaching position and a
personnel role. Now that the grievance has been dismissed, the Patriots will
need to negotiate with the Jets, bringing almost full circle the teams'
off-field relationship regarding coaches.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, the Jets sent four draft picks to New England to get Parcells
released from his contract with the Patriots. Questions of possible tampering by
the Jets raised those stakes.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, the Jets figure to get some draft choices back for Belichick, who came
to New York with Parcells and was defensive coordinator -- and coach-in-waiting
-- until earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Don't expect the Jets to get four picks for Belichick, however. He doesn't
have the proven track record of Parcells. While Parcells has led three teams to
the Super Bowl, Belichick had one winning season in five at Cleveland. Something
along the lines of a pair of second-rounders is more likely.
</P>
<P>
	   Tagliabue rejected claims by Belichick that he never actually assumed the
head coaching job. The commissioner cited "more than 10" discussions between
Belichick and Parcells about the prospect of Belichick becoming coach after the
1999 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Tagliabue denied the Jets' claim that Belichick should be barred from
leaving for another team for the remaining three years on his contract. This
ruling applied to 2000 only.
</P>
<P>
	   Tagliabue cited the uncertainty in the Jets' coaching situation, and told
both sides to address three points by Feb. 1:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Whether the Jets' contract rights to Belichick should extend through
2002, or should be limited to the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Whether the contract rights should remain in place if Parcells returns as
coach.
</P>
<P>
	   -- What procedures should be followed to determine whether the Jets are
entitled to damages for Belichick's breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Patriots spokesman Stacey James said, "This information doesn't change
anything with us. It's still between Belichick and the Jets."

since Nov. 3, when the Ducks tied Philadelphia 3-3 in Anaheim. They are 33-4-9
when Kariya and Selanne have scored in the same game, and 21-0-3 at home.
</P>
<P>
	   Drury, the only player ever to win the Hobey Baker Award as college hockey's
top player and NHL rookie of the year honors in back-to-back seasons, put the
Avalanche ahead to stay at 18:41 of the second with his 13th goal and second
game-winner.
</P>
<P>
	   Sandis Ozolinsh sent Drury on a 2-on-1 break gainst Anaheim defenseman Jason
Marshall, and the second-year center completed a perfect give-and-go with rookie
Alex Tanguay for his team-leading 40th point.
</P>
<P>
	   Kariya's goal put Anaheim ahead 2-1 at 4:43 of the second period after Dave
Reid was sent off for interfering with goalie Guy Hebert. The Ducks captain beat
Roy high to the stick side with a slap shot from the left point. It ended a
streak of 24 consecutive penalty-kills by the Avalanche and gave the Ducks only
their third power-play goal in 58 opportunities during a 13-game span.
</P>
<P>
	   Sakic and Forsberg, who have combined for 40 points over the last 11 games,
collaborated on the tying goal 3 1/2 minutes later. Forsberg got the puck in the
neutral zone from Deadmarsh, skated down the right wing and fed it into the
slot, where Sakic beat Hebert high to the stick side from 15 feet for his 26th
point in 28 games.
</P>
<P>
	   Playing in front of only their third sellout crowd in 26 home games this
season -- partly because the Stanley Cup was on display in the arena concourse
-- the Ducks opened the scoring less than 12 minutes into the game. Tverdovsky
got the puck in the right circle from Marty McInnins, skated right past Forsberg
and beat Roy from the edge of the crease.
</P>
<P>
	   Tverdovsky's fifth goal ended a scoreless streak of 173 minutes, 36 seconds
by Colorado goalies, including Marc Denis' 2-0 victory over Phoenix and Roy's
scoreless duel with San Jose rookie Evgeni Nabokov on Wednesday night.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Refugees Claim Abandonment  </HEADLINE>
   By NICK WADHAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KARABULAK, Russia (AP) -- Of the scores of refugee camps that dot the
landscape in the southern region of Ingushetia, on the border with Chechnya,
Milk Farm No. 1 is probably one of the worst.
</P>
<P>
	   Visitors approaching the camp are greeted by crowds of children with
dirt-streaked faces. Wild dogs pick through the trash strewn through fetid pools
of half-frozen water. Even though the cows moved out long ago, the smell of
manure hangs thickly in the seven cow barns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It really does stink here. But there's simply no place else for us to
go,'' says 45-year-old Ruslan Khasuyev, who fled his home in the southwestern
Chechen city of Urus-Martan in November, two months after Russian troops invaded
Chechnya to wipe out terrorists.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1,600 refugees here have endured these conditions for months since then.
And like many of the estimated 250,000 who have fled the conflict, most crossing
the eastern border to Ingushetia, they complain they have been all but abandoned
by the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government says we're Russian citizens, but what sort of citizens are
we when they don't pay any attention to us at all?,'' asked Vakha Abdulkadira,
another refugee from Urus-Martan.
</P>
<P>
	   Families have constructed tiny rooms for themselves along barn walls, using
concrete bricks either bought or stolen. Small, makeshift beds usually sleep two
or more.
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of most rooms is a tiny brick oven, which is heated by gas
from a pipe running out the door. The gas is tapped illegally from a main
running across an adjoining field, while power to feed a single bare ceiling
bulb is siphoned from a nearby wire.
</P>
<P>
	   While some refugee camps have provided a steady diet of various foods to
their inhabitants, the refugees at Milk Farm No. 1 each get just a half-loaf of
bread a day. Canned meat comes once every few weeks, and sugar and flour once a
month. Vegetables are unheard of.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite their living conditions, few refugees here are considering returning
home. They are skeptical of Russian assurances that some hometowns are safe, and
are more willing to bear the filth of the farm than risk a trip back to
Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Russian military says our villages are under its control, but what
they do and what they say are totally different,'' said 40-year-old Nura
Adayeva.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If someone takes one gunshot in those villages, they'll start bombing all
over again.''

Three-Person Junta Seizes Power in Ecuador
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's military chief announced late Friday a
three-person junta to replace the unpopular president, who fled after a
rebellion led by Indians and backed by the armed forces. President Jamil Mahuad
insisted he would not resign -- but he abandoned the palace where he worked and
lived in the afternoon after refusing a request from the military high command
to step down. Ecuador's economic woes appear to have led to the unusual Indian
uprising. Last year, inflation reached 60 percent, the highest in Latin America,
and only one in three in the labor force has full-time work.

	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday he wants to add
nearly $3 billion to federal science and technology research, a broad effort
that he said has already fostered amazing changes in American life and national
wealth. The proposed increase in next year's budget would add nearly $1 billion
to information technology-related computer research. Although he struggles with
computer technology himself, Clinton speaks with enthusiasm about the wonders
technology has wrought. "It is changing everything about the way we work and
live and relate to each other," Clinton said of the Internet, saying the
computer network is a major reason for the nation's continued economic growth.

U.S. Citizenship Sought for Elian
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Florida Republicans intend to introduce legislation
Monday to grant U.S. citizenship to 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott said Friday. The bill, sponsored by Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.,
could be brought up for a vote by midweek, Lott, R-Miss., said. "It will be a
custody issue, not an immigration issue, and that's the only intent," Lott said
during an interview on "John McLaughlin's One on One," to be aired Sunday on
PBS. Gonzalez has been at the center of an international custody dispute since
November, when his mother died and he was found on Thanksgiving Day floating in
an inner tube off Florida.

Bush Opines on Roe Vs. Wade
</SUBHEAD>

	   COLFAX, Iowa (AP) -- Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush
said Friday "it should be up to each state legislature" to decide what limits to
place on abortions, adding that the Supreme Court erred by issuing a ruling on
the issue 27 years ago. But Bush, an anti-abortion two-term Texas governor, did
not directly call for the outright repeal of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that
legalized abortions, and his comments, in the closing days of the Iowa caucus
campaign, drew a taunting reply from GOP rival Steve Forbes. Bush, who is
campaigning as a compassionate conservative, opposes abortion except in cases of
rape, incest and where the life of the mother is at stake. But he doesn't
emphasize the issue.

Venezuela Damage Estimated at $10B

	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela needs between $10 billion and $30
billion to repair the damage from December's massive floods and landslides, and
much of the money will have to come from other countries, a top official said
Friday. "The figures are astronomic because a substantial part of the national
infrastructure has been destroyed," Vice Foreign Minister Jorge Valero told
reporters. Valero's statement is the first official estimate of the damage since
avalanches of mud, water and boulders came crashing down the mountain that
separates the capital, Caracas, from the Caribbean Sea on Dec. 15.

<HEADLINE> Bank Chiefs Gather for G7 Meeting  </HEADLINE>
    By GARY SCHAEFER Associated Press writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers today urged Japan to
further open its economy to promote stable growth, a Japanese finance official
said.
</P>
<P>
	   While welcoming Japan's efforts to pull out of its deepest slump in decades,
Summers said he believes the world's second-largest economy has yet to achieve
its potential, according to Zembei Mizoguchi, head of the Finance Ministry's
international bureau.
</P>
<P>
	   Summers, who is in Japan for a weekend gathering of finance officials from
the Group of Seven industrial nations, made the remarks in a meeting with Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
	   The two sides reportedly said nothing about the subject on the minds of many
global investors and currency traders: the strong yen.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese officials worry that the yen's 10 percent rise against the dollar
over the last year threatens Japan's economic recovery by hurting its mainstay
export industries.
</P>
<P>
	   In his meeting with Obuchi, Summers urged Japan to continue to deregulate
its economy, including the telecommunications sector, to attract foreign
investment and stimulate growth, Mizoguchi said.

<HEADLINE> Jags Say They Will Stay Competitive  </HEADLINE>
    By EDDIE PELLS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jaguars senior vice president Michael Huyghue has
watched the salary cap and free agency slowly chip away at the one-time NFL
dynasties.
</P>
<P>
	   He thinks he has the plan to keep Jacksonville from becoming part of that
trend.
</P>
<P>
	   Huyghue, the Jaguars salary cap guru, bases his optimism on two things --
good long-term cap management and what the organization perceives as its fair
treatment of veteran players.
</P>
<P>
	   In each of their last five years, the Jaguars have finished in the top-third
of the league in cap room. To close this season, they're fifth, $957,000 below
the league limit.
</P>
<P>
	   "When San Francisco was building a dynasty, they were doing things like
signing Deion Sanders and doing artificial deals," Huyghue said. "We've never
done that. When you're in the top five positions as far as cap room, it doesn't
stand that the horizon is bleak."
</P>
<P>
	   Huyghue believes the Jaguars have treated their players well enough to
command loyalty when contracts expire.
</P>
<P>
	   Among those who will test that theory are defensive end Tony Brackens and
cornerback Aaron Beasley, key players in Jacksonville's surge from 25th to
fourth in the league in yardage allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll find out," Huyghue said. "Maybe I'm living in a fantasy world, but I
think we'll find out for the first time what loyalty on one side of the stick
means on the other."
</P>
<P>
	   Beasley, a fourth-year veteran, said the Jaguars have always treated him
well, but knows the real proof will come after the season.
</P>
<P>
	   "When it comes to numbers, I just want to be treated fairly," he said. "I'm
not looking to move anywhere. I'm just looking for a fair deal. I know that guys
who have been here and played well have been rewarded."
</P>
<P>
	   Huyghue believes Brackens, also in his fourth season, will accept $1 million
less than the highest bidder to stay in Jacksonville, where the cost of living
is relatively low and there is no state income tax. Brackens, who had 12 sacks,
is expected to fetch up to $7 million per year.
</P>
<P>
	   Owner Wayne Weaver said Huyghue taught him the principles of sound financing
when he bought the team. Weaver said his role is simply to remind Huyghue of
those principles when big-money issues come up.
</P>
<P>
	   Part of Jacksonville's success has been its ability to strike quickly once
the free-agent period begins.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll face some critical issues of how well we can keep this football team
together and how well we manage that," Weaver said. "I think we're good at
modeling out the next four years of what we can spend and what we can't spend."
</P>
<P>
	   If the Jaguars can keep Keenan McCardell, Jimmy Smith, Mark Brunell, Fred
Taylor and Tony Boselli -- offensive stars all in the prime of their careers --
both Huyghue and coach Tom Coughlin figure they'll be in good shape for the next
several years.
</P>
<P>
	   "People ask me if this is our best opportunity right now," Coughlin said.
"I've never gone along with the 'now' segment of it. It's an ongoing process,
and I hope that we'll be able to keep the majority of our players here."

<HEADLINE> Major News -- McNair's Toe Hurts  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- A day before the AFC championship game, there's
actual news -- Tennessee quarterback Steve McNair's toe still hurts.
</P>
<P>
	   OK, so McNair said there's no chance he'll miss Sunday's AFC title game with
the Jacksonville Jaguars. But he did miss Friday's practice in Nashville and was
wearing a boot to protect his turf toe injury at the obligatory final press
conference after the Titans arrived in Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
	   "Steve is 100 percent in my eyes and his eyes as well," running back Eddie
George said. "Any time you play 20 games in a season, nobody is totally
healthy."
</P>
<P>
	   There were, of course, no startling revelations at the final press
conference for either team.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the usual fare -- questions to Jacksonville coach Tom Coughlin about
his sense of humor, or lack of it; questions to the Jaguars about whether they
want to force McNair out of the pocket or keep him in it; questions about the
weather report (a chance of rain), and a question to Tennessee's Jevon Kearse,
the defensive rookie of the year, about how fast he is.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fast enough," Kearse replied.
</P>
<P>
	   But there were two major subjects -- the fact that Tennessee inflicted
Jacksonville's only two losses this season and McNair's toe.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jaguars said the two losses to the Titans were additional incentive.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans said they didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're playing this like we've never played them before," McNair said.
</P>
<P>
	   And nobody on the Tennessee side seemed particularly concerned about
McNair's toe problems, which he's had off and on for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, last season, when the Titans -- then the Oilers -- beat the Jaguars
here 16-13, McNair wore a piece of hard plastic over his toes for protection
during the game. He ended up scrambling for 81 yards and passing for 232 more.
</P>
<P>
	   So it finally got back to the sense of humor, or lack thereof, possessed by
the dour Coughlin, one of the most driven coaches in a league full of them.
</P>
<P>
	   "He'll have a rare moment when he'll have a chuckle," said safety Carnell
Lake, who signed with Jacksonville after playing most of his career under the
equally obsessive Bill Cowher in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
	   "But most of the time, what you see is what you get."

<HEADLINE> Letterman Beats Leno in Ratings  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- David Letterman can recuperate with a smile: He just scored
his first weekly ratings victory against Jay Leno in nearly five years.
</P>
<P>
	   The CBS "Late Show" host underwent emergency heart surgery on Jan. 14, two
days after his much-anticipated interview with Hillary Rodham Clinton. The show
earned Letterman his biggest audience since 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   The show may bring in guest hosts during Letterman's absence, said executive
producer Rob Burnett. Already, he's been flooded with offers from people
including Howard Stern and Regis Philbin, to whom Letterman revealed his heart
problems on the air last week.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a million ideas," Burnett said.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman hadn't beaten Leno, host of NBC's "Tonight Show," in the ratings
with first-run programming since the week of May 22, 1995. Letterman's average
audience last week was 5.9 million to Leno's 5.8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory was driven almost entirely by Mrs. Clinton's appearance, which
drew 11.2 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's staff made a special point of noting that Mrs. Clinton's guest
shot drew higher ratings than Leno's first post-arrest interview with actor Hugh
Grant. The 1995 Grant interview cemented NBC's late-night dominance for the last
half of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   At first, CBS said it would run "Late Show" reruns during Letterman's
absence. That's what the network has done this week, and next week the show airs
the best of its "on the road" broadcasts from San Francisco, Los Angeles, Miami,
London and Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   After that, Burnett said CBS is considering several options, including more
reruns, guest hosts and a mix of repeats with some live celebrity cameos.
</P>
<P>
	   Burnett said he has talked to Letterman frequently since his surgery, but
not about the show. It was unclear when Letterman will return to work.
</P>
<P>
	   "Obviously we can't make these huge decisions without him, but it's still
too early to go to him with questions about it," Burnett said. "A lot will
depend on how long he's going to be out."
</P>
<P>
	   CBS can only hope Letterman returns to work sometime in February, a ratings
"sweeps" month. The network expects a big audience for his return.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some people have floated the notion that our audience will erode while he's
away," Burnett said. "I couldn't disagree more."

<HEADLINE> Titans Aren't Road Warriors  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- The Tennessee Titans aren't road warriors. It
just seems that way.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans are the only team with a winning record at Alltel Stadium against
the Jacksonville Jaguars, losing only in 1997. Not bad in a stadium where the
Jaguars are 30-4 since 1996 with three of the losses to Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   But coach Jeff Fisher, who handed the Jaguars a loss in their inaugural game
in 1995 and their only losses this season, said there's nothing special about
the stadium or Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over the last few years, we've had a good deal of success on the road.
Typically, I think that's because of what the club's been through. We've played
a number of games on the road the last three, four years. It's just the approach
we take to playing on the road," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a very difficult place to play, as a lot of teams have found out
here the last couple of years."
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee has done well on the road ever since owner Bud Adams announced
plans to move his team from Houston to Nashville. Until this season, seats
usually outnumbered fans for "home" games in Houston, Memphis and Nashville, so
the Titans quickly learned to enjoy playing in front of people even if the
crowds were hostile.
</P>
<P>
	   The challenge gets tougher Sunday for the Titans when they play the Jaguars
in the AFC championship. The Titans haven't played in this game since 1979 when
they lived in Houston and were called the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
	   They also face some tough history. They are trying to become the first team
in NFL history to beat an opponent three times in a season with two of the
victories coming on the road.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have to approach this game like it's the first time we've played them,"
running back Eddie George said. "We know each other."
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher said the Titans didn't change how they prepare for a game, coming in
early and staying late.
</P>
<P>
	   "Jacksonville week is a fun week at our facility," he said. "It brings out
the best in our club because it's an opportunity to play the best."
</P>
<P>
	   An example of how comfortable the Titans feel came Friday night when Fisher
and three of his players showed up nearly an hour late for their scheduled news
conference. Steve McNair, wearing a boot on his left foot as a precaution
against turf toe, and George shared a few quiet laughs waiting for their turn at
questions.
</P>
<P>
	   Fisher also had an explanation ready for their late arrival.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had our weekly half-hour meeting with Lady Luck, and it ran over a
little bit," said Fisher, whose Titans had the "Music City Miracle" in the
wild-card game and benefited from an instant replay reversal in Indianapolis
last week.

	   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Jaguars safety Carnell Lake said it would be
foolish to deny two previous losses to the Titans are a motivating factor for
Jacksonville in the AFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel good about having another shot," Lake said. "I think it will
definitely give us great momentum going into the Super Bowl if we're able to
overcome the Titans. And it will scratch a lot of questions that people have
about this team."
</P>
<P>
	   Jaguars coach Tom Coughlin figures it's only natural for his players to want
to get back at the only team to beat them this year. The Jaguars were pointing
at a possible rematch with Tennessee as soon as the playoff pairings came out.
</P>
<P>
	   "By most accounts, our team is not very happy with the way we performed the
last time we played them," Coughlin said of the 41-14 loss Dec. 26. "We'd like
to have an opportunity to do something about that."

	   BEST BUDDIES: Jaguars running back Fred Taylor and Titans defensive end
Jevon Kearse are former college teammates and good friends.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither has stood out in the previous meetings between the teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Kearse said the AFC title game is no time to renew old acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not going to be buddy-buddy," he said. "That's not in my game plan,
I'm sure it's not in his game plan. The friendship thing -- you've just got to
put that aside for a couple hours."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Y2K OK: Changing the routine shouldn't be a problem for the Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   They flew to Jacksonville on Friday instead of their usual Saturday trip as
required by league rules for the title game.
</P>
<P>
	   But running back Eddie George compared it to their Dec. 31 trip to
Pittsburgh, required to avoid any problems due to Y2K. He said they'll just have
a few extra hours to watch film, relax and take it easy.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   FINALLY HEALTHY: During the past two seasons, Taylor and Jaguars running
back James Stewart have intermingled solid performances and difficult injuries
to combine for one of the NFL's most effective rushing combinations.
</P>
<P>
	   For the first time since September 1998, both are back at full health --
just in time for Sunday's AFC championship game against Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
	   "Finally," Stewart said. "It seems one of us has been hurting each week all
season. But I think we're both set to go. It's ironic that it has taken that
long."
</P>
<P>
	   Taylor may never have emerged as one of the NFL's biggest threats were it
not for Stewart's season-ending knee injury in the third game of last season.
</P>
<P>
	   Given the opportunity, Taylor rushed for 1,223 yards and scored 17
touchdowns while Stewart quietly rehabilitated the knee and slipped into
oblivion.
</P>
<P>
	   Stewart re-emerged this season when Taylor went down with a series of
nagging injuries, most notably the sore hamstring that kept him out of all or
parts of 10 games.
</P>
<P>
	   "James might by our most valuable player this season," Jaguars quarterback
Mark Brunell said.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, Stewart led the Jaguars in rushing and scoring this season with 931
yards and 13 touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   EXPERIENCE COUNTS: Defensive tackle Jason Fisk is the only member of the
Titans to play in a conference championship last season. He was a member of the
Minnesota Vikings. But he's not sure if anyone should listen to any advice he
has about playing in a title game.
</P>
<P>
	   "We lost it last year, so I know what not to do," said Fisk, who signed with
Tennessee as a free agent.
</P>
<P>
	   The best advice Fisk has for his new teammates is to stay relaxed. The
Vikings were just a little tight as they headed into the NFC championship only
to lose to the Atlanta Falcons.
</P>
<P>
	   "We thought we were just a shoo-in for the Super Bowl. We were a little
tight. When they did some stuff, we didn't respond very well," Fisk said.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- One way or another, it will be payback time.
</P>
<P>
	   The Buccaneers-Rams for the NFC championship Sunday is a rematch of the 1979
title game. It also marks the first time since, that either of the franchises
have been this close to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams, who called Los Angeles home at the time, won a defensive struggle
9-0 over a Bucs team that advanced to the title game by beating the Dick
Vermeil-coached Philadelphia Eagles 24-17.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't remember much about that game, except we got beat," Vermeil, now
the coach of the St. Louis Rams, said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bucs coach Tony Dungy was a player with the San Francisco 49ers at the time.
One of Vermeil's former players, Herman Edwards, is the Bucs' assistant head
coach.
</P>
<P>
	   "I remember watching it on TV. We had played both the Bucs and the Rams. I
knew it was going to be a hard-fought, defensive game because they both had
tough defenses," Dungy said. "I don't remember too much about the game per se.
But I know the Rams won, so we'd like to change that around."
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams rushed for 216 yards, yet settled for three short field goals by
Frank Corral while holding Tampa Bay to just 177 yards. The Bucs trailed 6-0
when quarterback Doug Williams, who completed just 2 of 13 passes for 12 yards
and one interception, left the game with a torn bicep.
</P>
<P>
	   Dungy said there are a number of similarities between the Bucs of '79 and
'99.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the mentality of those teams are very much the same, that no matter
what happens, they're going to play 60 minutes, they're going to be physical,
they're going to hit you," the coach said. "I think the '79 team knew how good
it was maybe before a lot of other people did, and I think the same thing is
true with this team."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   BARK OR BITE?: Rams offensive guard Adam Timmerman doesn't pay much
attention to trash talk.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let's put it this way, I'd rather have a dog that bites hard than barks
loud," Timmerman said.
</P>
<P>
	   So which description applies to Bucs defensive tackle Warren Sapp, the
league's Defensive Player of the Year?
</P>
<P>
	   "He barks loud," Timmerman said. "He can bite, but it's one of those
things."
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   CONWELL'S CHEMISTRY LESSON: Rams tight end Ernie Conwell doesn't expect to
get heavy duty on Sunday. He missed more than a season due to reconstructive
knee surgery and has played in only two games, each time as a reserve.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Dick Vermeil said Conwell is a potential All-Pro, but he got into only
10-15 plays last week against Minnesota. Against the Buccaneers he'll be the
third-stringer behind Roland Williams and Jeff Robinson.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel good physically," Conwell said. "Part of it is you dance with the
one that brung you, know what I mean?' You don't want to mess with that
chemistry too much."

<HEADLINE> Surprise Teams in NFC Title Game  </HEADLINE>
    By BARRY WILNER AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Where are the Cowboys? The 49ers? The Packers?
</P>
<P>
	   Sure, none of them made the NFC championship game last year, but wasn't that
a fluke? Those were the powerhouse teams of the 1990s, and one of them must
belong in the title game.
</P>
<P>
	   Not quite. The Cowboys lost in the first round of the playoffs. The Packers
were a .500 team, and the 49ers had their worst season in nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
	   So when the St. Louis Rams and Tampa Bay Buccaneers trot onto the Trans
World Dome turf on Sunday, it might be the start of a new era. Regardless, it
sure is better than what we've come to expect from these two franchises.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rams were the losingest team of the 1990s until their turnaround season,
going from 4-12 to 13-3.
</P>
<P>
	   "The only thing I've talked about is winning, even when we lost eight
straight," coach Dick Vermeil said. "I would tell them, 'I can't promise you
when we are going to, but we're going to win. I don't think anyone can do
anything if he plays in fear of losing."
</P>
<P>
	   There's no fear in his team's eyes, and why should there be? The Rams have
the league's most dynamic and dangerous offense, led by quarterback Kurt Warner,
the NFL's Most Valuable Player, and running back Marshall Faulk, the Offensive
Player of the Year. It has a defense that hasn't allowed a 100-yard rusher all
season and ranks sixth overall.
</P>
<P>
	   It has a perfect 9-0 record at home in the noisy dome.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have a lot of quality guys on this team," All-Pro defensive end Kevin
Carter, the NFL sacks leader with 17, said. "It shows in the type of game we
play and the maturity we have. The guys we've assembled are really quality
people and that has made a difference.
</P>
<P>
	   "The chemistry is just right. Whatever it is you say you can bottle and sell
for $1 million, well, we've got it."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucs, 12-5 and winners of the NFC Central, also have been losers for
much of the decade. Where they have an edge in negativity is that they've
generally been a poor team throughout their 24-year history.
</P>
<P>
	   But when Tony Dungy took over as coach in 1996, their luck and their record
began turning around. They made the playoffs two years ago and now are one step
from their first Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   Of course, they got this far in 1979, only to lose to the Los Angeles Rams
for the NFC crown.
</P>
<P>
	   He has instilled the proper work ethic and built a dominating defense that
will be put to the supreme test Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone does their job and works hard and are always trying to get to the
Super Bowl and win it," Dungy said. "But you do not get validated in one game or
one season, but more how you do in the long haul.
</P>
<P>
	   "It would be great to get there, but the world would not come to an end if
we do not get there. If you do, you are not automatically going into the Hall of
Fame."
</P>
<P>
	   The Hall of Shame has been more like it for the Bucs. But nobody on the
Rams' side is mistaking them for the team that lost its first 26 games and,
except for a short spurt in the late 1970s and early '80s, didn't improve much
on those unenviable numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the important thing is that we as a team, the St. Louis Rams, are
not counting them out," wideout Isaac Bruce said of the Bucs, who are 14-point
underdogs. "They would not be playing against us if they weren't good.
</P>
<P>
	   "They definitely are a team to be reckoned with and they can stop a team
from scoring; that is what they do best."

<HEADLINE> NFL Rules Against Jets' Belichick  </HEADLINE>
    By BARRY WILNER AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Bill Parcells won't be on the sidelines for the New York Jets next season.
Bill Belichick won't, either, even if he still is their property.
</P>
<P>
	   On a day when the NFL ruled in favor of the Jets in Belichick's grievance
against the team, Parcells reaffirmed his intention to retire from coaching.
</P>
<P>
	   An NFL source told The Associated Press on Friday night that Parcells
reiterated to Woody Johnson, the Jets' new owner, that he doesn't want to coach
anymore. He also recommended linebackers coach Al Groh to take over the post
that Belichick didn't want. Groh is expected to be announced on Monday as the
new coach.
</P>
<P>
	   "He simply doesn't want to coach anymore," the source said of Parcells.
"He's sticking by what he decided."
</P>
<P>
	   He's also expected to stick around as the team's chief of football
operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Friday, commissioner Paul Tagliabue upheld the Jets' rights to
Belichick through the 2000 season. Tagliabue ruled Belichick breached his
contract, which has three years remaining, when he resigned as coach of the Jets
on Jan. 4 -- one day after Parcells stepped down -- and cannot work for another
team this year without the Jets' approval.
</P>
<P>
	   That means compensation, which almost certainly would be in the form of
draft picks.
</P>
<P>
	   The New England Patriots are eager to hire Belichick for their vacant head
coaching position. And Belichick's representatives, lawyers Neil Cornrich and
Jeffrey Kessler, are threatening to sue the NFL, which they say is unlawfully
forbidding Belichick from shopping himself.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think the commissioner's decision is unlawful and we are actively
assessing all of our legal options," Cornrich said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Taken as a whole, the contract and the related memoranda constitute an
agreement that Mr. Belichick would be the Jets' head coach except when Mr.
(Bill) Parcells served in that capacity," Tagilabue ruled in a grievance filed
by Belichick. "The agreement contemplated that Mr. Belichick would automatically
succeed to the head coaching position if Mr. Parcells was no longer head coach."
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, the Jets sent four draft picks to New England to get Parcells
released from his contract with the Patriots. Questions of possible tampering by
the Jets raised those stakes.
</P>
<P>
	   Now it is New England seeking the coach who is under contract -- Belichick,
who came to New York with Parcells and was defensive coordinator and
coach-in-waiting until earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Don't expect the Jets to get four picks for Belichick, however. He doesn't
have Parcells' track record. While Parcells has led three teams to the Super
Bowl, Belichick had one winning season in five at Cleveland. Something along the
lines of a pair of second-rounders is more likely.
</P>
<P>
	   Tagliabue rejected claims by Belichick that he never actually assumed the
head coaching job. The commissioner cited "more than 10" discussions between
Belichick and Parcells about the prospect of Belichick becoming coach after the
1999 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Tagliabue denied the Jets' claim that Belichick should be barred from
leaving for another team for the remaining three years on his contract. This
ruling applied to 2000 only.
</P>
<P>
	   Tagliabue cited the uncertainty in the Jets' coaching situation, and told
both sides to address three points by Feb. 1:
</P>
<P>
	   -- Whether the Jets' contract rights to Belichick should extend through
2002, or should be limited to the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Whether the contract rights should remain in place if Parcells returns as
coach.
</P>
<P>
	   -- What procedures should be followed to determine whether the Jets are
entitled to damages for Belichick's breach of contract.
</P>
<P>
	   Patriots spokesman Stacey James said, "This information doesn't change
anything with us. It's still between Belichick and the Jets."

<HEADLINE> Packers Seek Help for Lambeau Field  </HEADLINE>
    By ANTHONY JEWELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers are hoping to get approval for a
0.5 percent sales tax in Brown County, which would help pay for a $295 million
renovation of Lambeau Field, The Associated Press learned.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax would require approval in a referendum and would be in addition to
the 5 percent state sales tax.
</P>
<P>
	   It could generate $160 million to help repay bonds issued for remodeling,
sources who were briefed by Packers officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sales tax will remain in effect until it's paid for," said one of the
sources, a state legislator who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The remaining $135 million would be paid by the Packers, who plan to charge
a one-time "personal seat license" of $1,500 to $2,000 on all season-ticket
holders, sources said.
</P>
<P>
	   The renovation plan calls for the Packers to expand the 61,000-seat
city-owned stadium by about 10,000 seats, the lawmaker said. The plan was
verified by another source who had discussed it with the team and also spoke on
the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Team officials said they would consider selling single-game tickets for
games if they were to receive taxpayer money for renovating and expanding the
stadium, allowing non-season ticket holders to see games. There is a 51,000-fan
waiting list for Packers tickets, team officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Packers officials scheduled a news conference this afternoon in Green Bay,
the Brown County seat, to announce their plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Team president Bob Harlan said the team would prefer to stay at Lambeau
Field but needs to expand the stadium by at least 8,000 seats. The team also
wants to add luxury boxes and other amenities, like meeting halls or banquet
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The stadium was last expanded in 1995 when luxury boxes were added.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Hinkfuss, chairman of the Brown County Board, said he was surprised the
financing plan only included a sales tax on Brown County.
</P>
<P>
	   "Would something like this pass? That is a very good question. Everything
depends on how the Packers lay out the plan and make their case," Hinkfuss said.
He added he wanted more information before deciding whether he would support the
tax.
</P>
<P>
	   "The county sales tax has been a very sensitive issue in Brown County.
People don't like taxes period."
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. John Ryba, a Green Bay Democrat whose district includes Lambeau Field,
said he didn't like the proposal, especially the personal seat license, but
supported the idea of a referendum.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it's going to fly at the county level or anywhere else, but
they feel confident that it's going to pass," said Ryba, a season ticketholder.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Tommy Thompson, who met with team officials Monday, said he expects
there will be widespread support for the proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor has been very pleased that the Packers have been open to a
referendum," Thompson's spokesman Kevin Keane said. "The governor believes that
when people see the entire plan, they'll see it's very well thought out."
</P>
<P>
	   The Packers plan news conferences Monday in Wausau, La Crosse and Madison.
</P>
<P>
	   The Packers began playing in Green Bay in 1919 and are the only publicly
owned professional football team.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers To Meet Reno  </HEADLINE>
   By DIEGO IBARGUEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers spoke pointedly, at times
tearfully, in asking a nation to let them take their grandson back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this tragedy that has
been so hard for us as a family and to ask you that our grandson can return as
soon as possible,'' Mariela Quintana, Elian's paternal grandmother, said after
arriving at Kennedy International Airport on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The women flew to New York with a church delegation that has supported
Elian's return over the objections of the boy's relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The next step toward reclaiming their 6-year-old grandson was expected to
take place later today in Washington -- a meeting with Attorney General Janet
Reno and Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said that the grandmothers requested the meeting and that the
Clinton administration wants to hear what they have to say. The INS has ordered
that the boy be returned to his father in Cuba, a decision supported by Reno.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov.
25, after the boat on which he was heading for the United States capsized,
killing his mother, her boyfriend and nine other people.
</P>
<P>
	   He has been living with relatives in Miami, who say he would have a better
life in the United States. Attorneys for the family in Florida have asked a
federal judge to prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nobody has a right to make him an American citizen,'' Mrs. Quintana said.
``He was born in Cuba. He lived in Cuba. He is a Cuban.''
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, said the boy's late mother
will not ``rest in peace'' until Elian is back in his homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Respect the memory of my daughter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Quintana also said Elian, in telephone conversations with her and with
his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, had expressed a desire to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The emotional appeal failed to impress Elian's relatives in Miami. Following
the grandmothers' televised news conference, the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, emerged from his house with Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban
American National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elian saw the images of his grandmothers,'' Mas said. ``He crossed in
front of the television set and continued playing in his room without spending
more than 10 seconds looking at the screen.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both reiterated their request that the grandmothers visit Elian in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why don't they come to Miami to hug him and be together with him?'' Mas
asked. ``Instead they're in New York, repeating the propaganda of the Castro
regime. We sincerely hope that they will stop this charade, that they will come
here and be with their grandson.''
</P>
<P>
	   For now, the women have chosen to avoid Miami, where Cuban immigrants staged
massive protests after the INS said Elian must go back to Cuba.
</P>

<P>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Patrik Elias has raised his game to the point
that he no longer simply hopes to score.
</P>
<P>
	   "I expect to score every game," Elias said after scoring twice and adding an
assist in the New Jersey Devils' 4-0 victory over the New York Islanders on
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Elias extended his point streak to a New Jersey-record 13 games, breaking
the mark set by Aaron Broten in 1984-85 and matched by Pat Verbeek in 1987-88
and Scott Stevens in 1993-94.
</P>
<P>
	   "Hopefully, I can keep this going," Elias said. "Our whole line, we're
having fun out there. We want to make the other team aware of us every shift."
</P>
<P>
	   The Czech star has 19 goals in his last 20 games, and 14 goals and eight
assists during the streak.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every guy wants to score goals. For some reason, it might seem easier the
way I'm playing right now, but we're working hard and playing good right now as
a unit," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to get better every game. You want to work on yourself every game,
every practice."
</P>
<P>
	   In other NHL games Friday night, it was Florida 3, Atlanta 3; St. Louis 3,
Chicago 0; Calgary 5, Nashville 4 in overtime; and Colorado 3, Anaheim 3.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's Martin Brodeur made 31 saves for his NHL-high 29th victory. He
has three shutouts this season and 39 in his career. It also was his first
complete-game shutout of the Islanders.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought about it as it got closer and closer," said Brodeur, who teamed
with Mike Dunham to shut out New York in 1996-97. "That was a team that I had
never had a real one against.
</P>
<P>
	   Petr Sykora added a goal and had the primary assist on both of Elias' goals.
Sergei Brylin also scored for New Jersey, which has won four straight and is
11-1-2 in its last 14.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're pretty deep," Islanders coach Butch Goring said. "They don't have
any glaring weaknesses. That makes it tough. When you do get a chance to score,
they have a pretty good goaltender."
</P>
<P>
	   New York has lost six straight and is 1-11-1 in its last 13.
</P>
<P>
	   "We give them a lot of credit," Islanders goalie Kevin Weekes said. "They're
obviously a very efficient hockey team ... like a machine. They seem to be
playing so well and so synchronized in all aspects of their game."
</P>
<P>
	   Elias opened the scoring at 1:20 of the first period, slipping behind
Islanders defenseman Jamie Heward to slam a centering feed from Sykora past
Weekes.
</P>
<P>
	   Midway through the second, Brylin patiently held the puck and waited for an
opening that developed when Islanders defenseman Jamie Rivers checked Jay
Pandolfo into Weekes.
</P>
<P>
	   Elias, once again set up Sykora, made it 3-0 with a power-play goal with
3:11 left in the second. Elias turned playmaker in the third, setting up Sykora
at 9:41.
</P>
<P>
	   Yannick Tremblay scored a short-handed goal with 4:14 left in regulation and
Norm Maracle made 37 saves as Atlanta rallied to tie visiting Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Florida's Pavel Bure scored his 32nd goal of the season and 299th of his
career with 8:48 left in the third period, but was stopped twice in overtime on
brilliant saves by Maracle.
</P>
<P>
	   Oleg Kvasha and Mark Parrish added goals for Florida. Andreas Karlsson and
Roman Ndur also scored for the Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   Roman Turek stopped 11 shots for his fourth shutout of the season in St.
Louis' victory in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Reirden, Pavol Demitra and Mike Eastwood scored to help St. Louis, the
NHL's top defensive team, move past Detroit for first place in the Western
Conference. Chicago tied a team record for fewest shots in a game, set April 18,
1998, in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
	   Valeri Bure scored twice, including the game-winner, as Calgary beat
Nashville for its NHL-record ninth overtime victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Calgary improved its overtime record to 9-1-5, breaking the NHL record of
eight set by Winnipeg in 1987-88.
</P>
<P>
	   Jarome Iginla had a goal and two assists, and Bobby Dollas and Jeff Shantz
also scored for Calgary. The Flames have won seven straight at home and are
13-1-1 in their last 15 at the Saddledome.
</P>
<P>
	   Drake Berehowsky had two power-play goals for Nashville, and Vitali
Yachmenev and Mark Mowers also scored.
</P>
<P>
	   Teemu Selanne scored with 1:40 remaining in the third period as Anaheim
rallied to tie visiting Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Kariya had a goal and two assists, and Oleg Tverdovsky also scored for
the Ducks. Peter Forsberg, Joe Sakic and Chris Drury scored for Colorado, which
extended its unbeaten streak to a season-best six games (4-0-2).

Ecuador's President Flees, Junta Announced
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- After President Jamil Mahuad fled amid an Indian-led
rebellion, Ecuador's military chief announced late Friday a three-person junta
to replace the unpopular president. Mahuad insisted he would not resign -- but
he abandoned the palace where he worked and lived in the afternoon after
refusing a request from the military high command to step down. Ecuador's
economic woes appear to have led to the unusual Indian uprising. Last year,
inflation reached 60 percent, the highest in Latin America, and only one in
three in the labor force has full-time work.

said. While welcoming Japan's efforts to pull out of its deepest slump in
decades, Summers said he believes the world's second-largest economy has yet to
achieve its potential, according to Zembei Mizoguchi, head of the Finance
Ministry's international bureau. Summers, who is in Japan for a weekend
gathering of finance officials from the Group of Seven industrial nations, made
the remarks in a meeting with Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.

health issue and his handling of the disclosures consuming his campaign as it
headed into the final weekend before Iowa's leadoff nominating caucuses. Bradley
sought to quell the uproar over his health late in the day, releasing a
statement from his cardiologist. "These episodes have not, in any way,
interfered with his busy schedule," said Dr. Robert H. Heissenbuttel.

General Janet Reno, who has said Elian belongs with his father. Elian was found
clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov. 25 after the boat on
which he was heading for the United States capsized, killing his mother. "I

Press report that investigators are increasingly convinced the jet was crashed
deliberately. Three government officials close to the investigation, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said examinations of the jet's remains have revealed no
signs of a mechanical failure that would have caused the plane to crash, AP
reported Thursday. "No hypothesis for the cause of this accident has been
accepted," Hall said Friday in a statement.

Clinton Seeks More Research Funds

<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton said Friday he wants to add
nearly $3 billion to federal science and technology research, a broad effort
that he said has already fostered amazing changes in American life and national
wealth. The proposed increase in next year's budget would add nearly $1 billion
to information technology-related computer research. Although he struggles with
computer technology himself, Clinton speaks with enthusiasm about the wonders
technology has wrought. "It is changing everything about the way we work and
live and relate to each other," Clinton said of the Internet, saying the
computer network is a major reason for the nation's continued economic growth.

<HEADLINE> Obstetrician carves his initials in mom's abdomen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan doctor who carved his initials into the
abdomen of a woman whose baby he had just delivered by Caesarian section is
being sued for $5 million.
<P>
	   Dr. Allan Zarkin "felt very close to this woman, but something clicked on
and off in his brain," his lawyer, Kenneth Platzer, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The woman, Liana Gedz, 31, says in her lawsuit that the 3-by-1 1/2-inch
letters "A" and "Z" make her feel like "a branded animal."
</P>
<P>
	   Zarkin, a 61-year-old obstetrician, cut his initials into his sedated
patient an inch above her Caesarian incision shortly after delivering her baby
girl Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   But he was mentally impaired at the time, his attorney said, "and this was a
bizarre, unexplainable event."
</P>
<P>
	   Zarkin, Platzer said, suffers from a frontal-lobe disorder called Pick's
disease, a progressive form of Alzheimer's-like dementia characterized by
personality changes and inappropriate behavior.
</P>
<P>
	   "The doctor had no ill will, no malice, no intent to harm the patient,"
Platzer said. "I would call it a cerebral dysfunction brought on by an illness."
</P>
<P>
	   Zarkin is being treated by a psychiatrist and a neurologist, his lawyer
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The carved initials are permanent, Gedz, a dentist, said in her lawsuit,
which was made public Friday in Manhattan state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt like I was raped," Gedz told the Daily News. "I'm so embarrassed to
get undressed in front of my husband because I have another man's initials on my
stomach."
</P>
<P>
	   Her husband, Robert Ghalili, an oral surgeon, also is named as a plaintiff.
He's asking $500,000 in personal damages caused by the scarring of his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple also is suing Beth Israel Medical Center, where the child was
delivered, and New York Gyn/Ob Associates, Zarkin's medical group.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital suspended Zarkin's right to practice immediately following the
incident and reported him to health authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   After the delivery, Zarkin announced, "I did such a beautiful job, I'll
initial it," according to operating room witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Gedz's husband and mother were present at the delivery.
</P>
<P>
	   A friend had recommended Zarkin to the pregnant woman, and she was so
pleased with the prenatal care that she and her husband invited Zarkin to visit
them at their Long Island country home.
</P>
<P>
	   "He became a close friend," she said. "I don't understand why he did this."
</P>
<P>
	   Gedz and Zarkin were unavailable for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor had never before harmed any patient, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Disfiguring someone with a dangerous instrument is considered first-degree
assault, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. No charges have been filed
against Zarkin.
</P>
<P>
	   Platzer, who specializes in medical malpractice law, insisted his client did
not commit a criminal act because he is mentally impaired.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gedz's attorney, Robert Sullivan, said the illness was a ruse.
</P>
<P>
	   "How could this man with Pick's be performing major surgery for 30 years,"
Sullivan asked, "and now, a month after this assault, they send him for tests
and he has a frontal-lobe disorder?"

<HEADLINE> Canada Abandons NHL Bailout  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA PODELL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   The NHL still plans to keep six clubs in Canada. Now, they have to find a
new way to do it.
</P>
<P>
	   Just three days after the Canadian government announced a financial bailout
for those teams, the plan was abandoned Friday. Without that federal aid,
further movement of teams into the United States is a definite threat.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm obviously disappointed by the recent developments and remain
concerned," NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said. "This is an appropriate time to
regroup and reassess."
</P>
<P>
	   The Edmonton Oilers, Calgary Flames, Vancouver Canucks and Ottawa Senators
could follow the Quebec Nordiques and Winnipeg Jets across the border. The
Nordiques moved to Denver and the Jets to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have challenges and we will do everything we can to keep the six teams
in Canada and keep them competitive. I'm not as optimistic today," Bettman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The other Canadian teams are Original Six members Montreal and Toronto.
</P>
<P>
	   The government, on Tuesday, approved the aid package that would provide up
to about $2 million annually to each team. The plan was contingent on city and
provincial governments also giving money.
</P>
<P>
	   However, it did not have the necessary support and was scrapped amid strong
opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   Industry Minister John Manley called the public response "clear" and
"negative." He said the proposal is "dead, and we will not be pursuing the issue
any further."
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not too happy to see it fall apart," Manley said. "If it leads to the
demise of National Hockey League teams in Canada, it will be a very sad
development."
</P>
<P>
	   Several U.S. cities, including Houston, Las Vegas, and Portland, Ore., have
expressed interest in having NHL teams.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our focus has to be to keep the six teams in Canada where they are now,"
said Bettman, who called Canada "the heart and soul of the game".
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the week, Bettman hailed the Canadian government for
"courageously ... addressing a difficult issue in a meaningful way."
</P>
<P>
	   The commissioner said there is no longer a national solution to this
predicament and the teams will now be handled on a one-on-one basis.
</P>
<P>
	   "Each of the clubs and their ownership is going to have to take a step back
and evaluate their individual circumstances," Bettman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Senators owner Rod Bryden thought it was safe to put away his team's "For
Sale" sign, he was a bit hasty. Bryden won't have to go far to retrieve it.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's still in the garage, but it's probably useful we didn't burn it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bryden said he will need as much as 10 days to decide his next move.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is high-stakes poker, folks," Canucks president and general manager
Brian Burke said. "And it's a lot about the future of this city and this
province."
</P>
<P>
	   The Canucks reported a $24 million loss last year, and Burke says he will
next approach the city and provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not discouraged by it," he said of the aid relief. "We're dismayed by
it, but in no way are we throwing in the towel."
</P>
<P>
	   Provincial ministers from British Columbia, Alberta and Quebec and Ontario
Premier Mike Harris all opposed the plan. Brenda Chamberlain, head of Ontario's
Liberal Party caucus, said she has fielded numerous protest calls.
</P>
<P>
	   "My caucus colleagues have echoed their constituents' opposition," Manley
said. "And the prime minister and I want them to know today that this government
listens and takes their views very seriously."
</P>
<P>
	   Although puzzled by the extent of the criticism in Canada, Bettman said he
did not fault Canadian leaders for the turnabout.
</P>
<P>
	   "At the end of the day, the will of the people as determined by the federal
government, was 'No' and you have to go with the will of the people," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Canada's NHL teams have been damaged by a number of factors. They earn most
of their revenues in Canadian dollars and pay most expenses -- notably player
salaries -- in American currency. That puts them at a serious competitive
disadvantage against U.S. teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Franchises also complain of higher taxes in Canada, while all NHL teams have
been stung by salaries that are climbing by about 10 percent annually. The
average NHL salary exceeds $1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Some U.S. franchises have received tax breaks or had publicly funded arenas
built for them.
</P>
<P>
	   Edmonton Mayor Bill Smith called the federal package an "ill-conceived plan
that went astray."
</P>
<P>
	   Alberta Treasurer Stockwell Day questioned why the federal government didn't
act when teams in Winnipeg and Quebec were in trouble.
</P>
<P>
	   "But when the Ottawa Senators had a problem, it seemed to ring a bell," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Dayne Gets All Attention in Hawaii  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN DiPIETRO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) -- The NCAA's career rushing leader needs to show pro
scouts he can catch.
</P>
<P>
	   Ron Dayne doesn't need to show he can run at today's Hula Bowl -- his 6,397
yards at Wisconsin prove that -- but the Heisman Trophy winner must answer
questions about whether he has sufficient pass-catching skills for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't have to catch a lot of footballs at Wisconsin, but I caught nearly
everything they threw to me," Dayne said. "I know there are some questions, but
I think I have the answers."
</P>
<P>
	   Barry Alvarez, Dayne's coach at Wisconsin, is coaching the North team and
plans to showcase Dayne's catching skills in limited duty.
</P>
<P>
	   "Probably a six- to 10-play game for him," Alvarez said. "I want him to
catch some passes, I want him in the game for some receptions, but I'm not going
to hand it to him like I did during the regular season."
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee's Phil Fulmer, coaching the South team, expects Dayne to be a
major part of the North's offense.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'd say we're going to get a lot of Dayne," Fulmer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Both coaches said the key to preparing for the game is keeping it simple.
</P>
<P>
	   "Trying to put a team together in a week, so thank goodness it's simple
offensively and defensively," Fulmer said. "Practices have gone well, the kids
have responded well. They're anxious to look good."
</P>
<P>
	   Alvarez is impressed with how well his disparate group of players are
meshing.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's funny how kids can develop some chemistry, even in a week," Alvarez
said. "We've got a good group of kids, they've really been cooperative. We've
gotten a lot done."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Alvarez isn't sure what type of game fans can expect.
</P>
<P>
	   "You'd like to hope it's the kind of game where the ball is going up and
down the field, but you can't ever say," he said. "I think the quality will be
OK, as long as everybody plays by the rules defensively."
</P>
<P>
	   While Dayne is receiving most of the attention, the rest of the players are
hoping to steal a bit of the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's an opportunity when you bring somebody like that in because you know
he's going to bring the scouts in," Southern California running back Chad Morton
said. "That's a chance for you to sneak in there and get some attention."

<HEADLINE> Flyers' Lindros Cleared To Practice  </HEADLINE>
    By KEN BERGER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   VOORHEES, N.J. (AP) -- Even though Eric Lindros was one step closer to
coming back from his latest concussion, there was still concern in his voice.
</P>
<P>
	   There has to be. The words "Lindros" and "concussion" bring back too many
bad memories.
</P>
<P>
	   Lindros, the Philadelphia Flyers' captain and franchise player, was cleared
to practice Friday after his third concussion in 22 months. But he won't return
to the lineup until next week, exercising the kind of caution his brother,
Brett, did not.
</P>
<P>
	   Brett Lindros, the first-round draft pick of the New York Islanders in 1995,
had his career ended at age 19 by a series of concussions. The players' father,
Carl, expressed regret Friday that Brett didn't have the kind of information
Eric has about the severity of head injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   "What became apparent after the fact was that Brett shouldn't have been
playing," Carl Lindros said. "I think he was playing through concussions on a
fairly regular basis.
</P>
<P>
	   "Since Brett turned pro, he wanted so badly to succeed that he was prepared
to do anything, including playing through concussions, to be a player. What's
become abundantly clear is, you certainly cannot play through a concussion."
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Lindros, who sustained a Grade 2 concussion last Friday in Atlanta,
passed a neurological baseline test Friday, team doctor Gary Dorshimer said.
That's the first step to coming back from a concussion.
</P>
<P>
	   But Lindros was not able to skate Friday after experiencing headaches during
his first attempt to return to the ice Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had trouble skating," Lindros said. "I don't have a problem on the bike.
Every day we've been making progress. I'll start skating again tomorrow and keep
moving ahead."
</P>
<P>
	   Lindros took a 45-minute test to measure his reaction time and memory, and
results were compared to scores he achieved before the concussion. Such
"baseline" tests are standard in the NHL and NFL to make sure players are fit to
return after taking a potentially dangerous blow to the head.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was pleased to hear that his mental function seemed to be back to his
baseline at this point," Dorshimer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lindros said he plans to practice today and perhaps return to the lineup
Thursday at home against Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   "Just to get practicing would be nice," Lindros said. "We're looking at
(today). Everything's going well. Every day I'm feeling better."
</P>
<P>
	   Still, concussions are a serious matter for the Lindros family.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been fortunate in the fact that they've been spread out," Eric Lindros
said. "My brother had one and then had another one eight days later, which is a
huge concern and ended up being the final blow.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was a little nervous about why things were taking so long. When I was
skating, when I was riding the bike, I was still having headaches. But they
assured me that things will clear up and be in order."
</P>
<P>
	   Lindros, who turns 27 next month, has been through a harrowing nine months.
He missed the final seven games of the regular season and last year's playoffs
because of a collapsed lung. Bothered by a badly bruised hand, Lindros is having
an off year with 17 goals and 26 assists -- barely qualifying for the NHL leader
board.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, another concussion.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's got the concussions hanging over him that could end his career,"
Flyers coach Roger Neilson said. "His brother got it and the whole thing. It's
not easy to have stuff hanging over you."
</P>
<P>
	   Neilson and Lindros had a long talk Thursday about how they both are going
through difficult times. Neilson is being treated for a rare form of bone cancer
and will have to leave the team in February or March for a grueling bone marrow
transplant.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've got an incurable disease hanging over me," Neilson said. "Whether they
say it is or not, my sister got the same thing and she died from it.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's got the concussions hanging over him. I want him to know that I know
it's not easy, too. It's really important to have a positive attitude. We can
kind of sympathize with each other on that."

<HEADLINE> NLRB Rules Against Phillips  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Richie Phillips lost the election and the appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips and the Major League Umpires Association, trying to hold on to
power, were rebuffed Friday by a National Labor Relations Board hearing officer
in their attempt to overturn the election that kicked them out in November.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's NLRB decision removes any doubt that major league umpires will be
represented by our new union," said American League umpire John Hirschbeck, one
of the leaders of the insurgents who won a representation election 57-35 in
November.
</P>
<P>
	   Umpires, many angry at a failed mass resignation plan that backfired in July
and cost 22 of them their jobs, voted to be represented by the Major League
Umpires Independent Organizing Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips and the MLUA appealed, claiming the new union was helped illegally
by owners during the election. Hearing officer David E. Leach III, who listened
to three days of testimony this month, rejected all their objections.
</P>
<P>
	   "We said from the beginning that we didn't engage in any improper conduct
and we think the board's decision reflects that fact," owners lawyer Rob Manfred
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The MLUA has two weeks to appeal Leach's decision to the five-member NLRB in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   "If after we read the opinion, we conclude there are grounds to appeal, then
we'll appeal," MLUA lawyer Pat Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new union called for an end to the infighting.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's time now for Richie Phillips to yield to the will of a clear majority
of the umpires and step aside," said Ron Shapiro, a lawyer and agent who has
advised the insurgents. "An appeal would only delay the inevitable now."
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the appeal, bargaining for a labor contract to replace the one
that expired Dec. 31 has been virtually nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
	   "We now have the opportunity to move forward in the best interests of all
umpires, the game of baseball and the public," Hirschbeck said. "The only result
from an appeal would be to delay the inevitable and to slow down bargaining for
a new contact."
</P>
<P>
	   Leach overruled the four objections filed by the old union, saying they
either were irrelevant or were not supported by evidence, and recommended that
Daniel Silverman, the NLRB's New York regional director, certify the new union.
</P>
<P>
	   "It has been asserted that the employer is blatantly anti-Phillips and
anti-MLUA, but the record is silent in this regard," Leach wrote in his 35-page
report.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips has led the MLUA to tremendous gains. When he became its negotiator
in 1978, rookie umpires made $17,500 and the most senior umps got $40,000. In
the contract that just expired, they made at least $95,000 each and could earn
up to $282,500 apiece, including bonuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Many AL umps became increasingly uncomfortable with Phillips in recent years
and some voted against renewing his contract before last season.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips prevailed 56-14 in a vote during spring training last year, and
worried about baseball's plan to merge the AL and NL umpiring staffs, Phillips
and MLUA president Jerry Crawford called for mass resignations in July. They
said they were angry over the umpires' working conditions, and many umps said
they wanted to force an early start to labor negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   The strategy collapsed when most AL umps either didn't resign or quickly
withdrew their resignations. Owners then hired 25 new umps from the minor
leagues and accepted the resignations of the 22, effective Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
	   In early September, the insurgents began organizing the new union, with many
AL umps on the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips and the MLUA claimed the new union illegally tried to win votes by
saying it could get a better deal with owners than the MLUA and that management
employees told umpires to vote for the new union. It also said the failure to
pay $20,000 postseason bonuses to the 22 illegally influenced the election.
</P>
<P>
	   "The employer's position, while harsh, is certainly a matter for
interpretation of the contractual language," Leach wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if the new union takes over, Phillips and the old union will continue
to argue the grievance to regain the jobs of the 22.
</P>
<P>
	   Phillips testified Thursday for a third straight day in Philadelphia before
arbitrator Alan Symonette, who is hearing the MLUA's grievance trying to gain
back the 22 jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Crawford and Phillips have testified, but Symonette does not know when the
case will resume.

<HEADLINE> Salvadoran Families Rebury Dead  </HEADLINE>
   By DIEGO MENDEZ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SANTA ROSITA, El Salvador (AP) -- Felipe Alvarado dug without rest,
searching for the body of the daughter-in-law who was raped and killed by
soldiers in 1980 at the start of El Salvador's civil war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My daughter-in-law was six months pregnant. It didn't matter to them, and
they killed her for no reason on the banks of a river,'' he recalled. ``Many
shots were heard, and we had to hide so they wouldn't kill us.''
</P>
<P>
	   The young woman, 18-year-old Dolores, and her cousin Anita, 22, were among
17 people killed on the morning of Sept. 11, 1980, in Santa Rosita, 45 miles
east of San Salvador.
</P>
<P>
	   The exhumation this week is the first following some 80 requests by
Salvadoran families who want to give proper burials to victims of the war,
according to Naida Medrano, a coordinator with the Madeleine Lagadec Human
Rights Promotion Center.
</P>
<P>
	   The human rights center, named for a French nurse killed in 1989 by soldiers
while working at a makeshift rebel hospital in El Tortugal, is not far from the
site of Thursday's dig.
</P>
<P>
	   During El Salvador's 12-year civil war, more than 75,000 people were killed
by soldiers and members of the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front.
Peace accords signed in 1992 ended the fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Santa Rosita massacre, relatives of Dolores and the other victims
hurriedly buried the bodies one atop the other in a mass grave at the foothills
of this central mountain region, Alvarado recalled.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We buried all of them. We fled because the army surrounded the area, and
we were very afraid,'' the 70-year-old man said while lifting his worn hat and
wiping sweat from his face.
</P>
<P>
	   After hours of digging, Alvarado finally found what he was searching for. In
between bits of bone, he recognized the remains of the wedding dress in which
his daughter-in-law had been buried.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We put the wedding dress on her,'' he said. Six years after the burial,
Alvarado's son was killed by soldiers in the same area.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Now what I want is to bury them as God wants, and I only ask my Lord that
there be justice.''

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Military To Have Contact  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- A senior Chinese general left for the United States today for
the first military contact since Beijing broke off the exchanges eight months
ago, following NATO's bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Gen. Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of the general staff of the People's
Liberation Army, will hold three days of talks in Washington next week with U.S.
Undersecretary of Defense Walter Slocombe and other Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Their meetings are to be the first high-level meetings between the two
militaries in 13 months, and should help dispel the lingering ill-will that has
clouded Chinese-U.S. relations since the May 7 bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   Military exchanges have been among the most complex and hard-won gains in
the countries' relations. Cut off after the PLA quelled the Tiananmen Square
democracy protests in 1989, relations ploddingly resumed in 1993 and progressed
to include base visits and discussions of disaster relief operations.
</P>
<P>
	   After U.S. warplanes fired satellite-guided missiles into the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade on May 7, China broke off the military contacts, as well as
consultations on arms control and human rights. It also effectively suspended
negotiations on its entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Although China has never accepted Washington's explanation that the attack
was accidental, a WTO deal in November and an agreement last month on
compensation for the bombing led Beijing to agree to restart military contacts.
</P>
<P>
	   But the bombing heightened the Chinese military's suspicions of U.S.
intentions. And despite resuming contacts, the PLA remains wary, especially on
the issue of Taiwan's status.
</P>
<P>
	   The military sees itself as the ultimate defender of China's claim to the
island, a former U.S. ally that Washington by law must aid in defending.
</P>
<P>
	   Xiong is one of China's most politically influential generals and is known
for his hard-line views on the United States. A former head of military
intelligence, Xiong sits on the ruling Communist Party's committee that sets
policy toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   China calls Taiwan the most sensitive issue in relations with the United
States. A state-run newspaper quoted a diplomat at the Chinese Embassy in
Washington today as saying U.S. failures to curb arms sales to Taiwan have hurt
relations and increased tensions between the mainland and the island.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The supply of weapons could drag the U.S. into a war that it is neither
prepared for nor willing to fight,'' the China Daily quoted Liu Xiaoming as
saying.
</P>
<P>
	   While Liu said the Chinese-U.S. relations were making progress, he said
several issues were still plaguing cooperation, including Taiwan, Washington's
decision to censure China before the U.N. Human Rights Commission, and
congressional opposition to granting Beijing the same permanent low-tariff
trading rights given other trade partners.

<P>
	   REESEDALE, Pa. (AP) -- Inspecting a hydropower dam 60 feet below the surface
of the Allegheny River was a routine job for Todd Washburn. But in the
underwater world of commercial diving, the unexpected always shadows the
familiar.
</P>
<P>
	   The 33-year-old Trenton, N.J., man, who had 18 months of experience as a
commercial diver, disappeared Jan. 13 while inspecting gates that control water
flow to the dam's generator.
</P>
<P>
	   Rescuers found his body five days later in 20 feet of water downstream from
the Piney Hydroelectric Station, about 40 miles northeast of Pittsburgh. His
funeral is planned for today in Trenton.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported commercial
divers are 40 times more likely to die or have a major accident than other
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a very hazardous industry,'' said Frances Stepp, president of the
National Association of Commercial Divers. ``There are easier ways to earn a
living.''
</P>
<P>
	   Washburn's air lines broke just after he signaled to his surface crew he was
ready to come up, fellow diver Jeff Pelkowski said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every time you get in the water there is an inherent danger, even if it's
just a survey or inspection,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The work of commercial divers includes heavy construction in dark, deep
waters and sometimes strong, cold currents. Divers weld, pour concrete, lay pipe
and inspect structures, all the while carrying 70 pounds or more of equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, 90 of the nation's 2,500 commercial divers were killed on the
job, Stepp said. She is investigating 30 other fatalities that might have
involved commercial diving accidents.
</P>
<P>
	   The job attracts young men with recreational or military diving experience.
Few continue past the age of 50, due to its physical demands.
</P>
<P>
	   Finding jobs is easy, said Ernie Barton, training director at the College of
Oceaneering in Wilmington, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would sense that 99 percent of our students have some idea of the
industry before they get here through their own research,'' he said. ``Schools
train the basics, and graduates hopefully go to work for a reputable diving
company with its own set of standards.''
</P>
<P>
	   Scuba diving is actually more dangerous than commercial diving because the
latter employs backup equipment and radio contact with a surface crew, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Stepp said the industry isn't well-regulated.
</P>
<P>
	   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which is investigating
Washburn's death, places commercial divers in a ``miscellaneous'' labor code,
which also includes home tax preparers and taxidermists.
</P>
<P>
	   The grouping hinders efforts to keep track of diver deaths and accidents,
Stepp said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Coast Guard is supposed to investigate the deaths of divers working
on ocean jobs, but divers often are lumped in with construction workers, further
complicating efforts to maintain accurate statistics, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   OSHA has safety regulations for divers, and the Coast Guard has a few rules.
But job standards are mostly left to diving outfits and the companies that hire
them, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pete Pilkington, a contractor from Bellevue, Wash., said his son died four
years ago after a compressor malfunctioned as he inspected an inactive oil well
off the coast of Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, he has campaigned against a lack of regulations in the industry.
His son's dive, he says, should have been canceled because backup divers and
equipment were not at the site.
</P>
<P>
	   The father and son were once recreational divers, and the elder Pilkington
said he never worried about his son's choice of profession.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Had I looked into it a little more seriously,'' he said, ``I probably
would have encouraged my son to do something else.''

<HEADLINE> Elian's grandmothers hope to reclaim him  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers spoke pointedly, and at
times tearfully, in asking the nation to let them take their grandson back to
Cuba.
<P>
	   "I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this tragedy that has
been so hard for us as a family and to ask you that our grandson can return as
soon as possible," Mariela Quintana, Elian's paternal grandmother, said in
Spanish on Friday after arriving at Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, the grandmothers were expected to travel to Washington, D.C., for an
afternoon meeting with Attorney General Janet Reno and Immigration and
Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner.
</P>
<P>
	   There, they planned to take another step toward reclaiming their 6-year-old
grandson, who remains with relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said that the grandmothers requested the meeting and that the
Clinton administration wants to hear what they have to say. Reno and the INS
have said Elian belongs with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, representatives for the grandmothers were unsure what time the
pair would head to the Justice Department in Washington. The weary women planned
a dinner and a night of rest following their flight from Havana and their
airport news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody has a right to make him an American citizen," Mrs. Quintana, the
paternal grandmother, said of Elian. "He was born in Cuba. He lived in Cuba. He
is a Cuban."
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, said through an
interpreter she felt a need to take Elian back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you want to help us ... I want that my daughter (Elian's dead mother)
will be in peace, and she will not be in peace until Elian is home," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Quintana also said that Elian, in telephone conversations with her and
with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, had expressed a desire to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The emotional appeal failed to impress Elian's relatives in Miami. Following
the grandmothers' televised news conference, the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, emerged from his house with Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban
American National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   "Elian saw the images of his grandmothers," Mas said. "He crossed in front
of the television set and continued playing in his room without spending more
than 10 seconds looking at the screen."
</P>
<P>
	   Both reiterated their request that the grandmothers visit Elian in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why don't they come to Miami to hug him and be together with him?" Mas
said. "Instead they're in New York, repeating the propaganda of the Castro
regime. We sincerely hope that they will stop this charade, that they will come
here and be with their grandson."
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers are being accompanied by a three-member U.S. church
delegation. Their grandson has been the subject of both a personal battle for
custody between family members and a political tug of war between the Castro
regime and expatriate Cubans.
</P>
<P>
	   In the airport at Havana, the two women kissed and embraced Elian's father
before boarding the plane without him. They left for New York after meeting over
24 hours with representatives of the National Council of Churches, which favors
the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear how long the grandmothers would stay in the
United States, although trip organizers said it would only be a few days and the
grandmothers' visas were good for two months.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was with his mother as she attempted to flee Cuba in a 17-foot power
boat two months ago. The mother and 10 other Cubans died when the boat capsized.
The boy was found floating on an inner tube 2 miles off Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's relatives in Miami argue he would have a better life in the United
States and have raised legal action to keep him. The boy's father wants him
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Backers of the trip reportedly opted for New York to avoid an emotional
scene in Miami, where anti-Castro protesters have demonstrated in favor of
keeping the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ordered Elian returned. But attorneys for the family in Florida
accused the INS of violating Elian's due process rights and asked a judge to
prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., is sponsoring legislation that
would allow Elian to have U.S. citizenship. The bill will be filed Monday and
could come up for a vote as soon as Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, the federal judge who was to hear the lawsuit by the boy's
Miami relatives withdrew from the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge James Lawrence King's son, Miami-Dade County Judge Lawrence B. King,
once hired Armando Gutierrez - a man now working as spokesman for the boy's
relatives in Miami - to help in his re-election bid. The federal judge also has
a daughter who is a federal prosecutor in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was reassigned to Judge William M. Hoeveler, who presided over the
trial of Manuel Noriega and declared the ex-Panamanian dictator a prisoner of
war.

<HEADLINE> Poll: Move S.C. Confederate Flag  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. (AP) -- Removing the Confederate flag from atop the Capitol
dome has the support of about half of South Carolina's residents, a new poll
shows.
</P>
<P>
	   Of those questioned, 52 percent favored moving the flag off the dome, 37
percent opposed a move and 11 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   When respondents were given three options -- keeping the flag flying, taking
it down or putting it elsewhere on Statehouse grounds -- 49 percent favored
moving it to a memorial and 21 percent said it should be removed altogether.
Only 25 percent wanted to keep it flying, and 5 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   The telephone poll of 623 registered voters was commissioned by The
(Charleston) Post and Courier and several South Carolina television stations. It
has a margin of error of 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   Mason Dixon Polling and Research Co. of Washington interviewed people on
Tuesday and Wednesday following a Martin Luther King Day rally Monday at the
Statehouse that drew about 48,000 people.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the poll clearly reflects what we've (NAACP) been saying all
along,'' said Dwight James, executive director of the South Carolina National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. ``More people have taken the
opportunity to stop and think about what it means to African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Jim Hodges is trying to negotiate a compromise, which could include
moving the flag to a memorial on Statehouse grounds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it reflects flag fatigue,'' Sen. Glenn McConnell, a Charleston
Republican and flag supporter, said of the poll results. ``I think people are
tired of hearing about it and are looking for a settlement.''
</P>
<P>
	   The banner was raised in 1962 during the civil rights movement and the Civil
War centennial. Opponents say it represents racism and slavery, while supporters
say it is an important emblem of the state's heritage.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll results showed that 51 percent of those questioned believed the
flag symbolizes Southern heritage and pride, down from 65 percent in a poll
taken in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Harvard To Close Institute  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A Harvard University institute recently tainted by
an investigation of alleged financial self-dealing by two staff members in
Russia is being shut down.
</P>
<P>
	   The projects run by the Harvard Institute for International Development will
be integrated into other Harvard schools, including the Kennedy School of
Government, the School of Public Health and the School of Education, the
university said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   A faculty task force had recommended shutting down the institute, which
provides policy advice, technical assistance, training and research. The panel
said the institute was too large.
</P>
<P>
	   The institute, with 159 employees, has 41 active projects in 11 countries,
studying such areas as the environment, economics, public finance, health,
education and social development.
</P>
<P>
	   The projects will continue to operate as they have been for the rest of the
academic year.
</P>
<P>
	   Harvey V. Fineberg, Harvard's provost, did not give a specific timetable for
the transition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The main purpose is to integrate these valuable international development
activities more closely with teaching and research at Harvard,'' Fineberg wrote
in a letter informing faculty of the closing.
</P>
<P>
	   Harvard denied the closing of the institute had anything to do with a
Justice Department investigation last year into allegations that two staffers
who took part in a federally funded program to establish capitalism in Russia
profited from stock investments there at the same time.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Harvard lawyer Jonathan Hay was investigated to determine whether he
profited from stock investments while working for the institute, which was paid
$43 million by the U.S. Agency for International Development to advise Russian
President Boris Yeltsin and his economists.
</P>
<P>
	   USAID's own investigation has concluded that Hay and colleague Andrew
Shleifer, an economics professor, gained influence over Russian capital markets
they were helping establish and had ``abused the trust of the United States
government by using personal relationships ... for private gain.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hay and Shleifer denied the allegations but were dismissed from their posts
at the institute.

<HEADLINE> Tough Week for Baltimore's Mayor  </HEADLINE>
   By SETH HETTENA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Mayor Martin O'Malley brought the governor to one of the
city's drug-infested neighborhoods to underscore his commitment to make a marked
dent in crime during his first six months in office.
</P>
<P>
	   But as they met with church leaders and residents Friday, an apparent
robbery victim collapsed in the entryway of a day-care center across town,
bleeding from a gunshot wound.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What's killing our young men is drugs and the violence that drugs breed on
every corner,'' O'Malley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Parris Glendening the meeting offering vague promises.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Malley had originally planned to lead the governor on a walking tour of
one of the city's open-air drug markets with hopes of winning some state
support, including money to treat the city's estimated 60,000 drug addicts. But
the tour was canceled because of subfreezing temperatures and the leaders met at
a church instead.
</P>
<P>
	   The mayor said it was imperative to create more positive options for
children, offer better drug treatment and improve law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not one or the other,'' he said. ``You've got to do all three
together.''
</P>
<P>
	   Baltimore, the nation's 14th largest city with 650,000 people, has a rate of
46 homicides per 100,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Malley's anti-crime platform won votes in November. But not much has
changed in the crime-weary town, where homicides have topped 300 each year for
the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Nineteen people were killed in the first 20 days of the year -- 10 in the
past week. Nearly 50 people were wounded by gunfire; Friday's shooting victim
was in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this week, federal officials charged a city police officer with
delivering cocaine shipments.

<P>
	   MISSOULA, Mont. (AP) -- Greg Anderson, whose interceptions and kick returns
sparked Montana's football teams during the mid-1970s, died Jan. 8 of a heart
attack. He was 46.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson, a defensive back, played four years for the Grizzlies. He was a
Little All-American in 1976 and all-Big Sky Conference for three years. He was
the league's most valuable player on defense in 1976, as a senior free safety.
</P>
<P>
	   He spent two seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs of the National Football
League, and one in Montreal with the Canadian Football League.
D. Brook Bartlett
</P>
<P>
	   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- U.S. District Judge D. Brook Bartlett, who
sentenced a former state attorney general to jail for corruption, has died of
cancer at the age of 62.
</P>
<P>
	   His wife, Karen Iverson, said the judge died at their home Friday afternoon.
He was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Bartlett, a Kansas City native, was appointed to the federal bench in 1981
by President Reagan and he became chief judge in 1995. He was a graduate of
Princeton University and earned his law degree from Stanford.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the many high-profile cases Bartlett handled on the bench was that of
William Webster, the former Missouri attorney general who was prosecuted for
corruption after his unsuccessful race for governor as the Republican nominee in
1992.
</P>
<P>
	   Webster pleaded guilty to conspiracy and to misapplying state resources in
his gubernatorial campaign. Bartlett sentenced Webster to the maximum two years
in prison, six months more than prosecutors recommended, refusing to give him
the credit Webster sought for accepting responsibility for his wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> Planet Hollywood Emerges From Ch. 11  </HEADLINE>
    By MIKE SCHNEIDER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- A federal judge has approved Planet Hollywood
International Inc.'s bankruptcy plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Founder Robert Earl will keep his job as the company's CEO under an order
that was signed Friday by U.S. District Chief Judge Joseph Farnan Jr. in
Wilmington, Del., where the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
	   The approval will allow Planet Hollywood to operate with court protection
while it restructures and sheds debt that it cannot repay, without totally
liquidating the business.
</P>
<P>
	   "For us, it means that we can get back to business as usual," Earl said.
</P>
<P>
	   The company will have 21 company-owned restaurants in the United States and
10 company-owned restaurants overseas.
</P>
<P>
	   Earl and several other major investors are injecting $30 million in new
capital into the company, which was started 8 1/2 years ago with actors
Sylvester Stallone, Demi Moore, Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger as
investors.
</P>
<P>
	   Planet Hollywood closed nine poorly performing restaurants throughout the
country just before declaring bankruptcy in October. It later closed one in
Holland.
</P>
<P>
	   Planet Hollywood is planning several new initiatives to jump-start the
company and next month plans to announce a new set of celebrity investors.
</P>
<P>
	   The new group hopefully will appeal to the youth market in their pitches to
buy Planet Hollywood clothing and memorabilia. He decline said Earl, who
wouldn't be more specific.

    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
support abortion rights, but Mrs. Clinton is suggesting she'd yell louder and
fight harder on the issue if elected to the Senate.
<P>
	   "I would want New Yorkers to know that I wouldn't only vote right, but I

decision legalizing abortion.

	   Mrs. Clinton did not mention the name of the mayor, her likely Senate race
opponent.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani, who has spoken in the past at the annual NARAL event, was invited
this year but did not attend, NARAL director Kelli Conlin said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The mayor's position on choice is well known, and it has not changed," said
Kim Serafin, a spokeswoman for Giuliani's likely Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton may have trouble winning votes on the issue, since she and
Giuliani are both strong supporters of abortion rights.
</P>
<P>
	   During 1998's Senate race, abortion rights advocates were galvanized by the
murder shortly before the election of Dr. Bernard Slepian, a Buffalo doctor who
performed abortions. Charles Schumer, a Democratic supporter of abortion rights,
defeated anti-abortion Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato in an extremely close
election, largely on the strength of his 3-to-2 ratio advantage among female
voters.
</P>
<P>
	   This year, with two candidates who support abortion rights, the issue may be
less prominent. Although Mrs. Clinton was received warmly by NARAL leaders at
the Harvard Club lunch, the group did not endorse her.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a celebration of Roe vs. Wade, that's what this is all about,"
Conlin said when asked if NARAL were supporting Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Today is the 27th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision legalizing
abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Conlin said it was too early to say whether NARAL would make an endorsement
in the Senate race. If the group is satisfied with both candidates' support for
abortion rights, it may remain neutral, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani has been under pressure from Conservative Party Chairman Michael
Long to support a ban on late-term abortions but so far has refused to drop his
opposition to such a ban. No Republican has won a statewide race in New York in
25 years without Conservative Party backing.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have to give a lot of credit to the mayor, because he's stood up to
Michael Long and he's really defended the principles," Conlin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton said that with the U.S. Supreme Court preparing to hear
arguments on the late-term procedure opponents call "partial-birth abortion,"
the Senate's role in safeguarding abortion rights will be increasingly
important.
</P>
<P>
	   "For women, the Senate will be our court of last resort," she said. "It will
not be enough for any senator simply to cast the right vote and sit down.
Because this is going to be a struggle that will be particularly difficult if we
do not, for reasons that I hope will not come to pass, hold the White House."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked after the lunch about her feelings when a radio interviewer inquired
several days ago whether she had been faithful to her husband, Mrs. Clinton said
she was not bothered and would not let such questions distract her.
</P>
<P>
	   "I knew that when I entered this race that there would be people who might
ask inappropriate questions, but that's not going to deter me," she said. "None
of that concerns me in the least, because I think there's a lot at stake in this
election."

<HEADLINE> Bank Chiefs Gather for G7 Meeting  </HEADLINE>
    By ERIC TALMADGE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- While expressing optimism in the growth of the world's major
economies, finance ministers and central bank governors from leading industrial
nations said today they shared Japan's concern for an overly strong yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The Group of Seven finance officials were meeting in Tokyo to discuss global
economic issues, including the strength of the yen, as well as Japan's efforts
to keep its economy growing.
</P>
<P>
	   In a final statement issued after the one-day meeting, they said it was
unclear whether Japan's growth would continue.
</P>
<P>
	   "Japan's economy has shown some encouraging signs of recovery, although a
sustained recovery remains to be established," the final statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Measures to further strengthen the financial system and structural reforms
will continue to be important."
</P>
<P>
	   Japan has been struggling to get out of its worst economic downturn since
World War II. Though officials say a recovery appears finally to be under way,
they are concerned the strong yen might smother that recovery by hurting
Japanese exporters competing on world markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The yen has risen 10 percent against the U.S. dollar over the past year, to
about 105 yen to one dollar. A stronger currency makes a country's products more
expensive abroad.
</P>
<P>
	   The G7 officials -- from the United States, Japan, Canada, Britain, Germany,
Italy and France, along with honorary member Russia -- said they shared Japan's
concerns about the "potential impact of yen appreciation for the Japanese
economy and the world economy."
</P>
<P>
	   The statement was similar to what some market watchers had expected, and
also close to what the G7 agreed in September, when the Japanese currency was
valued at about 104 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   "The situation has stayed the same, so the same thing has been reaffirmed,"
Japan's Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said about the statement's wording.
</P>
<P>
	   Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami, who also attended the G7 meeting, said his
central bank intended to continue its current zero-interest rate policy until
fears of deflation were gone.
</P>
<P>
	   But the G7 statement indicated that Japan must work harder on structural
reforms, and urged Tokyo to continue efforts to restructure its financial system
-- an apparent jab at the government's decision to delay by one year the
abolition of blanket guarantees on deposits held at banks that fail.
</P>
<P>
	   "As part of a stimulus agenda, an acceleration of structural reform is
particularly important," U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bowing to political pressure, Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's administration
decided in late December to maintain full guarantees on banking deposits until
March 31, 2002. The government had been scheduled to abolish full guarantees
from April 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   On other fronts, the statement said the G7 was encouraged by Asia's "earlier
and stronger than expected" recovery from its economic crisis, and by signs of
improved economic conditions in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   Regarding the economic situations in other member nations, the leaders
agreed that the goal for the United States and Canada would be to set policies
to preserve growth and low unemployment and inflation rates.
</P>
<P>
	   It noted that the economy in Britain was also increasingly strong, with a
robust labor market.
</P>
<P>
	   The leaders welcomed "favorable developments" in some areas of the Russian
economy, but said Russian leaders should work toward more transparency,
institutional reform and budgetary and fiscal accountability. They also urged
Russia to combat corruption and money-laundering.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual G7 summit will be held this July in Okinawa, Japan.

<HEADLINE> No Injuries at Ohio Dormitory Fire  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIFFIN, Ohio (AP) -- Dozens of students at Heidelberg College were evacuated
from their three-story dormitory after a fire broke out in the building's top
floor early today.
</P>
<P>
	   The fire was confined to the top floor and no injuries were reported, said
college spokesman Jamie Abel.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the dormitory, Williard Hall, is home to 70 students but he did not
know how many were in the building when the fire broke out around 4 a.m.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the fire has not been determined and there is no estimate of
damages, Abel said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dormitory was built in 1907 and had major renovations in 1993 that
included alarms and a sprinkler system, Abel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Two buildings adjacent to Williard were evacuated as a precaution, he said.
One building is a dorm that shares a hallway with Williard, the other is a
former private residence owned by the college.
</P>
<P>
	   Heidelberg, a private college affiliated with the United Church of Christ,
has 1,200 students and is located in Tiffin, about 40 miles southeast of Toledo
in northwestern Ohio.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Targets Medicare Fraud  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton said today he wants to send a ``fraud
fighter'' to the office of every Medicare contractor in the country in a new
campaign to crack down on billions of dollars in false claims.
</P>
<P>
	   In his weekly radio address, Clinton asked Congress to approve the $43
million cost of the initiative as part of the federal budget for fiscal 2001. He
said it is needed to stop a raid on the Treasury that persists despite what he
called aggressive detection, enforcement and prosecution efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   The president flew to Los Angeles on Friday and announced in a speech at the
California Institute of Technology in Pasadena that he will seek to raise the
federal annual investment in basic scientific and technological research by
nearly $2.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   White House officials said medical and computer research is popular on
Capitol Hill, and they predicted the proposal will win bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton included a political component in his California trip, speaking at a
pair of fund-raisers expected to raise $600,000 for the Democratic National
Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   In the radio address, which he pre-recorded here, the president took credit
for persistent efforts to stem fraud and abuse in the Medicare health care
program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All told, our efforts have prevented the wasteful spending of an estimated
$50 billion, he said. ``Aggressive enforcement has recovered nearly $1.6 billion
for the Medicare trust fund.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mass fraud continues, however, Clinton said. ``Though our efforts are
stronger than ever, Medicare contractors still pay false claims totaling in the
billions; this is simply unacceptable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A White House statement said ``too many contractors do not protect the
program as they are required to.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton initiative would establish a team of more than 100 financial
management specialists working in the offices of every Medicare contractor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These 'fraud fighters' will ensure a swift and coordinated response to
suspected instances of fraud,'' the White House said. The program also will
develop computer systems to track payments and intervene to prevent claims
processors and auditors from abusing the program, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Medicare is vital to the health of our nation,'' Clinton said. ``It's too
important to be compromised. If we take these steps to reform and strengthen
Medicare, and if we modernize it with a voluntary prescription drug benefit,
then we will adapt a program that has worked in the past to the needs of the
future.''

<HEADLINE> Elian's grandmothers hope to reclaim him  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - One day after making a national appeal for the return of
their 6-year-old grandson, the grandmothers of Elian Gonzalez were headed to
Washington this morning to meet with Attorney General Janet Reno.
<P>
	   The two women, who flew in from Cuba on Friday, left a Manhattan apartment
house without speaking to reporters. Flanked by police, they climbed into a car
for the trip to Kennedy International Airport and a flight south.
</P>
<P>
	   They were expected to hold an afternoon meeting with Reno and Immigration
and Naturalization Service Commissioner Doris Meissner. There, they hoped to
take another step toward reclaiming their 6-year-old grandson, who remains with
relatives in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said that the grandmothers requested the meeting and that the
Clinton administration wants to hear what they have to say. Reno and the INS
have said Elian belongs with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the pair spoke pointedly, and at times tearfully, in asking the
nation to let them take their grandson back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this tragedy that has
been so hard for us as a family and to ask you that our grandson can return as
soon as possible," Mariela Quintana, Elian's paternal grandmother, said in
Spanish on Friday after arriving at Kennedy International Airport.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nobody has a right to make him an American citizen," Mrs. Quintana, the
paternal grandmother, said of Elian. "He was born in Cuba. He lived in Cuba. He
is a Cuban."
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's maternal grandmother, Raquel Rodriguez, said through an
interpreter she felt a need to take Elian back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you want to help us ... I want that my daughter (Elian's dead mother)
will be in peace, and she will not be in peace until Elian is home," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Quintana also said that Elian, in telephone conversations with her and
with his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, had expressed a desire to return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The emotional appeal failed to impress Elian's relatives in Miami. Following
the grandmothers' televised news conference, the boy's great-uncle, Lazaro
Gonzalez, emerged from his house with Jorge Mas Santos, chairman of the Cuban
American National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
	   "Elian saw the images of his grandmothers," Mas said. "He crossed in front
of the television set and continued playing in his room without spending more
than 10 seconds looking at the screen."
</P>
<P>
	   Both reiterated their request that the grandmothers visit Elian in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why don't they come to Miami to hug him and be together with him?" Mas
said. "Instead they're in New York, repeating the propaganda of the Castro
regime. We sincerely hope that they will stop this charade, that they will come
here and be with their grandson."
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers are being accompanied by a three-member U.S. church
delegation. Their grandson has been the subject of both a personal battle for
custody between family members and a political tug of war between the Castro
regime and expatriate Cubans.
</P>
<P>
	   In the airport at Havana, the two women kissed and embraced Elian's father
before boarding the plane without him. They left for New York after meeting over
24 hours with representatives of the National Council of Churches, which favors
the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear how long the grandmothers would stay in the
United States, although trip organizers said it would only be a few days and the
grandmothers' visas were good for two months.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy was with his mother as she attempted to flee Cuba in a 17-foot power
boat two months ago. The mother and 10 other Cubans died when the boat capsized.
The boy was found floating on an inner tube 2 miles off Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy's relatives in Miami argue he would have a better life in the United
States and have raised legal action to keep him. The boy's father wants him
returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Backers of the trip reportedly opted for New York to avoid an emotional
scene in Miami, where anti-Castro protesters have demonstrated in favor of
keeping the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ordered Elian returned. But attorneys for the family in Florida
accused the INS of violating Elian's due process rights and asked a judge to
prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., is sponsoring legislation that
would allow Elian to have U.S. citizenship. The bill will be filed Monday and
could come up for a vote as soon as Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, the federal judge who was to hear the lawsuit by the boy's
Miami relatives withdrew from the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Judge James Lawrence King's son, Miami-Dade County Judge Lawrence B. King,
once hired Armando Gutierrez - a man now working as spokesman for the boy's
relatives in Miami - to help in his re-election bid. The federal judge also has
a daughter who is a federal prosecutor in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   The case was reassigned to Judge William M. Hoeveler, who presided over the
trial of Manuel Noriega and declared the ex-Panamanian dictator a prisoner of
war.

<HEADLINE> G-7 Economies Seek Better Balance  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSEPH COLEMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKYO (AP) -- The U.S. economy is booming, but Japan is still in the
doldrums. Britain is recovering, but other European countries face stubbornly
high unemployment.
</P>
<P>
	   The world's major industrial powers lauded the overall strength of the world
economy at a meeting in Tokyo on Saturday, but pushed to spread that expansion
more evenly.
</P>
<P>
	   "The challenge remains to secure a more balanced pattern of growth among our
economies," finance ministers and central bank governors from the Group of Seven
nations said in a joint communique.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States, which has the most robust economy in the G7, has been
especially vocal in urging other members to carry out structural reforms that
would open the door to greater expansion.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers has argued that with Asia
recovering from a financial crisis and the Japanese and European economies also
emerging from slowdowns, it is now time for countries other than the United
States to be an engine for global economic growth.
</P>
<P>
	   The other G7 members agree with this idea, Summers said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was a general awareness of the importance ... of working to achieve
greater and more balanced growth in our economies," he told reporters after the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   For Japan, the group's statement said, that means further measures to
strengthen its financial system and deregulate the economy. For Europe, the
group called for expanded investment opportunities. Even the United States was
urged to increase national saving.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the call for stronger growth in some countries, the group's
statement overall was positive about the state of the global economy -- and
confident that goals can be met.
</P>
<P>
	   "We fully expect Europe to play its part," said Gordon Brown, British
chancellor of the exchequer. "And we look forward to the encouraging signs of
recovery being shown in Japan."
</P>
<P>
	   Japan was a major focus of the group's discussions on Saturday. G7 nations
said it was still unclear whether that country's recent emergence from a severe
downturn would be lasting.
</P>
<P>
	   Though officials say a recovery appears to be finally under way, many in
Japan are concerned that a strong yen might smother it by hurting Japanese
exporters. The yen has risen 10 percent over the last year to around 105 yen
against the dollar, and Tokyo has been pushing hard to get the G7 to voice
strong support for a weaker yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The final communique said the group shares Japan's concerns about the
potential impact of yen appreciation on Japan and the world economy, but did not
commit to any active intervention to push down the value of the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   "The situation has stayed the same, so the same thing has been reaffirmed,"
Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said about the wording of the communique.
</P>
<P>
	   Bank of Japan Gov. Masaru Hayami, who also attended the G7 meeting, said his
central bank intends to continue its current zero-interest rate policy until
fears of deflation are gone. This was heralded by other members as a sign Japan
is intent on achieving economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   On other fronts, the communique said the group was encouraged by Asia's
"earlier and stronger than expected" recovery from its economic crisis and signs
of improved economic conditions in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   The leaders also welcomed "favorable developments" in some areas of the
Russian economy, but urged Russian leaders to work toward more transparency,
budgetary and fiscal accountability, institutional reform as well as to combat
corruption and money-laundering.
</P>
<P>
	   The G7 is made up of the United States, Japan, Canada, England, Germany,
Italy and France. Russia attends as an honorary observer. The annual G7 summit
will be held this July in Okinawa, Japan.

<HEADLINE> Voters Say Character Issues Matter  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOONE, Iowa (AP) -- The economy is sizzling, and the Cold War has thawed. So
what are voters looking for in a president this year?
</P>
<P>
	   It's their character, stupid.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The lack of an overwhelming issue has made personality and character
traits a more important part of the campaign,'' said Republican pollster Ed
Goeas of Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   Recognizing the change in voter attitudes since 1992, presidential
candidates this year are defining their character with policies and promises.
``I pledge to uphold the dignity of the office,'' Republican national
front-runner George W. Bush says at every stop, his right hand raised in the
air.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, the leading Democratic candidate who is trying to
emerge from President Clinton's scandal-tinged shadow, says of his boss'
involvement with a White House intern: ``I wouldn't have done that.''
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews with more than two dozen voters in Iowa and New Hampshire suggest
the phenomenon cuts across party lines, though Republicans and Democrats are
looking for slightly different qualities in the next president.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP voters cite integrity, honesty and even fidelity as key ingredients.
Democrats mentioned the same characteristics in unusually high numbers, but seem
more inclined to want experienced leadership.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters in both parties say Clinton's impeachment embarrassed the nation and
is a major reason for their anxiety about who will occupy the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel Clinton betrayed my trust,'' said one Democrat, Cynthia Onigman,
74, of Manchester, N.H.. ``That's something I don't think we'd have to worry
about with Bill Bradley,'' Gore's sole rival.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Fank's sigh left a trail of white vapor in the frigid Iowa air. ``I
just want a president who won't lie to me,'' the Republican said as snow piled
atop his box of bakery-fresh donuts. ``Is that too much to ask?''
</P>
<P>
	   This may be the legacy of the two-term president whose 1992 campaign tapped
the fears of recession-weary Americans, particularly in New Hampshire. ``It's
the economy, stupid,'' read the sign posted in Clinton's Arkansas headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls from that election showed honesty far down the list of values
that mattered most when people picked a president; at the top was ``bringing
change.''
</P>
<P>
	   When things changed and the economy soared -- when New Hampshire's high-tech
industry replaced struggling textile mills as the symbol of that state's economy
-- the public's emphasis on values shifted, too.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996 exit polls, honesty was tops along with ``shares my view of
government'' in personal qualities that mattered most when choosing a president.
</P>
<P>
	   A year after Clinton's trial, a Los Angeles Times poll shows that nearly
three-quarters of Iowa caucus-goers say they were supporting their candidate
because of a personal trait rather than his stance on issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Honesty and integrity are it for me,'' said Barbara Lund of Polk City,
Iowa. ``Health care and all that is important, but nothing they promise means
much if they're lying about it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Susan Henning of Boone, Iowa, watched through a storefront window as Steve
Forbes boarded his well-appointed campaign bus. She only wanted to know one
thing about the GOP candidate: ``Is he faithful?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you're not faithful in your marriage, you won't be faithful to the
people,'' she reasoned.
</P>
<P>
	   Sallie Klum, 65, a Republican from Hollis, N.H., does not know who she wants
to be president but she knows what she wants. ``I think when you give someone
the right to provide the leadership for your country, for your future and the
future of your children and grandchildren, that's a huge gift of trust,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Honesty and integrity are important to Bob Connett, but the Democrat said he
is ``mainly looking for somebody who has the ability and knows how to run this
country.''
</P>
<P>
	   Greg Lewis, who had been shooting the breeze with Connett at a Des Moines
union hall, said the next president ``needs to keep things on track.''
</P>
<P>
	   Both backers of Gore, their sentiments reflect polls that show the vice
president is a rare candidate whose supporters don't cite character issues as
their No. 1 attraction. ``Morality/Integrity/Honesty'' ranked third, well behind
his experience and education policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats as a whole were only slightly less likely than Republicans to cite
a character trait as the reason for choosing their candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP pollster John McLaughlin said policy issues still are important in the
2000 election, especially when candidates use them to highlight character
traits.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush pledges to cut taxes for low-income Americans, then calls himself a
``compassionate'' conservative.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes accuses Bush of breaking his no-tax pledge as Texas governor, an
obvious attempt to raise doubts about Bush's integrity.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley says his campaign ``has been one of respect for people.'' And he
will not let polls guide his actions, Gore's rival says, because that would be
dishonorable.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore did not just question the math behind Bradley's health care plan, he
suggested he was out to hurt minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   One Republican even slapped a character trait on the side of his campaign
bus: The ``Straight Talk Express'' rolls through New Hampshire and South
Carolina with Arizona Sen. John McCain aboard.

<HEADLINE> Congress Eyes Election-Year Action  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The popular wisdom is that Congress does not accomplish
much in an election year. But in 2000, with the parties trying to win voters'
doubting hearts, prospects are good for some legislative successes.
</P>
<P>
	   While almost no one expects action on the bigger issues of the day --
reforming the Social Security and Medicare systems and fixing campaign finance
rules -- momentum is there to pass a range of important farm, education, health
and high-tech bills.
</P>
<P>
	   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, says the focus when Congress
returns Monday will be tax relief, trade and technology.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans, who saw their big tax package vetoed by President Clinton last
year, have shifted to smaller, more targeted bills. One of the first is intended
to help married couples who pay more taxes when they file jointly because both
have jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House has offered its own tax proposals, including a $21 billion
expansion in tax credits for the working poor. Clinton and House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., have come together on a tax plan to spur investment in the
nation's neediest communities.
</P>
<P>
	   The big trade vote, expected this summer, deals with giving China permanent
normal trade status as part of China's entry in the World Trade Organization.
The debate should be noisy, but if Clinton can win enough support from his own
Democratic Party, ``We will prevail in Congress,'' said Rep. David Dreier,
R-Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   Chances for compromise also are good on legislation, passed by both the
House and Senate last year, to expand trade with sub-Saharan Africa. The Senate
combined its Africa bill with another that would ease restrictions on trade with
Caribbean nations.
</P>
<P>
	   In the technology area, the two chambers are close on bills to give legal
validity to electronic signatures used in e-commerce. There also is broad
support for legislation to extend a moratorium on new taxes on Internet
transactions. The Senate last year passed a bill to ban Internet gambling; the
House is likely to follow suit.
</P>
<P>
	   The Democratic minority will be on the offensive in pushing for passage of a
patients' bill of rights, gun controls, prescription drug benefits for Medicare
beneficiaries and a rise in the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
	   The patients' bill of right, hung up on the issue of whether patients should
have the ability to sue their managed care providers, and gun controls both were
stuck in House-Senate conferences at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This year legislatively you should expect to see HMO reform, you should
expect to see prescription drugs completed for our Medicare patients,'' Armey
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This needs to be a year of action, not a year of stalemate,'' said the
House's top Democrat, Rep. Dick Gephardt of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
	   But with Democrats given a real shot of winning back the House the
Republicans captured in 1994, there also could be some reluctance to passing
bills that make the GOP majority look good.
</P>
<P>
	   A productive year helps only the Clinton legacy and the Republican Congress,
said University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato, an expert on Congress.
``Democrats will be under pressure to do exactly one thing -- nothing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans, on the other hand, will be eager to showcase successes if the
presidential race is close and they discover that the coattails of expected GOP
candidate Texas Gov. George W. Bush are short.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They'd have to do something big,'' Sabato said, and prescription drugs is
one bill ``ideally suited to the needs of a party desperate to make an impact in
the last minute.''
</P>
<P>
	   Among other measures with a good chance of passage this year:
</P>
<P>
	   --The House and Senate are under pressure to resolve differences on a
four-year, $50 billion bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration
and finance airport safety and construction.
</P>
<P>
	   --On education, the White House wants money to hire new teachers and rebuild
crumbling schools, while Republicans support vouchers and greater local control.
Congress must reauthorize the 1965 Elementary and Secondary Education Act, and
some compromise may be in the works.
</P>
<P>
	   --The Judiciary committees are working on several bills. One imposing
federal regulation of ``date rape'' drugs is close to passage. Others include
resolution of asbestos claims, a bill protecting religious expression and a
proposed victims' rights amendment to the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
	   --Farm state legislators are pressing for changes in the 1996 Freedom to
Farm Act they say has left farmers vulnerable to crop price drops. That may be
difficult, but farmers could see a cut in premiums they pay for federally
subsidized crop insurance and another big bailout if prices remain low.
</P>
<P>
	   --Action is expected on a House-passed bill funding programs to help men
from low-income families become better fathers and earners. The Senate will
consider a House bill giving the Customs Service more money to fight drug
trafficking and online child pornography.

<HEADLINE> Some Incumbents Face No Resistance  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID ESPO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The battle for control of the House promises to be fierce
this year -- but not for everyone.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, 12 Democrats are without GOP opponents in states where the candidate
filing deadline has passed. Six Republicans are similarly blessed.
</P>
<P>
	   The GOP chose not to contest several black and Hispanic lawmakers, including
Reps. Jesse Jackson Jr. of Illinois, Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio, Matthew
Martinez of California, and four Texans -- Ruben Hinojosa, Eddie Bernice
Johnson, Charlie Gonzalez and Ciro Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
	   Three of the six Republicans without Democratic opposition are from Texas --
Reps. Joe Barton, Larry Combest and Kevin Brady.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of these lawmakers face primary or minor party opposition, including
Martinez, who faces a challenge from a Democratic state senator.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans command a 222-212 majority in the current House, with one
Democrat-leaning independent. A switch of five seats would deliver control to
the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Both parties have a list of target seats, but there is a tacit
acknowledgment that dozens if not hundreds of districts are safe for incumbents.
</P>
<P>
	   The situation may well change in 2002, after reapportionment leads to a
redrawing of congressional district lines around the country.
</P>
<P>
	   But for now, says Democratic campaign committee spokesman Erik Smith, ``The
battle for the House will be fought on a much smaller field than previous years.
The fight will certainly be just as lively.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jill Schroeder, Smith's counterpart at the GOP campaign committee, said,
``What this shows is that Americans approve of the job Congress is doing. There
is a 65 percent approval rating'' for many incumbents, she said, and ``because
of that it's tough to find candidates sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   When conservative Democratic Rep. Virgil Goode of Virginia was elected to
Congress three years ago, his party breathed a sigh of relief that he had kept
the seat from falling into Republican hands.
</P>
<P>
	   Not so fast.
</P>
<P>
	   Goode has been flirting openly in recent weeks with a switch in allegiance,
possibly to become an independent, possibly a Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   He and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt talked by phone in recent days,
and Democrats express pessimism that the Virginian will side with them in the
most politically important vote of all -- the one to elect a speaker when the
107th Congress convenes in 2001 after this fall's elections.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, Republicans have expressed optimism that Goode is moving away
from the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Goode said this week he had no announcement to make.
</P>
<P>
	   Party switches, while rare, have become more frequent since the Republicans
gained control of the House in the 1994 elections. The most recent change came
last summer, when GOP Rep. Michael Forbes of New York became a Democrat. Five
Democratic lawmakers switched to the GOP in recent years.
</P>
<P>
	   The House has one independent, Rep. Bernard Sanders of Vermont, who is
closely aligned with the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   House Republicans are making plans for an early vote this year on
legislation to ban certain late-term abortions. The Senate passed a ``partial
birth'' abortion measure last year, but the House deferred action.
</P>
<P>
	   Passage is assured in the House, since the measure has cleared Congress
twice before, and been vetoed twice before by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   This year there is a difference.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court agreed recently to hear arguments on a Nebraska law that
made it a crime for doctors to perform such abortions. A ruling would ordinarily
be expected this summer, and it is possible Republicans will hold off sending
legislation to the White House until after the court speaks.

<HEADLINE> Candidates' Personal Likes, Dislikes  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   By now, most voters are familiar with the presidential candidates' positions
on issues ranging from foreign policy to taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   But do voters know what kinds of bad habits the candidates admit to, or
their favorite junk foods? With that in mind, The Associated Press asked each

<HEADLINE> Letters: Ellison Agonized Over Epic  </HEADLINE>
   By HILLEL ITALIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- To the public, Ralph Ellison's classic novel is known
simply as ``Invisible Man.'' In private, as he agonized over the manuscript, the
author dreamed up more colorful nicknames: ``My endless you-know-what,'' ``my
six hundred page obsession'' and ``the goddamnedest experience of my life.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ellison took seven years to complete ``Invisible Man,'' an epic narrative on
race and identity published to great acclaim in 1952 and still widely read
today. When he needed to confess a worry, share a joke or work out an idea, he
often wrote to his friend Albert Murray, an influential novelist and critic.
</P>
<P>
	   Their correspondence is compiled in ``Trading Twelves,'' to be published in
June by the Modern Library.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The letters between Ellison and Murray are the bounty of a rare and
spontaneous friendship in which each taps into the deepest experience of the
other,'' Ellison's literary executor, John F. Callahan, writes in the
introduction.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Trading Twelves,'' which covers the years 1949-60, includes exchanges on
literature, music (Murray was a friend of Duke Ellington and other jazz
performers) and politics. It's also a record of two idealists determined to
expand and enrich the perceptions of black people.
</P>
<P>
	   Ellison writes of William Faulkner, an author he otherwise admired: ``He
thinks that Negroes exist simply to give ironic overtone to the viciousness of
white folks.''
</P>
<P>
	   ''(W)e're trying ... to free ourselves; thoroughly and completely, so that
when we got the crackers off our back we can discover what we really are and
what we really wish to preserve out of the experience that made us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ellison and Murray met in the mid 1930s as students at the Tuskegee
Institute in Alabama. They became friends and intellectual comrades, united in
their crusade to celebrate the sophistication of jazz and black folklore.
Ellison died in 1994. Murray, now 83, is a longtime resident of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
	   The letters begin with Ellison and Murray working on their first novels.
Ellison writes hopefully that both will have books out in 1950. But Murray
didn't publish a novel until the 1970s. Ellison didn't wrap up ``Invisible Man''
until 1952 and spent the rest of his life working on his next novel, edited
posthumously by Callahan and published last year as ``Juneteenth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Impatient to finish a book he's sure will make history, Ellison makes poetry
just out of describing ``Invisible Man.'' It's ``my endless you-know-what,'' the
``switch-bladed confession'' and ``my six hundred page monster.'' He wonders if
``it's a rock around my neck; a dream, a nasty compulsive dream which I no
longer write but now am acting out, or is it a kind of death a dying?
</P>
<P>
	   ``Certainly,'' he writes, ``after it's all over and done up in binders I
will have passed through the goddamnedest experience of my life and shall never
be the same.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ellison was as immodest as he was insecure. He likens himself to a
``self-doubting god'' unsure of the world he's created. He likens the multiple
voices and styles of ``Invisible Man'' to a jazz jam, imagining his characters
as members of the Ellington orchestra, with Ellison standing in for the maestro
himself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Boy, I really think I got me some soloists in there near about as good as
old Cootie and Rex and Johnny and Ben Webster and Harry Carney,'' he writes,
``but you also got to have a pianist-arranger like old Duke to make them cats
really blow, and naturally THAT'S got me worried.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ellison fussed over transitions. His publisher, Random House, heeded the
censors. The original manuscript for ``Invisible Man'' contained explicit
passages that never made it to print. One involved a most unorthodox application
of sour cream.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was too ripe for 'em man,'' an amused Ellison reported. ``They called
me and said, 'Mr. E, that sour cream just naturally has to go.'''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Invisible Man'' won the National Book Award and stayed on bestseller lists
for months, but the letters show both writers impatient for the next novel. In
1953, Ellison complains that his new book has proved as much a strain as putting
on ``my first pair of long pants.'' Murray sounds like a manager pushing his
star back on stage for an encore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Get with it, Jasper,'' he writes, ``they ain't seen nothing yet -- ain't
heard nothing yet. Remember, you're the goddamned trumpet player, and you
already got 'em clapping their hands and patting their feet.''

<HEADLINE> With AM-NJ--College Dorm Fire, Bjt  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - A familiar debate began to take shape in the
days following the fire that killed three students in Seton Hall University's
freshman dormitory.
<P>
	   Students blamed the university for not teaching them how to fight
Wednesday's fire in Boland Hall, saying they had no fire drills and learned
little about fire safety from their resident assistants.
</P>
<P>
	   "They don't even wake us up when the alarm goes off," said Bobb Barber, 19,
of Millville.
</P>
<P>
	   The university responded by releasing pages from its student manual on fire
preparedness. "There were fire education programs," spokeswoman Lisa Grider
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But college students weren't listening, say campus safety experts and others
who have struggled to get students' attention at their own universities.
</P>
<P>
	   "Experience tells me that 18- to 24-year-olds have a sense of immortality,"
says Dan Jones, chief of Chapel Hill, N.C.'s fire department. "You're just not
going to get them to pay close attention to safety lessons."
</P>
<P>
	   Joseph Zuccarella, chief of university emergency services at Rutgers
University, gave an account of fire safety problems at Rutgers dorms that
closely resembles the situation described by Seton Hall students.
</P>
<P>
	   He cited more than 100 false fire alarms last year, mostly in three freshman
dormitories, and described students who don't leave the building during fire
drills, who smoke in their bedrooms and keep banned cooking appliances and
candles.
</P>
<P>
	   When Rutgers cites a student for a fire violation, "I receive more
complaints from the parents that we cited the child," Zuccarella said.
</P>
<P>
	   College students, newly free from rules at home, tend to keep odd hours,
demanding schedules and experiment with alcohol or drugs, Jones said. That makes
them among the least likely to respond to traditional fire drills and more
likely to pull prank alarms, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're away from mom and dad. They're away from that level of control,"
Zuccarella said. "It just seems to be something to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Rutgers conducts two fire drills a year, inspects every room once a year for
fire violations and provides fire safety training at floor meetings, Zuccarella
said. But students still have to be dragged out for fire drills and pull false
alarms, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   At Princeton University, undergraduates get fire education booklets, two
seminars a year, four inspections and two fire drills, but spokesman Justin
Harmon said the school has the same problem getting students to listen and
comply.
</P>
<P>
	   "They get it handed it to them. They hear it twice a year in these
meetings," Harmon said. "But you know, ... an alarm goes off and some kid is in
the middle of writing a paper and he doesn't want to be bothered because he's
sure it's somebody's toaster."
</P>
<P>
	   Seton Hall officials acknowledged this week they had not conducted organized
fire drills last semester for Boland Hall residents because of the practice they
were getting from the 18 alarms that rang since September, all but one false.
</P>
<P>
	   But the university said it stressed fire education in floor meetings with
resident assistants and its student manual. It put up posters offering rewards
for information on pranksters who might be pulling alarms.
</P>
<P>
	   Many students said they waited to escape Wednesday's fire because they were
used to false alarms and thought it was another one. Among the 62 injured was a
boy who jumped out a window and broke his ankle, and six burn victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones believes the only way to keep college students safe from fires is to
install sprinklers in university housing. He has led a national campaign to do
so since a 1996 fraternity fire at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill
killed five people.
</P>
<P>
	   "You have to protect them where they are," Jones said. "We can't count on
them evacuating."
</P>
<P>
	   He said that last fall, there were several arsons in one dormitory where
someone was setting couches on fire. Students didn't evacuate for that true
alarm, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Boland Hall was one of two Seton Hall dormitories that are not equipped with
sprinklers, because they were built before the law required it. Grider has said
the university will consider installing them and Gov. Christie Whitman has said
she would likely endorse legislation requiring sprinklers at all state college
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
	   Four of Seton Hall's six dormitories were equipped with sprinklers, a
statistic Jones says is likely higher than average for the nation. A majority of
Rutgers and Princeton dormitories do not have sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
	   "What about the other states that haven't had a tragedy yet? Are they
waiting for the tragedy?" Jones said.

<HEADLINE> It's character, not the economy, behind voter choices in 2000  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BOONE, Iowa (AP) - The economy is sizzling, and the Cold War has thawed.
So what are voters looking for in a president this year?
<P>
	   It's their character, stupid.
</P>
<P>
	   "The lack of an overwhelming issue has made personality and character traits
a more important part of the campaign," said Republican pollster Ed Goeas of
Alexandria, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   Recognizing the change in voter attitudes since 1992, presidential
candidates this year are defining their character with policies and promises. "I
pledge to uphold the dignity of the office," Republican national front-runner
George W. Bush says at every stop, his right hand raised in the air.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore, the leading Democratic candidate who is trying to
emerge from President Clinton's scandal-tinged shadow, says of his boss'
involvement with a White House intern: "I wouldn't have done that."
</P>
<P>
	   Interviews with more than two dozen voters in Iowa and New Hampshire suggest
the phenomenon cuts across party lines, though Republicans and Democrats are
looking for slightly different qualities in the next president.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP voters cite integrity, honesty and even fidelity as key ingredients.
Democrats mentioned the same characteristics in unusually high numbers, but seem
more inclined to want experienced leadership.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters in both parties say Clinton's impeachment embarrassed the nation and
is a major reason for their anxiety about who will occupy the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel Clinton betrayed my trust," said one Democrat, Cynthia Onigman, 74,
of Manchester, N.H.. "That's something I don't think we'd have to worry about
with Bill Bradley," Gore's sole rival.
</P>
<P>
	   Mike Fank's sigh left a trail of white vapor in the frigid Iowa air. "I just
want a president who won't lie to me," the Republican said as snow piled atop
his box of bakery-fresh donuts. "Is that too much to ask?"
</P>
<P>
	   This may be the legacy of the two-term president whose 1992 campaign tapped
the fears of recession-weary Americans, particularly in New Hampshire. "It's the
economy, stupid," read the sign posted in Clinton's Arkansas headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Exit polls from that election showed honesty far down the list of values
that mattered most when people picked a president; at the top was "bringing
change."
</P>
<P>
	   When things changed and the economy soared - when New Hampshire's high-tech
industry replaced struggling textile mills as the symbol of that state's economy
- the public's emphasis on values shifted, too.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1996 exit polls, honesty was tops along with "shares my view of
government" in personal qualities that mattered most when choosing a president.
</P>
<P>
	   A year after Clinton's trial, a Los Angeles Times poll shows that nearly
three-quarters of Iowa caucus-goers say they were supporting their candidate
because of a personal trait rather than his stance on issues.
</P>
<P>
	   "Honesty and integrity are it for me," said Barbara Lund of Polk City, Iowa.
"Health care and all that is important, but nothing they promise means much if
they're lying about it."
</P>
<P>
	   Susan Henning of Boone, Iowa, watched through a storefront window as Steve
Forbes boarded his well-appointed campaign bus. She only wanted to know one
thing about the GOP candidate: "Is he faithful?"
</P>
<P>
	   "If you're not faithful in your marriage, you won't be faithful to the
people," she reasoned.
</P>
<P>
	   Sallie Klum, 65, a Republican from Hollis, N.H., does not know who she wants
to be president but she knows what she wants. "I think when you give someone the
right to provide the leadership for your country, for your future and the future
of your children and grandchildren, that's a huge gift of trust," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Honesty and integrity are important to Bob Connett, but the Democrat said he
is "mainly looking for somebody who has the ability and knows how to run this
country."
</P>
<P>
	   Greg Lewis, who had been shooting the breeze with Connett at a Des Moines
union hall, said the next president "needs to keep things on track."
</P>
<P>
	   Both backers of Gore, their sentiments reflect polls that show the vice
president is a rare candidate whose supporters don't cite character issues as
their No. 1 attraction. "Morality/Integrity/Honesty" ranked third, well behind
his experience and education policies.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats as a whole were only slightly less likely than Republicans to cite
a character trait as the reason for choosing their candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   GOP pollster John McLaughlin said policy issues still are important in the
2000 election, especially when candidates use them to highlight character
traits.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush pledges to cut taxes for low-income Americans, then calls himself a
"compassionate" conservative.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes accuses Bush of breaking his no-tax pledge as Texas governor, an
obvious attempt to raise doubts about Bush's integrity.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley says his campaign "has been one of respect for people." And he will
not let polls guide his actions, Gore's rival says, because that would be
dishonorable.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore did not just question the math behind Bradley's health care plan, he
suggested he was out to hurt minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   One Republican even slapped a character trait on the side of his campaign
bus: The "Straight Talk Express" rolls through New Hampshire and South Carolina
with Arizona Sen. John McCain aboard.

<HEADLINE> Baptists Seek To 'Convert' Mormons  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Two Southern Baptist congregations are preparing
a crusade to teach their members how to convert ``cult'' members, including
Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cult Awareness Impact Crusade is scheduled for Feb. 6-8 at Calvary
Baptist Church and Oaklawn Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
	   Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses are not Christians, say the Rev. Mark Corts,
Calvary's senior pastor, and the Rev. Philip Henry, assistant pastor for
evangelism and new-member assimilation.
</P>
<P>
	   They want to help prevent their members from joining those religions and
teach them how to convert Jehovah's Witnesses and Mormons to Christianity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This would be like the U.S. Army holding a seminar on Russian military
tactics or something,'' said Henry. ``In the military realm, they would call
that understanding your enemy, but we do not consider them our enemy.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mormons and Jehovah's Witnesses members objected to the congregations'
plans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm disappointed that they would go to that approach,'' said Gary Smith,
president of the Winston-Salem stake of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day
Saints.

<HEADLINE> Teen Charged As Adult in Baby Death  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) -- A 14-year-old boy is facing murder and sexual assault
charges in adult court for allegedly feeding windshield washer fluid to his
13-month-old niece after the toddler scratched him.
</P>
<P>
	   Juvenile Court Judge Steven Nash ordered Braxton Bowers to adult court on
Friday, saying there may be no hope of rehabilitation ``if in fact he is the
perpetrator of such fundamentally brutal, vicious acts.''
</P>
<P>
	   If convicted, Braxton could be sent to a juvenile facility until age 17 and
then spend the rest of his life in adult prison. As a juvenile, the most serious
punishment would be detention until age 21.
</P>
<P>
	   Braxton, who was baby-sitting Amber and her 4-year-old sister, told police
the baby scratched him while he was changing her diaper, so he mixed the washer
fluid with juice in a bottle and gave it to her, said prosecutor Lorinda Lamken.
A coroner's investigation found evidence of sexual assault, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The boy is charged with first-degree murder, involuntary manslaughter and
two counts of aggravated criminal sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense attorney Adam Brenner argued that Braxton did not know the fluid
would kill Amber.

<HEADLINE> Hateful Remarks Ignite Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By CHELSEA J. CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- It began with a homophobic remark -- dirty
words yelled out a car window as William Petrasich walked along a street in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
	   When he told police, Petrasich was turned away. No crime committed, they
said.
</P>
<P>
	   So he took his case public in a letter-writing campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The result is a new police policy of documenting hate speech -- even when no
crime is committed. The policy has ignited a debate about free speech in this
Orange County oceanside resort community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the government starts to record what people say, is your speech
really free?'' said Peter Eliasberg of the American Civil Liberties Union in Los
Angeles. ``If the speech is protected, the government has no business of keeping
track of it. They are trampling on the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
	   But those who have been targeted by such remarks say it's a matter of safety
and being able to walk the streets without fear of harassment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I respect the First Amendment, but I also have a right to be free of
verbal assault,'' said Petrasich, an attorney at 20th Century Fox studios. He is
also gay.
</P>
<P>
	   A handful of police departments around the country have been documenting
racist remarks for years. Police in West Hollywood, Calif., file reports on such
incidents. In New York City, the Bias Crime Investigations Unit is dedicated to
documenting and investigating racist actions, including hateful remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   The ACLU, however, says hate speech is a gray area and Eliasberg says he
plans to keep an eye on such policies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ethnic and gender labels are protected so long as they do not pose a
reasonable fear of eminent harm,'' Eliasberg said. ``We may not like that kind
of speech, but it is protected.''
</P>
<P>
	   Laguna Beach, which has a prominent gay population, sits along the famed
Pacific Coast Highway that serves as a main traffic artery on the state's scenic
coast. The city is known nationally for its arts community, punctuated by a
slough of boutiques and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to city officials, Petrasich recounted his experience as a
tourist during a weekend trip to the city in October. He said an anti-gay remark
was hurled at him by a passing motorist.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yeah, they drove off. But I didn't know if they were going to come back
for Round 2,'' he said. ``It was so bad I returned to my hotel and didn't go out
for the rest of the evening.''
</P>
<P>
	   Around the same time, several other anti-gay incidents occurred, including a
water balloon thrown at a gay man at a restaurant and a group of teens who
sprayed another gay man with a fire extinguisher.
</P>
<P>
	   Although there is no written policy, Police Chief James Spreine said
officers were instructed in December to start taking incident reports.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The message we're sending is we want you to come to Laguna Beach and feel
safe,'' he said. ``We're going to treat it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since December, the police department has not received any complaints that
it considered significant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not Nazi, Germany. I'm not Hitler. We're not creating secret
files,'' Spreine said. ``Just driving by and making a statement is not a crime.
But I think the incident should be documented.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What do I do with it? Nothing. But if the person later becomes a victim of
a crime, we can look back and ... maybe come up with a lead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Spreine announced the policy, the police department has been inundated
with telephone calls and letters. Concerns have been raised in local newspapers
and on talk radio shows.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Laguna will rue the jackboots and matching bag of the ACLU,'' wrote Carmen
Langford of nearby Newport Beach.
</P>
<P>
	   But Stu Saffer, managing editor of the weekly Coastline News, said much of
the debate is being held outside of city limits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People in this town do not do anything to embarrass it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Game Shows Still Popular in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Clenching his fist in celebration, Game Show Network
President Michael Fleming looks at the numbers on a piece of paper with a sense
of wonder.
</P>
<P>
	   They're television ratings from the night before, but have nothing to do
with his network. Rather, they indicate another stunningly large audience for
ABC's quiz craze, "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire." For Fleming, that's the next
best thing.
</P>
<P>
	   You would think now would be a great time to be running a cable network
devoted to game shows, and you'd be right.
</P>
<P>
	   The previously little-noticed Game Show Network is surfing the wave of
interest in "Millionaire." It is gaining in viewers, attention and, most
importantly at this stage, in cable systems that offer its service.
</P>
<P>
	   "It does, in some way, justify what we've always known -- that this is a
very powerful genre of programming," said Jake Tauber, a former "Match Game"
writer who is head of programming at GSN.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, the Game Show Network was added to cable systems in 1.8 million
homes, nearly double the best month ever in its five-year history. Roughly
one-quarter of the nation's television homes have access to the network.
</P>
<P>
	   It has always had to struggle to be noticed by the people who decide which
networks are picked up by cable systems, Fleming said. They tend to be
middle-age white males, a group that traditionally has little interest in game
shows.
</P>
<P>
	   "Now they are calling us instead of us calling them," Tauber said.
</P>
<P>
	   Viewers of the Game Show Network get a steady diet of classic quizzes and a
handful of originals, like "Inquizition," a challenging test of knowledge with
an impatient mystery man as host, and "3's a Crowd," a remake of a relationship
show with host Alan Thicke.
</P>
<P>
	   The classics, including "Match Game," "Family Feud" and "The Newlywed Game,"
are like a look into a time capsule with excruciating haircuts, clothing styles
and social mores. The late "Match Game" host Gene Rayburn's leer is definitely
the product of a different era.
</P>
<P>
	   Producers of many of these chestnuts hung on to the tapes, in some cases
storing them in their homes, correctly anticipating a lucrative new market. The
not-so-prescient left some unfortunate historical gaps: all but about 100 of the
old "Hollywood Squares" episodes with Peter Marshall were thrown away and
forever lost.
</P>
<P>
	   For the future, the Game Show Network is counting heavily on an interactive
television world where people will be able to play along with their games at
home.
</P>
<P>
	   Only a small fraction of viewers now have the digital equipment necessary to
do this, but the network is catering to them. "Inquizition" allows contestants
at home to compete with players on the show, and win cash prizes.
</P>
<P>
	   The network is even going back to the tapes of old game shows to concoct
ways viewers can play along. It expects the new games the network develops to
all have some interactive element.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will set us apart from everyone on the television landscape and set us
apart from any other service," Tauber said.
</P>
<P>
	   In one sense, "Millionaire" has made Tauber's day much busier. More
Hollywood producers are working on developing game shows now, so the Game Show
Network has more to choose from for the future. Of course, they also have more
competition for the best games.
</P>
<P>
	   Fleming and Tauber, like most people in television, have their own theories
about why "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" became a big success. It's easy for
people to play along as they watch, particularly because many of the questions
are so easy, Tauber said. And the focus on one player enables viewers to either
root for or against the contestant.
</P>
<P>
	   The Game Show Network executives are most heartened that many young people
are watching, because it introduces the genre to another generation.
</P>
<P>
	   Since September, the average number of people watching the Game Show Network
at any given time has crept up from 200,000 to 260,000. That's nowhere near the
28.8 million viewers that "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" got in its first five
airings of the year. Still, it beats the alternative.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were a little concerned that it might go the other way," Fleming
admitted.
</P>
<P>
	   He's still a little worried, actually.
</P>
<P>
	   "All of a sudden we're looking at a prime-time television schedule that has
a game show on a major network every night of the week," he said. "That's some
pretty stiff competition for us. It could still have a backlash."
</P>
<P>
	   But for now, it's all fun and games.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in television ...
</P>
<P>
	   TRIBUTE TO A CLIMBER: It's a moving profile and a heartfelt tribute.
Describing him as "grace on granite," Tom Brokaw reports on Alex Lowe, regarded
by some as the world's best climber, not to mention loving husband and father.
Lowe climbed on five continents during his 25-year career and twice scaled Mount
Everest. But last October he died on Tibet's 26,291-foot Shishapangma, forever
buried in a Himalayan avalanche. Now Brokaw interviews Lowe's friends and fellow
climbers, and visits with his widow, Jennifer Leigh Lowe, at home in Bozemon,
Mont. Clearly a labor of love, the story airs on "Dateline NBC" tonight at 9
p.m. EST.

<HEADLINE> Ledyard man to try for $1 million field goal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LEDYARD, Conn. (AP) - A Ledyard man is going to the Super Bowl and
hoping to come home with $1 million.
<P>
	   All Rodney Sylvia, 39, has to do is kick a 40-yard field goal on live
television during the Super Bowl pre-game show on Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm excited, but it's a lot of pressure around you," Sylvia told The
Associated Press Saturday. "I played softball and a little bit of football as a
teenager."
</P>
<P>
	   George Ryan, who has worked with Sylvia for 15 years at Shetucket Plumbing
Supply Co.'s purchasing office in Groton, has confidence in his friend.
</P>
<P>
	   "He can do it," said Ryan. "He's very disciplined and very athletic."
</P>
<P>
	   Sylvia won the chance in Hershey's Million Dollar Kick Sweepstakes. He and
two other contestants were picked at random from about 100,000 entries. He edged
out his competitors in a kicking contest at the San Diego Chargers training
facility on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sylvia's wife, Colleen, entered her husband in the contest. He said they
were sitting at the kitchen table one morning and she asked him if he could
kick. "I said, 'Sure, I can kick,' and the next thing I know I get a phone call
from Hershey's," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Three of the last five contestants in the field goal contest have taken home
the $1 million prize.
</P>
<P>
	   Sylvia successfully kicked a 40-yard field goal during practice on Tuesday,
said Mike Kinney, a spokesman for Hershey Foods.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're really excited about Rod," he said. "We know he has the leg strength
to make the kick."
</P>
<P>
	   And to make sure, Hershey will supply coaching in the form of retired NFL
kicker Nick Lowry.
</P>
<P>
	   A father of three, Sylvia will not come home empty-handed even if he misses
the kick. He and his wife have won an all-expenses paid trip to the Super Bowl
in Atlanta and if the kick falls short, he will still receive $10,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Sylvia's co-workers are rooting for him to take home the top prize. A banner
in their office reads "Congratulations Rod. Go for the Gold!"
</P>
<P>
	   The kick will be broadcast live at about 2 p.m. during the pre-game show
from the ESPN Zone in Atlanta. The contestants in the other big event - the
Super Bowl - have not yet been determined.

<HEADLINE> Spike in prices may take big bite out of budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The price of heating oil rose in Connecticut
almost as steeply as temperatures plunged this week.
<P>
	   An unprecedented wholesale spike - heating oil increased more than 30 cents
Friday - could result in some customers playing $2 or more a gallon beginning
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been in this business for 25 years and even during the Persian Gulf
War, prices never escalated to this point. We went up this week 40 cents a
gallon," said Donald J. Schmidt, president of East Coast Petroleum in Waterbury,
a distributor of transportation fuels.
</P>
<P>
	   The increase caught the attention of Attorney General Richard Blumenthal. He
said Friday his office is examining the higher prices to make sure no illegal
price gouging is taking place.
</P>
<P>
	   "The combination of dramatic price increases with drastic drops in
temperature certainly sounds an alarm," Blumenthal said. "The increases in spot
prices along with the very significant reductions in OPEC supply and world
inventories may well be a factor. The question is whether that is enough to
explain the entire phenomenon."
</P>
<P>
	   Both state and regional fuel oil associations have asked President Clinton
to tap into the nation's strategic oil reserve for the first time since 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   Ray Gincavage, who runs five oil terminals and wholesale operations in
Connecticut and western Massachusetts for Global Companies LLC, said diesel fuel
is expected to increase more than 40 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've been in this business for 30 years and I've never seen a price
explosion as quickly as we've seen here," Gincavage said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gincavage said he is being forced to pay the higher prices too for
deliveries coming into New Haven Harbor.
</P>
<P>
	   In Connecticut, extra demand for heating oil and diesel fuel is being
created by more than 100 Connecticut companies who normally use natural gas to
heat their buildings or to operate their power plants.
</P>
<P>
	   "Oil will come through. We're not going to see houses go cold. Unfortunately
customers will have to pay more for it," Gincavage said.
</P>
<P>
	   The good news, he said, is "historically these price spikes don't last very
long, two to three weeks."

<HEADLINE> State officials seek injunction against city in water fight  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) - The state is seeking an injunction against the
city in a 10-year dispute over water rights in the Shepaug River.
<P>
	   State Superior Court Judge Beverly J. Hodgson on Friday said she would
release her opinion on the best way to resolve the battle within the next six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Conservationists from Roxbury and Washington, Conn. sued the city in 1997,
saying Waterbury does not release enough water into the Shepaug River from an
upstream watershed.
</P>
<P>
	   Prior to closing arguments in the case Friday, Attorney General Richard
Blumenthal and Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Arthur J.
Rocque Jr. delivered a proposed injunction to Hodgson's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Blumenthal and Rocque asked Hodgson to order Waterbury to implement a water
supply operation consistent with what the river advocates had proposed earlier
in the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The order, if approved by Hodgson, would require Waterbury to release a
minimum of 10 million gallons a day to the river in the summer, and 32.6 million
gallons a day in the fall, winter and spring through the city-owned Shepaug Dam
in Warren.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, the city is required to release 1.5 million gallons a day in the
summer under a 1921 agreement with Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit claims that the city's actions affect the river, especially in
the summer when it dries to a trickle in some places. The river runs through the
towns of Warren, Washington and Roxbury before it empties into the Housatonic
River.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant Attorney General Janet P. Brooks said Friday the release schedule
is a prudent and feasible alternative to the way Waterbury currently supplies
water to its 120,000 customers. She said the city failed to show at trial that
there are workable alternatives to the current system, as it was required to do.
</P>
<P>
	   "They could have given us alternatives that said, 'This doesn't work and why
or that this does work and why.' There needed to be some evidence that there was
no prudent and feasible alternatives to conduct their system," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the city tried to block the submission of the injunction
request, but Hodgson allowed it to be entered into the record. City attorney
Michael Tansley said the time for Blumenthal and Rocque to take a position in
the case was when they intervened last year, not on the final day of trial.
</P>
<P>
	   "The commissioner is asking for wide powers, almost to manage the city of
Waterbury's water system," Tansley said. "We have no power to respond to it."

<HEADLINE> Let the Puffy backlash begin - wait, it already has  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - It was back in late June, back when Sean "Puffy" Combs
still teetered atop the rap world. Combs was on his cell phone, offering an
apology for the beating of a fellow record executive.
<P>
	   "I was embarrassed," the Grammy-winning rap entrepreneur quietly told a
reporter. "That's not me. I disappointed my fans, my family, and I disappointed
hip-hop."
</P>
<P>
	   A quick call to right everything. Except in the months since, it's all gone
wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   Since his April 15 assault on Interscope Records official Steve Stoute, the
30-year-old Combs has suffered twin black eyes himself: a stiff drop-off in
record sales and a sharp increase in negative publicity.
</P>
<P>
	   His latest album stayed in the Top 10 for just two weeks, and sold a
fraction of its predecessor. He was arrested again on Dec. 27, this time for
felony weapon possession; improbably, so was his humiliated girlfriend, Jennifer
Lopez. His latest protDegDe was charged in a Manhattan nightclub shooting
shortly before Combs' arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks later, Combs was indicted on weapons charges - possession of two
stolen guns loaded with hollow point bullets - that leave him facing 15 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
	   He's been gagged by his lawyer, and generally bashed by critics everywhere
from the Internet to The Washington Post. Combs maintains his innocence, but the
toll on his reputation is already heavy.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's hard to imagine anything about this is going to enhance his career,"
said Spin magazine editor Alan Light, former editor of Vibe magazine.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of Puff Daddy's problems are self-inflicted, others seem just the
inevitable product of his runaway success. But detractors have a list of
anti-Puffy complaints:
</P>
<P>
	   Puffy is a phony gangster. Puffy can't rap. Puffy rips off other people's
hits. Puffy, with his big bankroll and his Bentley and his $600,000 birthday
party, is out of touch with the street. Puffy is just dumb.
</P>
<P>
	   Criticism is new to Combs, who survived the nightmarish death of 9 people
crushed at a 1991 charity basketball game and the 1997 murder of his sidekick,
The Notorious B.I.G.
</P>
<P>
	   But he no longer rises like a phoenix from such disasters. Instead, Puffy's
new bird is an albatross, hanging around his neck with Combs' jewelry.
</P>
<P>
	   Record sales?
</P>
<P>
	   Disappointing. While 1997's "No Way Out" sold 7 million copies, the current
"Forever" barely broke the 1 million mark. Two of Combs' top Bad Boy acts left
his label; multi-platinum Mase found religion, while The Lox found a new label.
"Puff, the Magic's Draggin"', said a New York Post headline.
</P>
<P>
	   Puffy's hopes for a chart comeback were tied to his latest signee, a rapper
named Shyne. Unfortunately, Shyne - aka Jamal Barrow, 19 - was charged with
attempted murder after allegedly shooting three people inside a Manhattan club.
Puff Daddy was arrested while fleeing the club.
</P>
<P>
	   Respect?
</P>
<P>
	   Anti-Puffy Web sites are as prevalent as the hits he once enjoyed. There's
Americans Against Puffy, Musicians Against Puffy - you get the idea. "C'mon
Puffy, you steal hits," read an entry on one site.
</P>
<P>
	   Public relations?
</P>
<P>
	   "The Deflation of Puffy Combs," read The Washington Post headline back in
December, before Puffy's latest brush with the law. Vibe magazine ran a similar
piece discussing the Puffy backlash - and that, too, was before the nightclub
incident.
</P>
<P>
	   Even the staid New Yorker magazine dissed Puffy, weighing in with "A Letter
to Puff Daddy." The tongue-in-cheek piece had writer Andy (Stacky) Borowitz
applying for a job with Puffy's posse, saying, "I am available to start hanging
with you 24-7, effective immediately."
</P>
<P>
	   Ouch. That's dissin' Puffy big-time.
</P>
<P>
	   Combs was once the reigning king of rap, crossing over into the mainstream.
He had a house in the Hamptons, partied with Donald Trump and Martha Stewart. He
had a magazine, a clothing line, a restaurant. He earned $53.5 million in 1998,
according to Forbes magazine - which put him on its cover in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   But now Combs is keeping a low profile, awaiting a February court date with
his new lawyer, Johnnie Cochran. In his last public appearance, Puffy stood
before a roomful of reporters - including 19 camera crews - to proclaim his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   The media was restless; Combs arrived 25 minutes late, wearing a beige
sweater from his clothing line and a glum look on his face. He did not take
questions; attorney Harvey Slovis cut off attempts to quiz the millionaire
artist.
</P>
<P>
	   But just before the news conference ended, the rap impresario grabbed the
microphone and delivered a free-style rap.
</P>
<P>
	   "Thank you," he announced. "I wish I could answer more of your questions,
and hopefully I will be able to in the next couple of days when the truth comes
out."
</P>
<P>
	   It's been several weeks now. And the truth has yet to set Puff Daddy free.

<HEADLINE> Wind chill keeps New Jerseyans bundled up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Bahamas, anyone?
<P>
	   The layered-look remained the uniform of the day Saturday while phones rang
at travel agencies and auto repair shops as bitter wind chills continued to
leave the Garden State in a deep freeze.
</P>
<P>
	   Temperatures in the teens and single digits combined with gusty northwest
winds to form wind chills that made it feel like it was well below zero.
</P>
<P>
	   It's the longest cold spell New Jersey has experienced since early January
1996.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've been spoiled," said Dave Robinson, the state climatologist. "January
temperatures were above normal nine out of ten times in the 1990s."
</P>
<P>
	   The first real blast of Arctic cold hit the Garden State a week ago Friday,
ending a 12-day period when average temperatures were about ten degrees above
normal.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the cold, temperatures around the state this month remained roughly
three degrees above normal, Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
	   The storm that brought the season's first significant snowfall Thursday
dragged a lot of Arctic air into the region, said meteorologist Joe Hasko in
Mount Holly.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone wants to get the hell out of Ocean County," said Landy Lamonea,
who owns Adventures in Travel in Brick Township. "They want Mickey Mouse, Fort
Lauderdale, Tampa, the Bahamas, anyplace cheap and warm."
</P>
<P>
	   Her business picked up considerably when temperatures plummeted and Y2K
fears subsided.
</P>
<P>
	   But last-minute travelers who hadn't booked 21 days in advance weren't
finding any bargain airfares, Lamonea said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was so busy at the Sears auto repair center at Seaview Square Mall in
Ocean Township that no one could talk to a reporter.
</P>
<P>
	   It was much the same at the Sears Auto Center at the Quakerbridge Mall in
Hamilton Township, said manager Rich Beer.
</P>
<P>
	   "Batteries, lots of batteries," he said. "And people hitting curbs."
</P>
<P>
	   Business has doubled since temperatures dipped, Beer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Motorists should check their batteries, hoses and belts for signs of wear,
Beer said. The average battery lasts about four to five years and a replacement
costs about $60, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forecasters said light snow was expected Saturday evening, bringing another
one to three inches to parts of the state before it was expected to end early
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   There was a chance for flurries Monday and the possibility of more light
snow Wednesday, Hasko said. After that, "I think we've seen the last of the
bitterly cold air and the bitterly cold wind chills for a while. We have not
seen the end of winter-type weather, though."

<HEADLINE> Lifetime's guru is champion of domesticity made easy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Katie Brown just LOVES Martha Stewart.
<P>
	   But she sometimes frets over the domestic diva's gourmet recipes and
fabulous home improvement schemes. They're so complicated - and so costly.
</P>
<P>
	   So when Brown - no slouch herself in the domesticity department - got her
own homemaking show on the Lifetime cable network, she made simplicity her
touchstone.
</P>
<P>
	   One of a slew of imitators riding the wave of Stewart-stimulated interest in
hearth and home, Brown gears her craft and cooking tips toward career-minded 20-
and 30-somethings who hope to create cozy homes and tasty meals with a minimal
investment of time and money.
</P>
<P>
	   "You always have to ask yourself the question, 'Would anybody ever really do
this?"' said Brown, whose half-hour show "Next Door with Katie Brown" airs six
days a week. "I want the answer to always be yes."
</P>
<P>
	   While Brown says she's been a cooking and decorating nut all her life, her
move to television makes her one of a flood of homemaking gurus being plugged as
conceptual spinoffs of the immensely successful Stewart.
</P>
<P>
	   The relentlessly upbeat Brown makes scented soaps and candles, mixes
martinis, experiments with flower arrangements and concocts fancy but
easy-to-replicate breakfast entrees. All with enough encouraging smiles to put
Martha to shame.
</P>
<P>
	   "Next Door" focuses on "how to do cool stuff if you don't have a ton of
money, you don't have a ton of time," explains Brown. Even those who do have
time and money may prefer to read a book or play with their children rather than
get involved in overly meticulous chores, she says.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown isn't bothered by those who dub her show "Domesticity for Dummies" -
she thinks the tag is on target and says viewers appreciate her focus on the
basics. One recent show offered a primer on setting the dinner table, with an
oh-so-creative twist - Brown draped swatches of fabric across her table and tied
napkins with long blades of grass. She decorates picture frames with birch
branches, cures her own olives and makes book covers festooned with images of
flowers, leaves and post cards.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown, 36, thinks the Generation Xers who watch her show are longing for a
comfortable homeyness they may have lacked as children.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our generation was really the first generation of divorce," Brown said
during a recent interview, looking downtown hip in a wrinkled white-and-orange
shirt and green scarf, her short brown hair mussed and her hands splattered with
white paint from a morning's work. "We're all a little bit homesick, and we like
to daydream about having time to get fresh-baked cookies out of the oven."
</P>
<P>
	   The desire for domestic bliss only seems to grow as the harried pace of
modern life moves further from the mythical hearth-and-home ideal cherished by
many, Brown says. But she hopes to show viewers that a busy work life doesn't
have to mean chaos at home - pre-made pie crusts and pastry dough and
store-bought everything are staples of her recipes and decorating ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   "Women of my generation ... we get to pursue a life outside of the home, and
it's fantastic," she said. "But you still have this urge - clearly I have it -
to nest, and make a home and learn how to cook.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't want to make stock from scratch," she continued. "But I still want
my family and people I love and my friends to know that I put some time in. So I
just try and take some of the steps out so that people can be domestic and proud
of it, and still have a life that doesn't just revolve around the hearth."
</P>
<P>
	   Brown's dumbed-down approach to homemaking may be catching on. Her show
draws an average of 371,000 viewers daily and 834,000 in its Saturday slot, very
respectable for niche cable show. By contrast, the genre's Goliath, the
syndicated "Martha Stewart Living," gets about 1.9 million viewers per episode,
according to Nielsen Media Research.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown says she scrutinizes all her suggestions for simplicity and cost
before putting them on the air.
</P>
<P>
	   "If someone brings me an idea, or I come up with an idea that has too many
steps in it, there's got to be a way to take it out," she said. "I have to think
of a way to recreate it but not have to use mahogany. You know, 'Can we do that
with plywood and put a stain on it?' It's just always thinking in terms of
quicker and easier."
</P>
<P>
	   Brown learned her trade growing up in tiny Petoskey, Mich., surrounded by a
large extended family whose members gathered often for home-cooked communal
meals.
</P>
<P>
	   "The biggest claim to fame for them was 'How many did you feed last night?"'
Brown said, recalling her competitive aunts' answers: "'I fed 10!' 'I fed 12!"'
</P>
<P>
	   She absorbed their nurturing inclinations and added a keen mind for business
and promotion. After struggling for several years as a would-be actress in New
York and then starting a catering company in Los Angeles, Brown opened Goat, an
L.A. shop she crammed with antiques and eclectic what-nots. She soon began
hosting weekly dinner parties there, putting a long table in the middle of the
store and serving platters piled with food.
</P>
<P>
	   When she went home to Michigan three years ago planning to open a similar
shop near her parents' home on Mackinac Island, serendipity struck. Lifetime
executives, scouring the country for someone to host a down-to-earth homemaking
show, called a local official for help.
</P>
<P>
	   "Les who runs the Chamber of Commerce said, 'Yeah, Paul Brown's daughter
does that kind of thing,"' Brown said. "When he came down with this ripped-up
piece of paper in his hand and said 'Lifetime television called, they want to do
this show,' I thought it was my sisters playing a joke on me."
</P>
<P>
	   Many meetings and audition tapes later, "Next Door with Katie Brown"
premiered in late 1997. Brown is also working on a book about dinner parties,
and spends much of her time brainstorming new cooking and decorating ideas - at
a stylish SoHo restaurant, she gushed over cut-glass salt-and-pepper shakers and
admired comfy-looking leather chairs.
</P>
<P>
	   But she tries not to get too wrapped up in the quest for domestic
perfection.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not that serious," she laughs. "I mean, if worst comes to worst, just
order pizza."

<HEADLINE> Elian's grandmothers meet with attorney general  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Elian Gonzalez' grandmothers went directly to the
attorney general Saturday with their emotional crusade to wrest the Cuban boy
from his Miami relatives and have him returned to his native Cuba.
<P>
	   Mariela Quintana, paternal grandmother of 6-year-old Elian, arrived at the
Justice Department with maternal grandmother Raquel Rodriguez for a meeting with
Attorney General Attorney General Janet Reno and Doris Meissner, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service commissioner.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ordered the boy returned to Cuba and Reno concurred, saying the
youngster belongs with his father in the communist island where he was raised.
The grandmothers requested the meeting, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives of the National Council of Churches, representing mainline
Protestant denominations, have been serving as the grandmothers' hosts during
their stay of undetermined length in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been in the middle of a custody fight between the U.S. relatives
in Miami's politically powerful Cuban community and the father and grandmothers
living in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The fight has escalated far beyond a family feud, becoming the latest
centerpiece of the decades-long battle between anti-Castro Cubans and Cuban
President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov.
25 after the boat taking him to the United States capsized, killing his mother,
her boyfriend and nine other people.
</P>
<P>
	   The case could be settled in the courts or in Congress. Attorneys for the
boy's relatives in Florida have asked a federal court to prevent Elian's return
before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   But the court may be in a race with Congress, where lawmakers plan an
attempt this week to declare Elian a U.S. citizen. If such legislation becomes
law, the boy no longer would be an immigrant under INS jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, upon their arrival in New York, Elian's grandmothers spoke
pointedly, and at times tearfully, in asking the nation to let them take their
grandson back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "I came here to tell you all and to ask you to finish this tragedy that has
been so hard for us as a family and to ask you that our grandson can return as
soon as possible," Mrs. Quintana said in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Rodriguez, also speaking through an interpreter, said she felt a need
to take Elian back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you want to help us ... I want that my daughter (Elian's dead mother)
will be in peace, and she will not be in peace until Elian is home," she said.

<HEADLINE> Survey: N.J. colleges reluctant to add sprinklers due to cost  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Many New Jersey colleges and universities have not
added sprinklers to their buildings because of the cost.
<P>
	   In the wake of Wednesday's fire at a Seton Hall freshman dormitory where
three students died, the Star-Ledger of Newark reported in Saturday's editions
that retrofitting older buildings with sprinklers is a cost that most were
reluctant to incur.
</P>
<P>
	   "Retrofitting is very difficult to sell because building owners and the real
estate interests are a powerful lobby and they object to the costs," said John
A. Viniello, president of the National Fire Sprinkler Association, a trade group
based in Patterson, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
	   For example, out of the 12 residence halls at the College of New Jersey, two
did not have sprinklers. At Montclair State University, four of the seven
residence halls did not have sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
	   At Princeton University, only seven of the school's 41 residences had
sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
	   Justin Harmon, a spokesman for Princeton University, said the school has
begun a major dormitory renovation, aimed at gutting and upgrading every dorm on
campus to include sprinklers as required by the state fire code.
</P>
<P>
	   One 240-bed dormitory is under construction this year and will get
sprinklers; another will get sprinklers in 2001.
</P>
<P>
	   Harmon said when the state placed a fire suppression requirement into their
code around 1988, Princeton estimated it would cost $20 million to retrofit
their older buildings with sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not easy to retrofit them," Harmon said. "It's a huge price tag and
we, like others, have taken the approach that we're going to maintain safety
with the current smoke detector program, and that we'll bring everything up to
code but we will do it in a gradual way."
</P>
<P>
	   Princeton's dormitories, most of which were built in the early 20th century,
are equipped with smoke detectors instead of pull alarms and extinguishers.
</P>
<P>
	   At Rutgers, only 18 of 172 residence halls have sprinklers, said Joseph
Zuccarella, chief of university emergency services. The halls are equipped with
fire alarms and extinguishers, as is Boland Hall at Seton Hall, where
Wednesday's fire occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Fire Protection Association endorses sprinklers for college
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
	   "Sprinklers are extremely effective in saving lives," spokeswoman Susan
McKelvey said. "They either will put out the fire completely or contain it until
the fire department arrives."
</P>
<P>
	   "You can almost definitively say that those students would not have lost
their lives," said Steve Muncy, president of the American Fire Sprinkler
Association. "In a properly sprinklered building, we know of no instance where
there has been a multiple loss of life."
</P>
<P>
	   Nationwide, only a few states including Alaska, Hawaii, Massachusetts,
Nevada, require sprinklers be installed in older buildings retroactively,
according to Viniello.
</P>
<P>
	   Cities like Atlanta, Miami and San Francisco have their own regulations
requiring retrofitting of buildings with sprinklers, said Viniello. Most of the
time, however, stricter sprinkler regulations come into law after a tragedy has
occurred like the Seton Hall fire, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the fire at Boland Hall remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Funerals are scheduled Monday for the victims: Frank S. Caltabilota of West
Long Branch, John N. Giunta of Vineland and Aaron C. Karol of Green Brook. All
were 18-year-old freshmen.
</P>
<P>
	   Five students remained hospitalized Saturday, including four in critical
condition with serious burns. They were Nick Donato, 19, Thomas Pugilese, Alvaro
Llanos, and Ken Simons, all 18.
</P>
<P>
	   Ben Chibnik, 19, was released Saturday afternoon from Saint Barnabas Medical
Center in Livingston, said hospital spokeswoman Robin Lally.
</P>
<P>
	   At University Hospital in Newark, Dana Christmas, a 21-year-old resident
adviser with burns on 58 percent of her body, remained in critical condition,
said a hospital spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   Christmas had her first surgery Thursday to graft skin onto her back and
hands. Her surgeon, Dr. Edwin Deitch, has said she will need between three and
five surgeries.

<HEADLINE> Anniversary of Roe V. Wade Marked  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hundreds of activists on both sides of the abortion
debate converged on the nation's capital Saturday to mark the 27th anniversary
of the Roe v. Wade decision with a weekend of vigils, marches and protests.
</P>
<P>
	   The weekend events were to lead up to Monday's annual March for Life rally
and march up Constitution Avenue to the Capitol and the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Jan. 22, 1973, that the Supreme Court made abortion legal.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday, about 50 anti-abortion protesters, wearing T-shirts that read
``Mr. Clinton Stop Killing Children'' and ``Abortion is Homicide,'' waited in
freezing temperatures to tour the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   Protesters also gathered outside a downtown Planned Parenthood office less
than five blocks from the White House.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the same as always,'' said Anthony Sheehan, an anti-abortion activist
from Alexandria, Va. ``When they stop killing children, we'll stop showing up.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jatrice Martel Gaiter, president and chief executive officer of Planned
Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington DC Inc., said she was ``appalled that 27
years after Roe vs. Wade we are still having the same sidewalk debate.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The decision to choose should be a decision a woman makes for herself.
Abortion existed before Roe vs. Wade and will always exist,'' Gaiter said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Saturday protests came a day after a federal judge in Washington ordered
seven abortion protesters, including the director of Operation Rescue National,
not to obstruct access to reproductive health care clinics in the Washington
area.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling from U.S. District Judge Gladys Kessler came in response to a
lawsuit filed by the U.S. Justice Department in June 1998. The permanent
injunction prohibits the defendants from coming within 20 feet of any
reproductive health facility within the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuit had alleged that the seven defendants, including Philip Benham,
Operation Rescue's director, and Patrick Mahoney, director of the Christian
Defense Coalition, violated the Freedom of Clinic Entrances Act by obstructing
entrances of an abortion clinic in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahoney was among protesters outside the downtown abortion clinic Saturday.
``Our presence here is to protect life, to say it is important,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Troy Newman, a California man with Operation Rescue West, angrily accused
the judge of showing her ``true colors'' and promised to return to March to
challenge the judge's order.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes noted the Roe vs.

<HEADLINE> Another large budget surplus seems to be in New York's future  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The good times are continuing to roll for the
state's treasury, in the form of higher-than-anticipated revenues and of another
significant projected surplus.
<P>
	   Gov. George Pataki's proposed 2000-01 state budget projects that the state
will end the current fiscal year on March 31 with a surplus of $625 million.
</P>
<P>
	   State Comptroller H. Carl McCall said last week that his review of revenue
collections so far this fiscal year indicates that the surplus could grow even
higher by the time the state closes its books on fiscal 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
	   State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat like McCall, also said the
surplus will be more than the Republican governor estimates. Silver said his
analysts predicted as much during the months-long impasse over passage of the
budget last summer and that, once again, the Assembly's revenue projections are
proving more accurate than those of Pataki's Budget Division or analysts in the
Republican state Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest projected surplus would actually be modest by recent standards if
it remains at the levels estimated by Pataki.
</P>
<P>
	   New York ended the 1996-97 fiscal year with a $1.42 billion surplus, the
1997-98 fiscal year with a $2.04 billion surplus and fiscal 1998-99 with a $1.82
billion surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the budget for the current state fiscal year is about $73 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki Budget Division spokesman Joseph Conway said the administration hopes
the projection of a $625 million surplus is too conservative.
</P>
<P>
	   "We certainly hope that the strong economy will continue to grow the size of
our projected surplus," he said. "The key will be targeting any additional
surplus toward fiscally prudent purposes such as debt reduction, tax cuts and
rainy day reserves."
</P>
<P>
	   All of the 1998-99 budget surplus was set aside so the state can pay for
future expansions of the STAR property tax reduction program.
</P>
<P>
	   For the new $625 million surplus, Pataki has proposed using $300 million on
new tax cuts, $250 million for the state's Debt Reduction Reserve Fund and $75
million for the state's Tax Stabilization Reserve Fund, a "rainy day" fund.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall said there were few warning signs evident in the state's balance
sheet for the first nine months of fiscal 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Personal income tax collections from April to December grew by 10.1 percent
over the same period of fiscal 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
	   Collections of another chief source of state revenue, sales taxes, grew 7.1
percent over the first nine months of fiscal 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no significant, unexpected state expenses from April to December
to eat into the projected surplus, McCall said.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting Monday, the state Legislature's fiscal committees will begin their
annual series of joint hearings on the Pataki's budget proposal and the state's
next budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The local aid portion of the spending plan will be discussed by, among other
local officials, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. He will undoubtedly argue
that the city should get more state aid for education, more general
revenue-sharing aid and other money above what the governor has proposed
spending.

<HEADLINE> White Supremacist Wants Equal Time  </HEADLINE>
   By MARTHA IRVINE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- He is a one-man media-wooing machine -- a would-be
lawyer and self-proclaimed reverend who takes glee in the free air time he's
received to spread his message of hate.
</P>
<P>
	   Few outside Illinois knew who white supremacist Matt Hale was until last
July, when alleged follower Benjamin Smith went on a shooting rampage across
Illinois and Indiana that left nine wounded and three dead, including Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   Hale -- who claims he does not advocate violence -- now sells T-shirts
proclaiming Smith a martyr. He and a few followers continue to paper
neighborhoods with literature from his World Church of the Creator. And now he
wants Northwestern University to officially recognize a student chapter of his
group.
</P>
<P>
	   His presence on campus -- most recently on Friday -- has put a university
long known as a bastion of free speech in a quandary: What lengths can or should
officials there go to keep a self-proclaimed racist and anti-Semite away from
students?
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because we're a private campus, we have the right to regulate -- and we do
every day,'' says Alan Cubbage, vice president for university relations at
Northwestern, where the death of former basketball coach Ricky Byrdsong -- whom
Smith allegedly targeted because he was black -- is still fresh in the minds of
faculty members and students.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It troubles me that Hale is using Northwestern as a launching pad for his
garbage,'' Cubbage adds.
</P>
<P>
	   It also troubled him that he had to cancel a meeting Friday to monitor a
visit Hale made in an attempt to recruit students. The visit turned violent when
Hale and at least two of his supporters scuffled with protesters -- most of whom
were not students.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The true haters are the anti-racists,'' said a bloody-lipped Hale, who
traveled to the Evanston campus from his home in East Peoria and vowed to
continue his fight to form a campus group.
</P>
<P>
	   Three Chicago men, none of them students, were arrested for disorderly
conduct.
</P>
<P>
	   Some university officials -- and some students -- believe the best way to
handle Hale is to ignore him. Cubbage, for example, regularly gives reporters
who call about Hale, including those from the university's newspaper, a hard
time for ``giving Hale ink.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others aren't so sure.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think Matt Hale should be able to claim our space,'' says Beki
Park, a Northwestern sophomore who left a student discussion organized as a
boycott of Hale's visit to take part in the direct protests against his visit.
``I don't think just sitting back is doing any good.''
</P>
<P>
	   Then there's the matter of freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
	   Being a private university does give Northwestern more leeway --
constitutionally -- to keep Hale at bay, says Martin Redish, a law professor at
Northwestern University who specializes in the First Amendment. But he says that
doesn't make the question of how to deal with him -- or how much attention to
pay to him -- much easier.
</P>
<P>
	   ``One should debate how much you want to start selectively censoring views
in a university setting,'' Redish says. ``But that's a moral debate, not a
constitutional one.''
</P>
<P>
	   The American Civil Liberties Union -- however uncomfortably -- sides with
Hale.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think that our First Amendment rights, which have served our
country and our democracy well for 200 years, should be set on their ear because
of Matt Hale -- however repugnant we find what he says,'' says Ed Yohnka, a
spokesman in the ACLU's Chicago office.
</P>
<P>
	   That's fine, say some Hale detractors. But they'll be sure to make their
opinions known, too.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have to take a stand. I don't believe that being silent makes this go
away,'' says Jeffrey Isaac, a political science professor at Indiana University
and a member of Bloomington United, a community group that formed after Smith
killed a Korean student in the Indiana college town.
</P>
<P>
	   His group has chosen to take public -- though separate -- stands against
Hale and his followers, staging public rallies on campus to oppose hate speech
and crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking a page from civil rights organizers, the group also supports the use
of civil lawsuits to fight hate crime. Two Chicago families have already filed
such a lawsuit attempting to hold Hale -- and even Smith's parents --
accountable for the shootings. Other victims, who are awaiting the results of an
FBI investigation of Hale, say they are considering similar lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   Some wonder whether such lawsuits could have a chilling effect on free
speech. But others -- including lawyers from the Anti-Defamation League -- say
it's worth exploring holding people like Hale responsible for the damage hate
speech may do.
</P>
<P>
	   Rabbi Dov Hillel Klein, a Jewish leader on the Northwestern campus, is
another.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If Matt Hale wants to get up and say he hates Jews and it's true ... and
it's not leading to violence, I may not like it,'' Klein says. ``But it's very
different than creating a discourse that can only lead to one thing -- the
killing and maiming of others.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Leads in Iowa, N.H. Polls  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore has a strong lead over Bill Bradley in Iowa polls
just days before the state's presidential caucuses, while several New Hampshire
polls indicate Gore has an edge over Bradley in a very close Democratic contest.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls in Iowa have given Gore more than a 20-point edge and a new
survey in Iowa gave him an even larger lead, 63 percent-to-26 percent, over the
former New Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Republicans, Texas Gov. George W. Bush has been about 20 points or
more ahead of Steve Forbes in recent Iowa polls. And he was ahead 54 percent to
18 percent in the Heartland Poll by the University of Iowa Social Science
Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   In the New Hampshire Republican race, Bush and McCain remain very close:
They are tied in a Los Angeles Times poll, while McCain has an edge in a
tracking poll by the American Research Group and Bush has an edge in a Newsweek
poll.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iowa caucuses are Monday and the New Hampshire primary is Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Likely Democratic voters in the Heartland Poll in Iowa saw Gore as stronger
than Bradley on international affairs, the economy and even health care,
Bradley's centerpiece issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Confidence in Gore on international matters has grown steadily since
November, while confidence in Bradley on this issue has dropped, according to
the Heartland Poll, which did not have a November-to-January comparison on
health care.
</P>
<P>
	   Arthur Miller, director of the Heartland Poll, said previously undecided
voters now were picking Gore by a 2-1 margin. And Gore's advantage over Bradley
on handling the economy has more than doubled from a 15-point difference in late
summer to more than a 35-point difference now.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The thing that really struck me the most is how much shifting around is
going on in the closing of the race,'' Miller said, noting the latest Heartland
Poll reinterviewed people questioned in the December poll.
</P>
<P>
	   While the front-runners seem to be holding big leads in Iowa, he said, the
movement still could offer some surprises in the margins and final order of the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Heartland Poll of 660 likely voters in the Iowa caucus had an overall
error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points, larger for subgroups like
Democrats and Republicans. The Times poll of 427 likely New Hampshire voters in
the Democratic primary and 516 likely voters in the Republican primary had an
error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points for likely Republican voters
and 5 percentage points for likely Democratic voters. Both polls were taken Jan.
16 through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Democrats, the latest polls indicate Gore may have slowed Bradley's
momentum in New Hampshire, where Gore has an edge in three recent polls and is
tied with Bradley in a fourth.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, Gore had a slight lead in four new polls, CNN-Time,
Newsweek, a tracking poll by the American Research Group and one by The Los
Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
	   A Mason-Dixon poll published Saturday in the Concord Monitor has the race
between the two Democrats too close to call.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Newsweek poll, more than half of those polled said Gore is ``likely
to get things done as president,'' while a third said that about Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore built a slight in the Los Angeles Times poll by getting strong support
from women and cutting down Bradley's previous advantage among men. And Gore
split the support of the independent, or undeclared, voters with Bradley, whose
earlier strength was built largely on support from that group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bradley had been doing extremely well among undeclared voters,'' said
Susan Pinkus, director of the Times poll. ``They play a role that could change
the election. They're like the wild card in New Hampshire.''

<HEADLINE> Oil Spill Spotted in Gulf of Mexico  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN CLENDENNING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A crude oil slick floated on the Gulf of Mexico on
Saturday after an underwater pipeline was ruptured by an 8-ton anchor dropped
accidentally from a drilling rig.
</P>
<P>
	   The slick was floating slowly westward, about 115 miles south of New Orleans
and 75 miles south of the closest land, and did not pose an immediate threat to
coastal areas, Coast Guard spokesman Jason Neubauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   No dead birds or fish had been spotted.
</P>
<P>
	   Airplanes were used to spread a chemical to disperse the oil, and five oil
recovery boats were sent to the area, Neubauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 77,000 gallons of oil poured into the water on Friday, creating a
slick two miles long and two miles wide. The size of the slick on Saturday was
not immediately determined, Neubauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The drill rig was being towed to a new location Friday when the anchor
dropped into water 440 feet deep and snagged the pipeline, dragging it and
causing several breaks, Neubauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pipeline, owned by Equilon Pipeline Co. of New Orleans, was shut down
after monitoring systems detected a pressure drop, said Mary Dokianos, a
spokesman for Shell, which is a partial owner of Equilon.
</P>
<P>
	   The owner of the drill rig, Transocean Sedco Forex Inc. of Houston, said the
accident was caused by a malfunction in the rig's anchor winch. No one was hurt.

<HEADLINE> Hateful Remarks Ignite Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By CHELSEA J. CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LAGUNA BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- It began with a homophobic remark -- dirty
words yelled out a car window as William Petrasich walked along a street in
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
	   When he told police, Petrasich was turned away. No crime committed, they
said.
</P>
<P>
	   So he took his case public in a letter-writing campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   The result is a new police policy of documenting hate speech -- even when no
crime is committed. The policy has ignited a debate about free speech in this
Orange County oceanside resort community.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When the government starts to record what people say, is your speech
really free?'' said Peter Eliasberg of the American Civil Liberties Union in Los
Angeles. ``If the speech is protected, the government has no business of keeping
track of it. They are trampling on the Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
	   But those who have been targeted by such remarks say it's a matter of safety
and being able to walk the streets without fear of harassment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I respect the First Amendment, but I also have a right to be free of
verbal assault,'' said Petrasich, an attorney at 20th Century Fox studios. He is
also gay.
</P>
<P>
	   A handful of police departments around the country have been documenting
racist remarks for years. Police in West Hollywood, Calif., file reports on such
incidents. In New York City, the Bias Crime Investigations Unit is dedicated to
documenting and investigating racist actions, including hateful remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   The ACLU, however, says hate speech is a gray area and Eliasberg says he
plans to keep an eye on such policies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Ethnic and gender labels are protected so long as they do not pose a
reasonable fear of eminent harm,'' Eliasberg said. ``We may not like that kind
of speech, but it is protected.''
</P>
<P>
	   Laguna Beach, which has a prominent gay population, sits along the famed
Pacific Coast Highway that serves as a main traffic artery on the state's scenic
coast. The city is known nationally for its arts community, punctuated by a slew
of boutiques and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to city officials, Petrasich recounted his experience as a
tourist during a weekend trip to the city in October. He said an anti-gay remark
was hurled at him by a passing motorist.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Yeah, they drove off. But I didn't know if they were going to come back
for Round 2,'' he said. ``It was so bad I returned to my hotel and didn't go out
for the rest of the evening.''
</P>
<P>
	   Around the same time, several other anti-gay incidents occurred, including a
water balloon thrown at a gay man at a restaurant and a group of teens who
sprayed another gay man with a fire extinguisher.
</P>
<P>
	   Although there is no written policy, Police Chief James Spreine said
officers were instructed in December to start taking incident reports.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The message we're sending is we want you to come to Laguna Beach and feel
safe,'' he said. ``We're going to treat it very seriously.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since December, the police department has not received any complaints that
it considered significant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not Nazi, Germany. I'm not Hitler. We're not creating secret
files,'' Spreine said. ``Just driving by and making a statement is not a crime.
But I think the incident should be documented.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``What do I do with it? Nothing. But if the person later becomes a victim of
a crime, we can look back and ... maybe come up with a lead,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Since Spreine announced the policy, the police department has been inundated
with telephone calls and letters. Concerns have been raised in local newspapers
and on talk radio shows.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Laguna will rue the jackboots and matching bag of the ACLU,'' wrote Carmen
Langford of nearby Newport Beach.
</P>
<P>
	   But Stu Saffer, managing editor of the weekly Coastline News, said much of
the debate is being held outside of city limits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People in this town do not do anything to embarrass it,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Citywide coalition formed to fight police brutality  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - A coalition of community boards from across the city
gathered Saturday to announce the formation of a new group aimed at curbing
police brutality.
<P>
	   Members from 21 community boards in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens and the
Bronx met at the offices of the New York Civil Liberties Union to announce the
formation of the Caucus to Stop Police Brutality.
</P>
<P>
	   "This campaign is not to bash cops, but to work with police to improve
community relations," said Norman Siegel, head of the NYCLU. "People want to see
some systemic change."
</P>
<P>
	   The caucus arose out of a series of NYCLU meetings with various community
board members in 1999. According to Siegel, police brutality - most prominently
in the assault on Abner Louima and the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo - emerged
as a citywide concern.
</P>
<P>
	   "We discovered that this is not exclusively an African-American issue, or a
Latino issue, but an issue for everyone," Siegel said after a news conference
announcing the start of the caucus.
</P>
<P>
	   The group issued a series of recommendations for fighting police brutality,
including:
</P>
<P>
	   - The creation of a special prosecutor to investigate such cases.
</P>
<P>
	   - The end of the "48 hour rule," which gives police officers a two-day grace
period from speaking with investigators once officers are identified as criminal
suspects.
</P>
<P>
	   - Enacting a law requiring police officers to live in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   Siegel acknowledged that he doesn't believe the new organization will
succeed immediately where past efforts have proven fruitless.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're not politically naive," said Siegel. "We very likely won't see the
changes we're talking about until 2002. But to see that, we have to make it an
issue now."

<HEADLINE> Skakel Arrest Hits Prominent Family  </HEADLINE>
   By HELEN O'NEILL and DENISE LAVOIE Associated Press Writers
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Born to a life of privilege and wealth, burdened by
a family name that expected so much, Michael Skakel seems never to have quite
found his way.
</P>
<P>
	   Sure, he savored the trappings of wealth, the stately mansions, the whirl of
weekend parties, the ski trips, private planes, country clubs and golf. Most of
all he savored the heady invincibility of being a Kennedy -- even a Kennedy
once-removed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rambunctious, bratty, arrogant and rich,'' is how Greenwich author Tim
Dumas describes the Skakel he remembers from his youth. ``There was always a
sense of, Ooh, one of the Kennedys. He made sure that everyone was very aware of
that pedigree.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the pedigree haunted Skakel as much as helped him. Last Wednesday, the
nephew of Ethel Kennedy was charged with the murder of his 15-year old neighbor,
Martha Moxley. Her battered body was found under a pine tree at her home on
Halloween 25 years ago. She had been bludgeoned to death with a golf club that
was traced to the Skakel home.
</P>
<P>
	   In a town filled with prominent families, the Skakels were one of the most
prominent. Michael Skakel, 39, the fifth of seven children, grew up in Belle
Haven, a gated shoreline community where children attend private schools and
parents play golf at private clubs. His father, industrialist Rushton Walter
Skakel, is the brother of Ethel Skakel Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael, then 15, and his 17-year-old brother, Thomas, were suspects from
the start. Both brothers had a romantic interest in the popular Martha and both
had partied with her and other teen-agers the night she died.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially cooperative with police, the Skakel family soon closed ranks,
sending Michael into rehab while Thomas left the country. Over the years there
was much speculation, including three books and a made-for-TV movie, but the
murder remained unsolved.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1991, interest rekindled during the William Kennedy Smith trial, when a
rumor circulated that he had been at the Skakel house the night of Moxley's
murder. Though false, the rumor prompted a re-investigation, eventually leading
to Skakel's arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   And so, Michael Skakel returned from Florida last week to his boyhood home,
and turned himself in to Greenwich police. His bloated face surprised those who
knew the skinny, long-haired teen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Old friends were shocked by his appearance,'' said Dumas, who wrote a book
about the case in 1998, focusing on the culture of wealth in Greenwich. ``He
looked nothing like the Michael they remembered.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dumas, who attended summer camp with Skakel, remembers an energetic,
charismatic teenager. But he also describes an unhinged quality, which Dumas
attributes to a long illness suffered by Skakel's mother, Anne, who died of
cancer when Michael was 13.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The family fell apart after her death,'' Dumas said.
</P>
<P>
	   Others recall a lack of parental supervision: unruly parties at the Skakel
mansion, heavy drinking among the siblings, nannies and live-in tutors who
couldn't control them, police who turned a blind eye to their pranks.
</P>
<P>
	   They ``knew they could pretty well do what they wanted and not have to worry
about the consequences,'' wrote former Los Angeles detective Mark Fuhrman in his
recent book on the Moxley case.
</P>
<P>
	   In such an atmosphere, Skakel floundered, performing poorly at the private
Brunswick School, developing an alcohol problem at an early age.
</P>
<P>
	   Dumas said boyhood friends repeatedly spoke of Skakel's ``Jeckyl and Hyde''
personality, about how he lavished gifts on them but boasted of beating cats and
squirrels to death with golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the truth to the stories, Skakel did have problems. In 1978, after
leading police on a high speed chase in Windham, N.Y., Skakel was sent to the
Elan School in Poland Spring, Me., a private school for teens with drug and
alcohol problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was just your average good-looking kid who worked very hard on his
problems and tried to change himself,'' said Joseph Ricci, founder of the
school.
</P>
<P>
	   In court papers, a prosecutor quoted former Elan residents as saying Ricci
overheard Skakel ``make admissions as to the murder of Martha Moxley.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ricci denies anything was said in his presence and defends his former
student, saying Skakel should be allowed to get on with his life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Kennedy family has gone from Camelot in America right to Dante's
Inferno,'' Ricci said. ``One wonders when are they going to stop persecuting
this family which has been fraught with tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the Kennedys seem to have disowned this particular tragedy, and Skakel
himself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the Kennedys hate him,'' said Dominick Dunne, author of yet
another book on the case, a 1993 fictional account titled ``A Season in
Purgatory.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the beginning, however, the Kennedy connection was a charm.
</P>
<P>
	   After a decade drifting in and out of rehabilitation centers, Skakel
graduated from Curry College in Milton, Mass., in May 1993 with a bachelor's in
English.
</P>
<P>
	   He worked as an aide on Sen. Edward Kennedy's 1994 re-election campaign
before joining his cousin, Michael Kennedy, in 1995 at Citizens Energy Corp., a
Boston nonprofit. In 1996, he went to Cuba with cousins Michael and Robert
Kennedy to meet Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   He got married and moved to Cohasset, Mass., where his wife, Margot, worked
as a golf pro. They had a son, Steven, now 2. At last, Skakel's life seemed to
be on track.
</P>
<P>
	   And then a Kennedy sex scandal unraveled it all.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Skakel was identified as the main contact with prosecutors
investigating Michael Kennedy's alleged extramarital affair with his children's
underage baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Kennedy's hated what he did to his cousin by being the whistle-blower
on the affair,'' Dunne said. Michael Kennedy later died in a skiing accident in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dumas suggests that the baby-sitting incident was torture for Skakel in
another way. Friends believed his involvement was part of a conscientious effort
to discourage it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think Michael felt in a real spot between that family and the Kennedy
family,'' Dumas said. ``It really stung him, when the Kennedy's said `You're
out.'''
</P>
<P>
	   But out he was, without a job.
</P>
<P>
	   He moved to Hobe Sound, Fla., where he lives with his wife and son in a
complex with his father and brother, Rushton Skakel Jr. He became involved in
volunteer work, going on several overseas missions with AmeriCares, a disaster
relief organization where his brother, Stephen, is vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   He continued to profess his innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   For friends, the real irony of Skakel's arrest is the timing. Just as his
life seemed stable for the first time, his past came crashing down.
</P>
<P>
	   Because he was 15 at the time of the crime, Skakel will be arraigned Feb. 8
in juvenile court. He will be taken back 25 years, to a time when he was a
juvenile, when he had a crush on a girl named Martha, when a night of teen-age
partying turned deadly.

<HEADLINE> Oil Spill Spotted in Gulf of Mexico  </HEADLINE>
   By ALAN CLENDENNING Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- A crude oil slick floated on the Gulf of Mexico on
Saturday after an underwater pipeline was ruptured by an 8-ton anchor dropped
accidentally from a drilling rig.
</P>
<P>
	   The slick was floating slowly westward, about 115 miles south of New Orleans
and 75 miles south of the closest land, and did not pose an immediate threat to
coastal areas, Coast Guard spokesman Jason Neubauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   No dead birds or fish had been spotted.
</P>
<P>
	   Airplanes were used to spread a chemical to disperse the oil, and five oil
recovery boats were sent to the area, Neubauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   About 77,000 gallons of oil poured into the water on Friday, creating a
slick two miles long and two miles wide. On Saturday, the slick was roughly the
same width but had stretched to seven miles long, Neubauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The drill rig was being towed to a new location Friday when the anchor
dropped into water 440 feet deep and snagged the pipeline, dragging it and
causing several breaks, Neubauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pipeline, owned by Equilon Pipeline Co. of New Orleans, was shut down
after monitoring systems detected a pressure drop, said Mary Dokianos, a
spokesman for Shell, which is a partial owner of Equilon.
</P>
<P>
	   The owner of the drill rig, Transocean Sedco Forex Inc. of Houston, said the
accident was caused by a malfunction in the rig's anchor winch. No one was hurt.

<HEADLINE> Letters: Ellison Agonized Over Epic  </HEADLINE>
   By HILLEL ITALIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- To the public, Ralph Ellison's classic novel is known
simply as ``Invisible Man.'' In private, as he agonized over the manuscript, the
author dreamed up more colorful nicknames: ``My endless you-know-what,'' ``my
six hundred page obsession'' and the ``switch-bladed confession.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ellison took seven years to complete ``Invisible Man,'' an epic narrative on
race and identity published to great acclaim in 1952 and still widely read
today. When he needed to confess a worry, share a joke or work out an idea, he
often wrote to his friend Albert Murray, an influential novelist and critic.
</P>
<P>
	   Their correspondence is compiled in ``Trading Twelves,'' to be published in
June by the Modern Library.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The letters between Ellison and Murray are the bounty of a rare and
spontaneous friendship in which each taps into the deepest experience of the
other,'' Ellison's literary executor, John F. Callahan, writes in the
introduction.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Trading Twelves,'' which covers the years 1949-60, includes exchanges on
literature, music (Murray was a friend of Duke Ellington and other jazz
performers) and politics. It's also a record of two idealists determined to
expand and enrich the perceptions of black people.
</P>
<P>
	   Ellison writes of William Faulkner, an author he otherwise admired: ``He
thinks that Negroes exist simply to give ironic overtone to the viciousness of
white folks.''
</P>
<P>
	   ''(W)e're trying ... to free ourselves; thoroughly and completely, so that
when we got the crackers off our back we can discover what we really are and
what we really wish to preserve out of the experience that made us.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ellison and Murray met in the mid 1930s as students at the Tuskegee
Institute in Alabama. They became friends and intellectual comrades, united in
their crusade to celebrate the sophistication of jazz and black folklore.
Ellison died in 1994. Murray, now 83, is a longtime resident of Harlem.
</P>
<P>
	   The letters begin with Ellison and Murray working on their first novels.
Ellison writes hopefully that both will have books out in 1950. But Murray
didn't publish a novel until the 1970s. Ellison didn't wrap up ``Invisible Man''
until 1952 and spent the rest of his life working on his next novel, edited
posthumously by Callahan and published last year as ``Juneteenth.''
</P>
<P>
	   Impatient to finish a book he's sure will make history, Ellison makes poetry
just out of describing ``Invisible Man.'' It's ``my endless you-know-what,'' the
``switch-bladed confession'' and ``my six hundred page monster.'' He wonders if
``it's a rock around my neck; a dream, a nasty compulsive dream which I no
longer write but now am acting out, or is it a kind of death a dying?
</P>
<P>
	   ``Certainly,'' he writes, ``after it's all over and done up in binders I
will have passed through the goddamnedest experience of my life and shall never
be the same.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ellison was as immodest as he was insecure. He likens himself to a
``self-doubting god'' unsure of the world he's created. He likens the multiple
voices and styles of ``Invisible Man'' to a jazz jam, imagining his characters
as members of the Ellington orchestra, with Ellison standing in for the maestro
himself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Boy, I really think I got me some soloists in there near about as good as
old Cootie and Rex and Johnny and Ben Webster and Harry Carney,'' he writes,
``but you also got to have a pianist-arranger like old Duke to make them cats
really blow, and naturally THAT'S got me worried.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ellison fussed over transitions. His publisher, Random House, heeded the
censors. The original manuscript for ``Invisible Man'' contained explicit
passages that never made it to print. One involved a most unorthodox application
of sour cream.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was too ripe for 'em man,'' an amused Ellison reported. ``They called
me and said, 'Mr. E, that sour cream just naturally has to go.'''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Invisible Man'' won the National Book Award and stayed on bestseller lists
for months, but the letters show both writers impatient for the next novel. In
1953, Ellison complains that his new book has proved as much a strain as putting
on ``my first pair of long pants.'' Murray sounds like a manager pushing his
star back on stage for an encore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Get with it, Jasper,'' he writes, ``they ain't seen nothing yet -- ain't
heard nothing yet. Remember, you're the goddamned trumpet player, and you
already got 'em clapping their hands and patting their feet.''

<HEADLINE> Skakel Arrest Hits Prominent Family  </HEADLINE>
   By HELEN O'NEILL and DENISE LAVOIE Associated Press Writers
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Born to a life of privilege and wealth, burdened by
a family name that expected so much, Michael Skakel seems never to have quite
found his way.
</P>
<P>
	   Sure, he savored the trappings of wealth, the stately mansions, the whirl of
weekend parties, the ski trips, private planes, country clubs and golf. Most of
all he savored the heady invincibility of being a Kennedy -- even a Kennedy
once-removed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rambunctious, bratty, arrogant and rich,'' is how Greenwich author Tim
Dumas describes the Skakel he remembers from his youth. ``There was always a
sense of, Ooh, one of the Kennedys. He made sure that everyone was very aware of
that pedigree.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the pedigree haunted Skakel as much as helped him. Last Wednesday, the
nephew of Ethel Kennedy was charged with the murder of his 15-year old neighbor,
Martha Moxley. Her battered body was found under a pine tree at her home on
Halloween 25 years ago. She had been bludgeoned to death with a golf club that
was traced to the Skakel home.
</P>
<P>
	   In a town filled with prominent families, the Skakels were one of the most
prominent. Michael Skakel, 39, the fifth of seven children, grew up in Belle
Haven, a gated shoreline community where children attend private schools and
parents play golf at private clubs. His father, industrialist Rushton Walter
Skakel, is the brother of Ethel Skakel Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael, then 15, and his 17-year-old brother, Thomas, were suspects from
the start. Both brothers had a romantic interest in the popular Martha and both
had partied with her and other teen-agers the night she died.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially cooperative with police, the Skakel family soon closed ranks,
sending Michael into rehab while Thomas left the country. Over the years there
was much speculation, including three books and a made-for-TV movie, but the
murder remained unsolved.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1991, interest rekindled during the William Kennedy Smith trial, when a
rumor circulated that he had been at the Skakel house the night of Moxley's
murder. Though false, the rumor prompted a re-investigation, eventually leading
to Skakel's arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   And so, Michael Skakel returned from Florida last week to his boyhood home,
and turned himself in to Greenwich police. His bloated face surprised those who
knew the skinny, long-haired teen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Old friends were shocked by his appearance,'' said Dumas, who wrote a book
about the case in 1998, focusing on the culture of wealth in Greenwich. ``He
looked nothing like the Michael they remembered.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dumas, who attended summer camp with Skakel, remembers an energetic,
charismatic teenager. But he also describes an unhinged quality, which Dumas
attributes to a long illness suffered by Skakel's mother, Anne, who died of
cancer when Michael was 13.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The family fell apart after her death,'' Dumas said.
</P>
<P>
	   Others recall a lack of parental supervision: unruly parties at the Skakel
mansion, heavy drinking among the siblings, nannies and live-in tutors who
couldn't control them, police who turned a blind eye to their pranks.
</P>
<P>
	   They ``knew they could pretty well do what they wanted and not have to worry
about the consequences,'' wrote former Los Angeles detective Mark Fuhrman in his
recent book on the Moxley case.
</P>
<P>
	   In such an atmosphere, Skakel floundered, performing poorly at the private
Brunswick School, developing an alcohol problem at an early age.
</P>
<P>
	   Dumas said boyhood friends repeatedly spoke of Skakel's ``Jeckyl and Hyde''
personality, about how he lavished gifts on them but boasted of beating cats and
squirrels to death with golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the truth to the stories, Skakel did have problems. In 1978, after
leading police on a high speed chase in Windham, N.Y., Skakel was sent to the
Elan School in Poland Spring, Maine, a private school for teens with drug and
alcohol problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was just your average good-looking kid who worked very hard on his
problems and tried to change himself,'' said Joseph Ricci, founder of the
school.
</P>
<P>
	   In court papers, a prosecutor quoted former Elan residents as saying Ricci
overheard Skakel ``make admissions as to the murder of Martha Moxley.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ricci denies anything was said in his presence and defends his former
student, saying Skakel should be allowed to get on with his life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Kennedy family has gone from Camelot in America right to Dante's

this family which has been fraught with tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the Kennedys seem to have disowned this particular tragedy, and Skakel

<HEADLINE> Towns, schools to get $547 million more in state aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - New Jersey schools would get a 7 percent increase
in state aid, while municipalities would see a 3 percent jump in state funding,
under Gov. Christie Whitman's proposed spending plan.
<P>
	   The governor wants to spend a total of $547 million more in state aid for
municipal services and public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   A total of about $1 billion would be sent back to taxpayers under existing
rebate programs and the property tax deduction allowed on state income taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Some parts of the fiscal 2001 budget, which begins in July, were outlined
Saturday. Whitman is scheduled to deliver her budget address Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the additional local spending comes from a $482 million increase in
school aid. Total state aid to schools would be about $6.7 billion - or nearly
one-third of the proposed $21.3 million spending plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the education aid increase - $380 million - is dictated under the
state's school funding formula.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Whitman has earmarked $21.5 million more for new initiatives,
including a mentoring program to pair veteran teaches with novices during their
first two years in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials refused to discuss plans to fund a multi-billion-dollar
proposed school construction program, expected to be the largest in state
history. Whitman plans to unveil that proposal herself on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   But she is expected to dip into a multi-billion-dollar settlement with
tobacco companies. New Jersey's share of that settlement is estimated at about
$7.6 billion over 25 years, if the state's deal holds up to court challenges.
</P>
<P>
	   State treasurer Roland Machold said New Jersey is scheduled to receive a
total of $471 million in tobacco payments in the coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   Of that, $174 million has been earmarked for a new health insurance program
for families, tobacco control efforts and other programs.
</P>
<P>
	   That leaves $297 million unaccounted for. Machold said at least some of that
money would be used for "capital projects," which would likely include school
construction.
</P>
<P>
	   Also not included in the additional school aid is a promised $70 million for
public preschools in 30 of New Jersey's poorest districts. That money is coming
from federal welfare funds, said Mary Lou Murphy, treasury department
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey is under order from the state Supreme Court to provide public
preschool. Whitman has been dipping into different pots of money to meet that
mandate, including federal welfare money that allows states to spend it on
daycare for welfare mothers.
</P>
<P>
	   Regular aid to municipalities would increase about $66 million - or about 3
percent - to about $1.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Dressel, executive director of the New Jersey League of Municipalities,
said the increase is nice, but not nearly enough, especially considering an $850
million budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   "Since 1994, inflation has increased the cost of local programs 17.5
percent," said Dressel. "It seems to us taking $300 million out of state surplus
for municipal funding programs will be a step forward in achieving real property
tax relief."
</P>
<P>
	   But Whitman holds up her rebate program as real property tax relief. In its
second year, New Jersey Saver will get an additional $166 million, for a total
of $367 million.
</P>
<P>
	   That means the average property taxpayer would receive a $240 rebate this
fall - double the $120 they received last year, Machold said.

<HEADLINE> Four Young Siblings Mourned in Pa.  </HEADLINE>
   By TIM MOLLOY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRYBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Small groups of men and boys dressed in black trudged
across the snow-covered plains Saturday, leading a procession of horse-drawn
buggies toward a hilltop cemetery.
</P>
<P>
	   Four small graves had been dug for the bodies of four young Amish siblings
who died Thursday when their farmhouse burned.
</P>
<P>
	   The oldest, Moses, was 5.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators suspect a kerosene lamp in one of the children's bedroom's
started the fire while Levi and Anna Mast finished the morning chores in a
nearby barn.
</P>
<P>
	   Mast tried to reach the children, but the heat was too intense. The
two-story home had no electricity and the nearest phone was half a mile away. By
the time firefighters arrived, the farmhouse was engulfed in flames.
</P>
<P>
	   About 30 buggies from Amish farms across the region began arriving early
Saturday in Fryburg, a tiny farming and lumber village of 30 families.
</P>
<P>
	   The children's grandfather, Elmer Mast, said many of the 200 mourners would
return to help Levi Mast build a new house. A stone foundation and charred beams
were all that remained after the fire.
</P>
<P>
	   The home had no smoke alarms, phone or electricity because the community,
part of an ultra-conservative branch known as Troyer Amish, believes in a life
without modern conveniences.
</P>
<P>
	   The Troyer Amish began in Holmes County, Ohio, in the 1930s, and later built
communities in Ontario, western New York and Pennsylvania, said Steve Scott of
the Young Center for the Study of Anabapist and Pietist Groups at Elizabethtown
College.
</P>
<P>
	   While some Amish groups allow gas kitchen ranges and smoke detectors, the
Troyer Amish use ice-cooled refrigerators and coal- or wood-burning stoves.
</P>
<P>
	   The families who settled in Fryburg believe it is wrong to have modern
technology in their homes, said John Mast, 37, Anna's brother.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't think it's God's intended way,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Whitman to propose new highway funds with no tax hike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman will propose Monday to hike
borrowing but not taxes to renew the soon-to-expire state fund that pays for new
roads, bridges and mass transit.
<P>
	   Under the deal reportedly hammered out with Republican legislative leaders,
Whitman would tap $250 million in budget funds and borrow $750 million to renew
the Transportation Trust Fund, which is due to run out in June.
</P>
<P>
	   Coupled with $1 billion in matching federal dollars, the refreshed fund
would pay for $2 billion worth of new transportation projects each year for the
next two to three years, under the plan detailed by Whitman administration
officials Saturday. The governor will include it in her proposed $21.3 billion
budget, which she will unveil on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters already approved $170 million of the borrowing Whitman wants to plug
into the fund, last November. The governor would go into the bond market to
borrow the remaining $580 million to bring total borrowing to $750 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The new state funding would supplement the $480 million in annual gas tax
and other revenues that already support the fund. But the fund needs the extra
state revenue to pay debt on new projects, officials explained.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan is a "hybrid" of one floated by Senate President Donald DiFrancesco
last year, said Whitman Chief Counsel Richard Mroz. Like his, it does not raise
taxes. Unlike his, it does not constitutionally dedicate state funds to
transportation.
</P>
<P>
	   "The bottom line is, we have a program and it's good for everybody," Mroz
said.
</P>
<P>
	   A DiFrancesco spokeswoman said the Senate president is on board with the
governor, but still wants to pursue his idea of dedicating funds for
transportation in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
	   "Renewing the plan without raising taxes, that was the gist of his plan,"
said spokeswoman Rae Hutton.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Assembly Speaker Jack Collins could not be reached for
comment Saturday. Collins, who was cool to DiFrancesco's plan was it was first
announced late last year, previously left open the possibility of raising the
10.5 gas tax to pay for the new fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Collins in 1998 scuttled Whitman's proposal to raise the tax by 4 cents over
three years because Democrats in the Assembly would not agree to vote for it.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter McDonough, the governor's spokesman, said Whitman recognized that a
gas tax hike would again fail in the Legislature. Hence, the plan to use
existing state funds and borrow the rest, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   State Treasurer Roland Machold said borrowing to refresh the fund will add a
"moderate" amount to the state's total debt. "But bonding is not inappropriate
when you're building a long term asset," he said of highways and bridges.
</P>
<P>
	   Actual projects to be financed by a new Transportation Trust Fund will be
announced by state officials later in the year.

    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers told Attorney General
Janet Reno "how much they are suffering" over the 6-year-old's continued stay in
the United States and appealed for help Saturday in reuniting the youngster with
his father in Cuba.
<P>
	   The grandmothers gave her a letter expressing the wish that Elian be
returned to "the normality of life with his father, brother, family, friends at
schools, his toys, dog and parrot." Reno was said to have shown "enormous
compassion."
</P>
<P>
	   Mariela Quintana, paternal grandmother of 6-year-old Elian, and maternal
grandmother Raquel Rodriguez did not speak to reporters after the 45-minute
meeting at the Justice Department. But their three-paragraph letter was
released, and officials of the U.S. and Cuban Council of Churches described
their sentiments afterwards.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment from the Justice Department, although Reno
was expected to issue a statement. Also attending the meeting with Doris
Meissner, the Immigration and Naturalization Service commissioner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Very Rev. Oden Marichal, head of the Cuban church group, told reporters,
"The two grandmothers expressed how much they are suffering because of this
separation from their family on behalf of Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   "This has been a very good opportunity for them to express their deep
feeling as grandmothers to the (attorney general) asking the return of Elian to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "We understand that grandchildren belong to every grandfather and
grandmother."
</P>
<P>
	   The INS Service has ordered the boy returned to Cuba. Reno has agreed,
saying the youngster belongs with his father in the communist island where he
was raised. The grandmothers sought the meeting with Reno and Meissner, U.S.
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Representatives of the National Council of Churches, representing mainline
Protestant denominations, have been serving as the grandmothers' hosts during
their stay of undetermined length in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Bob Edgar, a former Democratic House member and general secretary
of the church organization, said the grandmothers "shared with the attorney
general their pain in the loss of this grandchild. Both grandmothers articulated
as clearly as anyone could the hunger and passion that they have to return their
grandchild to Cuba."
</P>
<P>
	   Edgar said the grandmothers' only plans at this point were to return
Saturday to New York City. No plans have been announced for them to visit the
boy, who is with his Miami relatives, or to return home. But they wrote in their
letter: "We only have Sunday to see Elian, and we not only want to see him, but
we also want to return with him to Cuba."
</P>
<P>
	   Edgar told reporters that Saturday's meeting was intended "to open the
dialogue and the conversation" with Reno. "The grandmothers had a wonderful
opportunity to speak to them and that's really all that I can say at this time."
</P>
<P>
	   He said Reno "showed enormous compassion for these two courageous women.
There was a long opportunity where they simply talked back and forth with each
other. It was a very personal meeting."
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been in the middle of a custody fight between the U.S. relatives
in Miami's politically powerful Cuban community and the father and grandmothers
living in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The fight has escalated far beyond a family feud, becoming the latest
centerpiece of the decades-long battle between anti-Castro Cubans and Cuban
President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov.
25 after the boat taking him to the United States capsized, killing his mother,
her boyfriend and nine other people.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers' letter said Elian's stay in the United States "adds to the
tragedy of the family over the loss" of the boy's mother, Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
	   They expressed gratitude that the U.S. government had affirmed the paternity
rights of father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, but expressed frustration over the
prolonged custody fight.
</P>
<P>
	   "We ask that you return Elian to his immediate family and not to his distant
family where there had not been a previous relationship. This is the reason for
being here, and we thank you for this interview," the grandmothers wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The case could be settled in the courts or in Congress. Attorneys for the
boy's relatives in Florida have asked a federal court to prevent Elian's return
before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   But the court may be in a race with Congress, where lawmakers plan an
attempt this week to declare Elian a U.S. citizen. If such legislation becomes
law, the boy no longer would be an immigrant under INS jurisdiction.

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Squabble Over Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Hitting every corner of this sprawling state,
Republicans squabbled over abortion and taxes in a fight for their conservative
base Sunday, as presidential candidates in both major parties braved nasty
weather to rally supporters to Iowa's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every vote matters!'' said GOP front-runner George W. Bush, who attempted
to burnish his anti-abortion credentials for a third consecutive day. The Texas
governor pledged to keep the abortion plank in a staunchly conservative GOP
platform.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday night, about 10 percent of the state's 1.8 million registered
voters are expected to gather in living rooms, schools, church basements and
fire stations to announce their support of candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Few convention delegates are at stake, but the real reward in Iowa and the
Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary is momentum: Campaigns can take flight or lose
altitude in the first two contests of the presidential year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to make a good showing maybe and surprise a lot of people,''
said former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, the sole rival to Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president holds a wide lead over Bradley in Iowa polls and has
broken out of a long-running tie in New Hampshire surveys.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president played an expectations game of his own design. ``What are
the expectations if Senator Bradley scored a victory? Expectations in the event
that occurred would be that he would do exactly what he said he would do and
take as his model for leadership style ... Ronald Reagan,'' the vice president
told supporters in Fort Dodge.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's irregular heartbeat, a minor condition that dominated his campaign
for the better part of two days, did not come up in a question-and-answer
session in Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was more of a problem.
</P>
<P>
	   A wintry mix of wind and snow made Bradley's motorcade ride through eastern
Iowa a perilous one. The plane carrying Steve Forbes, one of five candidates
stumping the state, made two false approaches to the Mason City runway and
pulled up quickly each time as his pilot had trouble in the murky weather.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane landed on the third attempt. Forbes emerged safe but shaken.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The weather couldn't stop us, and the political establishment is not going
to stop us,'' he said
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the day's more colorful events, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah gave a
foreign policy address in a barroom full of reporters and set the lowest of
expectations for a six-man field: ``I'm going to have to do better than sixth
here, it seems to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Bush, Forbes, Alan Keyes and Gary Bauer all stressed opposition to
abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer, who needs a strong third place to bolster his sagging campaign,
suggested that Forbes is a recent convert to the anti-abortion movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not a Steve-come-lately that believed something three years ago and
believed something different today,'' Bauer said in Waterloo.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning his sights on the front-runner, the Washington activist said,
``Governor Bush is completely out of step with the party he wants to lead.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is opposed to abortion but does not stress it on the campaign trails.
He is looking ahead to the general election, when the issue tends to alienate
swing voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Pressed by reporters, Bush said he was in favor of a party platform that
recommends a constitutional amendment banning abortion. ``I think that the
Republican Party ought to keep its pro-life plank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's anti-abortion position does not extend to cases of rape, incest and
when the mother's life if in danger. Those exceptions are not in the plank, but
Bush said the details of the amendment could be worked out later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first step is to convince Americans that we ought to value life,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides say Bush has made his support of the plank clear in the past, but
questions arose after Bush ducked a question about the platform in a recent
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   A memo sent to hundreds of supporters by his campaign says: ``While Governor
Bush respects those with differing views, he believes the current Republican
Party platform plank on abortion is an important statement of pro-life ideals,
and he does not believe it should be changed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign picked a long-distance fight over taxes, suggesting that
Arizona Sen. John McCain's tax-cutting package would undermine charitable
giving. McCain is the only GOP candidate not competing in Iowa, choosing instead
to focus his campaign on New Hampshire. He is, however, on the Iowa ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is a provision that would close what McCain calls a ``loophole'' by
allowing people who give contributions in forms of stock, real estate, bonds or
art work to get tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said it was yet ``another difference'' between his $483 billion tax-cut
plan and McCain's much smaller package.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain wants to use money from closing the loophole to cut taxes for
middle-class Americans, while Bush is worried about ``a few wealthy Americans
who can get a tax cut when they're done looking at an old painting,'' McCain
spokesman Howard Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a satellite address to conservatives in Washington, Bush said McCain
sounds like a Democrat.

<HEADLINE> Train Car Fire Finally Burns Out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- A fire inside a propane-filled train car burned out
Saturday, ending a tense 24 hours in which scores of homes were evacuated, two
schools were closed and an interstate was shut down.
</P>
<P>
	   No injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Flames were spotted spewing from a valve in the tanker at the CSX rail yard
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
	   Fire officials, fearing it would ignite a half-million gallons of propane in
54 other cars or explode, ordered 600 people from their homes and shut down
nearby Interstate 475.
</P>
<P>
	   Early Saturday, firefighters started a ``vent and burn'' procedure --
explosives were used to blow holes in the top and bottom of the car to release
pressure and gas -- that allowed the fire to burn out more rapidly, Fire Chief
Theron Wiggins said.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents were allowed back into neighborhoods near the rail yard at about
2:30 a.m.

<HEADLINE> Skakel Arrest Hits Prominent Family  </HEADLINE>
   By HELEN O'NEILL and DENISE LAVOIE Associated Press Writers
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) -- Born to a life of privilege and wealth, burdened by
a family name that expected so much, Michael Skakel seems never to have quite
found his way.
</P>
<P>
	   Sure, he savored the trappings of wealth, the stately mansions, the whirl of
weekend parties, the ski trips, private planes, country clubs and golf. Most of
all he savored the heady invincibility of being a Kennedy -- even a Kennedy
once-removed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rambunctious, bratty, arrogant and rich,'' is how Greenwich author Tim
Dumas describes the Skakel he remembers from his youth. ``There was always a
sense of, Ooh, one of the Kennedys. He made sure that everyone was very aware of
that pedigree.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the pedigree haunted Skakel as much as helped him. Last Wednesday, the
nephew of Ethel Kennedy was charged with the murder of his 15-year old neighbor,
Martha Moxley. Her battered body was found under a pine tree at her home on
Halloween 25 years ago. She had been bludgeoned to death with a golf club that
was traced to the Skakel home.
</P>
<P>
	   In a town filled with prominent families, the Skakels were one of the most
prominent. Michael Skakel, 39, the fifth of seven children, grew up in Belle
Haven, a gated shoreline community where children attend private schools and
parents play golf at private clubs. His father, industrialist Rushton Walter
Skakel, is the brother of Ethel Skakel Kennedy, the widow of Sen. Robert F.
Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael, then 15, and his 17-year-old brother, Thomas, were suspects from
the start. Both brothers had a romantic interest in the popular Martha and both
had partied with her and other teen-agers the night she died.
</P>
<P>
	   Initially cooperative with police, the Skakel family soon closed ranks,
sending Michael into rehab while Thomas left the country. Over the years there
was much speculation, including three books and a made-for-TV movie, but the
murder remained unsolved.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1991, interest rekindled during the William Kennedy Smith trial, when a
rumor circulated that he had been at the Skakel house the night of Moxley's
murder. Though false, the rumor prompted a re-investigation, eventually leading
to Skakel's arrest.
</P>
<P>
	   And so, Michael Skakel returned from Florida last week to his boyhood home,
and turned himself in to Greenwich police. His bloated face surprised those who
knew the skinny, long-haired teen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Old friends were shocked by his appearance,'' said Dumas, who wrote a book
about the case in 1998, focusing on the culture of wealth in Greenwich. ``He
looked nothing like the Michael they remembered.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dumas, who attended summer camp with Skakel, remembers an energetic,
charismatic teenager. But he also describes an unhinged quality, which Dumas
attributes to a long illness suffered by Skakel's mother, Anne, who died of
cancer when Michael was 13.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The family fell apart after her death,'' Dumas said.
</P>
<P>
	   Others recall a lack of parental supervision: unruly parties at the Skakel
mansion, heavy drinking among the siblings, nannies and live-in tutors who
couldn't control them, police who turned a blind eye to their pranks.
</P>
<P>
	   They ``knew they could pretty well do what they wanted and not have to worry
about the consequences,'' wrote former Los Angeles detective Mark Fuhrman in his
recent book on the Moxley case.
</P>
<P>
	   In such an atmosphere, Skakel floundered, performing poorly at the private
Brunswick School, developing an alcohol problem at an early age.
</P>
<P>
	   Dumas said boyhood friends repeatedly spoke of Skakel's ``Jekyll and Hyde''
personality, about how he lavished gifts on them but boasted of beating cats and
squirrels to death with golf clubs.
</P>
<P>
	   Whatever the truth to the stories, Skakel did have problems. In 1978, after
leading police on a high speed chase in Windham, N.Y., Skakel was sent to the
Elan School in Poland Spring, Maine, a private school for teens with drug and
alcohol problems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He was just your average good-looking kid who worked very hard on his
problems and tried to change himself,'' said Joseph Ricci, founder of the
school.
</P>
<P>
	   In court papers, a prosecutor quoted former Elan residents as saying Ricci
overheard Skakel ``make admissions as to the murder of Martha Moxley.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ricci denies anything was said in his presence and defends his former
student, saying Skakel should be allowed to get on with his life.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Kennedy family has gone from Camelot in America right to Dante's
Inferno,'' Ricci said. ``One wonders when are they going to stop persecuting
this family which has been fraught with tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the Kennedys seem to have disowned this particular tragedy, and Skakel
himself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the Kennedys hate him,'' said Dominick Dunne, author of yet
another book on the case, a 1993 fictional account titled ``A Season in
Purgatory.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the beginning, however, the Kennedy connection was a charm.
</P>
<P>
	   After a decade drifting in and out of rehabilitation centers, Skakel
graduated from Curry College in Milton, Mass., in May 1993 with a bachelor's in
English.
</P>
<P>
	   He worked as an aide on Sen. Edward Kennedy's 1994 re-election campaign
before joining his cousin, Michael Kennedy, in 1995 at Citizens Energy Corp., a
Boston nonprofit. In 1996, he went to Cuba with cousins Michael and Robert
Kennedy to meet Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   He got married and moved to Cohasset, Mass., where his wife, Margot, worked
as a golf pro. They had a son, Steven, now 2. At last, Skakel's life seemed to
be on track.
</P>
<P>
	   And then a Kennedy sex scandal unraveled it all.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Skakel was identified as the main contact with prosecutors
investigating Michael Kennedy's alleged extramarital affair with his children's
underage baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The Kennedys hated what he did to his cousin by being the whistle-blower
on the affair,'' Dunne said. Michael Kennedy later died in a skiing accident in
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   But Dumas suggests that the baby-sitting incident was torture for Skakel in
another way. Friends believed his involvement was part of a conscientious effort
to discourage it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think Michael felt in a real spot between that family and the Kennedy
family,'' Dumas said. ``It really stung him, when the Kennedys said `You're
out.'''
</P>
<P>
	   But out he was, without a job.
</P>
<P>
	   He moved to Hobe Sound, Fla., where he lives with his wife and son in a
complex with his father and brother, Rushton Skakel Jr. He became involved in
volunteer work, going on several overseas missions with AmeriCares, a disaster
relief organization where his brother, Stephen, is vice president.
</P>
<P>
	   He continued to profess his innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   For friends, the real irony of Skakel's arrest is the timing. Just as his
life seemed stable for the first time, his past came crashing down.
</P>
<P>
	   Because he was 15 at the time of the crime, Skakel will be arraigned Feb. 8
in juvenile court. He will be taken back 25 years, to a time when he was a
juvenile, when he had a crush on a girl named Martha, when a night of teen-age
partying turned deadly.

<HEADLINE> Preservationists Resort to Gambling  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT SONNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- They tried everything else -- petitions, protests,
lawsuits, even an appeal to the Nevada Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
	   None of that worked, so local preservationists trying to save the historic
Mapes Hotel from wrecking crews turned to what people do best in the Biggest
Little City in the World.
</P>
<P>
	   They plugged more than $400 worth of silver dollars into a slot machine to
try to win a $33 million jackpot and buy the vacant hotel-casino that the city
plans to blow up on Jan. 30.
</P>
<P>
	   That didn't work, either, but at least they won their money back.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a true last-ditch effort,'' said Mercedes de la Garza, a local
architect and member of the Truckee Meadows Heritage Trust.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Think what a great story it would have been if we hit it,'' trust
president Toni Harsh said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Members of the group of about 20 activists said it was only fitting to give
Lady Luck some say over the fate of the 12-story, brick, art deco building.
</P>
<P>
	   Built in 1947, the Mapes was the first building in the nation constructed
specifically to house a hotel, casino and live entertainment under one roof.
</P>
<P>
	   During its heyday in the 1950s, entertainers such as Mae West, the Marx
Brothers, Sammy Davis Jr. and Ray Bolger performed in its top-floor,
window-walled Sky Room with its spectacular view of the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
	   Vacant since 1982, the Mapes was added to the National Register of Historic
Places in 1984. The National Trust for Historic Preservation listed the Mapes as
one of America's most endangered historic buildings in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The trust had lost two separate battles in Washoe County District Court in
recent months and the Nevada Supreme Court refused to issue a stay to protect
the building.
</P>
<P>
	   Some people planned to continue trying to win enough money to save the
hotel, but Harsh said the organization was turning its attention to trying to
attract a developer to rehabilitate the building.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are not giving up. There is still time to turn this around if the City
Council would be responsive,'' Harsh said.
</P>
<P>
	   The City Council has rejected several bids to rehabilitate the Mapes,
primarily raising concerns about the financial backing available.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the panel voted Sept. 13 to demolish the Mapes to expand its
riverside district of art galleries, restaurants, retail shops and a 12-screen
movie theater.
</P>
<P>
	   Would $33 million have changed the City Council's mind?
</P>
<P>
	   ``That would be very interesting if they actually hit it. It would almost be
a dispensation from God,'' Councilman Dave Rigdon told the Reno Gazette-Journal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's see once they have cash in hand,'' Councilwoman Sherrie Doyle said.

<HEADLINE> Daewoo Reaches Pact With Creditors  </HEADLINE>
    By SANG-HUN CHOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- South Korea's ailing Daewoo Group and its foreign
creditors agreed Saturday on a plan to address the conglomerate's $4.84 billion
in foreign debt.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal removes the biggest stumbling block to restructuring Daewoo, the
nation's third-largest conglomerate. South Korea sees a successful reform of
Daewoo as a key to its overall economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday's accord came when creditor banks agreed to reclaim only 39 to 40
percent of their loans to Daewoo subsidiaries and regard the remainder as
losses.
</P>
<P>
	   Creditors include Chase Manhattan Corp., HSBC Holdings PLC, Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd., Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd., Citigroup Inc.'s Citibank
unit, ABN Amro Bank NV, National Australia Bank Ltd. and Arab Bank. Their
debt-restructuring talks with Daewoo had dragged on for six months, casting
doubt on a quick recovery for the conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. automakers General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are interested in
taking over Daewoo Motor, South Korea's No. 2 carmaker. Saturday's deal was
expected to expedite the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Today's development marks another important step in the successful
restructuring of the Daewoo companies," said Oh Hogen, chairman of the Korean
Corporate Restructuring Committee, which represented Daewoo's domestic
creditors.
</P>
<P>
	   The sheer size of Daewoo's total debt -- $72 billion -- had made the
government "very concerned," Oh said after the latest round of talks in Hong
Kong. He said Daewoo's debts were "very large and may have a profound effect on
capital markets and the financial industry as a whole."
</P>
<P>
	   Daewoo produces cars, ships, TV sets and textiles, among other products. In
the 1990s, it expanded its domestic and overseas business with huge bank loans.
Its debt soared from $19 billion in 1995 to $72 billion, compared to $15 billion
in equity.
</P>
<P>
	   During the Asian economic crisis, creditors called in short-term loans
accounting for more than half of Daewoo's total borrowing. Since subsidiaries
were cross-funded and had guaranteed each other's debt, the whole conglomerate
began to crumble.
</P>
<P>
	   Daewoo narrowly escaped becoming South Korea's biggest bankruptcy ever last
July when domestic creditors agreed to delay repayment of $5.8 billion in
short-term debt for six months and extend $3.3 billion in new loans.
</P>
<P>
	   In return, Daewoo promised to cut its debt drastically by selling or
spinning off all but 12 of its 25 subsidiaries and attracting foreign
investment. The 12 affiliates were placed under a government-coordinated
debt-rescheduling program that calls for creditor banks to turn debts into
equity and assume losses.

<HEADLINE> Whitman seeks $3 million tax on HMOs to increase state monitoring  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Whitman administration said Saturday it wants
to squeeze HMOs and managed-care health insurers for a new, $3.3 million tax to
pay for tougher oversight of the industry.
<P>
	   The administration also said it would endorse a plan to force insurers to
cough up $50 million to cover overdue bills left unpaid by their fallen giant,
HIP Health Plan of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief counsel Richard Mroz said the added oversight of insurers like HMOs
"makes sure there is a continued level of care or maybe greater care, that they
are actually providing what they are supposed to be providing."
</P>
<P>
	   Paul Langevin, president of the Association of Health Plans, said the new
tax seems to repeat an administrative surcharge HMOs pay now, and appears
needless.
</P>
<P>
	   "Short of running health insurance companies, I don't know how much more
regulated can it get," Langevin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Policy chief Eileen McGinnis said the new tax was triggered by Gov. Christie
Whitman's frustration after the state's HMO "report cards" in December found
subpar coverage for mammograms and other cancer screening, cholesterol testing,
eye exams and mental illness treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Brian Baxter, a policy analyst in McGinnis' office, said the funds would pay
for staff to monitor HMO activities, enforce regulations and prepare studies
like the report card.
</P>
<P>
	   "It follows the general theory, as we do with the insurance department, the
banking industry and several others, that the regulated industry, not the
general taxpayer, should pay for the cost of government's regulation," Baxter
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Baxter said the $3.3 million tax will be collected by assessing HMOs $2 for
each person covered. "It is a miniscule amount of money in terms of the overall
premium base we are talking about," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The $50 million assessment is far from miniscule. It is to be charged
against all health insurers one time and will be used in combination with $50
million from the taxpayers to pay most of the unpaid bills due hospitals,
doctors and clinics from the twin bankruptcies of HIP Health Plan, formerly the
state's largest HMO, and the minor American Preferred Provider Plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan outlined by Whitman officials Saturday addresses only $100 million
of the estimated $150 million left unpaid by HIP. The state would ask hospitals
and doctors to forget about the remaining $50 million as a loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Langevin said the insurers would fight the assessment, calling it grossly
unfair to force health insurers to pay millions to bail out a failed competitor.
</P>
<P>
	   "This just sets a dangerous precedent, having taxpayers and people who buy
health insurance bail out bad business deals," Langevin said. "It encourages
people to be careless about the business deals they engage in."

<HEADLINE> Brothers Cazimero Join NY Pops  </HEADLINE>
    By MARY CAMPBELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- The Brothers Cazimero, at the forefront ever since Hawaiian
music began a popular resurgence 25 years ago, brought a little island warmth
and relaxation to a wintertime New York Pops audience at Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   The brothers sing harmony while Roland, 49, plays guitar and Robert, 51,
plays bass and supplies the humorous commentary between songs. They're as
relaxed and mellow as Perry Como and Andy Williams.
</P>
<P>
	   Conductor Skitch Henderson invited them to join the New York Pops for the
second half of Friday's concert. They began with songs in English, "Hawaiian
Paradise," "Hello Honolulu" and "Home in the Islands," pop songs with Hawaiian
arrangement for the orchestras the Cazimeros often perform with. The songs
contain relaxing lines like "let me rest here when day is through."
</P>
<P>
	   When they went on to songs in Hawaiian language, "Ka Wailele O Nu'uanu" and
others, Robert Cazimero explained the songs and told a bit about the brothers.
They're three-quarters Hawaiian and one quarter Portuguese, he said, and on
stage "the Portuguese takes over and I keep talking."
</P>
<P>
	   Robert, the 10th child of performing parents, and Roland, the 12th and
youngest, are the only family members now on stage. Some of their songs are
chants and dances of their ancestors and some are new, written by friends. "Home
in the Islands" is about them -- gypsy musicians who travel the world.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawaiian music has been influenced by other music, like swing, Robert said.
In illustration, three dancers in green cellophane skirts danced along with to
"Hula Blues."
</P>
<P>
	   Dancer Leina'ala Heine's gestures depicted what they were singing about in a
song about a waterfall.
</P>
<P>
	   They did a romantic song Robert Cazimero wrote, which -- if one were
thinking world music -- sounded Bavarian-influenced. Another tune spoke of
jasmine and one, composed as a marriage proposal, compared the woman to a honey
flower.
</P>
<P>
	   After their last song, "Tropical Baby," one of the dancers put a lei over
Henderson's head. The Brothers Cazimero, without the orchestra, played an
encore, pulling the audience still deeper into the Hawaiian Islands' dreamy
spell.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first half of the evening, Henderson, who will be 82 on Friday,
conducted the Pops in Robert Russell Bennet's orchestration of Richard Rodgers'
music for "South Pacific." He also conducted "Ports of Call" by Jacques Ibert,
an Impressionist composer who was a friend of Henderson's in the late 1940s in
Paris.

<HEADLINE> Jean MacArthur, widow of Gen. Douglas MacArthur  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Jean MacArthur, wife of the late Gen. Douglas MacArthur,
who won admirers around the world with her vibrancy and charm, died Saturday.
She was 101.
<P>
	   Mrs. MacArthur died at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said Col. William
Davis, director of the MacArthur Foundation in Norfolk, Va.
</P>
<P>
	   She was at her general's side in war and peace. She accompanied him aboard a
PT boat when he was ordered out of the Philippines to escape a Japanese siege at
the outset of the war in the Pacific. She represented him at official and social
functions and mingled with throngs of Japanese on her trips around Japan during
the postwar occupation. She shared his homecoming when he was relieved of
command during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
	   Near his death in 1964, MacArthur described her as "my constant friend,
sweetheart and devoted supporter."
</P>
<P>
	   She had remained active in theater, opera, civic and philanthropic pursuits
and served as honorary chairman of the Norfolk, Va., foundation created as a
memorial to her husband.
</P>
<P>
	   "Jean MacArthur has witnessed the great cataclysms of our time, survived war
and peace, conquered tragedy and known triumph," President Reagan said in
awarding her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   The citation for the medal, the nation's highest civilian award, called her
"a shining example, a woman of substance and character, a loyal wife and mother,
and like her general, a patriot."
</P>
<P>
	   "People are so good to me," she often said.
</P>
<P>
	   Jean Marie Faircloth was born in Nashville, Tenn., on Dec. 28, 1898. Her
parents divorced when she was very young and her mother took her children to
live in their grandfather's home in Murfreesboro, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
	   She traveled widely after college and was on her way to China when she met
MacArthur aboard ship in 1935. He was headed for Manila to become military
adviser to the government of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
	   MacArthur and Miss Faircloth were seated together at dinner. He sent flowers
the next day. "That was that," she said later. She got off in Manila and
remained for 1 1/2 years as their romance flowered.
</P>
<P>
	   They were married in a quiet ceremony in New York on April 30, 1937. It was
his second marriage, her first. Thereafter, it often was noted the general
greeted his wife with great affection, no matter who was present.
</P>
<P>
	   Their son, Arthur, was born in Manila in 1938.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. MacArthur, while unassuming in public, strenuously guarded her family's
private life. They entertained only during lunch; their evenings often included
private showings of movies.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite her husband's status, she patiently waited in line at Army stores
and commissaries, not asking any special privileges.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. MacArthur remained a woman-about-town in New York through the 1980s,
her name appearing in write-ups of parties attended by the rich and famous.
</P>
<P>
	   She was a big baseball fan and once recalled attending the Brooklyn Dodgers
celebration after they defeated the New York Yankees in the 1955 World Series.
When the Dodgers moved west she became a Mets fan. On a visit to the MacArthur
Memorial in late 1990 she talked animatedly of Darryl Strawberry's decision to
leave the Mets and join the Dodgers in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   She is to be buried with her husband at the MacArthur Memorial in Virginia,
a domed building dating from 1850 that once served as Norfolk's city hall. It is
now part of a complex that includes the Jean MacArthur Research Center, which
houses her husband's archives.
</P>
<P>
	   She is survived by her son and a sister, Angie McCarthy, of Murfreesboro,
Tenn.

<HEADLINE> Van Crashes With 17 on Board  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOWLER, Colo. (AP) -- A van crowded with 17 people crashed on a rural highway
in southeastern Colorado early Saturday, killing three passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the passengers were Mexican nationals, and immigration officials
were trying to determine their status.
</P>
<P>
	   All 14 survivors were hospitalized, four of them in critical condition,
State Patrol Trooper Richard Breece said.
</P>
<P>
	   The driver lost control on a remote stretch of Colorado 10 about 130 miles
southeast of Denver, and the van skidded across the road and rolled into a
ravine.
</P>
<P>
	   The van was registered in Greenville, Tenn., and belonged to the driver,
Guadalupe Gonzales, who went by several identities, each with a different date
of birth and address, Breece said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, one man died and several people were injured when a van carrying
at least 22 Mexican nationals believed to have been headed for Colorado blew a
tire and overturned in southern New Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Freed Inmate To Be Retried  </HEADLINE>
   By BEN DOBBIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- Since being freed last spring after 25 years in
prison, John Duval has spent weekdays sweeping the floor and filling in the
appointment book at Val's, his mother's neighborhood beauty salon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not a job,'' said Duval, 47. ``It's just something I do to keep busy
and stay out of trouble.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the joy of being on the outside after having his conviction overturned
for a 1973 murder is tempered by the prospect that he might soon end up behind
bars again.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors have opted to retry him, and testimony is scheduled to open
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval concentrates hard on living each day as it comes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``With my faith in God, I don't worry about nothing,'' he said. ``I used to
worry, but I don't no more because I know in my heart I'm in the right.''
</P>
<P>
	   Duval and Betty Tyson, both former prostitutes, got 25 years to life
imprisonment in February 1974 for the strangling of Timothy Haworth, 52, a
Philadelphia business consultant who left his Rochester hotel the night of May
24, 1973, apparently to look for a prostitute. Police believe the motive was
robbery.
</P>
<P>
	   In the absence of physical evidence, Duval and Tyson were convicted of
second-degree murder on the basis of confessions they insist were beaten out of
them by a rogue detective, William Mahoney, and on the testimony of two teen-age
runaways, Wayne Wright and Jon Jackson.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1997, Wright recanted his account, saying Mahoney had terrorized him into
lying. Prosecutors then came upon a buried synopsis of a police interview with
Jackson in which he also denied seeing Duval or Tyson with the victim. Neither
prosecutors nor defense lawyers had seen the interview before.
</P>
<P>
	   Ruling that exculpatory evidence was wrongfully suppressed, a judge freed
Tyson in May 1998 and Duval last April. While prosecutors decided not to retry
Tyson -- the city gave her $1.2 million in compensation -- they went after Duval
again. While Tyson had steadfastly maintained her innocence, Duval had twice
admitted his guilt before a parole board.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you don't show remorse, they're not going to let you go,'' Duval
explained. ``I was very upset about it ... but I didn't have outside support,
anybody saying 'We're trying to get you out Johnny, just hold on.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Howard Relin has no doubt Duval took part in the slaying. Unlike
the Tyson case, two detectives who interviewed Duval are still alive to testify.
In addition, Relin maintained, Mahoney was not directly involved in Duval's
case.
</P>
<P>
	   The chief detective, investigated at least 10 times for allegedly abusing
suspects, resigned in 1980 after fabricating evidence in an unrelated case. He
died in 1981.
</P>
<P>
	   Duval's retrial does not constitute double jeopardy because he did not
establish in his appeal that there was prosecutorial misconduct, Relin said.
</P>
<P>
	   One of eight children, Duval was a rebellious teen-ager who dabbled with
heroin and entered a world of prostitutes and transvestites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I probably would have ended up being one of Arthur Shawcross' victims,''
he said, referring to the 1980s prostitute serial killer.
</P>
<P>
	   Under his sentence, Duval had to serve a minimum of 25 years. If convicted
again of second-degree murder, he would be returned to prison. He could someday
be granted parole or spend the rest of his life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   With his future in limbo, Duval's emotions swing between the everyday
travails of adjusting to the outside world and the elation of renewing links
with his family.
</P>
<P>
	   During a reunion with his brother's children last summer, ``they called me
uncle. That tore me up,'' said Duval, who crochets stuffed animals he sells to
pay for his defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago, Duval said prosecutors offered him the assurance that he
would remain free if he pleaded guilty and, in effect, gave up any chance of
compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would rather die in prison an old man,'' Duval said defiantly, adding
that ``no amount of money could give me what they took from me.''

<HEADLINE> Elian's Miami neighbors share own journey  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   MIAMI (AP) - Mirta Falcon says she knows the desires that must have
driven Elian Gonzalez's mother to give her life to put the boy on American soil.
<P>
	   Seven months ago, Ms. Falcon was the one wading from a Cuban beach toward a
small boat bound for Florida. In her arms, she cradled her 2-year-old son,
Antonio, gravely ill with asthma. He needed medicine that his mother says was
not available in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "A mother always wants the best for her children," Ms. Falcon said.
</P>
<P>
	   She and her children now live in a small Miami apartment building where all
the tenants and many neighbors are Cuban. Elian and the relatives who are
fighting to keep him live next door.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's mother drowned when their boat capsized on the journey from Cuba in
November. The 6-year-old was found Thanksgiving Day on an inner tube off the
Florida coast.
</P>
<P>
	   His father, still in Cuba, wants the boy returned. And Elian's grandmothers
were in Washington on Saturday to lobby Attorney General Janet Reno to let them
take Elian home.
</P>
<P>
	   While reporters and onlookers crowd Ms. Falcon's Miami neighborhood for a
glimpse of Elian, Antonio, now 3, runs around the apartment lawn. When his lungs
grow tense from asthma, his mother pulls out a machine through which the boy
breathes in a vaporized medicine.
</P>
<P>
	   "I give thanks to God, truly, for being here," Ms. Falcon said.
</P>
<P>
	   But she said her daughter, from a previous marriage, still asks about her
father back in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "My girl sometimes asks me, 'Mommy, do you think my dad is going to claim
me?" Ms. Falcon said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she tells Yuliet, 10, not to worry about her father. He didn't know
they were leaving, but he wouldn't have objected, she said. Antonio's father now
supports the family as a construction worker in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Falcon believes they and Elian have more opportunities in America.
</P>
<P>
	   "For him, the best thing is to be here," she said. "I believe you have to go
through it to know it."

<HEADLINE> Explosion wrecks Flemington building  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   FLEMINGTON, N.J. (AP) - An explosion leveled a former antiques store and
injured several people Saturday afternoon.
<P>
	   Police confirmed at least two people were injured in the blast. Their
conditions could not immediately be determined.
</P>
<P>
	   The explosion took place at about 3 p.m. at a Church Street building that
formerly housed an antiques store, the Antiques Emporium.
</P>
<P>
	   Christine Robertson, who lives four doors down from the blast site, said she
was napping on the couch when the explosion woke her.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all got out of our houses to walk outside to see what happened, and you
could smell the gas," she said. "The chimney blew away, and all the windows on
the first floor had blown out. I pass that place everyday. It was a mess."
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbors said the antiques store was vacated last fall, and workers had
been seen recently renovating the building.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond Hall, 23, said he was putting up wallpaper in his home at 41 Church
St. when the entire house shook.
</P>
<P>
	   "I ran downstairs to see if my basement was OK," said Hall. "Then, I looked
outside and saw flames coming out of the building's chimney. It's been up and
down, sometimes you'd see smoke and flames, and then it would go down."
</P>
<P>
	   Mark McNealy, who lives nearby, smelled a strong odor of natural gas and
went to his telephone to call 911. Seconds after the call was completed, he
said, an explosion ripped through the former antiques store.
</P>
<P>
	   He told the Courier News of Bridgewater that he saw three construction
workers outside the building earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Rita Mills, who lives behind the antiques shop, said firefighters arrived at
the building shortly before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought a tree slammed into the house," neighbor Bill Baykowski told the
Express-Times of Easton, Pa. "I was inside watching television when I heard the
blast."
</P>
<P>
	   Elizabethtown Gas Company spokesman Chris Reardon confirmed an explosion
occurred, but could not immediately provide any other details.
</P>
<P>
	   Numerous fire companies and ambulances responded to the scene.

<HEADLINE> Bush Battles for Waiter's Vote  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAVENPORT, Iowa (AP) -- In an era of mass communications, it's rare for
politicians to battle for an individual voter's support. But George W. Bush gave
it a shot Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   As he shook hands in the Thunder Bay Grille, a restaurant styled after a
fishing camp, the Republican presidential candidate bumped into Joshua Nerney in
an alcove between dining rooms.
</P>
<P>
	   After greeting Bush, the 25-year-old waiter said he was confused by the
conflicting messages in the campaign, which left him wondering why he should
support the Texas governor over his rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Because I've got a plan that keeps the economy going, a plan to keep the
peace,'' Bush said. ``What you've got to do is you've got to look people in the
eye and say, `Who do you trust?'''
</P>
<P>
	   Nerney replied: ``And that's why I'm looking at you in the eye. All
everybody says is the exact same thing as you said.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush replied, ``Well, I've got a record. I've been a governor of the state
of Texas. I've actually done in office what I said I would do. You've got to
sift through all the noise and figure out who you can trust. That's really what
it's about.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nerney came back: ``I have heard, as I said, and I don't know what's truly
true and what's not, that some of the things that you just said you haven't
(done).''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They're true,'' the governor replied.
</P>
<P>
	   ``How do you find out who to believe?'' Nerney asked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You've just got to do the research and figure it out,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   It wasn't immediately clear if Bush persuaded Nerney to vote for him in
Monday's Iowa caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   But as Bush left to tour other tables and the kitchen, Nerney showed him the
way.

<HEADLINE> EgyptAir Families To Get $115M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- The families of those killed on EgyptAir Flight 990 will
receive a total of about $115 million in insurance payouts, the airline's
chairman said in remarks published Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The figure conflicted with EgyptAir Chairman Mohammed Fahim Rayan's
statements in November, when he said the payment would be $100,000 for every one
of the 217 people on board the plane that plunged into the Atlantic Ocean on
Oct. 31. Such payments would total about $22 million.
</P>
<P>
	   An EgyptAir spokesman was not available to explain the discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
	   The value of the insurance for the families of the victims will be between
the equivalent of $86.9 million and $115.9 million, Rayan said, according to the
pro-government newspaper Al Gomhuria.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the head of Egypt's Civil Aviation Authority, Abdel-Fattah Qato,
returned home Saturday after spending a week in the United States with
investigators of the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   Upon his arrival in Cairo, Qato said he couldn't comment because
investigations are still proceeding.
</P>
<P>
	   Qato held several meetings with Jim Hall, chairman of the National
Transportation Safety Board, and other American investigators, Cairo airport
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Qato is expected to hand a report to Egypt's minister of transportation on
the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall says his agency must conduct additional studies before determining the
cause of the EgyptAir crash. He has disputed reports that investigators are
increasingly convinced the jet was crashed deliberately.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators have speculated that the crash was the result of a deliberate
action by the co-pilot, Capt. Gameel El-Batouty.
</P>
<P>
	   EgyptAir has rejected the suicide possibility and said that all its pilots
undergo routine physical and psychological testing. El-Batouty's family has
reacted angrily to reports that the veteran pilot had a death wish.

<HEADLINE> Whitman proposes $21.3 billion state budget  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman is proposing a $21.3 billion
state budget that would provide dollars for road spending without raising the
gasoline tax, add about 600 state workers, and send New Jersey into a new cash
stratosphere with $1.7 billion in added spending.
<P>
	   Whitman's proposed budget will also include major items state officials
refused to discuss at a briefing on Saturday, saying they want the governor to
have a few news nuggets to present in her annual budget speech on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman is expected to propose how New Jersey should pay for billions in
school construction costs, and how tobacco dollars should be spent. When asked
if the governor will propose using tobacco dollars to pay for school
construction, several state officials merely smiled and told reporters to wait
until Monday. Spokesman Peter McDonough said the governor would likely offer
some kind of a tax proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   The spending plan for the fiscal year that begins in July is 8.9 percent
higher than the $19.5 billion budget the governor signed last June. It's nearly
11 percent higher than the level of spending Whitman proposed to lawmakers last
January.
</P>
<P>
	   And there is more to the bottom line of the proposed $21.3 billion budget.
State treasury officials expect $471 million in payments from the settlement of
the national tobacco settlement to come in sometime in the fiscal year that
begins in July. Of that, the budget only takes into account $174 million. The
additional $297 million is not counted in the $21.3 billion budget figure and
will likely be spent on programs Whitman will detail on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Richard Mroz, Whitman's chief counsel, said the proposed spending plan is
"prudent and responsible" and addresses major challenges facing the state.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a budget that also provides a great amount of funding back to
municipalities, school boards, and to the taxpayers, directly back in property
tax relief, and it's one that continues to make New Jersey a better place to
live, work and raise a family," Mroz said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials said the governor will on Monday propose a plan that would provide
$1 billion in transportation funding without any gas tax increase. Leaders have
been trying to find a way to renew the fund, which pays for road, bridge and
mass transit projects. Whitman two years ago proposed raising the gas tax, but
lawmakers wary of taxpayer wrath balked at it.
</P>
<P>
	   The new plan would use $250 million from the state budget and borrow $750
million. That $1 billion would tap another $1 billion in federal funds, which
could keep the fund afloat for a couple of years.
</P>
<P>
	   The state budget includes $1.1 billion for capital projects, which Treasurer
Roland Machold said is what government should do in good economic times.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that's good policy because we are, in effect, paying up front for
things that our children will enjoy down the line," Machold said.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget adds $166.7 million more to Whitman's property taxpayer rebate
program, which last year doled out checks averaging $120. However, while
officials expected about $200 million in rebates in 1999, the state doled out
only about $170 million despite continually extending deadlines for people to
apply. Machold said response to the program was a bit lower than anticipated.
This year's property tax rebate checks will average about $240, and the budget
anticipates it will cost about $336 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitman also wants to boost direct state funding to public schools by about
$482 million. Aid to towns would rise by about $66 million, which the New Jersey
State League of Municipalities says is not enough.
</P>
<P>
	   Assemblyman Joseph Charles, D-Hudson, said Democrats will push for more
property tax relief.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's nothing new by way of property tax relief," Charles said. "We've
been talking about that for a number of years now and suggesting things, and
this budget doesn't add anything new."
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed budget includes $50 million to help pay off hospital and doctor
bills left over from the demise of the Health Insurance Plan of New Jersey. The
budget also calls for a $3.3 million tax on HMOs to cover tougher oversight of
the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   With a flush economy, this year's proposed spending plan once again spares
state workers. It includes no plans for layoffs, and no plans to replace state
workers with private companies. In fact, it seeks to add about 640 more
positions, including 70 new State Police troopers, 126 more workers in the
Department of Corrections (28 new corrections officers), about 150 new workers
for expanded juvenile justice operations, and 100 new workers at the Ann Klein
Forensic Center in Ewing.
</P>
<P>
	   The budget anticipates spending about $326 million more than the
administration estimates the state will take in during the fiscal year that
begins in July. But because revenue has come in at a faster pace than estimated,
this budget once again starts out with a bigger money pot. It anticipates ending
the fiscal year in mid-2001 with a $850 million surplus - about $67 million more
than officials expect to have on hand when the books are closed on the current
budget this July. Machold said unlike previous spending plans, this budget
includes no "one shot" revenue sources.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials say a booming economy has made it easier to propose spending
projects without tax increases. Treasury officials on Saturday predicted the
state will take in $503 million more than they had forecast for the current
fiscal year, which ends June 30. Machold said officials expect the economy to
cool down a bit, but even if that happens, he says $1.16 billion in extra money
will pour into tax coffers from July 2000 to June 2001, a revenue growth of
about 6 percent.

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Squabble Over Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Hitting every corner of this sprawling state,
Republicans squabbled over abortion and taxes in a fight for their conservative
base Saturday, as presidential candidates in both major parties braved nasty
weather to rally supporters to Iowa's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every vote matters!'' said GOP front-runner George W. Bush, who attempted
to burnish his anti-abortion credentials for a third consecutive day. The Texas
governor pledged to keep the abortion plank in a staunchly conservative GOP
platform.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday night, about 10 percent of the state's 1.8 million registered
voters are expected to gather in living rooms, schools, church basements and
fire stations to announce their support of candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Few convention delegates are at stake, but the real reward in Iowa and the
Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary is momentum: Campaigns can take flight or lose
altitude in the first two contests of the presidential year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to make a good showing maybe and surprise a lot of people,''
said former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, the sole rival to Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president holds a wide lead over Bradley in Iowa polls and has
broken out of a long-running tie in New Hampshire surveys. ``I'm not quitting,''
Bradley told supporters in Maquoketa. ``We're going forward. We have another
day.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president played an expectations game of his own design. ``What are
the expectations if Senator Bradley scored a victory? Expectations in the event
that occurred would be that he would do exactly what he said he would do and
take as his model for leadership style ... Ronald Reagan,'' the vice president
said at a Fort Dodge rally.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's irregular heartbeat, a minor condition that dominated his campaign
for the better part of two days, did not come up in a question-and-answer
session in Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was more of a problem.
</P>
<P>
	   A wintry mix of wind and snow made Bradley's motorcade ride through eastern
Iowa a perilous one. The plane carrying Steve Forbes, one of five candidates
stumping the state, made two false approaches to the Mason City runway and
pulled up quickly each time as his pilot had trouble in the murky weather.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane landed on the third attempt. Forbes emerged safe but shaken.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The weather couldn't stop us, and the political establishment is not going
to stop us,'' he said
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the day's more colorful events, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah gave a
foreign policy address in a barroom full of reporters and set the lowest of
expectations for a six-man field: ``I'm going to have to do better than sixth
here, it seems to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion is a major issue for many caucus-goers, who tend to be more
conservative than voters as a whole. That may be why the topic came up often at
GOP campaign events Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer, who needs a strong third place to bolster his sagging campaign,
suggested that Forbes is a recent convert to the anti-abortion movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not a Steve-come-lately that believed something three years ago and
believed something different today,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning his sights on the front-runner, the Washington activist said,
``Governor Bush is completely out of step with the party he wants to lead.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, like most Republican voters, is opposed to abortion but he does not
stress it on the campaign trail. He is looking ahead to the general election,
when the issue tends to alienate swing voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Pressed by reporters, the Texan said he was in favor of a party platform
that recommends a constitutional amendment banning abortion. ``I think that the
Republican Party ought to keep its pro-life plank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes accused Bush of pandering. ``I think it's too little, too late. It's
almost typical for an establishment candidate to suddenly realize he has to say
something so he does something like this,'' Forbes said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's anti-abortion position does not extend to cases of rape, incest and
when the mother's life if in danger. Those exceptions are not in the plank, but
Bush said the details of the amendment could be worked out later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first step is to convince Americans that we ought to value life,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides say the governor has made his support of the plank clear in the past,
but questions arose after Bush ducked a question about the platform in a recent
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   A memo sent to hundreds of supporters by his campaign says: ``While Governor
Bush respects those with differing views, he believes the current Republican
Party platform plank on abortion is an important statement of pro-life ideals,
and he does not believe it should be changed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign picked a long-distance fight over taxes, suggesting that
Arizona Sen. John McCain's tax-cutting package would undermine charitable
giving. McCain is the only GOP candidate not competing in Iowa, choosing instead
to focus his campaign on New Hampshire. He is, however, on the Iowa ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is a provision that would close what McCain calls a ``loophole'' by
allowing people who give contributions in forms of stock, real estate, bonds or
art work to get tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is important to encourage an outpouring of giving in America,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain wants to use money from closing the loophole to cut taxes for
middle-class Americans, while Bush is worried about ``a few wealthy Americans
who can get a tax cut when they're done looking at an old painting,'' McCain
spokesman Howard Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a satellite address to conservatives in Washington, Bush said McCain
sounds like a Democrat.

<HEADLINE> Gargan Fights for Reform Party Job  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE SCHNEIDER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Reform Party chairman Jack Gargan vowed Saturday to
fight efforts to remove him from party leadership, saying he is ready to
compromise over the location of the party's convention.
</P>
<P>
	   The site of the national convention has caused internal warfare in recent
weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As you know, they want my head on a platter but they're not going to get
it,'' Gargan told about 200 delegates at the Florida party's state conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Republican Pat Buchanan continued to campaign for the party's
nomination despite the fray.
</P>
<P>
	   He told delegates during a half-hour speech that he would work to control
the United States' borders, end illegal immigration and take a tough stand
against China.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan said he would invite Chinese officials to the Oval Office and tell
them, ``You've got to stop persecuting Christians, you've got to stop pointing
missiles at our friends, pointing missiles at us or you all have sold your last
pair of chopsticks at any mall in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
	   New York developer Donald Trump, who is considering a run for the White
House, was invited to speak to the Florida delegates but declined.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, despite the campaigning, a storm continued to brew over the
convention site.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, Gargan ruled that the August convention would be held in
St. Paul, Minn., despite plans by the previous chairman to hold it in Long
Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan is a supporter of Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, while his
predecessor, Russell Verney, is a top aide to party founder Ross Perot. The
Perot faction tends to support Buchanan for president, while the Ventura faction
prefers Trump.
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan said he had asked the Buchanan faction for a meeting to discuss a
neutral site but they ``refused to come to the table.'' A site in a midwestern
city, such as St. Louis, may appeal to both sides, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan, after speaking to the Florida delegates, said he wasn't approached
by Gargan and added he came up with the idea for a neutral site several weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't want to get into the battles or the factions, but if they want a
third (site), we think that would be a great idea, in middle America, where
everyone can reach it,'' Buchanan said. ``We can put this battle behind us.''
</P>
<P>
	   The issue could be settled next month at a Feb. 12 meeting in Nashville of
the 150-member national committee. Michael Farris, chairman of the party's
Presidential Nomination committee, plans to call for Gargan's removal at that
meeting and has said he will resign if the motions fails.
</P>
<P>
	   Gargan said the meeting was improperly called and would not be valid. He
said he may call a competing meeting to reinforce his position.

<HEADLINE> Man Charged in Stabbing in Hospital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND (AP) -- A man accused of stabbing three people aboard an Amtrak
train last summer has been committed to a maximum-security psychiatric hospital,
his attorney said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Aaron Hall, 41, of Ontario, Calif., was charged with attempted murder but
was found innocent by reason of insanity Jan. 6 by a Cuyahoga County judge.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge on Friday committed Hall to Twin Valley Psychiatric Hospital, said
defense attorney Regis McGann.
</P>
<P>
	   Three psychiatrists had determined Hall was delusional and should be
hospitalized, McGann said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall was accused of stabbing two Amtrak conductors and a passenger on the
Lakeshore Limited as it headed from Chicago to New York on Aug. 26. He was
arrested in Ohio after the train made an emergency stop.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall claimed he acted in self-defense after someone threatened him with a
gun. Authorities said he had made the same claim a day before the stabbings when
he was removed from a bus for being unruly. No one on the bus was injured and no
gun was found.
</P>
<P>
	   Hall's mental status will be reviewed periodically by the court to determine
when he can be released, McGann said.

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers Want Him Back  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY MARGASAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers, said to be crying as they
told Attorney General Janet Reno in a private meeting ``how much they are
suffering,'' appealed for help Saturday in removing the boy from his Florida
relatives and reuniting him with his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers gave her a letter expressing the wish that Elian be
returned to ``the normality of life with his father, brother, family, friends at
schools, his toys, dog and parrot.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reno, who has supported Elian's return, said in a written statement the
grandmothers ``made a very compassionate and heartfelt plea'' but that the
matter now is in federal court. One source familiar with the meeting, speaking
only on condition of anonymity, said the grandmothers were in tears through much
of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We maintain that the law recognizes the unique relationship between parent
and child and that family reunification has long been a cornerstone'' of U.S
immigration law as well as Immigration and Naturalization Service practice,
Reno's statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the boy's relatives in Florida have asked a federal judge to
prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariela Quintana, the boy's paternal grandmother, and maternal grandmother
Raquel Rodriguez did not speak to reporters after the 45-minute meeting at the
Justice Department. But their three-paragraph letter was released, and officials
of the U.S. and Cuban Council of Churches described their sentiments afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The two grandmothers expressed how much they are suffering because of this
separation from their family on behalf of Elian Gonzalez, the Very Rev. Oden
Marichal, head of the Cuban church group, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This has been a very good opportunity for them to express their deep
feeling as grandmothers to the (attorney general) asking the return of Elian to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We understand that grandchildren belong to every grandfather and
grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ordered the boy returned to Cuba. Reno has agreed, saying the
youngster belongs with his father in the communist island where he was reared.
The grandmothers sought the meeting with Reno and Doris Meissner, the INS
commissioner, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from National Council of Churches, which represent mainline
Protestant denominations, have been serving as the grandmothers' hosts during
their stay of undetermined length in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Bob Edgar, a former Democratic House member and general secretary
of the church organization, said the grandmothers ``shared with the attorney
general their pain in the loss of this grandchild. Both grandmothers articulated
as clearly as anyone could the hunger and passion that they have to return their
grandchild to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   Edgar said the grandmothers' only plans so far were to return Saturday to
New York City. No plans have been announced for the women to visit the boy, who
is with his Miami relatives, or to return home. But the grandmothers wrote in
their letter: ``We only have Sunday to see Elian, and we not only want to see
him, but we also want to return with him to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   The women must go to Miami to visit Elian, said Armando Gutierrez, spokesman
for the Florida relatives caring for the youngster.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The doors are open and the welcome mats are out. The family would love for
them to come here to Miami. In fact, they are surprised they went to New York
and Washington and have not come here,'' he said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers so far have chosen to avoid Miami, where Cuban immigrants
staged massive protests after the INS ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Edgar told reporters the meeting was intended ``to open the dialogue and the
conversation'' with Reno. ``The grandmothers had a wonderful opportunity to
speak to them and that's really all that I can say at this time.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Reno ``showed enormous compassion for these two courageous women.
There was a long opportunity where they simply talked back and forth with each
other. It was a very personal meeting.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been in the middle of a custody fight between the U.S. relatives
in Miami's politically powerful Cuban community and the father and grandmothers
living in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The fight has escalated far beyond a family feud, becoming the latest
centerpiece of the decades-long battle between anti-Castro Cubans and Cuban
President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov.
25 after the boat taking him to the United States capsized, killing his mother,
her boyfriend and nine other people.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers' letter said Elian's stay in the United States ``adds to
the tragedy of the family over the loss'' of the boy's mother, Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
	   They expressed gratitude that the U.S. government had affirmed the paternity
rights of father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, but expressed frustration over the
prolonged custody fight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We ask that you return Elian to his immediate family and not to his
distant family where there had not been a previous relationship. This is the
reason for being here, and we thank you for this interview,'' the grandmothers
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   While the matter goes through the courts, lawmakers in Congress plan an
attempt this week to declare Elian a U.S. citizen. If such legislation becomes
law, the boy no longer would be an immigrant under INS jurisdiction.

<HEADLINE> Explosion wrecks Flemington building  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   FLEMINGTON, N.J. (AP) - An explosion leveled a former antiques store and
injured at least two people Saturday afternoon.
<P>
	   Officials confirmed at least two people - a fire chief and a patrolman -
were injured in the blast. Their conditions could not immediately be determined.
A firefighter who was also in the building at the time of the explosion was not
injured, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The explosion happened about 3 p.m. at a Church Street building that
formerly housed an antiques store, the Antiques Emporium.
</P>
<P>
	   Christine Robertson, who lives four doors down from the blast site, said she
was napping on the couch when the explosion woke her.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all got out of our houses to walk outside to see what happened, and you
could smell the gas," she said. "The chimney blew away, and all the windows on
the first floor had blown out. I pass that place everyday. It was a mess."
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbors said the antiques store was vacated last fall, and workers had
been seen recently renovating the building.
</P>
<P>
	   Elizabethtown Gas Company spokesman Chris Reardon said the fire chief,
firefighter and patrolman reportedly entered the building before the explosion,
and before officials from the gas company had arrived.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond Hall, 23, said he was putting up wallpaper in his home at 41 Church
St. when the entire house shook.
</P>
<P>
	   "I ran downstairs to see if my basement was OK," said Hall. "Then, I looked
outside and saw flames coming out of the building's chimney. It's been up and
down, sometimes you'd see smoke and flames, and then it would go down."
</P>
<P>
	   Mark McNealy, who lives nearby, smelled a strong odor of natural gas and
went to his telephone to call 911. Seconds after the call was completed, he
said, an explosion ripped through the former antiques store.
</P>
<P>
	   He told the Courier News of Bridgewater that he saw three construction
workers outside the building earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Rita Mills, who lives behind the antiques shop, said firefighters arrived at
the building shortly before the explosion.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought a tree slammed into the house," neighbor Bill Baykowski told the
Express-Times of Easton, Pa. "I was inside watching television when I heard the
blast."
</P>
<P>
	   Reardon said it was not clear whether the explosion was caused by natural
gas.
</P>
<P>
	   He said employees of the gas company planned to open a hole in the street
Saturday evening to inspect the line that runs from the gas main into the
building to help determine the cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Numerous fire companies and ambulances responded to the scene.

<TEXT>
<P>
    VANCOUVER, British Columbia (AP) -- Pat Garrity hit a 3-point shot with 13.5
seconds left as the Orlando Magic snapped an eight-game losing streak by beating
the Vancouver Grizzlies 85-82 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tariq Abdul-Wahad and Chucky Atkins scored 16 points each as the Magic won
for only the second time in 15 games -- both wins coming against the Grizzlies.
Ben Wallace had nine points and 11 rebounds, and secured the victory by blocking
Shareef Abdur-Rahim's 3-point attempt at the buzzer.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando, now 7-1 all-time against the Grizzlies, has defeated Vancouver in
six straight meetings, including a 116-96 win earlier this month in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
	   Abdur-Rahim led the Grizzlies with 16 points and 10 rebounds, while Othella
Harrington and Michael Dickerson also had 16 points. Vancouver has now lost five
straight overall and seven in a row at home.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grizzlies overcame a 79-70 deficit, cutting Orlando's lead to 81-80 on
Abdur-Rahim's eight-foot jumper with 52.6 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando responded on its next possession when Darrell Armstong fed a
wide-open Garrity, who sank a 25-footer.
</P>
<P>
	   After a layup by Dickerson, Armstrong hit one of two free throws to put
Orlando up 85-82 with 3.6 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Atkins, who averages just 8.3 points per game, scored all 16 of his points
in a seven-minute span in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Orlando scored on each of Vancouver's 11 first-half turnovers. Vancouver
eventually committed 24 turnovers, which led to 37 Orlando points.

<HEADLINE> No. 8 UConn. 92, Georgetown 71  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSEPH WHITE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Given a week to brood over a home loss to St. John's,
Connecticut took out its frustrations at Georgetown.
</P>
<P>
	   Khalid El-Amin, held without a field goal in the first half, scored 19 of
his 22 points in the second half as the No. 8 Huskies beat Georgetown 92-71
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Occasionally, when you lose a game, you have that 3-12 feeling when you're
12-3," said Connecticut coach Jim Calhoun, referring to the five-point loss to
the Red Storm last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you sit on a loss, you're kind of upset with the way you played, and
truly I was. It's hard to sit on it for a week. I would have liked to have
played Wednesday."
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut (13-3, 2-2 Big East), unbeaten away and winless at home in the
conference, stretched its conference-record road winning streak to 13 games. The
Huskies visit unbeaten No. 6 Syracuse on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maybe the secret to us is just don't go back to Connecticut," Calhoun said.
</P>
<P>
	   More seriously, he added: "You didn't want to go in losing two in a row to a
team that's 15-0. That takes away certainly some of your confidence. This team
is still going through a process of trying to find itself."
</P>
<P>
	   The first half was played at the Hoyas' methodical, defense-orientated pace,
the second half at Huskies breakneck speed. Led by El-Amin, UConn scored on its
first eight possessions after halftime, starting a 25-13 run to build a 67-47
lead with 12:27 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hoyas responded immediately with a 10-0 run, including back-to-back
3-pointers from freshman Demetrius Hunter, but the Huskies came back with seven
straight points to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought we were completely outclassed in the second half," Georgetown
coach Craig Esherick said. "They're the best team I've ever seen in my life
right now."
</P>
<P>
	   Kevin Braswell scored 26 points to lead the Hoyas (10-7, 2-4), who have lost
four straight to UConn. Braswell had a hot hand early -- scoring 15 points in
the first 13 minutes -- before UConn started double-teaming him at every
opportunity. The Hoyas then started going inside to Ruben Boumtje Boumtje in the
second half, and Braswell went more than 14 minutes without a field goal.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had got off to a hot start, and then they were denying me the ball,"
Braswell said. "It's so frustrating."
</P>
<P>
	   Braswell and Anthony Perry did a superb job in the first half on El-Amin,
who was 0-for-4 from the field at halftime with just three points off free
throws.
</P>
<P>
	   But El-Amin, working free off screens, had 13 points in the first 6 1/2
minutes of the second half. El-Amin also didn't have an assist in the first
half, but he broke that drought with a bit of flourish -- by banking an
alley-oop pass off the backboard to Doug Wrenn for a dunk on a fast break.
</P>
<P>
	   "He does it intentionally," Esherick said. "He tries to get other people
involved the first half, and in the second half, he kills you."
</P>
<P>
	   El-Amin's only major problem in the second half was a cut on his left wrist,
which caused him to constantly rub his hand on his shorts before he was taken
out to get a bandage.
</P>
<P>
	   The two teams combined for just one field goal over a 7:18 stretch in the
first half as Georgetown's stifling defense kept Connecticut's attack in check.
But the Hoyas couldn't take advantage because of the poor shooting and
ball-handling that has plagued them all season. Georgetown finished with 17
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
	   With the score tied 30-30, the Huskies went on a 12-4 spurt to end the first
half. Jake Voskuhl had two dunks in the run.
</P>
<P>
	   With neither defense allowing a decent look at the basket the first half,
the scoreboard kept moving because both teams were making free throws. The
Huskies made 15 in a row in the first half, allowing them to make up a 5-point
deficit without scoring a field goal. The team shot a combined 30-for-34 from
the line in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   Countering Georgetown's rebounding prowess, Calhoun shook up his lineup by
moving Kevin Freeman to power forward and giving Wrenn his first start of the
season. Freeman's double-team help kept Boumtje Boumtje quiet after the Hoyas
center scored four straight baskets early in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut shot 45 free throws, making 38. Esherick drew a technical foul
arguing one call in the second half, but he bluntly put the blame on himself and
his team in his postgame remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the refs had anything to do with it," Esherick said. "In a
lot of cases, we ended up fouling because we were out of position."

<HEADLINE> Strife-Torn Colombia Holds Meeting  </HEADLINE>
   By RICARDO MALDONADO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- Beset by guerrilla violence and its worst
recession since the 1930s, Colombia might seem an odd place to convene a meeting
of high-powered business moguls that included the chairmen of America Online and
Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's precisely because the country needs foreign investment so badly
that President Andres Pastrana's government worked hard to attract a coterie of
international business and financial heavyweights for an unusual weekend
meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL's Jim Kimsey, Mitsubishi's Minoru Makihara and New York Stock Exchange
Chairman Richard Grasso were among the 13 heavyweights who met with government
officials Friday in the balmy Caribbean seaport of Cartagena.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've shared with the most important businessmen in the world our vision
of the Colombia we want in the new millennium,'' Pastrana told a brief press
conference following the one-day event that was closed to the media.
</P>
<P>
	   That the top executives were drawn to Colombia, not exactly an economic
powerhouse, was testimony to Pastrana's tireless efforts to convince the world
that Colombia has more to offer than drugs and violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Also present were former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, now a
partner in a Montreal law firm and a board member of several multinational
corporations, American Express CEO James Robinson III and executives from
Mexico, Hong Kong, Argentina and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the meeting's key organizers was President Clinton's confidant Vernon
Jordan. The Pastrana government hired the Washington lawyer and lobbyist to help
boost its image.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's proposal earlier this month to provide Colombia with a $1.6
billion emergency aid package was another sign that Pastrana's lobbying was
paying off.
</P>
<P>
	   No new business deals were announced at the Cartagena meeting, however.
</P>
<P>
	   Shriveling foreign investment has exacerbated the nation's recession,
heaping economic woes atop Colombia's perennial political problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials stressed they weren't expecting an immediate rush of foreign
investment to the South American nation where executives buy insurance against
being kidnapped by guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   But it seemed the charms of Cartagena, whose pastel-washed colonial center
is Colombia's top tourist attraction, worked on at least one of Pastrana's
illustrious guests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Colombia isn't as dangerous as it seems from abroad,'' said Kimsey,
announcing he felt safer in heavily guarded Cartagena than in many U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Colombia's principal problem is its image,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   Kimsey applauded Pastrana's conservative economic management, but urged
Colombia to make itself more competitive by streamlining bureaucracy and
providing better legal guarantees for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   For Wall Street's Grasso, the visit was probably less exciting than his last
to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   He traveled at Pastrana's invitation last June to a meeting with machine
gun-toting leaders of Colombia's most powerful guerrilla group. The trip showed
bravery, but many people accused Grasso of lending undue legitimacy to the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Grasso said he was only trying to enlighten the Marxist insurgents about the
benefits of the global capitalist system.

<HEADLINE> More Bodies Surface in Islamic Case  </HEADLINE>
   By HARMONIE TOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Police on Saturday discovered the bodies of eight
people allegedly killed by an Islamic militant group, raising the number of
corpses unearthed in Turkey this week to 25, a news report said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said they discovered the bodies in the basement of a house in the
central Anatolian city of Konya where they said Hezbollah militants buried their
opponents, private NTV television reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Police dug up four bodies from the basement of another house in Konya on
Friday, and discovered 13 bodies of people believed killed by the group in
houses in Istanbul and Ankara earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
	   Several bodies have been identified as those of pro-Islamic businessmen, who
apparently refused to support the group.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah aims to form an Islamic state in Turkey's Kurdish-dominated
southeast. Police detained hundreds of suspected members of the group in a
nationwide crackdown after killing the leader of the group's most militant wing
in a shootout in Istanbul on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, police arrested a suspected militant who works as a computer
analyst at the prime ministry. Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit told reporters in
Ankara Saturday that ``there is a big possibility'' Hezbollah may have
infiltrated other state institutions.

<P>
    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Jamaal Magliore had 23 points and 15 rebounds and
coach Tubby Smith got his 200th career victory as No. 18 Kentucky beat No. 20
Vanderbilt 81-73 in overtime on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Sophomore Desmond Allison added a career-high 23 points for Kentucky (13-5
overall, 4-1 Southeastern Conference) in the SEC East battle, including shooting
6-for-9 on 3s. As a team, Kentucky was 12-for-27 from 3-point range and
Vanderbilt was only 5-for-27.
</P>
<P>
	   The Commodores' Dan Langhi, the SEC's leading scorer, was held to 15 points
on 5-for-13 shooting. The Wildcats blocked eight shots and now have 108 blocks
on the season to 29 for their opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   Kentucky, which defeated Vandy (12-3, 3-2) for the 15th straight time, got a
key 3-pointer with 29.1 seconds left in overtime from Tayshaun Prince. With the
shot clock running down and UK up 75-73, Prince double-pumped and made the
basket from the left side.
</P>
<P>
	   The game was tied 65-65 with 54.9 seconds left in regulation when Saul Smith
found Magliore underneath for a dunk to put the Wildcats up 67-65. Vandy's Sam
Howard tied it 67-67 with two free throws with 12.7 seconds left. UK's Keith
Bogans missed a potential game-winning 3-pointer at the end of regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Wildcats led 39-38 at halftime as Allison led all scorers with 12.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Nationals Get Lost in Minn.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSEAU, Minn. (AP) -- Three Turkish nationals who entered the United States
illegally got lost in Minnesota's north woods in below-zero weather.
</P>
<P>
	   The three men crossed the U.S.-Canada border late Tuesday in a wooded area
near the town of Pinecreek, in northwestern Minnesota, Border Patrol Agent Lonny
Schweitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The men said that after being lost in the forest they found the Pinecreek
Lutheran Church, where they took refuge as the temperature fell to 25 below
zero. The next morning, they hiked to a nearby highway where they were picked up
by Alvin Sather, pastor at Pinecreek.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were pretty cold,'' Sather said. ``I don't normally pick up
hitchhikers, but it seemed like the Christian thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Sather took the men to a motel in town, and later mentioned his encounter to
a Border Patrol agent.
</P>
<P>
	   The men, ages 22, 26 and 38, were arrested at the motel and will be
deported, Schweitzer said. He said they were not carrying weapons or contraband.
The FBI said none of them have criminal records.

<HEADLINE> No. 22 Utah 69, Wyoming 61  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM KORTE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Alex Jensen had 19 points and 14 rebounds as No. 22
Utah survived its worst shooting game of the season to beat scrappy Wyoming
69-61 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Hanno Mottola was held to seven points but his basket with 3:10 to play and
his 3-point play with 2:17 remaining helped the Utes (14-3, 3-0 Mountain West)
extend the nation's longest homecourt winning streak to 46 games.
</P>
<P>
	   It also was Utah's 31st straight victory at home in league games, including
play in the old Western Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The Utes shot 39 percent (23-of-59) but the defense produced an answer to
every threat by the resilient Cowboys (11-8, 1-3), who lost for the fourth time
in their last five games.
</P>
<P>
	   Nate Althoff scored 13 points and Jeremy Killion had 14 for Utah, which
played Wyoming for the first time since February 1998 because of the convoluted
schedule in the old 16-team WAC.
</P>
<P>
	   LeDarion Jones led the Cowboys with 19 points and Bailey added 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah led 37-32 at halftime and the Cowboys rallied three times from at least
five points down in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   But Wyoming couldn't score when it counted the most. After the Cowboys
pulled within 63-61 on a basket by Marcus Bailey with 2:46 to play, they didn't
score again.
</P>
<P>
	   One week ago, the Utes won at BYU by holding the Cougars scoreless over the
final seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Jensen came up with some huge plays against Wyoming, including his block of
Chris McMillian's layup with 1:19 on the clock and the Utes leading 66-61.
</P>
<P>
	   Jensen drew cheers on a steal while falling with 7:47 to play, igniting a
fastbreak that Jeff Johnsen capped with a 3-point play for a 58-52 lead. But
Wyoming answered on a finger-roll under the basket by Josh Davis and two free
throws by McMillian.
</P>
<P>
	   Killion's 3-pointer with 4:12 remaining gave Utah a 61-54 lead. Again, the
Cowboys came back as McMillian hit two free throws and Jones capped a 3-point
play to make it 61-59 with 3:25 left.
</P>
<P>
	   That's when Mottola, who was tentative after getting two fouls in the game's
first three minutes, got involved. He hit an eight-foot turnaround and took a
feed from Jensen for a layup and, after being fouled, a free throw.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah seemed ready to blow the game open early in the second half, after Tony
Harvey's two free throws gave the Utes a 48-42 lead. But Jones scored four
baskets during an 8-2 run that tied it at 50 with 12:36 remaining.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers met with Attorney General
Janet Reno today and expressed how much they want the boy back in Cuba. Reno,
who has supported Elian's return, said in a written statement the grandmothers
"made a very compassionate and heartfelt plea" but that the matter now is in
federal court. Attorneys for the boy's relatives in Florida have asked a federal
judge to prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing. The INS has ordered
the boy returned to Cuba. Reno has agreed, saying the youngster belongs with his
father in the communist island where he was reared.

	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Hitting every corner of the state, Republicans
squabbled over abortion and taxes in a fight for their conservative base today,
as presidential candidates in both major parties braved nasty weather to rally
supporters to Iowa's caucuses. On Monday night, about 10 percent of the state's
1.8 million registered voters are expected to gather in living rooms, schools,
church basements and fire stations to announce their support of candidates. Few
convention delegates are at stake, but the real reward in Iowa and the Feb. 1

Ecuador Vice President Takes Power

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's vice president assumed the presidency today
-- ending, at least for now, a political crisis that exploded when Indian
protesters aided by a cadre of junior military officers seized power and ousted
a highly unpopular president. Vice President Gustavo Noboa's sudden ascension
came after Ecuador's military chief, buckling to U.S. pressure, dissolved a
three-man junta that had claimed power just few hours earlier. Noboa becomes the
sixth president since 1996 in this troubled nation, which has suffered years of
political and economic turmoil.

EgyptAir Families To Get $115M

	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- The families of those killed on EgyptAir Flight 990
will receive a total of about $115 million in insurance payouts, the airline's
chairman said in remarks published Saturday. The figure conflicted with EgyptAir
Chairman Mohammed Fahim Rayan's statements in November, when he said the payment
would be $100,000 for every one of the 217 people on board the plane that
plunged into the Atlantic Ocean on Oct. 31. Investigators have speculated that
the crash was the result of a deliberate action by the co-pilot, Capt. Gameel
El-Batouty. EgyptAir has rejected the suicide possibility and said that all its
pilots undergo routine physical and psychological testing.

Gore as stronger than Bradley on international affairs, the economy and even

Cowboys were the fourth ranked team the Aggies have faced in their last five

<HEADLINE> Van Crashes With 17 on Board  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOWLER, Colo. (AP) -- A van crowded with 17 people crashed on a rural highway
in southeastern Colorado early Saturday, killing three passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the passengers were Mexican nationals, and immigration officials
were trying to determine their status.
</P>
<P>
	   All 14 survivors were hospitalized, eight of them in critical condition,
State Patrol Trooper Richard Breece said.
</P>
<P>
	   The driver lost control on a remote stretch of Colorado 10 about 130 miles
southeast of Denver, and the van skidded across the road and rolled into a
ravine.
</P>
<P>
	   The van was registered in Greeneville, Tenn., and belonged to the driver,
Guadalupe Gonzales, Breece said. Breece said that Gonzales used several aliases
and that warrants had been issued in Texas for his arrest. He didn't know why
the warrants were issued.
</P>
<P>
	   In another crash Friday, one man died and several people were injured when a
van carrying at least 22 Mexican nationals believed to have been headed for
Colorado blew a tire and overturned in southern New Mexico.

<HEADLINE> Italian Military Holds Fashion Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME (AP) -- Twirling their capes on the Spanish Steps on Saturday, models
showed off the carabinieri military police's first uniform redesign since 1814
-- a high-heeled makeover for women's entry to Italy's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Italian designer Rocco Barocco handled the changes for the 186-year-old
military police. He included such alterations for women as holsters that skim
the hips.
</P>
<P>
	   The differences ``are details that you can't explain but you notice,''
Barocco said.
</P>
<P>
	   Italy in September became one of the last countries in Western Europe to
accept female volunteers in the military. Women remain exempt from conscription.
</P>
<P>
	   The most noticeable response in Italy was media speculation over suitable
designers for women's uniforms -- a fashion concern in a country where billowing
plumes quiver on the helmets of tank crews and dashing capes twirl at the heels
of police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   The navy premiered its women's uniforms this week: standard boxy uniforms
and bulky camouflage that the press described as rather severe. But the
carabinieri's women's uniform received more favorable attention in its debut on
the Spanish Steps.
</P>
<P>
	   Italy's military academies are saving 250 slots for women in their next
classes. Applications from women already are outstripping those of men for some
officers' schools.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador President Forced Out  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- When deposed President Jamil Mahuad announced his
plan two weeks ago to halt Ecuador's soaring inflation by replacing its currency
with the dollar, he apologized for his delay in trying to stabilize the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I recognize I have been slow to act,'' he said, ``but I have my foot on
the accelerator now.''
</P>
<P>
	   But his surprise move came too late to save him. His repeated failure to
address the economy's collapse had already destroyed Ecuadoreans' faith in him,
and his radical dollar plan struck many as desperate and ill-conceived.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, the military high command forced Mahuad from power after 17
months. The military said it was taking the step to avoid ``a social explosion''
after hundreds of Indians and young military officers stormed the Congress
building and announced the formation of a new government to fight corruption and
work on behalf of the poor.
</P>
<P>
	   For months, Mahuad had been under fire from rivals across the political
spectrum and from business and union leaders who accused him of putting off
crucial decisions that might halt Ecuador's slide.
</P>
<P>
	   Before he announced his currency plan, Mahuad had watched his approval
rating plummet to 7 percent, the lowest of any president since democracy was
re-established in 1979 after a decade of dictatorships. People no longer had
confidence that he could pull the country out of its worst crisis in 70 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He wasted the opportunity of his life,'' said Carlos Vallejo, a former
member of Mahuad's centrist Christian Democracy party and a former president of
Congress. ``Unfortunately, he demonstrated that he is great theoretician but
incapable of making decisions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 50-year-old Mahuad raised great hopes when he took office in August
1998. He had all the right credentials to do the job: a master's degree in
public administration from Harvard, six years of experience as a successful
mayor of Quito, the image of a youthful, honest public servant with fresh ideas.
</P>
<P>
	   But he appeared overwhelmed by the magnitude of Ecuador's problems and the
decisions he had to make.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The job was too big for him,'' public opinion analyst Luis Eladio Proano
said. ``In times of crisis an especially gifted person is needed. Under normal
circumstances he might have got by unnoticed.''

<P>
	   Tall, bespectacled and cerebral, Mahuad seemed to withdraw into himself, not
venturing out of the palace for weeks as the country spun out of control.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent weeks, people commented on the sad look in his eyes, and Aminta
Buenano, a writer, ventured that he felt ``shadowed by the many corrupt
governments'' that preceded him.
</P>
<P>
	   What finally destroyed his credibility was his $1.2 billion bailout of 18
bankrupt banks, especially after a banker who was jailed for fraud said that he
gave $3.1 million to Mahuad's 1998 campaign war chest. The bailout required the
printing of huge amounts of Ecuadorean currency, which fed the inflationary
fires.
</P>
<P>
	   The episode tainted Mahuad in the public eye as just another corrupt
politician, and his political foes rushed in for the kill.

	   ``Politicians should not be the watchdogs of banking and business
interests,'' declared former President Rodrigo Borja, a political enemy. ``They
should defend the public interest.''

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Writers Convicted  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT (AP) -- A court handed down suspended two-month prison sentences to
two Kuwaiti writers Saturday after convicting one of blasphemy and the other of
indecency.
</P>
<P>
	   Alia Shuaib, who teaches philosophy at Kuwait University, was found guilty
of ``publishing opinions that ridicule religion'' and blasphemy in a book she
published in 1993, ``Spiders Bemoan a Wound.''
</P>
<P>
	   Laila al-Othman was convicted of using indecent language in her book ``The
Departure,'' which had been approved by government censors in 1984.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutions were initiated by Muslim fundamentalists. The court ordered
the authorities to withdraw all copies of both books from the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Shuaib, 36, told The Associated Press she would appeal the conviction.
Al-Othman, who is in Lebanon, could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The judges did not say what they found offensive in the books. Muslim
fundamentalists have become increasingly influential in Kuwait in recent years.
They are represented by some 20 lawmakers in the 50-seat Parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   The court also gave a suspended two-month sentence to Yehya al-Rubaian, the
publisher of ``Spiders Bemoan a Wound.'' He was fined the equivalent of $328 for
publishing the book without government approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Shuaib's lawyer has said that the only part of her book that mentions God is
the phrase ``God's secret map.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Othman's attorneys have said their client used words such as ``lustful''
in describing the relationship of one sea wave with another, but had not
intended this to have a sexual connotation. The lawyers, Rashid al-Enezi and
Mansour al-Fadhli, also said that when a character in ``The Departure'' tells
his roommates, in a moment of despair, that they can rape him, he did not really
want to have sex with them. The remark was an expression of his psychological
state.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement handed in to the court and published by the newspaper
Al-Siyassah, the lawyers said Arabic and Islamic literature is full of such
writings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Do people now have a different definition of decency?'' the statement
asked.

<HEADLINE> Syria Wants Israeli Pledge  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Before peace talks resume, Israel should provide a
written pledge to withdraw from the Golan Heights to 1967 prewar borders, a
Syrian government-run newspaper said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   ''(Ehud) Barak should adopt a clear-cut policy and deposit a written
document to the American side in which he has to reaffirm that his promise to
abandon the Golan was not mere talk,'' Al-Thawra said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
	   In Syria, newspapers are state-run and reflect government views. The
editorial was Damascus's first public indication that it may not return to the
talks without such a written pledge.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Saturday, Syrian President Hafez Assad briefed President Hosni Mubarak
of Egypt on the Syrian-Israeli peace negotiations, which have been indefinitely
postponed. Mubarak flew to Damascus early Saturday for a previously unannounced
visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria and Israel resumed peace talks last month for the first time in nearly
four years. A third round of negotiations was to have begun Wednesday in the
United States, but it was delayed.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria has said it will not return to the talks unless Israel is prepared to
commit itself to a complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights it captured in the
1967 Arab-Israeli War. Israel has insisted on knowing what sort of security
guarantees and peacetime relations Syria would offer in return for a withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian presidential spokesman Jubran Kourieh said Mubarak and Assad met
three times Saturday, once alone and twice with their ministers. Speaking to
reporters after the talks, Mubarak said he backed the Syrian demand for an
Israeli withdrawal to the prewar borders, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Mubarak was expected to stay overnight in the Syrian capital and leave
Sunday for Jordan, where he will hold talks with King Abdullah.

<HEADLINE> Elian's grandmothers meet with attorney general  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers told Attorney General
Janet Reno "how much they are suffering" over the 6-year-old's continued stay in
the United States and appealed for help Saturday in reuniting the youngster with
his father in Cuba.
<P>
	   The grandmothers gave her a letter expressing the wish that Elian be
returned to "the normality of life with his father, brother, family, friends at
schools, his toys, dog and parrot."
</P>
<P>
	   Reno, who has supported Elian's return, said in a written statement the
grandmothers "made a very compassionate and heartfelt plea" but that the matter
now is in federal court.
</P>
<P>
	   "We maintain that the law recognizes the unique relationship between parent
and child and that family reunification has long been a cornerstone" of U.S
immigration law as well as Immigration and Naturalization Service practice, she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the boy's relatives in Florida have asked a federal judge to
prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariela Quintana, the boy's paternal grandmother, and maternal grandmother
Raquel Rodriguez did not speak to reporters after the 45-minute meeting at the
Justice Department. But their three-paragraph letter was released, and officials
of the U.S. and Cuban Council of Churches described their sentiments afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   "The two grandmothers expressed how much they are suffering because of this
separation from their family on behalf of Elian Gonzalez, the Very Rev. Oden
Marichal, head of the Cuban church group, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   "This has been a very good opportunity for them to express their deep
feeling as grandmothers to the (attorney general) asking the return of Elian to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "We understand that grandchildren belong to every grandfather and
grandmother."
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ordered the boy returned to Cuba. Reno has agreed, saying the
youngster belongs with his father in the communist island where he was reared.
The grandmothers sought the meeting with Reno and Doris Meissner, the INS
commissioner, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from National Council of Churches, which represent mainline
Protestant denominations, have been serving as the grandmothers' hosts during
their stay of undetermined length in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Bob Edgar, a former Democratic House member and general secretary
of the church organization, said the grandmothers "shared with the attorney
general their pain in the loss of this grandchild. Both grandmothers articulated
as clearly as anyone could the hunger and passion that they have to return their
grandchild to Cuba."
</P>
<P>
	   Edgar said the grandmothers' only plans so far were to return Saturday to
New York City. No plans have been announced for the women to visit the boy, who
is with his Miami relatives, or to return home. But the grandmothers wrote in
their letter: "We only have Sunday to see Elian, and we not only want to see
him, but we also want to return with him to Cuba."
</P>
<P>
	   The women must go to Miami to visit Elian, said Armando Gutierrez, spokesman
for the Florida relatives caring for the youngster.
</P>
<P>
	   "The doors are open and the welcome mats are out. The family would love for
them to come here to Miami. In fact, they are surprised they went to New York
and Washington and have not come here," he said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers so far have chosen to avoid Miami, where Cuban immigrants
staged massive protests after the INS ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Edgar told reporters the meeting was intended "to open the dialogue and the
conversation" with Reno. "The grandmothers had a wonderful opportunity to speak
to them and that's really all that I can say at this time."
</P>
<P>
	   He said Reno "showed enormous compassion for these two courageous women.
There was a long opportunity where they simply talked back and forth with each
other. It was a very personal meeting."
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been in the middle of a custody fight between the U.S. relatives
in Miami's politically powerful Cuban community and the father and grandmothers
living in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The fight has escalated far beyond a family feud, becoming the latest
centerpiece of the decades-long battle between anti-Castro Cubans and Cuban
President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov.
25 after the boat taking him to the United States capsized, killing his mother,
her boyfriend and nine other people.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers' letter said Elian's stay in the United States "adds to the
tragedy of the family over the loss" of the boy's mother, Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
	   They expressed gratitude that the U.S. government had affirmed the paternity
rights of father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, but expressed frustration over the
prolonged custody fight.
</P>
<P>
	   "We ask that you return Elian to his immediate family and not to his distant
family where there had not been a previous relationship. This is the reason for
being here, and we thank you for this interview," the grandmothers wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   While the matter goes through the courts, lawmakers in Congress plan an
attempt this week to declare Elian a U.S. citizen. If such legislation becomes
law, the boy no longer would be an immigrant under INS jurisdiction.

<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Justin Love scored 10 of his 18 points in overtime and Saint
Louis upset No. 23 DePaul 75-69 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Saint Louis (10-7, 2-3 Conference USA) had lost eight straight road games
and DePaul (12-6, 3-3) has lost three of four, all against unranked opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   After Quentin Richardson, who had 22 points, hit a 3-pointer to give DePaul
a 63-62 overtime lead, Love hit four free throws and two jumpers to give Saint
Louis a 70-65 edge with 47 seconds left. Rashon Burno's jumper cut the lead to
three with 28 seconds left, but St. Louis' Dave Fergerson, who had 18 points,
made three free throws in the final 25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Saint Louis held DePaul to 33 percent shooting in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   DePaul came out sluggish, committing 13 first-half turnovers, many on lazy
passes and sloppy ballhandling. The Billikens led 15-12 when Troy Robertson
scored and was fouled hard by reserve point guard George Baker. Baker was
sandwiched by Robertson and teammate Kerry Hartfield as he fell to the floor and
had to be helped off the court with a back injury. He did not return.
</P>
<P>
	   Saint Louis built a 30-23 halftime lead thanks to eight points on 4-of-4
shooting by center Chris Heinrich.
</P>
<P>
	   DePaul came out with some fire after the break, scoring the first seven
points to tie the game. The Billikens, missing an opportunity to regain control,
turned the ball over seven times over nine possessions midway through the second
half.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither team led by more than three points through the remainder of
regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   After a wild miss by DePaul point guard Rashon Burno, Fergerson scored on a
layup to give the Billkens a 58-56 lead with two minutes left. Bobby Simmons hit
two free-throws to tie the game with 33 seconds remaining. The Billikens held
for the final shot and Justin Love missed a short jumper with three-tenths of a
second to go.

<HEADLINE> No. 24 Maryland 74, Clemson 62  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GINSBURG AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Tahj Holden had 12 points and 10 rebounds in his
first career start and No. 24 Maryland allowed only eight first-half baskets
Saturday in handing Clemson a 74-62 loss, its sixth straight.
</P>
<P>
	   The Terrapins (13-5, 2-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) were without No. 2
scorer Terence Morris, who sprained his left ankle Wednesday against Wake
Forest. The junior forward had played in 83 straight games, including 51
consecutive starts.
</P>
<P>
	   Holden performed more than adequately in his place. Holden, a 6-foot-10
freshman, backed up a 17-point performance against Wake Forest with his first
career double-double and also blocked five shots.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Dixon scored 18 points and Danny Miller 15 for the Terrapins, who have
won two straight after a three-game skid.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrius Jurkunas scored 16 for Clemson (6-12, 0-5). The Tigers, who last
lost their first five ACC games in 1993, are winless since Dec. 29.
</P>
<P>
	   Will Solomon, who came in averaging an ACC-best 21.6 points per game, scored
12 on 4-for-14 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   The Terrapins shot just 40 percent and made only 10 of their school-record
31 attempts from 3-point range. But Maryland became the third team to outrebound
Clemson and held the Tigers to 30 percent shooting in the decisive first half.
</P>
<P>
	   After falling behind 38-22 at halftime, Clemson closed to 52-41 with eight
minutes left. Maryland erased any doubt with a 9-0 run to go up by 20.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tigers got the first basket of the game, but that was their only lead.
The Terrapins scored the next 10 points and led 15-6 after holding Clemson to
2-for-13 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   It was 17-11 before Drew Nicholas and Miller made successive 3-pointers to
put Maryland up by 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Solomon's first two shots were air balls, and he was 0-for-5 before finally
connecting with 2:47 left in the first half. The 17-footer made it 28-17, but
Dixon followed with a 3-pointer and Miller got a putback to boost the margin to
16.

<HEADLINE> North 24, South 21  </HEADLINE>
    By JENNA FRYER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   AUBURN, Ala. (AP) -- Call it a draw.
</P>
<P>
	   Chad Pennington and Chris Redman, considered by most scouts as the top two
quarterbacks in the NFL draft, each directed two scoring drives Saturday while
leading the North to a 24-21 victory over the South in the Senior Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The two, friends since meeting at the 1998 Motor City Bowl, had insisted all
week there was no competition between them. They even said neither cared who was
drafted higher, much less who started the game.
</P>
<P>
	   But it did matter to the scouts, who charted their every move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennington got the starting nod, but only played four series. The Marshall
quarterback threw for 92 yards and a 4-yard touchdown pass to UCLA's Danny
Farmer in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fourth quarter he led the North on a game-tying scoring drive,
completing four of five passes before Michigan's Aaron Shea scored on a 2-yard
run that made it 21-21.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennington completed 11 of 14 passes and was the game's Most Valuable
Player.
</P>
<P>
	   Redman, of Louisville, entered the game on the North's third possession and
played five series.
</P>
<P>
	   He didn't throw for any touchdowns, but led the North on two scoring drives.
He helped the North take a 14-7 second quarter lead by directing a nine-play
drive that ended with a 6-yard touchdown run by Ohio State's Michael Wiley.
</P>
<P>
	   He later led the North on its game-winning drive, moving them 12 plays --
and completing a 15-yard pass to Farmer on fourth-and-11 -- before Michigan
State's Paul Edinger kicked the go-ahead field goal with 5:19 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Redman finished 12-of-20 for 134 yards and was the North's Most Valuable
Offensive Player.
</P>
<P>
	   Penn State's Brandon Short was the North's Most Valuable Defensive Player.
</P>
<P>
	   New Mexico's Brian Urlacher was the South's Most Valuable Defensive Player
and Arizona State's J.R. Redmond was the South's Most Valuable Offensive Player.
Redmond led all rushers with 61 yards on 10 carries.
</P>
<P>
	   Redman and Pennington weren't the only two quarterback to thrive. Of the
game's six QBs, only Hofstra's Giovanni Carmazzi failed to lead a scoring drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin overcame two first-half interceptions and
threw a 36-yard touchdown pass to Alabama's Shamari Buchanan in the third
quarter. That gave the South a 21-14 lead with 7:03 to play in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin finished 5-of-8 for 65 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Louisiana Tech's Tim Rattay directed a 13-play second quarter drive that led
to a 4-yard touchdown run by LSU's Rondell Mealey. Rattay finished 5-of-12 for
45 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   And Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton engineered a 10-play drive that ended in a
1-yard touchdown run by Arizona State's Terrelle Smith and tied the game at
14-14 right before halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamilton finished 5-of-8 for 49 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   The game got off to an auspicious start for its two celebrated heroes.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama running back Shaun Alexander and Martin, a Mobile native, were
introduced last and greeted with the largest applause of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Both started the game for the South and both produced the first turnovers.
Alexander fumbled the ball at the end of a 10-yard gain. It was recovered by
Minnesota's Tyrone Carter, but didn't lead to any points for the North.
</P>
<P>
	   The South wasn't so lucky on its next possession, when Martin was
intercepted by Michigan State's Julian Peterson, who returned it 20 yards to the
South 17-yard line. The North turned it into a 7-0 lead six plays later when
Pennington threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Farmer.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin was intercepted a second time in the waning moments of the first half
by Penn State's David Macklin.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander finished with 32 yards on seven carries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Officer Leaves for U.S.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- In the first U.S.-Chinese military contact since NATO's
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia last spring, a senior Chinese
general left for the United States on Sunday to meet with Pentagon officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Gen. Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of the general staff of the People's
Liberation Army, will hold three days of talks in Washington next week with U.S.
Undersecretary of Defense Walter Slocombe and other officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Xiong is one of China's most politically influential generals and is known
for his hard-line views on the United States. A former head of military
intelligence, he sits on the ruling Communist Party's committee that sets policy
toward Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
	   The talks will be the first high-level meetings between the two militaries
in 13 months. They should help dispel the lingering ill will that has clouded
Chinese-U.S. relations since the May 7 bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   Military exchanges have been among the most complex and hard-won gains in
the two countries' relations. Cut off after the Chinese military quelled the
Tiananmen Square democracy protests in 1989, the exchanges ploddingly resumed in
1993 and progressed to include base visits and discussions of disaster relief
operations.
</P>
<P>
	   But after U.S. warplanes fired satellite-guided missiles into the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, China broke off the military contacts as well as
consultations on arms control and human rights. It also effectively suspended
negotiations on its entry into the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Although China has never accepted Washington's explanation that the attack
was accidental, a WTO deal in November and an agreement last month on
compensation for the bombing led Beijing to agree to restart military contacts.
</P>
<P>
	   But the bombing heightened the Chinese military's suspicions of U.S.
intentions. And despite resuming contacts, the military remains wary, especially
on the issue of Taiwan's status.
</P>
<P>
	   The military sees itself as the ultimate defender of China's claim to the
island, a former U.S. ally that Washington by law must aid in defending.
</P>
<P>
	   China calls Taiwan the most sensitive issue in relations with the United
States. U.S. failures to curb arms sales to Taiwan have hurt relations and
increased tensions between the mainland and the island, a state-run newspaper
quoted a diplomat at the Chinese Embassy in Washington as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The supply of weapons could drag the U.S. into a war that it is neither
prepared for nor willing to fight,'' the China Daily quoted Liu Xiaoming as
saying in Sunday editions.
</P>
<P>
	   Liu said Chinese-U.S. relations are making progress. But he said several
issues are still plaguing cooperation, including Taiwan, Washington's decision
to censure China before the U.N. Human Rights Commission and congressional
opposition to granting Beijing the same permanent low-tariff trading rights
given other trade partners.

<HEADLINE> Saddam To Give Jordan $300M of Oil  </HEADLINE>
   By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- President Saddam Hussein has agreed to give Jordan
$300 million worth of crude oil this year, Jordanian and Iraqi ministers said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The grant was part of two oil and trade accords the ministers signed
Saturday after months of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan has received all its oil from Iraq at reduced prices since 1991.
Jordan pays for the oil by exporting goods to Iraq. The deal is an exemption to
the U.N. sanctions imposed on Baghdad for its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
	   Saddam's grant, previously set at $250 million, represents almost half the
value of oil that Jordan wants to import from Iraq this year, said Jordan's
Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, Waiel Sabri.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I extend my gratitude for the grant ordered by his excellency President
Saddam Hussein, which is highly appreciated by the Jordanian people,'' said
Mohammed Halayqah, the Jordanian minister of trade and industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan has agreed to pay a maximum of $19 a barrel for any oil it imports
above the grant, so long as the world price maintains its current high level.
Iraq currently sells its oil at $24 per barrel.
</P>
<P>
	   It is not clear what prompted Iraq to offer Jordan terms even better than
last year. There has been a strain in the countries' relations because of
Jordan's shift towards Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, Iraq's main opponents in the
Arab world, and its hosting of Iraqi dissident groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iraqi officials, Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid and Trade Minister
Mohammed Mehdi Saleh, said the deal's terms were decided by Saddam.

<HEADLINE> Chileans Demand Trial of Pinochet  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Several hundred people marched through downtown
Santiago on Saturday to oppose the release of Gen. Augusto Pinochet from
detention in Britain and demand that he be tried for human rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
	   The peaceful demonstration was called by human rights groups and relatives
of victims of repression under Pinochet's 1973-90 dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrators carried posters asking that Pinochet be extradited to
Spain, where judge Baltasar Garzon wants to try him on torture charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Pinochet was arrested in London 15 month ago on a warrant by Garzon.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstration came as the British government sought more information
from the parties in the case before deciding whether to free the 84-year-old
former dictator for health reasons or send him to Spain.
</P>
<P>
	   British Home Secretary Jack Straw has said he was inclined toward sending
Pinochet back to Chile after doctors said he may to be too ill to stand trial. A
decision by Straw is expected early next week.
</P>
<P>
	   At the demonstration Saturday, Viviana Diaz, president of an organization of
relatives of dissidents who disappeared after being arrested by Pinochet's
security services, asked Straw not to release him.

<HEADLINE> President Thanks Bush for Candor  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The future of legalized abortion depends on the outcome
of the 2000 presidential race, President Clinton told Democratic Party donors
Saturday. ``To pretend otherwise is naive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   And he said Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush, by
endorsing a constitutional amendment banning abortion, laid out clearly for
American voters the choice facing them in November.
</P>
<P>
	   The next president will likely name more than two justices to the Supreme
Court, Clinton said. That could tip the balance in favor of overturning the Roe
vs. Wade Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is absolutely no question in my mind (that) whether Roe vs. Wade is
preserved or scrapped depends on what happens in the presidential election, and
to pretend otherwise is naive,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Texas governor, recently said he thinks the legal reasoning behind
Roe vs. Wade is thin, and he favors overturning the decision. He has also said
he most admires two of the court's most conservative justices -- Antonin Scalia
and Clarence Thomas -- who likely would vote to overturn the ruling issued 27
years ago Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush returned to the subject Saturday, saying the next Republican election
platform should support a constitutional amendment banning abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokeswoman Mindy Tucker noted that Bush, at the same time, has said that
``America is not ready'' now for such an amendment, ``and in the meantime we
should all work to reduce the number of abortions in America.'' She pointed to
his support in Texas for legislation on parental notification, abstinence
education and a streamlined adoption process.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley, support abortion rights and favor retaining the Supreme Court
decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Its not whether you're compassionate or good or bad, it's what you
believe,'' Clinton said in direct reference to Bush's signature slogan of
``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all just ought to tell the American people what we believe, and let the
American people decide,'' Clinton continued. ``And I appreciate Gov. Bush being
candid enough to say he didn't believe in Roe vs. Wade.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Beverly Hills crowd, which had earlier heard Democratic National
Committee chairman Edward Rendell call Bush's comments alarming, laughed
nervously when Clinton cast the argument in a gentler light.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No, no, this is good,'' Clinton said. ``People should say what they think,
and we shouldn't be hateful about it. We shouldn't be mean. ... We should make
sure we know where everybody else is coming from.''
</P>
<P>
	   The speech was the last stop on a two-day trip to Southern California that
mixed business and pleasure for Clinton and his White House staff. After
proposing almost $3 billion in new federal science and technology research,
Clinton golfed, hobnobbed with Hollywood stars and wealthy West Coast moguls and
raised an estimated $150,000 for Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Life imitated art Friday, when press secretary Joe Lockhart and a crew of
White House staff visited the set of the television show ``West Wing,'' a drama
about White House staff.
</P>
<P>
	   In his weekly radio address, taped in California, Clinton said Saturday he
wants to send a ``fraud fighter'' to the office of every Medicare contractor in
the country in a new campaign to root out cheating.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton asked Congress to approve the $43 million cost of the initiative as
part of the federal budget for fiscal 2001. He said it is needed to stop a raid
on the Treasury that persists despite what he called aggressive detection,
enforcement and prosecution efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Medicare fraud and waste are more than an abuse of the system; they're an
abuse of the taxpayer,'' Clinton said. ``By over-billing, charging for phony
procedures and selling substandard supplies, Medicare cheats cost taxpayers
hundreds of millions a year.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton initiative would establish a team of more than 100 financial
management specialists working in the offices of every Medicare contractor.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., the House Republican Conference chairman, commended
Clinton for tackling Medicare fraud but said it was a GOP idea first.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He now so trusts the Republican mantra of fighting fraud that he's even
borrowed our theme of eliminating `waste, fraud and abuse' from the Washington
bureaucracy,'' Watts, R-Okla., said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> Mississippi 79, No. 4 Auburn 77  </HEADLINE>
    By RALPH D. RUSSO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OXFORD, Miss. (AP) -- After dodging upsets for three games with last
minute-heroics, a most unlikely opponent finally knocked off Auburn.
</P>
<P>
	   Mississippi broke a five-game Southeastern Conference losing streak by
beating the fourth-ranked Tigers 79-77 in overtime on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lataryl Williams' putback with 38 seconds left provided a lead for Ole Miss
(13-6 overall, 1-5 Southeastern Conference) and Jason Flanigan sealed the upset
with two free throws with 9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tigers (16-2, 4-1) had won 14 straight, although the last three
victories were by a combined 13 points and had all been decided in the closing
minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the fourth game in a row that we have been in like this," Tigers
coach Cliff Ellis said. "We had our opportunities as did Ole Miss and Ole Miss
capitalized."
</P>
<P>
	   Ellis said the upset proves what he has felt all along, that the SEC is as
tough as any conference in the country.
</P>
<P>
	   "From top to bottom the SEC is perhaps, with the Big Ten, the best league,"
he said. "I don't know where you can go find a game in this league where you can
go, 'OK, just go out there and play and have fun.' You better come to play every
night, home or away or you're going to get beat."
</P>
<P>
	   After beating Kentucky at home on Jan. 11, the Tigers went to the wire to
defeat Mississippi State and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The struggling Rebels proved Ellis right by making big shots when they
needed them most.
</P>
<P>
	   Jason Harrison hit a 3-pointer with 3:15 left in overtime, giving Ole Miss a
71-68 lead. Harrison, John Gunn and Jason Flanigan each had 13 points for Ole
Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   Harrison fouled out on the next possession. Doc Robinson made one free
throw, but the second was waved off because of a lane violation.
</P>
<P>
	   Then the Rebels' Darrian Brown hit a 3 and Ole Miss was up 74-69 with 2:43
left.
</P>
<P>
	   "They made big outside shots, and that was something we weren't expecting,"
Ellis said. "That hasn't been their forte."
</P>
<P>
	   Auburn regained the lead with 57 seconds left on six straight free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   On the next possession, Williams rebounded Brown's missed jumper and his
reverse layup gave the Rebels a 76-75 lead. Williams had 11 points and seven
rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Auburn is the second-best rebounding team in the SEC, but Ole Miss coach Rod
Barnes said he thought his team's quickness could make up for Auburn's size
advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   "They have some great big guys and they're going to block out, but I thought
if we just kept going to the glass we could get one or two offensive rebounds in
big situations," Barnes said. "When it happened I said, 'That's what I'm talking
about."'
</P>
<P>
	   Auburn tried to free up Scott Pohlman, who led the Tigers with 19 points, on
its next possession. But he was called for traveling with 9.8 seconds left
cutting into the lane.
</P>
<P>
	   "I had an open lane but I just went too quick," Pohlman said. "I should have
shot it."
</P>
<P>
	   Auburn fouled Flanigan, who hit both free throws, making it 78-75.
</P>
<P>
	   A layup by Mamadou N'diaye with a 1.4 seconds left cut the lead to two.
Emmanuel Wade hit one free throw, and after Chris Porter's desperation heave at
the buzzer fell short, the crowd at Tad Smith Coliseum rushed the floor.
</P>
<P>
	   Auburn was the third straight ranked opponent Ole Miss had played in eight
days. The Rebels lost to No. 12 Tennessee and No. 18 Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
	   "You call it Murderers' row. I called it Ranked Row," Barnes said. "I think
it will make our team tougher, but I have never questioned the toughness of this
team."
</P>
<P>
	   The 0-5 start in the SEC was the Rebels' worst since the 1995-96 season.
They were the only team left in the SEC without a conference victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson's jumper gave Auburn a 66-64 lead with 49 seconds left in
regulation. Harrison answered with a scoop shot, tying the score with 33 seconds
left.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson missed a 20-foot jumper in the closing seconds of regulation and
Porter couldn't tap in the rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   Robinson has been Auburn's go-to guy during the recent string of close
games, but this time he couldn't bail out the Tigers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It felt good, but it just didn't fall this time," Robinson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Auburn hadn't lost since a 67-58 defeat to Stanford on Nov. 27 in the Wooden
Classic.

<HEADLINE> No. 25 UCLA 83, Arizona St. 77  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Freshman Jason Kapono scored a career-high 24 points and
reserve Matt Barnes added a career-high 17 as No. 25 UCLA held on to beat
Arizona State 83-77 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bruins (11-5, 2-3 Pac-10) trailed most of the second half until Kapono
followed a 3-pointer by Ray Young with one of his own to tie the game at 65 with
7:58 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnes hit a 3-pointer to put the Bruins up 75-69, but the Sun Devils
answered with consecutive 3s by Chad Prewitt and Tanner Shell to draw within one
with 50 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnes missed a dunk, but Young grabbed the rebound and then Eddie House
fouled Kapono, who made both free throws with 20 seconds left for an 80-77 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Alton Mason missed a 3-point attempt and Prewitt intentionally fouled Earl
Watson for his fifth foul. Watson made the second of two free throws for an
81-77 lead with eight seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bruins got possession and Jerome Moiso, who had 22 points for UCLA, was
fouled. He made both for the game's final points with seven seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Awvee Storey, a 22-year-old sophomore, led Arizona State with 21 points.
</P>
<P>
	   House, who came in averaging 30.4 points in Pac-10 play, finished with 18 as
the Sun Devils (11-6, 3-3) lost their 22nd consecutive game to the Bruins. They
haven't won at Pauley Pavilion in nearly 13 years and haven't beaten UCLA since
1989.
</P>
<P>
	   House scored the Sun Devils' first 12 points of the game on 3-pointers, but
he was held in check by Watson in the second half when House had just five.
</P>
<P>
	   With Arizona State trailing 72-69, House missed the front end of a 1-and-1
and Barnes came down to hit a 3-pointer for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bruins outscored Arizona State 18-12 over the final 7:10, including
making 8 of 10 free throws.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Call it a draw.
</P>
<P>
	   Chad Pennington and Chris Redman, considered by most scouts as the top two
quarterbacks in the NFL draft, each directed two scoring drives Saturday while
leading the North to a 24-21 victory over the South in the Senior Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   The two, friends since meeting at the 1998 Motor City Bowl, had insisted all
week there was no competition between them. They even said neither cared who was
drafted higher, much less who started the game.
</P>
<P>
	   But it did matter to the scouts, who charted their every move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennington got the starting nod, but only played four series. The Marshall
quarterback threw for 92 yards and a 4-yard touchdown pass to UCLA's Danny
Farmer in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fourth quarter he led the North on a game-tying scoring drive,
completing four of five passes before Michigan's Aaron Shea scored on a 2-yard
run that made it 21-21.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennington completed 11 of 14 passes and was the game's Most Valuable
Player.
</P>
<P>
	   Redman, of Louisville, entered the game on the North's third possession and
played five series.
</P>
<P>
	   He didn't throw for any touchdowns, but led the North on two scoring drives.
He helped the North take a 14-7 second quarter lead by directing a nine-play
drive that ended with a 6-yard touchdown run by Ohio State's Michael Wiley.
</P>
<P>
	   He later led the North on its game-winning drive, moving them 12 plays --
and completing a 15-yard pass to Farmer on fourth-and-11 -- before Michigan
State's Paul Edinger kicked the go-ahead field goal with 5:19 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Redman finished 12-of-20 for 134 yards and was the North's Most Valuable
Offensive Player.
</P>
<P>
	   Penn State's Brandon Short was the North's Most Valuable Defensive Player.
</P>
<P>
	   New Mexico's Brian Urlacher was the South's Most Valuable Defensive Player
and Arizona State's J.R. Redmond was the South's Most Valuable Offensive Player.
Redmond led all rushers with 61 yards on 10 carries.
</P>
<P>
	   Redman and Pennington weren't the only two quarterback to thrive. Of the
game's six QBs, only Hofstra's Giovanni Carmazzi failed to lead a scoring drive.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin overcame two first-half interceptions and
threw a 36-yard touchdown pass to Alabama's Shamari Buchanan in the third
quarter. That gave the South a 21-14 lead with 7:03 to play in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin finished 5-of-8 for 65 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Louisiana Tech's Tim Rattay directed a 13-play second quarter drive that led
to a 4-yard touchdown run by LSU's Rondell Mealey. Rattay finished 5-of-12 for
45 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   And Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton engineered a 10-play drive that ended in a
1-yard touchdown run by Arizona State's Terrelle Smith and tied the game at
14-14 right before halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamilton finished 5-of-8 for 49 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   The game got off to an auspicious start for its two celebrated heroes.

	   Alabama running back Shaun Alexander and Martin, a Mobile native, were
introduced last and greeted with the largest applause of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Both started the game for the South and both produced the first turnovers.
Alexander fumbled the ball at the end of a 10-yard gain. It was recovered by
Minnesota's Tyrone Carter, but didn't lead to any points for the North.
</P>
<P>
	   The South wasn't so lucky on its next possession, when Martin was
intercepted by Michigan State's Julian Peterson, who returned it 20 yards to the
South 17-yard line. The North turned it into a 7-0 lead six plays later when
Pennington threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Farmer.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin was intercepted a second time in the waning moments of the first half
by Penn State's David Macklin.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander finished with 32 yards on seven carries.

<HEADLINE> Poland Lashes Out at Moscow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Poland lashed out at Russia on Saturday for expelling
nine Polish Embassy employees, saying the retaliatory move will create
``unnecessary tension'' between the onetime allies.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, Russia ordered the envoys out ``because of activities not in
accordance with their diplomatic status,'' according to the Russian Foreign
Ministry -- one day after Poland moved to expel nine Russian diplomats on
espionage allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It leads to unnecessary tension in mutual relations between Poland and the
Russian federation,'' said a short statement issued Saturday by Poland's Foreign
Ministry. ``Responsibility for unfriendly steps towards Polish diplomats,
fulfilling their statutory duties in Moscow, falls entirely on the Russian
authorities.''
</P>
<P>
	   Neither country gave details of how the alleged spying was conducted or what
information may have been compromised. Russia's Federal Security Service, the
main successor to the KGB, said in a statement reported by Interfax news agency
that it had evidence supporting the contention that the Poles were spying.
</P>
<P>
	   Jozef Gruszka, the head of the Polish parliament's secret service committee
that heard a government report on the case, said Russian activity involved
``mostly economic and political'' areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia has watched with anger and anxiety as its onetime ally moves closer
to the West, especially when Poland joined NATO last year. That expansion pushed
the Western alliance's reach to the border of Kaliningrad, the Russian enclave
where much of its western naval fleet is based.

<HEADLINE> Woman Charged With Abandoning Baby  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A woman who claimed she found a newborn baby when she
took her family's trash to the curb was arrested Saturday on charges she left
the child outside in a garbage bag on a freezing night last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Jenny Suarez, 21, turned herself into police to face charges of reckless
endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child, both misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
	   She was also charged with filing a false report. Ms. Suarez had told police
that she found the hours-old baby when she took her family's trash to the curb
on Tuesday night. Ms. Suarez's mother then called 911.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It appears she had no idea when she called police that the baby was her
grandchild,'' Lehigh County District Attorney James Martin said during a news
conference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Suarez was taken to Lehigh County Prison in lieu of $25,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
	   The temperature had dropped to 18 degrees at the time Ms. Suarez said she
found the child. The baby, dubbed ``Baby Jane'' by nurses, was in stable
condition at Sacred Heart Hospital on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Bulls 98, Pistons 92  </HEADLINE>
    By NANCY ARMOUR AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- With Grant Hill knocked out of the game and Jerry Stackhouse
having one of his worst outings of the season, the Chicago Bulls took advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Toni Kukoc led five Bulls in double figures with 22 points, Chris Carr
scored a season-high 15 and Dickey Simpkins grabbed a career-high 14 rebounds
Saturday as the Bulls beat the Detroit Pistons 98-92.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Chicago's first victory over Detroit in six games, while it was the
third straight loss for the Pistons.
</P>
<P>
	   The day started going sour for the Pistons with 20 seconds left in the first
half when Hill leapt for a steal and came down so hard on his tailbone the smack
could be heard throughout the United Center. He was on the ground grimacing for
about five minutes before he was helped to his feet and walked gingerly to the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill came back for second-half warm-ups, but was back in the locker room
shortly after and didn't return.
</P>
<P>
	   With Hill out, the Pistons could have used a big game from Stackhouse.
Instead, he tied his season-low with five points on 1-of-8 shooting and was
never a factor.
</P>
<P>
	   Mills made two 3-pointers in a three-minute span to give Detroit a 77-69
lead with 9:31 left in the game, but the Pistons went cold from there. They
didn't score a field goal for the next 5:17 and managed just three free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bulls took advantage as Matt Maloney hit two 3s to spark a 15-3 run that
gave Chicago an 84-80 lead with 4:34 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian Laettner finally hit a layup with 4:14 left to cut the lead to
84-82, but Detroit could get no closer than two points the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pistons did have four players in double figures, but shot 39 percent
(34-of-87) from the floor, just off its season-low, and was only 19-of-31 from
the free throw-line. Detroit also got smothered on the boards, outrebounded by a
whopping 53-39.
</P>
<P>
	   The lone bright spot for the Pistons was Terry Mills, who scored a team-high
20 points, including two 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the Bulls picked up their eighth victory -- two more and those
annoying comparisons to the 1972-73 76ers can stop -- they weren't exactly
crisp. They had 23 turnovers, 13 in the second quarter alone.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Bulls don't care about style points these days. Any win is a good
one.

<TEXT>
<P>
    ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Justin Love scored 10 of his 18 points in overtime
and Saint Louis upset No. 23 DePaul 75-69 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Saint Louis (10-7, 2-3 Conference USA) had lost eight straight road games
and DePaul (12-6, 3-3) has lost three of four, all against unranked opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   After Quentin Richardson, who had 22 points, hit a 3-pointer to give DePaul
a 63-62 overtime lead, Love hit four free throws and two jumpers to give Saint
Louis a 70-65 edge with 47 seconds left. Rashon Burno's jumper cut the lead to
three with 28 seconds left, but St. Louis' Dave Fergerson, who had 18 points,
made three free throws in the final 25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Saint Louis held DePaul to 33 percent shooting in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   DePaul came out sluggish, committing 13 first-half turnovers, many on lazy
passes and sloppy ballhandling. The Billikens led 15-12 when Troy Robertson
scored and was fouled hard by reserve point guard George Baker. Baker was
sandwiched by Robertson and teammate Kerry Hartfield as he fell to the floor and
had to be helped off the court with a back injury. He did not return.
</P>
<P>
	   Saint Louis built a 30-23 halftime lead thanks to eight points on 4-of-4
shooting by center Chris Heinrich.
</P>
<P>
	   DePaul came out with some fire after the break, scoring the first seven
points to tie the game. The Billikens, missing an opportunity to regain control,
turned the ball over seven times over nine possessions midway through the second
half.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither team led by more than three points through the remainder of
regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   After a wild miss by DePaul point guard Rashon Burno, Fergerson scored on a
layup to give the Billkens a 58-56 lead with two minutes left. Bobby Simmons hit
two free-throws to tie the game with 33 seconds remaining. The Billikens held
for the final shot and Justin Love missed a short jumper with three-tenths of a
second to go.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Michael Redd scored nine of his 15 points over the final
3:20 and No. 13 Ohio State scored the game's final 11 points for a 65-64 victory
over No. 19 St. John's on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Buckeyes (13-3) trailed 64-54 with 2:48 left when Bootsy Thornton hit a
3-pointer for St. John's (12-4).
</P>
<P>
	   Ohio State then forced turnovers on the Red Storm's next three possessions
and the defense only intensified over the final seconds as St. John's last two
shots -- a move down low by Glover with four seconds left and a 3-point by Erick
Barkley at the buzzer -- were both blocked.
</P>
<P>
	   Redd, who came into the game averaging 15.1 points per game, struggled
offensively as St. John's seemed to take control of the rematch of last season's
NCAA tournament regional final that was won by 77-74 by the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
	   Redd finally got untracked in the final minutes and his 3-pointer with 1:15
left brought Ohio State within 64-63. St. John's then missed three consecutive
shots.
</P>
<P>
	   The Buckeyes got the ball back with 34 seconds to play and Scoonie Penn was
fouled with 23 seconds left. He made two free throws for the final margin and
set the stage for Ohio State's impressive closing defensive stance.
</P>
<P>
	   Glover's shot was blocked by Ken Johnson, the nation's leading shot-blocker
who finished with a school-record 11. The ball bounced free and Barkley, who
ended last season's meeting with a turnover, had his shot blocked by Penn.
</P>
<P>
	   Penn and Brian Brown each had 16 points for Ohio State, which has won five
straight, including a win over No. 13 Michigan State on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   Thornton finished with a season-high 28 points for the Red Storm and was
6-for-8 from 3-point range. He scored St. John's final 11 points of the game,
including consecutive 3-pointers with 3:38 and 2:48 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Barkley finished with 15 points.
</P>
<P>
	   St. John's was coming in off a 78-70 loss to Seton Hall that followed a win
at then-No. 5 Connecticut last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   St. John's finished 21-for-71 from the field (29.6 percent) and except for
Thornton was 2-for-10 from 3-point range.

<HEADLINE> No. 22 Utah 69, Wyoming 61  </HEADLINE>
    By TIM KORTE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Between the gritty play of Alex Jensen and the
smothering defense that Utah coach Rick Majerus loves to see, the Utes showed
they don't have to shoot well to win.
</P>
<P>
	   Jensen had 19 points and 14 rebounds as No. 22 Utah survived its worst
shooting game of the season to beat scrappy Wyoming 69-61 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Utes shot 39 percent (23-of-59) but the defense produced an answer to
every threat by the resilient Cowboys (11-8, 1-3), who lost for the fourth time
in their last five games.
</P>
<P>
	   "This game was a lesson that you don't have to shoot well to win," Jensen
said. "We relied on our defense instead of a bunch of 3s."
</P>
<P>
	   Hanno Mottola was held to seven points but his basket with 3:10 to play and
his three-point play with 2:17 remaining helped the Utes (14-3, 3-0 Mountain
West) extend the nation's longest homecourt winning streak to 46 games.
</P>
<P>
	   "Mottola wasn't a factor until the last few minutes," Wyoming coach Steve
McClain said. "Then he steps up and does what an All-American is supposed to do.
He wins the game."
</P>
<P>
	   It also was Utah's 31st straight victory at home in league games, including
play in the old Western Athletic Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Nate Althoff scored 13 points and Jeremy Killion had 14 for Utah, which
played Wyoming for the first time since February 1998 because of the convoluted
schedule in the old 16-team WAC.
</P>
<P>
	   LeDarion Jones led the Cowboys with 19 points and Bailey added 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah led 37-32 at halftime and the Cowboys rallied three times from at least
five points down in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   But Wyoming couldn't score when it counted most. After the Cowboys pulled
within 63-61 on a basket by Marcus Bailey with 2:46 to play, they didn't score
again.
</P>
<P>
	   "When both teams play that hard, neither team will get all the bounces,"
Killion said. "But we were the ones to make the big plays in the last two
minutes."
</P>
<P>
	   One week ago, the Utes won at BYU by holding the Cougars scoreless over the
final seven minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Both teams defended very well tonight," Majerus said. "It was a very
hard-fought game. I like hustle plays and our guys always hustled. I just wish
we had played smarter tonight."
</P>
<P>
	   Jensen came up with some huge plays, including his block of Chris
McMillian's layup with 1:19 on the clock and the Utes leading 66-61.
</P>
<P>
	   "From the moment I came here, I've looked to Alex and tried to emulate his
example," guard Tony Harvey said. "I can't tell you how many times he makes a
play at the exact moment we need it."
</P>
<P>
	   Jensen also drew cheers on a steal while falling with 7:47 to play, igniting
a fastbreak that Jeff Johnsen capped with a 3-point play for a 58-52 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   "Al is playing like a senior," Majerus said. "He played hard. His defense
was excellent and his leadership was too. He did a wonderful job."
</P>
<P>
	   Killion's 3-pointer with 4:12 remaining gave Utah a 61-54 lead. Again, the
Cowboys came back as McMillian hit two free throws and Jones capped a 3-point
play to make it 61-59 with 3:25 left.
</P>
<P>
	   That's when Mottola, tentative after getting two fouls in the game's first
three minutes, got involved. He hit an eight-foot turnaround and took a feed
from Jensen for a layup and, after being fouled, a free throw.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Mottola struggled, Majerus praised him for being ready at the end.
</P>

	   "We were out of sync early without Hanno and then it was clear he was
pressing a little bit," Majerus said.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah seemed ready to blow the game open early in the second half, after
Harvey's two free throws gave the Utes a 48-42 lead. But Jones scored four
baskets during an 8-2 run that tied it at 50 with 12:36 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Wyoming's starting shooting guard, Anthony Blakes, limped off the floor
midway through the first half and didn't return. Team officials said may have
broken a toe in his left foot.

<HEADLINE> Strife-Torn Colombia Holds Meeting  </HEADLINE>
   By RICARDO MALDONADO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) -- Beset by guerrilla violence and its worst
recession since the 1930s, Colombia might seem an odd place to convene a meeting
of high-powered business moguls that included the chairmen of America Online and
Mitsubishi.
</P>
<P>
	   But it's precisely because the country needs foreign investment so badly
that President Andres Pastrana's government worked hard to attract a coterie of
international business and financial heavyweights for an unusual weekend
meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL's Jim Kimsey, Mitsubishi's Minoru Makihara and New York Stock Exchange
Chairman Richard Grasso were among the 13 heavyweights who met with government
officials Friday in the balmy Caribbean seaport of Cartagena.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've shared with the most important businessmen in the world our vision
of the Colombia we want in the new millennium,'' Pastrana told a brief press
conference following the one-day event that was closed to the media.
</P>
<P>
	   That the top executives were drawn to Colombia, not exactly an economic
powerhouse, was testimony to Pastrana's tireless efforts to convince the world
that Colombia has more to offer than drugs and violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Also present were former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, now a
partner in a Montreal law firm and a board member of several multinational
corporations, former American Express CEO James Robinson III and executives from
Mexico, Hong Kong, Argentina and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the meeting's key organizers was President Clinton's confidant Vernon
Jordan. The Pastrana government hired the Washington lawyer and lobbyist to help
boost its image.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's proposal earlier this month to provide Colombia with a $1.6
billion emergency aid package was another sign that Pastrana's lobbying was
paying off.
</P>
<P>
	   No new business deals were announced at the Cartagena meeting, however.
</P>
<P>
	   Shriveling foreign investment has exacerbated the nation's recession,
heaping economic woes atop Colombia's perennial political problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials stressed they weren't expecting an immediate rush of foreign
investment to the South American nation where executives buy insurance against
being kidnapped by guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   But it seemed the charms of Cartagena, whose pastel-washed colonial center
is Colombia's top tourist attraction, worked on at least one of Pastrana's
illustrious guests.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Colombia isn't as dangerous as it seems from abroad,'' said Kimsey,
announcing he felt safer in heavily guarded Cartagena than in many U.S. cities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Colombia's principal problem is its image,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
	   Kimsey applauded Pastrana's conservative economic management, but urged
Colombia to make itself more competitive by streamlining bureaucracy and
providing better legal guarantees for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
	   For Wall Street's Grasso, the visit was probably less exciting than his last
to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   He traveled at Pastrana's invitation last June to a meeting with machine
gun-toting leaders of Colombia's most powerful guerrilla group. The trip showed
bravery, but many people accused Grasso of lending undue legitimacy to the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Grasso said he was only trying to enlighten the Marxist insurgents about the
benefits of the global capitalist system.

<HEADLINE> Packers Seek $160M From Taxpayers  </HEADLINE>
    By SARAH WYATT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers want Brown County residents'
support for a 0.5 percent sales tax to pay for renovating historic Lambeau
Field, and team president Bob Harlan said Saturday the Packers are confident the
community will come through.
</P>
<P>
	   The Packers hope to raise $160 million from the sales tax in Brown County
that would cost people an extra 5 cents on every $10 spent to help lift the
team's tumbling financial standing in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   The 0.5 percent sales tax would help cover the cost of the $295 million
renovation, but Packers season-ticket holders also would bear $92.5 million of
the burden with one-time fees, Harlan said.
</P>
<P>
	   Green Bay ticket holders would pay $1,400 and Milwaukee ticket holders would
pay $600, with Packers officials still working out a way for fans to pay the
"user fee" over the course of several years, Harlan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The team would contribute $125.9 million for the renovation and upgrades,
including the fees from season-ticket holders. Green Bay stock proceeds would
add another $20.4 million for the stadium project and a loan from the NFL would
add $13 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The Packers' renovation plan calls for a 5-story red brick and green
wrought-iron atrium called Titletown on the east side of Lambeau Field. It would
include the Packers Hall of Fame, a stadium club and retail space, and would be
open all year.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown County voters would be able to vote on the sales tax in a binding
referendum, as long as the state Legislature and Gov. Tommy Thompson authorize
it. The tax would be in addition to Wisconsin's 5 percent sales tax.
</P>
<P>
	   Voters have supported the Packers before and will do so now, Harlan said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Failure has never been an option for the Green Bay Packers," he said. "When
the future of this franchise has been on the line before, this football team,
this community has always stepped up and made it happen.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't plan to lose. We are going to go into this with a great deal of
confidence," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harlan said the Packers chose to limit the sales tax to Brown County because
the area reaps most of the financial benefits of being "the home of the
Packers."
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. John Gard said he would support legislation letting the Packers take
their case to the Brown County voters and felt most other lawmakers would, too.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just can't envision a scenario in which it wouldn't pass," Gard said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thompson said he would sign such legislation and would personally vote for
the sales tax if he lived in Brown County.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the right thing for us, it's right for Green Bay, it's right for the
state, it's right for our future," Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Money raised from the sales tax would be used for maintenance and upgrades
to public areas of the stadium, Harlan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Packers also are asking for $9.1 million from the state for the
stadium's infrastructure and are open to the idea of a Green Bay Packers license
plate, which Senate Majority Leader Chuck Chvala has supported, Harlan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The team decided to renovate the existing stadium to protect "the intimacy
and tradition of Lambeau Field" and because it would cost an additional $185
million to build a new stadium, Harlan said.
</P>
<P>
	   The renovations would let the team open 4,000 seats a game to non-season
ticket holders. The Packers say there are now 51,000 people on a waiting list
for season tickets.
</P>
<P>
	   The renovation would add about 10,000 new seats, including about 6,000
general admission seats around the rim of the bowl and 4,340 indoor and outdoor
club seats.
</P>
<P>
	   The Packers also would expand the concourse, build more women's restrooms
and improve access for disabled people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Packers Board of Directors voted 45-0 Saturday to approve the renovation
project.
</P>
<P>
	   The team wants to begin the renovations in January 2001, finishing in 2003.
</P>
<P>
	   John Matthews, a lobbyist for the Packers and former chief of staff for
Thompson, said the team hopes the state Legislature would pass legislation
approving a referendum before the spring session ends March 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The Brown County Board of Directors would then schedule a referendum to get
the approval of area residents, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The voters here have the last word," Matthews said.

    TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Angela Lackey came off the bench to score 23 points as
No. 16 Arizona beat Southern California 67-52 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Lackey, replaced by freshman Krista Warren in the starting lineup, scored
six straight points early in the second half to pull the Wildcats (15-3, 4-2
Pac-10) to a 43-27 lead.
</P>

<HEADLINE> No. 17 Oklahoma 80, Iowa St. 75 2OT  </HEADLINE>
    By OWEN CANFIELD AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- Eduardo Najera scored seven of his 25 points in the
second overtime as No. 17 Oklahoma, which blew 14-point second-half lead
Saturday, held on to beat Iowa State 80-75 and end the Cyclones' 13-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sooners (15-3, 3-2 Big 12) were 13-of-27 from 3-point range, including
two by Tim Heskett in the second overtime when they finally were able to put
Iowa State away. Heskett scored all 18 of his points on 3s.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cyclones (16-3, 4-1) outscored Oklahoma 21-7 in the final 6 1/2 minutes
of regulation, missed a chance to take the lead at the end of the first overtime
and then was derailed in the second extra period.
</P>
<P>
	   Marcus Fizer, the Big 12's leading scorer, finished with 20 but didn't score
after regulation. Michael Nurse had 19 and helped carry the Cyclones back after
it appeared Oklahoma would coast to victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sooners had six 3-pointers in the first half, when they twice led by as
many as 16. Consecutive 3s by J.R. Raymond and Heskett gave Oklahoma a 52-38
lead with 6:47 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Nurse scored eight points as the Cyclones rallied. His 3-pointer with 1:38
left made it 59-all and proved to be the final basket of regulation. Iowa State
turned the ball over with 42.9 seconds left, Oklahoma's Raymond missed a shot
with 8 seconds left and Jamaal Tinsley's runner in the lane rolled off the rim.
</P>
<P>
	   Nurse made the first of two free throws with 4.8 seconds left in the first
overtime, tying the score at 63. But he missed the second, and Heskett's
3-pointer at the buzzer missed.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond, who broke out of a scoring slump with 20 points, got a good bounce
on a 3-pointer to give Oklahoma the lead for good in the second OT, 69-67.
Najera converted a three-point play a short time later -- his first basket in
overtime -- and the last of Heskett's 3-pointers made it 75-69 with 1:37 to go.
Najera added four straight free throws as Oklahoma widened the margin to nine in
the final 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond, the Sooners' No. 2 scorer with an average of 15 points per game,
had shot just 32 percent in the previous eight games and was only 15-of-52 from
3-point range.
</P>
<P>
	   But he made three from beyond the stripe during a 14-0 first-half run that
gave the Sooners early control.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss prevented Iowa State from matching the best record to this point in
school history.

<HEADLINE> North 24, South 21  </HEADLINE>
    By JENNA FRYER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOBILE, Ala. (AP) -- Call it a draw.
</P>
<P>
	   Chad Pennington and Chris Redman, considered by most scouts as the top two
quarterbacks in the NFL draft, each directed two scoring drives Saturday while
leading the North to a 24-21 victory over the South in the Senior Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   "Each of them at one time or another demonstrated something that I think
would lead people to say 'He's a guy who can play in the NFL,"' North coach
George Seifert said. "They both played well."
</P>
<P>
	   The two, friends since meeting at the 1998 Motor City Bowl, had insisted all
week there was no competition between them.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone here is working hard and trying to move on to the next level,"
said Penningtonn. "We're just two of those chasing the same dream as everyone
else."
</P>
<P>
	   That attitude led both to say they didn't care who was drafted higher, much
less who started the game.
</P>
<P>
	   But it mattered to the scouts, who charted their every move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Pennington got the starting nod, but played only four series. The Marshall
quarterback threw for 92 yards and a 4-yard touchdown pass to UCLA's Danny
Farmer in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   In the fourth quarter he led the North on a game-tying scoring drive,
completing four of five passes before Michigan's Aaron Shea scored on a 2-yard
run that made it 21-21.
</P>
<P>
	   He completed 11 of 14 passes and was the game's Most Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
	   "I felt really comfortable out there and I think the key to that was to
approach the practices like an actual game," Pennington said. "Then when the
game came, I just tried to have a little fun, toss the ball around and put some
points on the board."
</P>
<P>
	   Redman, of Louisville, entered the game on the North's third possession and
played five series.
</P>
<P>
	   He didn't throw for any touchdowns, but led the North on two scoring drives.
He helped the North take a 14-7 second quarter lead by directing a nine-play
drive that ended with a 6-yard touchdown run by Ohio State's Michael Wiley.
</P>
<P>
	   He later led the North on its game-winning drive, moving them 12 plays --
and completing a 15-yard pass to Farmer on fourth-and-11 -- before Michigan
State's Paul Edinger kicked the go-ahead field goal with 5:19 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Redman finished 12-of-20 for 134 yards and was the North's Most Valuable
Offensive Player.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think it was vintage Chris Redman, but I think I played well," said
Redman, who played two series in the first half then not again until the fourth
quarter. "I had to come in kind of cold from the sidelines, and that's the
biggest thing about these games."
</P>
<P>
	   Penn State's Brandon Short was the North's Most Valuable Defensive Player.
He had seven tackles, six unassisted.
</P>
<P>
	   New Mexico's Brian Urlacher was the South's Most Valuable Defensive Player
with five total tackles -- one for a loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona State's J.R. Redmond was the South's Most Valuable Offensive Player,
leading all rushers with 61 yards on 10 carries.
</P>
<P>
	   Redman and Pennington weren't the only two quarterbacks to thrive. Of the
game's six QBs, only Hofstra's Giovanni Carmazzi failed to lead a scoring drive.
But Carmazzi was on the North with Pennington and Redman, and had to fight for
playing time. On his three short series, he finished 2-of-6 for 18 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin overcame two first-half interceptions and
threw a 36-yard touchdown pass to Alabama's Shamari Buchanan in the third
quarter. That gave the South a 21-14 lead with 7:03 to play in the third
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin finished 5-of-8 for 65 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have a knack for starting slow and finishing strong," said Martin, who
grew up in Mobile and played high school high school just minutes away from the
Ladd-Peebles Stadium.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is where I came from and I wanted to do something good," he said. "I
think I did and now I look forward to bigger and better things."
</P>
<P>
	   Louisiana Tech's Tim Rattay directed a 13-play second quarter drive that led
to a 4-yard touchdown run by LSU's Rondell Mealey. Rattay finished 5-of-12 for
45 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   And Georgia Tech's Joe Hamilton engineered a 10-play drive that ended in a
1-yard touchdown run by Arizona State's Terrelle Smith and tied the game at
14-14 right before halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamilton finished 5-of-8 for 49 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   The game got off to an auspicious start for its two celebrated heroes.
</P>
<P>
	   Alabama running back Shaun Alexander and Martin were introduced last and
greeted with the largest applause of the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Both started the game for the South and both produced the first turnovers.
Alexander fumbled the ball on the first series of the game at the end of a
10-yard gain. It was recovered by Minnesota's Tyrone Carter, but didn't lead to
any points for the North.
</P>
<P>
	   The South wasn't so lucky on its next possession, when Martin was
intercepted by Michigan State's Julian Peterson, who returned it 20 yards to the
South 17-yard line. The North turned it into a 7-0 lead six plays later when
Pennington threw a 4-yard touchdown pass to Farmer.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin was intercepted a second time in the waning moments of the first half
by Penn State's David Macklin.
</P>
<P>
	   Alexander finished with 32 yards on seven carries.

<HEADLINE> Report: Islamic Group To Surrender  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- An Islamic rebel faction has accepted the terms of a
government amnesty and is on the verge of laying down its arms and disbanding, a
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Liberte daily reported that leaders of a faction called the Salafist
Group for Preaching and Combat, led by notorious rebel Hassan Hattab, met on
Thursday and Friday and decided to accept President Abdelaziz Bouteflika's plan
for civil concord.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the plan, Islamic insurgents not guilty of murder, bombing or rape had
until Jan. 13 to surrender in exchange for an amnesty. The amnesty is intended
to help end a violent eight-year insurgency that has left more than 100,000
people dead in Algeria.
</P>
<P>
	   As the Jan. 13 amnesty deadline approached, Hattab tried unsuccessfully to
have it moved back so he could negotiate his group's surrender, unconfirmed news
reports said earlier this month. Hattab's group had reportedly been trying to
get the same terms as more moderate groups that surrendered before the deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   If confirmed, Hattab's agreement to disband would come amid the first signs
of a threatened government crackdown on insurgents who refused the amnesty
offer. According to Saturday's edition of the newspaper El Watan, Algerian
security forces killed 12 members of Hattab's group in a raid overnight
Wednesday in a market in Sid Ali Bounab, 60 miles east of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Hattab's group is a dissident faction of the Armed Islamic Group, Algeria's
most radical insurgency movement. Algeria's interior minister said last week
that 80 percent of Muslim rebels have surrendered, but the Armed Islamic Group
and some other radicals are holding out against the peace plan.

<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Police have detained 19 activists of the outlawed Muslim
Brotherhood, the country's biggest Islamic group, security officials said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrests took place Friday and Saturday in Alexandria, said the
officials, who asked not to be named. The officials said the detainees were all
students at Cairo University. They were brought to Cairo, and prosecutors have
ordered them held for 15 days for interrogation, the officials added.
</P>
<P>
	   The students are accused of joining an illegal organization, trying to
revive the Brotherhood and spreading its ideas among colleagues, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Muslim Brotherhood was founded in 1928 and banned in 1954. It was
tolerated by the government of President Hosni Mubarak until 1995. The
government then cracked down on the group, accusing its members of supporting
the Islamic insurgency that began three years earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of Brotherhood members have been put on trial and scores
imprisoned. The Brotherhood maintains it does not support violence.

Reno Listens To Grandmothers' Pleas
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno met with the grandmothers of
Elian Gonzalez today and listened to their pleas to bring the young boy back to
Cuba. Reno, who has supported Elian's return, said in a written statement the
grandmothers "made a very compassionate and heartfelt plea" but that the matter
now is in federal court. One source familiar with the meeting, speaking only on
condition of anonymity, said the grandmothers were in tears through much of the
meeting. The INS has ordered the boy returned to Cuba. Reno has agreed, saying
the youngster belongs with his father in the communist island where he was
reared.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- President Clinton told members of the Democratic Party
today that the future of legalized abortion depends on the outcome of the 2000
presidential race. This came after Republican George W. Bush, the Texas
governor, said he thinks the legal reasoning behind Roe vs. Wade is thin, and he
favors overturning the decision. Republican spokeswoman Mindy Tucker noted that
Bush, at the same time, has said that "America is not ready" now for such a
change, "and in the meantime we should all work to reduce the number of
abortions in America."

of Konya where they said Hezbollah militants buried their opponents, private NTV

kidnappings and murders of hundreds of people, almost all rivals of the group.
Some corpses have been found with broken bones, possible signs of torture.

Syrian government-run newspaper said today. Syria and Israel resumed peace talks
last month for the first time in nearly four years. A third round of
negotiations was to have begun Wednesday in the United States, but it was
delayed. In Syria, newspapers are state-run and reflect government views. The
editorial was Damascus's first public indication that it may not return to the
talks without such a written pledge.

<HEADLINE> Hanna Leads Subaru Memorial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NAPLES, Fla. (AP) -- Rookie Jen Hanna shot a 5-under-par 67 on Saturday to
take a two-stroke lead after the third round of the Subaru Memorial of Naples.
</P>
<P>
	   Hanna, 13th on the SBC Futures Tour money list last year, birdied three of
the final four holes for a 13-under 203 total on The Club at The Strand. She is
attempting to become the first player to win in her first event since Beverly
Hanson in 1951.
</P>
<P>
	   Hanna, 23, attended Furman University and qualified for the tour by tying
for 13th at the tour qualifying school. Her only previous LPGA tournament was
the 1998 U.S. Women's Open in 1998, when she shot 91-82 and tied for last.
</P>
<P>
	   She was among the first-round leaders Thursday, but when she made the turn,
her name was not on the leaderboard because scorers mixed her up with one of her
playing partners. By the time she was finished, her name was correct on the
leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
	   England's Helen Dobson shot a 64, the best round of the day, to join Nancy
Scranton at 205. Scranton had a 68.
</P>
<P>
	   Cindy Flom (66), Catrin Nilsmark (68), Jane Crafter (69) and Tina Barrett
(70) were three strokes back at 206. Defending champion Meg Mallon, the leader
after the first two rounds, shot a 72 to drop into a five-player group at 207.
</P>
<P>
	   Grace Park, the 20-year-old South Korean star who won the 1998 U.S. Women's
Amateur and 1999 NCAA individual title, shot her second straight 75 for a 220
total.

<HEADLINE> St. Louis 75, No. 23 DePaul 69 OT  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Quentin Richardson was shocked to learn he's turning
pro, just as he was surprised at DePaul's performance against unranked Saint
Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   Justin Love scored 10 of his 18 points in overtime and the Billikens upset
the No. 23 Blue Demons 75-69 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   DePaul (12-7, 3-3 Conference USA) has now lost three of four games against
unranked opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the game, Richardson dealt with questions arising from a report
that he'd told his coaches he intends to apply for the NBA draft after the end
of this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "When the coaches showed me the story, I just laughed. I didn't know what to
think," said Richardson, who had 22 points Saturday. "I knew I never said
anything. It was a false statement by them."
</P>
<P>
	   DePaul coach Pat Kennedy echoed that.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's mindboggling, it's the lowest form of low," Kennedy said. "I feel bad
for Q but I feel worse for you guys. It's a terrible indictment of the media."
</P>
<P>
	   Richardson wasn't sure how the Blue Demons would work out of their slump.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is definitely my lowest point here," Richardson said. "The mood in the
locker room showed me that we wanted to win, but the guys didn't take that to
the court. I don't know if the guys are looking to me too much. I didn't notice
that when I'm out there."
</P>
<P>
	   Saint Louis (10-7, 2-3) had lost eight straight road games.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was our biggest win yet, because it's in conference," Saint Louis
coach Lorenzo Romar said. "As for the streak, that's broken."
</P>
<P>
	   After Richardson's 3-pointer gave DePaul a 63-62 overtime lead, Love hit
four free throws and two jumpers to give Saint Louis a 70-65 edge with 47
seconds left. Rashon Burno's jumper cut the lead to three with 28 seconds left,
but Saint Louis' Dave Fergerson, who had 18 points, made three free throws in
the final 25 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dave played outstanding," Romar said. "And Justin Love decided he wouldn't
let us lose."
</P>
<P>
	   Saint Louis held DePaul to 33 percent shooting in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   "We wanted to wear them out, inside and out," Love said. "Other than
Hartfield, who hit some shots, and Q, they didn't have the shooters for our
zone."
</P>
<P>
	   DePaul came out sluggish, committing 13 first-half turnovers, many on lazy
passes and sloppy ballhandling. The Billikens led 15-12 when Troy Robertson
scored and was fouled hard by reserve point guard George Baker. Baker was
sandwiched by Robertson and teammate Kerry Hartfield as he fell to the floor and
had to be helped off the court with a back injury. He did not return.
</P>
<P>
	   Saint Louis built a 30-23 halftime lead thanks to eight points on 4-of-4
shooting by center Chris Heinrich.
</P>
<P>
	   "The big redheaded kid stepped up," Kennedy said of Heinrich.
</P>
<P>
	   DePaul came out with some fire after the break, scoring the first seven
points to tie the game. The Billikens, missing an opportunity to regain control,
turned the ball over seven times over nine possessions midway through the second
half.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither team led by more than three points through the remainder of
regulation.
</P>
<P>
	   After a wild miss by Burno, Fergerson scored on a layup to give the Billkens
a 58-56 lead with two minutes left. Bobby Simmons hit two free-throws to tie the
game with 33 seconds remaining. The Billikens held for the final shot and Love
missed a short jumper with three-tenths of a second to go.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Kentucky has been able to count on senior Jamaal
Magliore all year. On Saturday afternoon, the team also got production from
sophomore Desmond Allison.
</P>
<P>
	   Allison matched Magliore's point total with a career-high 23 as the No. 18
Wildcats knocked off No. 20 Vanderbilt 83-71 in overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just broke out of a little shooting slump," said Allison, who had shot
just 1-for-10 against Ole Miss on Wednesday. "I had to have a boost of
confidence. I got a couple shots to fall down, and it was great. The basket
looked real big."
</P>
<P>
	   "Desmond was unbelievable," said Wildcats coach Tubby Smith, who got his
200th career victory. "He's been struggling, and you can see that their game
plan was to stay off him so he had wide-open looks at the basket."
</P>
<P>
	   Magliore, who was projected as a late first-round NBA draft pick after his
junior year, added 15 rebounds in 39 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   "Jamaal's just been a workhorse," said Allison, who made 6-for-9 3-pointers
including one to start the overtime. "Him coming back is paying off for us."
</P>
<P>
	   Kentucky was 12-for-27 on 3s and Vanderbilt only 5-for-27.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Kentucky is the most disciplined team we've played," said Vandy
guard Sam Howard, who was 4-for-11 from 3-point range. "Coach (Kevin Stallings)
had told us that they go for the shot block every time."
</P>
<P>
	   The Commodores' Dan Langhi, the SEC's leading scorer, was held to 15 points.
The Wildcats blocked eight shots to none for the Commodores. UK now has blocked
108 shots on the season to 29 for the Wildcats' opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   "Outside of the steal, I don't think anything is as devastating defensively
as the blocked shot," Smith said. "And Jamaal is the best in the country at
blocking the shot."
</P>
<P>
	   Kentucky (13-5 overall, 4-1 Southeastern Conference), which defeated Vandy
(12-3, 3-2) for the 15th straight time, got a key 3-pointer with 29.1 seconds
left in overtime from Tayshaun Prince. With the shot clock running down and UK
up 75-53, Prince double-pumped and made the 3 from the left side.
</P>
<P>
	   The game was tied 65-65 with 54.9 seconds left in regulation when Saul Smith
found Magliore underneath for a dunk to put the Wildcats up 67-65. Vandy's
Howard tied it 67-67 with two free throws with 12.7 seconds left. UK's Keith
Bogans missed a potential game-winning 3 at the end of regulation.

<HEADLINE> Bulls 98, Pistons 92  </HEADLINE>
    By NANCY ARMOUR AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- With Grant Hill knocked out of the game and Jerry Stackhouse
having one of his worst outings of the season, the Chicago Bulls took advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Toni Kukoc led five Bulls in double figures with 22 points, Chris Carr
scored a season-high 15 and Dickey Simpkins grabbed a career-high 14 rebounds
Saturday as the Bulls beat the Detroit Pistons 98-92.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Chicago's first victory over Detroit in six games, while it was the
third straight loss for the Pistons.
</P>
<P>
	   The day started going sour for the Pistons with 20 seconds left in the first
half when Hill leapt for a steal and came down so hard on his tailbone the smack
could be heard throughout the United Center. He was on the ground grimacing for
about five minutes before he was helped to his feet and walked gingerly to the
locker room.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill came back for second-half warm-ups, but was back in the locker room
shortly after and didn't return.
</P>
<P>
	   With Hill out, the Pistons could have used a big game from Stackhouse.
Instead, he tied his season-low with five points on 1-of-8 shooting and was
never a factor.
</P>
<P>
	   Mills made two 3-pointers in a three-minute span to give Detroit a 77-69
lead with 9:31 left in the game, but the Pistons went cold from there. They
didn't score a field goal for the next 5:17 and managed just three free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bulls took advantage as Matt Maloney hit two 3s to spark a 15-3 run that
gave Chicago an 84-80 lead with 4:34 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Christian Laettner finally hit a layup with 4:14 left to cut the lead to
84-82, but Detroit could get no closer than two points the rest of the game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pistons did have four players in double figures, but shot 39 percent
(34-of-87) from the floor, just off its season-low, and was only 19-of-31 from
the free throw-line. Detroit also got smothered on the boards, outrebounded by a
whopping 53-39.
</P>
<P>
	   The lone bright spot for the Pistons was Terry Mills, who scored a team-high
20 points, including two 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Though the Bulls picked up their seventh victory -- three more and those
annoying comparisons to the 1972-73 76ers can stop -- they weren't exactly
crisp. They had 23 turnovers, 13 in the second quarter alone.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Bulls don't care about style points these days. Any win is a good
one.

<HEADLINE> Brazilians Work To Clean Oil Spill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Hundreds of volunteers and experts cleaned up
muck-covered beaches and tried to save endangered birds Saturday as the massive
oil spill polluting Rio's Guanabara Bay continued spreading.
</P>
<P>
	   The work continued four days after a pipeline sprung a leak and spewed
338,000 gallons of crude oil into the bay, according to Petrobras, the
government-owned oil company. Local environmentalists say it is the worst
ecological disaster to hit Rio de Janeiro in a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   CBN Radio reported Saturday that Petrobras President Henri Phillipe
Reichstul has fired the company's corporate and environmental affairs directors
as a result of the spill. He apparently held them responsible for corrosion that
caused the pipeline to leak and faulty software that he said allowed the
accident to go unnoticed for several hours.
</P>
<P>
	   The oil slick spread through the Guapimirim and Jequia mangrove swamps, both
protected areas and important spawning grounds for fish, birds and crustaceans.
State biologists said it would take decades for nature to undo the damage.
</P>
<P>
	   Winds and tides carried the oil toward the mouth of the bay and the open
sea, prompting Rio de Janeiro Governor Anthony Garotinho to urge Petrobras to
put down more barriers to contain the spread. Despite the drift seaward, the
state environmental office said it was unlikely the oil would reach ocean
beaches such as Copacabana or Ipanema.
</P>
<P>
	   As the spill widened over more than 16 square miles, hundreds of workers and
volunteers took to the beaches in hard-hit areas to mop up the oil and dump it
into steel drums. Other volunteers helped biologists wash off oil-blackened
birds and crabs.
</P>
<P>
	   President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has said the $27.5 million fine the
government is likely to slap on Petrobras will be used to pay for the cleanup.

<HEADLINE> Sabbatini Leads Bob Hope Classic  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. (AP) -- An eagle on the 18th hole Saturday gave Rory
Sabbatini a one-stroke lead going into the final round of the Bob Hope Classic,
but it didn't make him the clear-cut favorite to win what figures to be another
shootout in the desert.
</P>
<P>
	   Never mind that Sabbatini, who had an 8-under 64 on the pitch-and-putt known
as Indian Wells, has never won on the PGA Tour before. Or that defending
champion David Duval, who closed with a 59 last year, is only two strokes
behind.
</P>
<P>
	   With amateurs like John Elway and Bill Murray finally going home, Sabbatini
has to worry about any of the 21 players who are within five strokes of the
lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Sabbatini, at 23-under 264, sounded like he was up to the task.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not like I'm sitting there wondering, 'I've had four good days -- when
am I going to have a bad day?' I'm ready to go out there and shoot even lower
tomorrow," said the 23-year-old South African.
</P>
<P>
	   Matt Gogel, a six-time winner on the Nike Tour who finally made it to the
big leagues this year, had a 3-under 68 at Bermuda Dunes and was at 265.
</P>
<P>
	   Another stroke back was Mr. 59, who doesn't believe he has to match history
to cash the $540,000 first-place check on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can promise you, if I shoot 59 I'll win," Duval cracked.
</P>
<P>
	   He also knows that he'll have to start making some putts. Duval failed to
convert several birdie chances and wound up with a 68 at Bermuda Dunes. It could
have been worse except for an exceptional shot that stirred memories of the PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
	   He pulled his tee shot on No. 16 and had no back swing -- there was only
about 18 inches between his ball and a tree, and a root was under the ball.
Duval threw caution to what little wind there was and punched a 7-iron some 70
yards to the right of the green.
</P>
<P>
	   The ball hooked sharply to the left and stopped 25 feet from the hole. The
only thing he didn't do was sprint down the fairway and leap like a pixie, just
like Sergio Garcia did last year at Medinah.
</P>
<P>
	   "I looked to see if I had a chance to hit out of bounds, which I felt like I
had a pretty good chance of doing that," he said. "But I wasn't making any
putts. It was almost like I was in a position where I had to try to force
something."
</P>
<P>
	   He wound up with a par, a string of eight in a row before a birdie on the
18th.
</P>
<P>
	   Also tied with Duval at 266 were Rich Beem, Stephen Ames and Jesper
Parnevik. Frank Lickliter had the best score of the day and of his career -- a
10-under 62 at Indian Wells -- and was in the group at 267.
</P>
<P>
	   One player who won't be around Sunday is Casey Martin, although his debut as
the first PGA Tour member in a cart ended on a memorable note.
</P>
<P>
	   Needing a birdie on his final hole at La Quinta to make the cut, Martin's
3-wood rolled to the edge of the water. He took off his socks and shoes -- even
the stocking that helps control the swelling in his right leg -- and stood in
the water.
</P>
<P>
	   Just like Jean Van de Velde in the British Open, Martin thought the better
of it. He took a drop, made double bogey and finished with a 69.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just blew it on that hole," Martin said. "I'm bummed. Four days of
grinding and playing well, and I get nothing for it. That sucks. That's life.
That's golf."
</P>
<P>
	   Sabbatini had no such concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   He has spent the past two weeks working with his coach and loves the results
he is getting. He missed only two greens on Saturday and finished off his round
in style. With water left and a bunker to the right, Sabbatini saw only the
flagstick.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the frame of mind I have with my swing at the moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Now what he needs is an image of winning.
</P>
<P>
	   He had two chances last year in his rookie season, and one of them featured
a showdown with Duval in the Bellsouth Classic.
</P>
<P>
	   He was tied with Duval until a double bogey from the bunker and the woods on
the 17th hole, then bogeyed the last hole going for broke. Duval birdied two of
his last four holes for his fourth victory of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Atlanta helped me last year," Sabbatini said. "It taught me a harsh lesson
coming down the stretch. I have much more confidence in my game, and it's
building in each round."
</P>
<P>
	   Chances are, he'll have to keep hitting it close and making the birdies to
have a chance at Bermuda Dunes on Sunday. And he may have more than just Duval
to worry about.

<HEADLINE> No. 24 Maryland 74, Clemson 62  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GINSBURG AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Playing without Terence Morris was no problem for
No. 24 Maryland, which simply turned up the defense and unleashed freshman Tahj
Holden on unsuspecting Clemson.
</P>
<P>
	   Holden had 12 points and 10 rebounds in his first career start and the
Terrapins allowed only eight first-half baskets Saturday in handing the Tigers a
74-62 loss, their sixth straight.
</P>
<P>
	   The Terrapins (13-5, 2-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) prevailed despite the
absence of Morris, who sprained his left ankle Wednesday against Wake Forest.
Morris, Maryland's No. 2 scorer, had played in 83 straight games, including 51
consecutive starts.
</P>
<P>
	   "Playing without a (preseason) All-American, before the game I was very
concerned," Maryland coach Gary Williams said.
</P>
<P>
	   Holden performed more than adequately in his place. Holden, a 6-foot-10
freshman, backed up a 17-point performance against Wake Forest with his first
career double-double and also blocked five shots.
</P>
<P>
	   "I guess I made a little statement that I can do a little bit of
everything," Holden said.
</P>
<P>
	   He certainly isn't lacking in confidence, either.
</P>
<P>
	   "I guess you can say I did anticipate it because I look at myself as one of
the better players around," Holden said. "Coming into the ACC I wasn't really
backing down to anybody. I pretty much expected myself to compete at this level.
If I didn't, I wouldn't have came here."
</P>
<P>
	   Andrius Jurkunas scored 16 for Clemson (6-12, 0-5). The Tigers, who last
lost their first five ACC games in 1993, are winless since Dec. 29.
</P>
<P>
	   Will Solomon, who came in averaging an ACC-best 21.6 points per game, scored
12 on 4-for-14 shooting. The Tigers, who have yet to have a full compliment of
scholarship players at a practice this season, started a smaller lineup in
anticipation of the tenacious Maryland press.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clemson still had 17 turnovers, including six by Solomon.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their halfcourt pressure was excellent," coach Larry Shyatt said. "Credit
Maryland's strength and aggressiveness."
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Dixon scored 18 points and Danny Miller 15 for the Terrapins, who have
won two straight after a three-game skid.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a good feeling to be kind of back in the mix," Williams said. "We
can't do anything about the way we started, but we can do something from here on
out. There are some pretty big games coming up and this past week was very
important to us."
</P>
<P>
	   The Terrapins shot just 40 percent and made only 10 of their school-record
31 attempts from 3-point range. But Maryland became the third team to outrebound
Clemson (41-38) and held the Tigers to 30 percent shooting in the decisive first
half.
</P>
<P>
	   After falling behind 38-22 at halftime, Clemson closed to 52-41 with eight
minutes left. Maryland erased any doubt with a 9-0 run to go up by 20.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were really getting shots and I felt that if we kept executing, we would
really be in good shape," Shyatt said. "But we missed shots down the stretch."
</P>
<P>
	   The Tigers got the first basket of the game, but that was their only lead.
The Terrapins scored the next 10 points and led 15-6 after holding Clemson to
2-for-13 shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   It was 17-11 before Drew Nicholas and Miller made successive 3-pointers to
put Maryland up by 12.
</P>
<P>
	   Solomon's first two shots were air balls, and he was 0-for-5 before finally
connecting with 2:47 left in the first half. The 17-footer made it 28-17, but
Dixon followed with a 3-pointer and Miller got a putback to boost the margin to
16.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland freshman Steve Blake shadowed Solomon for much of the game, with
exceptional results.
</P>
<P>
	   "Coming into the game I knew he was going to shoot a lot and I knew I just
had to keep pressure on him and not let him get the ball back every time he gave
it up," Blake said. "It was just a good defensive effort by the whole team."

<HEADLINE> No.13 OSU 65, No.19 St. John's 64  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM O'CONNELL AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Even Ohio State coach Jim O'Brien thought St. John's had
this one locked up.
</P>
<P>
	   With his 13th-ranked Buckeyes trailing No. 19 St. John's by 10 points with
2:48 to play, O'Brien was thinking just what the rest of the crowd of 15,164 at
Madison Square Garden was.
</P>
<P>
	   "Privately, I didn't think we could do it," he said. "I thought it was one
of those games where we just couldn't get anything done."
</P>
<P>
	   The Buckeyes turned up the defense, got some offense from a struggling
Michael Redd and blocked two shots over the final four seconds as they scored
the game's final 11 points for a 65-64 victory over St. John's on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was absolutely an incredible win for us," O'Brien said. "For 38
minutes we had no right winning the game and for the last two we had every
right. This was not one of our better performances but the kids refused to fold
up and go away."
</P>
<P>
	   The Buckeyes (13-3) trailed 64-54 with 2:48 left when Bootsy Thornton hit a
3-pointer for St. John's (12-4).
</P>
<P>
	   Ohio State then forced turnovers on the Red Storm's next three possessions
and the defense only intensified over the final seconds as St. John's last two
shots were blocked -- a move down low by Anthony Glover with four seconds left
by Ken Johnson and a 3-point attempt by Erick Barkley at the buzzer by Scoonie
Penn.
</P>
<P>
	   "What happened was we allowed Ohio State to hang around and be in a position
for players like Redd and Penn to do what they do best," St. John's coach Mike
Jarvis said. "We paid the price for not taking care of the ball when we had to."
</P>
<P>
	   Redd, who came into the game averaging 15.1 points per game, struggled
offensively as St. John's seemed to take control of the rematch of last season's
NCAA tournament regional final that was won by 77-74 by the Buckeyes.
</P>
<P>
	   Redd finally got untracked in the final minutes and his 3-pointer with 1:15
left brought Ohio State within 64-63. St. John's then missed three consecutive
shots.
</P>
<P>
	   The Buckeyes got the ball back with 34 seconds to play and Penn was fouled
with 23 seconds left. He made two free throws for the final margin and set the
stage for Ohio State's impressive closing defensive stance.
</P>
<P>
	   "I wanted the ball when we were down one," Penn said. "I want to be the man
on the spot."
</P>
<P>
	   That's where O'Brien wanted him as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "Not for one second did I think he wasn't making those free throws," O'Brien
said. "Then he made an incredible block on Erick."
</P>
<P>
	   Glover's shot was blocked by Johnson, the nation's leading shot-blocker at
five per game who finished with a school-record 11. The ball bounced free and
Barkley, who ended last season's meeting with a turnover, had his shot blocked
by Penn.
</P>
<P>
	   "There was no contact," said Barkley, who finished with 15 points. "I knew
it was down to a couple of seconds so I had no choice. I tried to get it up as
quick as possible."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Brien said he told his team to make sure Barkley didn't beat them off the
dribble.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have a lot of respect for Erick. I knew he'd be getting the last shot,"
Penn said. "I guarded him close because I knew what to expect."
</P>
<P>
	   Penn and Brian Brown each had 16 points for Ohio State, which has won five
straight, including a win over No. 13 Michigan State on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We never mentioned the Michigan State game (Friday) and today because we
didn't want any excuses about being tired," O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thornton finished with a season-high 28 points for the Red Storm and was
6-for-8 from 3-point range. He scored St. John's final 11 points of the game,
including consecutive 3-pointers with 3:38 and 2:48 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   "Every time we lose it's tough," Thornton said. "We had the game the whole
way and then we helped them make the plays."
</P>
<P>
	   St. John's was coming in off a 78-70 loss to Seton Hall that followed a win
at then-No. 5 Connecticut last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   St. John's finished 21-for-71 from the field (29.6 percent) and except for
Thornton was 2-for-10 from 3-point range.
</P>
<P>
	   When the game ended the Ohio State team and coaches celebrated on the court
jumping in a circle for a while.
</P>
<P>
	   "This game wasn't to that level," O'Brien said when asked if the celebration
was like the one after beating St. John's in Knoxville, Tenn. last March. "This
was just the euphoria of a win on national television, at a place like Madison
Square Garden and over one of the best teams in the country."

<HEADLINE> Crash Survivors Sue Airline  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Five more survivors of a deadly plane crash in
Little Rock, Ark., have sued American Airlines, claiming the company fostered an
atmosphere of carelessness.
</P>
<P>
	   Eleven people died after the MD-82 with 145 people on board skidded off an
airport runway while landing in a thunderstorm June 1. The plane broke into
pieces and caught fire after crashing into a walkway near the Arkansas River.
</P>
<P>
	   Pilot fatigue is among several potential factors the National Transportation
Safety Board has been investigating. The co-pilot had been on duty more than 13
hours the day of the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   An NTSB hearing on the crash is scheduled Wednesday through Friday in Little
Rock.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuits filed Friday in Dallas and Little Rock join more than a dozen
others accusing the airline primarily of failing to adequately train its crew to
deal with severe weather.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This crash has been called a case of a crew trying to beat the weather,
and that's tantamount to trying to beat a train at a crossing,'' attorney John
Howie told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
	   The airport control tower had warned the pilot about poor visibility, wind
shear and gusts up to 52 mph. Wind shear, a sudden change of wind direction, can
cause an aircraft to lose lift and crash, especially during takeoff or landing.
It has been blamed for about 30 U.S. crashes since 1964.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at AMR Corp., American's corporate headquarters in Fort Worth,
declined to comment on the lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our focus is on the NTSB hearings next week,'' spokesman Chris Chiames
said.
</P>
<P>
	   A final NTSB report on the crash isn't expected until late summer or fall.

<HEADLINE> DePaul Track Members in Accident  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RENSSELAER, Ind. (AP) -- Five women from DePaul's track team were injured,
one critically, Saturday when a school van they were riding in rolled over on
Interstate 65 after hitting a patch of ice.
</P>
<P>
	Sophomore Montia Gardner of Gary, was listed in critical condition Saturday
night at St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Lafayette, a hospital spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
	Preston Wolin, DePaul's team physician, said Gardner was on a ventilator and
had been moved to intensive care. ``She is responding to commands and she
recognizes her parents, which is a great sign,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	Gardner, a Gary Lew Wallace grad who was Indiana's 1998 high school discus
champ, was traveling with her teammates to Indianapolis for an invitational
track meet at Butler University when the accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
	``Our thoughts and prayers are with Montia, her family, teammates and coaches,
who are all rallying around her for support,'' said James R. Doyle, DePaul's
vice president for student affairs.
</P>
<P>
	DePaul spokeswoman Denise Mattson said the other four women, which included two
members of the team, a trainer, and an assistant coach, were treated for cuts
and bruises and released from a Jasper County hospital.
</P>
<P>
	Indiana State Police Sgt. Richard Broughton said snowy conditions caused the
crash, which happened about 7:45 a.m. on I-65 about four miles south of
Rensselaer.
</P>
<P>
	``The road was icy and the driver said she hit a patch of ice and slid and the
van rolled over twice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	Talese Branch, the team's assistant coach, was driving, Mattson said. The van
left DePaul's Chicago campus at 7 a.m.

<HEADLINE> No. 25 UCLA 83, Arizona St. 77  </HEADLINE>
    By BETH HARRIS AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Jason Kapono put his white headband back on and in doing
so got his head on straight.
</P>
<P>
	   The freshman scored a career-high 24 points and reserve Matt Barnes added a
career-high 17 as No. 25 UCLA held on to beat Arizona State 83-77 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The win salvaged the week for the inconsistent Bruins, who lost 76-61 to No.
2 Arizona on Thursday night. They shot just four free throws and were 3-of-21 on
3-pointers in that game. Saturday, they hit 18 of 26 free throws and made 7 of
12 from long-range.
</P>
<P>
	   "This was big for us. It would've been tough to lose two at home," said
Kapono, who favors the headband after a poor performance even though his short
hair doesn't need it.
</P>
<P>
	   He had 10 points and 10 of his team's 26 turnovers against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   "Thursday I struggled and it got to my head," he said. "Today I figured I'm
going to play hard throughout."
</P>
<P>
	   The Bruins (11-5, 2-3 Pac-10) trailed most of the second half until Kapono
followed a 3-pointer by Ray Young with one of his own to tie the game at 65 with
7:58 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnes hit a 3-pointer to put the Bruins up 75-69, but the Sun Devils
answered with consecutive 3s by Chad Prewitt and Tanner Shell to draw within one
with 50 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Barnes missed a dunk, but Young grabbed the rebound and then Eddie House
fouled Kapono, who made both free throws with 20 seconds left for an 80-77 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Alton Mason missed a 3-point attempt and Prewitt intentionally fouled Earl
Watson for his fifth foul. Watson made the second of two free throws for an
81-77 lead with eight seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bruins got possession and Jerome Moiso, who had 22 points for UCLA, was
fouled. He made both for the game's final points with seven seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Moiso had seven rebounds and a career-high five blocked shots, which helped
the Bruins to a season-high 11 blocks.
</P>
<P>
	   "We were struggling, so this was really a big game," said Barnes, who helped
UCLA's reserves outscore Arizona State's bench 32-17. "It gives us more
confidence, but we usually win one game and lose one. We've got to be more
consistent."
</P>
<P>
	   Awvee Storey, a 22-year-old sophomore, led Arizona State with 21 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sun Devils left Los Angeles having been swept, including a 95-92
overtime loss at Southern California on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
	   "We never defended," coach Rob Evans said. "We haven't defended in the past
five or six games. Our defense isn't solid enough to win on the road right now."
</P>
<P>
	   House, who came in averaging 30.4 points in Pac-10 play, finished with 18 as
the Sun Devils (11-6, 3-3) lost their 22nd consecutive game to the Bruins. They
haven't won at Pauley Pavilion in nearly 13 years and haven't beaten UCLA since
1989.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we had played as hard like we were capable of defensively, we'd have won
this game. It wouldn't even have come down to the last few minutes," House said.
"We gave up too many transition baskets and offensive boards. We've been playing
harder in practice than in the game. That has to change."
</P>
<P>
	   House scored the Sun Devils' first 12 points of the game on 3-pointers, but
he was held in check by Watson in the second half when House had just five.
Watson took just one shot in the game while focusing all his efforts on House.
</P>
<P>
	   "We made him work really hard for his shots," Watson said.
</P>
<P>
	   With Arizona State trailing 72-69, House missed the front end of a 1-and-1
and Barnes came down to hit a 3-pointer for UCLA.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bruins outscored Arizona State 18-12 over the final 7:10, including
making 8 of 10 free throws.

<HEADLINE> No. 17 Oklahoma 80, Iowa St. 75 2OT  </HEADLINE>
    By OWEN CANFIELD AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORMAN, Okla. (AP) -- No. 17 Oklahoma won a game it couldn't afford to lose.
Iowa State may have won over any skeptics.
</P>
<P>
	   Eduardo Najera scored seven of his 25 points in the second overtime, and Tim
Heskett added two big 3-pointers as the Sooners beat Iowa State 80-75 on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cyclones came in with a school-record 13-game winning streak and proved
it was no fluke, erasing a 14-point deficit in the final 6 1/2 minutes of
regulation and then forcing the issue for 10 more minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   "We desperately did need to win this basketball game," Oklahoma coach Kelvin
Sampson said. "Our kids bent and Iowa State kept putting it to us, but you find
out a little bit about a team through adversity."
</P>
<P>
	   Najera also had 14 rebounds. Heskett scored 18, all on 3-pointers, helping
the Sooners (15-3, 3-2 Big 12) end a two-game losing streak. Both those losses
came on the road.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're going to lose some games on the road, but you've got to defend your
home and that's what we felt we had to do," Heskett said.
</P>
<P>
	   Iowa State (16-3, 4-1 Big 12) scored a season-low 19 first-half points
before coming back. The Cyclones had opportunities to win at the end of
regulation and the first overtime, then dug too deep a hole in the second extra
period.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had our chances and didn't capitalize on them," coach Larry Eustachy
said. "I thought our team really made some great plays down the stretch to even
make it a game."
</P>
<P>
	   Big 12 scoring leader Marcus Fizer finished with 20 but didn't score after
regulation. Michael Nurse had 19 and helped carry the Cyclones back after it
appeared Oklahoma would coast to the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sooners went 13-of-27 from 3-point range. They made six of those in the
first half, when they twice led by as many as 16. After halftime, consecutive 3s
by J.R. Raymond and Heskett gave Oklahoma a 52-38 lead with 6:47 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   But Nurse scored eight points as the Cyclones rallied, scoring on nine of
their 12 possessions. Meanwhile Oklahoma, which had only two turnovers in the
first half, committed 12 in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   Nurse's 3-pointer with 1:38 left made it 59-all and proved to be the final
basket of regulation. Oklahoma Iowa State turned the ball over with 42.9 seconds
left, OU's Raymond missed a shot with 8 seconds and Jamaal Tinsley's runner in
the lane rolled off the rim.
</P>
<P>
	   "I want to see that layup. I just cannot believe that ball didn't go in by
Tinsley," Eustachy said.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma got two baskets from Victor Avila in the first overtime, the second
coming with 32 seconds left to give the Sooners a 63-62 lead. Nurse got fouled
on a drive to the basket with 4.8 remaining. He tied the score with his first
free throw, but missed the second and Heskett's potential game-winning 3-pointer
at the buzzer missed.
</P>
<P>
	   Heskett's first 3 of the second overtime gave Oklahoma a 66-65 lead. After
Tinsley scored on a short jumper to give the Cyclones the lead, Raymond got a
kind bounce on a 3-pointer and Najera converted a three-point play -- his first
basket of either OT -- to make it 72-67.
</P>
<P>
	   Heskett's final 3-pointer, on a pass from Najera, gave the Sooners a 75-69
lead. Najera added four straight free throws as Oklahoma widened the lead to
nine in the final 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymond scored 20, including six 3-pointers. Tinsley finished with 17.
</P>
<P>
	   The loss, the Cyclones' first since Nov. 28, prevented them from tying the
best start in school history.

<HEADLINE> Protesters March Through Montreal  </HEADLINE>
   By DANIEL SANGER
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MONTREAL (AP) -- About 1,000 protesters marched through Montreal on
Saturday, warning delegates to a meeting on the trade of genetically engineered
plants and animals that toying with nature is risky.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting, which begins Monday and runs through Friday, is to bring
together representatives from some 130 countries. Officials in Montreal have
expressed fears that it could be disrupted by the sort of violent protests that
accompanied World Trade Organization talks in Seattle last year.
</P>
<P>
	   But Saturday's demonstration was peaceful, and no arrests were reported.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Life before profits!'' the protesters chanted after completing their
hourlong march in subzero temperatures. They waved placards reading ``We will
not be guinea pigs'' before returning indoors to listen to speakers discuss the
dangers of biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference Friday, a protester threw a pie in the face of Joyce
Groote, the biotechnology industry's top lobbyist in Canada.
</P>
<P>
	   The negotiations are considered the final, make-or-break step in a process
begun in 1995 to draw up international standards to regulate the trade of
genetically modified food, pharmaceuticals and other products. Informal talks
began Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting is sponsored by the U.N. Environmental Program and is an
extension of failed talks 11 months ago in Cartagena, Colombia, on what is
called the Biosafety Protocol. The Cartagena meeting collapsed when the United
States, Canada, Australia, Uruguay, Argentina and Chile blocked a draft accepted
by 125 other countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. and other grain-exporting countries demanded that commodities such
as corn and soy beans be exempted from strict controls even though they account
for most of the global trade in genetically modified goods.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics of genetic engineering say gene-splicing has the potential for
environmental catastrophe. Proponents say such arguments ignore the promise and
benefits to humanity of scientific advancement.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the speakers who addressed the protesters Saturday warned that
modern-day biotechnology is different from the centuries-old art of selective
and cross breeding.
</P>
<P>
	   Doreen Stabinsky, a scientist from California State University at
Sacramento, said that taking a gene from a flounder, for instance, and using it
to keep strawberries from freezing at low temperatures ``means you're mixing and
matching, you're mixing molecules that haven't coexisted within that cell.''
</P>
<P>
	   Stabinsky and other speakers said that as genetically modified plants
crossbreed and evolve, the dangers range from disrupting natural processes to
causing extinctions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hubris, arrogance and scientific ignorance are all there,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Pataki threatens fines after rumored copycat strikes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki on Saturday warned unionized
Department of Transportation workers statewide that they would be fined if they
fail to show up for work because of rumored wildcat strikes.
<P>
	   Saturday's warning came after state officials were told by a union official
of a possible copycat action in Westchester and Putnam counties similar to
Thursday morning's unauthorized strike among snowplow operators on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've received information from the CSEA itself that DOT employees in
Westchester and Putnam were planning an illegal strike, and the forecast calls
for snow," said Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon.
</P>
<P>
	   A letter from union negotiator Ross Hanna to the governor's office alerted
the administration of "a possible problem ... regarding the possibility of
Department of Transportation employees not reporting for duty during an expected
snow storm over the weekend," according to a copy of the letter.
</P>
<P>
	   "CSEA has affirmatively attempted to stop any such activity, including by
speaking specifically to each residency that we thought might be involved," the
letter stated.
</P>
<P>
	   CSEA President Danny Donohue had said he knew of no plans to strike. He also
said his administration wouldn't condone such a job action.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor's action is a disgrace," Donohue said Saturday. "He is going
after state employees who have done nothing wrong because of the actions of
some."
</P>
<P>
	   McKeon countered that Donohue "either has no clue as to what's going on in
his own union or he's not telling the truth."
</P>
<P>
	   Donohue is facing a tough reelection battle to run the union whose members
have worked without a contract since April.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor needs to consider how seriously he is alienating the people
who work for him," Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki obtained a court Saturday that could result in fines up to $1,000 a
day and termination for workers who don't show up.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's 1967 Taylor Law, which allows public sector employees to bargain
collectively, prohibits strikes.
</P>
<P>
	   No job actions had been reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials said they will take every measure to keep roads cleared
around the state. That includes declaring a national emergency as the governor
did Thursday when he called in the National Guard. Road crews from upstate were
also dispatched.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is no excuse whatsoever for jeopardizing public safety," DOT
Spokesman Michael Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   The CSEA's 77,000 state workers have been without a contract for nine
months. In April, the rank and file rejected a negotiated contract offer calling
for an 11-percent raise over four years.
</P>
<P>
	   They argue that the state Legislature gave itself a 38 percent pay hike last
year, although it was their first increase in several years. Union leaders also
said they deserve a bigger raise because the state has an estimated $2 billion
surplus after the unions accepted lower wage packages in recent lean years.
</P>
<P>
	   "Workers in this country are fired up," Cornell University Professor Kate
Bronfen-Brenner said. "There's a sense there's an economic boom and they're not
benefiting."

<HEADLINE> North, South Tie 28-28 in Hula Bowl  </HEADLINE>
    By BEN DiPIETRO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WAILUKU, Hawaii (AP) -- Wisconsin linebacker Donnel Thompson blocked Jimmy
Kibble's 25-yard field-goal attempt as time expired Saturday and the North tied
the South 28-28 in the Hula Bowl all-star game.
</P>
<P>
	   Thompson's play against the Virginia Tech kicker salvaged a tie for the
North, which was in danger of losing after overcoming a 28-7 deficit.
</P>
<P>
	   The South had a first down at the North 5 on a 63-yard pass from West
Virginia quarterback Mark Bulger to Texas A&AMP;M's Chris Cole.
</P>
<P>
	   Bulger, who was 4-of-6 for 112 yards, gave the South a 28-7 lead with a
29-yard touchdown pass to Duke's Scotty Montgomery early in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The North rally started when Nebraska defensive end Aaron Wills recovered a
fumbled handoff between Bulger and Dylan Ching of San Diego on the South 15 and
returned it to the 3.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas Hamner of Minnesota took it in from the 1 two plays later to make it
28-14 with 49 seconds left in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Chapman of Marshall made it 28-21 on a 1-yard run with 9:17 to play,
ending a 32-yard drive after a short punt by Kibble. Bill Volek completed a
22-yard pass to Hamner to the 1 and Chapman scored on the next play.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamner's second TD, a 3-yard run with 3:15 to play, capped a 32-yard drive
aided by another short punt out of the end zone by Kibble.
</P>
<P>
	   The South grabbed a 7-0 lead the first time it had the ball, with Arizona
quarterback Keith Smith leading an 11-play, 77-yard drive capped by a 1-yard run
by Rice running back Chad Richardson.
</P>
<P>
	   The North tied it eight seconds into the second quarter when Heisman Trophy
winner Ron Dayne of Wisconsin went 9 yards off right tackle to complete a
41-yard drive. Dayne, playing briefly, gained 21 yards on six carries and caught
one pass for 10 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Husak of Stanford, selected the South MVP, moved his team 63 yards in
nine plays to the go-ahead TD, completing all four of his passes for 56 yards.
UCLA's Darrell Price finished the drive with a 1-yard sweep.
</P>
<P>
	   Curtis Keaton of James Madison finished the next South scoring drive with a
1-yard run 15 seconds before halftime. Husak, who was 10-of-15 for 125 yards in
the game, passed for 58 of the 77 yards in the drive.

Reno Listens To Grandmothers' Pleas
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers met with Janet Reno today
and tearfully explained to the Attorney General how much they wanted to bring
the boy back to his homeland. The INS has ordered the boy returned to Cuba. Reno
has agreed, saying the youngster belongs with his father in the communist island
where he was reared. The grandmothers sought the meeting with Reno and Doris
Meissner, the INS commissioner, U.S. officials said. While the matter goes
through the U.S. courts, lawmakers in Congress plan an attempt this week to
declare Elian a U.S. citizen. If such legislation becomes law, the boy no longer
would be an immigrant under INS jurisdiction.

Brazilians Work To Clean Oil Spill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Hundreds of volunteers and experts cleaned up
muck-covered beaches and tried to save endangered birds Saturday as the massive
oil spill polluting Rio's Guanabara Bay continued spreading. The work continued
four days after a pipeline sprung a leak and spewed 338,000 gallons of crude oil
into the bay, according to Petrobras, the government-owned oil company. Local
environmentalists say it is the worst ecological disaster to hit Rio de Janeiro
in a decade. The oil slick spread through the Guapimirim and Jequia mangrove
swamps, both protected areas and important spawning grounds for fish, birds and
crustaceans. State biologists said it would take decades for nature to undo the
damage.

Arkansas Crash Survivors Sue Airline

	   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Five more survivors of a deadly plane crash in
Little Rock, Ark., have sued American Airlines, claiming the company fostered an
atmosphere of carelessness. Eleven people died after the MD-82 with 145 people
on board skidded off an airport runway while landing in a thunderstorm June 1.
The plane broke into pieces and caught fire after crashing into a walkway near
the Arkansas River. The lawsuits filed Friday in Dallas and Little Rock join
more than a dozen others accusing the airline primarily of failing to adequately
train its crew to deal with severe weather.

Vice President Takes Power in Ecuador

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The political crisis in Ecuador has ceased for the
moment as the vice president took over the small country today. Vice President
Gustavo Noboa's sudden ascension came after Ecuador's military chief, buckling
to U.S. pressure, dissolved a three-man junta that had claimed power just a few
hours earlier. Noboa becomes the sixth president since 1996 in this troubled
nation, which has suffered years of political and economic turmoil.

Republican Hopefuls Hit Iowa
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Republican presidential hopefuls hit every corner
of Iowa to rally supper for Monday's caucuses squabbling over everything from
abortion to taxes. Abortion is a major issue for many caucus-goers, who tend to
be more conservative than voters as a whole. That may be why the topic came up
often at GOP campaign events. Few convention delegates are at stake, but the
real reward in Iowa and the Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary is momentum: Campaigns
can take flight or lose altitude in the first two contests of the presidential
year.

Syria Wants Israeli Pledge
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- Before peace talks resume, Israel should provide a
written pledge to withdraw from the Golan Heights to 1967 prewar borders, a
Syrian government-run newspaper said today. Syria and Israel resumed peace talks
last month for the first time in nearly four years. A third round of
negotiations was to have begun Wednesday in the United States, but it was
delayed. In Syria, newspapers are state-run and reflect government views. The
editorial was Damascus's first public indication that it may not return to the
talks without such a written pledge.

<HEADLINE> Grant Hill Suffers Tailbone Injury  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Grant Hill's hard fall on his tailbone looked -- and sounded
-- worse than it was.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill suffered a hip contusion when he fell as he jumped to intercept a
downcourt pass with about 20 seconds left in the first half of the Detroit
Pistons' game against the Chicago Bulls on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   He didn't play the rest of the game, but team spokesman J.J. Carter said
Hill is expected to play Sunday when the Pistons host the Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
	   "You hate to see that happen to any great player, and he is a great player,"
Bulls coach Tim Floyd said. "You just hope it's not a broken bone or, the way he
was holding his lower back, a vertebrae."
</P>
<P>
	   Hill collided in the air with Ron Artest as he tried to steal Toni Kukoc's
pass. He landed on his left foot before crashing to the floor, landing so hard
on his tailbone the smack was heard throughout the United Center.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill started grimacing as soon as he hit the floor, rolling over onto his
stomach.
</P>
<P>
	   "I bet that hurt," Kukoc said, wincing at the thought of the injury.
"Hopefully, he can recover as soon as possible."
</P>
<P>
	   Hill lay on the ground for about five minutes as trainers worked on him,
with worried teammates Christian Laettner and Lindsey Hunter standing by.
</P>
<P>
	   He finally rolled back over, rubbing his backside before being helped to his
feet. He walked gingerly off the court to the locker room, drawing a standing
ovation as he left.
</P>
<P>
	   He returned for second-half warmups, but returned to the locker room shortly
after for more treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Hill scored eight points on 3-of-10 shooting before leaving the game.

<HEADLINE> Sabbatini Leads Bob Hope Classic  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BERMUDA DUNES, Calif. (AP) -- Memories of major championship moments from a
year ago invaded the fourth round of the Bob Hope Classic on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Casey Martin got out of his cart, took off his shoes and waded into the
water on the final hole, needing a birdie to make the cut. He decided to take
his lumps, made double bogey and felt about as badly as Jean Van de Velde in the
British Open.
</P>
<P>
	   David Duval, stymied by a tree on the 16th hole, aimed sideways and punched
a 7-iron from 167 yards off a root that hooked sharply and stopped 25 feet below
the hole. The only thing he didn't do was sprint down the fairway and leap like
a pixie, as Sergio Garcia did in the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
	   At the end of the day, the Hope Classic was just like any other year. No
matter who's on top or by how much, the final round Sunday figures to be another
shootout in the desert.
</P>
<P>
	   The leader was Rory Sabbatini, a 23-year-old South African who hit a 5-iron
from 208 yards into 15 feet on No. 18 -- the same distance Payne Stewart had to
win the U.S. Open. He made the eagle for an 8-under 64 on pitch-and-putt Indian
Wells for a one-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Now the fun begins.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty-one players are within five shots of the lead. That includes Duval,
the defending champion who came from seven strokes back a year ago with a 59.
</P>
<P>
	   Even though Sabbatini has never won on the PGA Tour, he said his 23-under
264 was no fluke.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not like I'm sitting there wondering, 'I've had four good days -- when
am I going to have a bad day?' I'm ready to go out there and shoot even lower
tomorrow," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Matt Gogel, a six-time winner on the Nike Tour who finally made it to the
big leagues this year, had a 3-under 68 at Bermuda Dunes and was at 265. Another
stroke back was Mr. 59, who doesn't believe he has to match history to cash the
$540,000 first-place check.
</P>
<P>
	   "I can promise you, if I shoot 59 I'll win," Duval cracked.
</P>
<P>
	   He also knows that he'll have to start making some putts. Duval failed to
convert several birdie chances and wound up with a 68 at Bermuda Dunes. It could
have been worse except for an exceptional shot that stirred memories of the PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
	   He pulled his tee shot on No. 16 and had no back swing -- there was only
about 18 inches between his ball and a tree, and a root was under the ball.
Duval threw caution to what little wind there was and punched a 7-iron some 70
yards to the right of the green.
</P>
<P>
	   The ball hooked sharply to the left and stopped 25 feet from the hole.
</P>
<P>
	   "I looked to see if I had a chance to hit out of bounds, which I felt like I
had a pretty good chance of doing that," he said. "But I wasn't making any
putts. It was almost like I was in a position where I had to try to force
something."
</P>
<P>
	   He wound up with a par, a string of eight in a row before a birdie on the
18th.
</P>
<P>
	   Also tied with Duval at 266 were Rich Beem, Stephen Ames and Jesper
Parnevik. Frank Lickliter had the best score of the day and of his career -- a
10-under 62 at Indian Wells -- and was another stroke back.
</P>
<P>
	   The cut was 276, the lowest ever in a PGA Tour event.
</P>
<P>
	   One player who didn't make it was Martin, although his debut as the first
PGA Tour member in a cart ended on a memorable note.
</P>
<P>
	   Needing a birdie on his final hole at La Quinta to make the cut, Martin's
3-wood rolled to the edge of the water. He took off his socks and shoes -- even
the stocking that helps control the swelling in his right leg -- and stood in
the water.
</P>
<P>
	   Martin thought otherwise and made double bogey for a 69.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just blew it on that hole," Martin said. "I'm bummed. Four days of
grinding and playing well, and I get nothing for it. That sucks. That's life.
That's golf."
</P>
<P>
	   Sabbatini had no such concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   He has spent the past two weeks working with his coach and loves the results
he is getting. He missed only two greens on Saturday and finished off his round
in style. With water left and a bunker to the right, Sabbatini saw only the
flagstick.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's the frame of mind I have with my swing at the moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Now what he needs is an image of winning.
</P>
<P>
	   He had two chances last year in his rookie season, and one of them featured
a showdown with Duval in the Bellsouth Classic.
</P>
<P>
	   He was tied with Duval until a double bogey from the bunker and the woods on
the 17th hole, then bogeyed the last hole going for broke. Duval birdied two of
his last four holes for his fourth victory of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "Atlanta helped me last year," Sabbatini said. "It taught me a harsh lesson
coming down the stretch. I have much more confidence in my game, and it's
building in each round."
</P>
<P>
	   Chances are, he'll have to keep hitting it close and making the birdies to
have a chance at Bermuda Dunes on Sunday. And he may have more than just Duval
to worry about.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Arrested in Bishop Slaying  </HEADLINE>
   By ALFONSO ANZUETO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A third military suspect was arrested Saturday in the
1998 slaying of a Roman Catholic bishop whose office had issued a human rights
report critical of the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Army guard Jose Obdulio Villanueva was detained in the city of Quezada,
about 40 miles east of the capital, police spokesman Gerson Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
	   In February 1998, Obdulio had been sentenced to five years in prison for
shooting a milkman who had careened into a presidential parade two years
earlier. On April 7, 1998, an appeals court ruled that he could go free if he
paid the equivalent of 84 cents for each day he was to serve, or a total of
about $1,500.
</P>
<P>
	   Bishop Juan Gerardi was bludgeoned to death in his garage on April 26, 1998,
two days after presenting a report blaming the military and pro-government death
squads for most of the deaths during Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   On Friday, National Civil Police arrested Guatemalan army Capt. Byron Lima
Oliva and his father, retired Col. Disrael Lima Estrada, in connection with the
slaying and took them under heavy guard to a Guatemala City prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Police on Friday also re-arrested a church cook, Margarita Lopez, who had
been jailed by investigators for five days in July 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The arrests come one week after President Alfonso Portillo took office.
Portillo, a former Marxist scholar with ties to a right-wing former dictator,
had promised to resolve the Gerardi slaying.
</P>
<P>
	   The Human Rights Office of the Archbishop, formerly led by Gerardi, had
given him six months to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials in the human rights office have accused army officers of
involvement, saying that a car seen near the crime scene was linked to the
military.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators, however, initially insisted that Gerardi was killed by a
fellow priest, the Rev. Mario Orantes. The priest spent seven months in jail but
was released after church leaders and observers protested that investigators had
overlooked possible military involvement.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear whether authorities would seek to arrest Orantes again.

<HEADLINE> Haitians Reunite With Mother  </HEADLINE>
   By MILDRADE CHERFILS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A mother separated from her son and daughter after a boat
packed with 411 mostly Haitian passengers ran aground New Year's Day was
reunited with her children Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the glare of television cameras, Marc Yvens Dieubon, 9, and Germanie, 8,
embraced their mother, Yvena Rhinvil, while about 50 community leaders, elected
officials and supporters -- some carrying American flags -- looked on.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Carrie Meek, D-Florida, her son, state Sen. Kendrick Meek, D-Miami, and
activist Marleine Bastien traveled to Haiti Saturday to accompany the children
back to Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a unification of a family,'' Carrie Meek said. ``We have fought
hard, but we have not won the battle yet.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rhinvil, 33, who is pregnant, was one of four people brought ashore Jan. 1,
from the ship stuck off South Florida for medical treatment. Her children were
left on the boat, and were among the 407 people then returned to Haiti.
</P>
<P>
	   The shy sister and brother, who had been staying with an aunt in
Port-au-Prince, received yellow ducks stuffed toys as presents from community
members.
</P>
<P>
	   The siblings' separation from their mother became the catalyst for four
protests by Haitian-Americans who contrasted their plight with the immense
attention given Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy at the center of an
international custody dispute.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban government is demanding that Elian, who was rescued after a
smuggling accident off Florida killed his mother and nine others, be returned to
his father in Cuba. His grandmothers have traveled from Cuba to plea with U.S.
officials for the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   The two cases highlighted what critics say is a double standard between the
treatment of Cubans and others seeking refuge in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Based on the Cuban Readjustment Act of 1966, Cubans who reach U.S. shores
are usually allowed to stay. Haitians and others are usually repatriated, unless
they can prove a ``credible fear'' of persecution in their homeland.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service granted Rhinvil's children
humanitarian parole so they could join their mother while she pursues a claim
for political asylum.

<HEADLINE> State fines Long Hill kennel owner over $18,000 for violations  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LONG HILL, N.J. (AP) - The state will fine Rahway's city business
administrator over $18,000 for failing inspections at a kennel he owns in Long
Hill.
<P>
	   The Department of Health and Senior Services accuse kennel owner Peter
Pelissier of several violations at his kennel, including using the wrong
chemicals to euthanize animals, killing stray animals too soon, and for waiting
three days before calling a veterinarian for a dog with a broken leg.
</P>
<P>
	   Pelissier has 10 days to pay the $18,715 fine to the state for conditions in
the Garden State Kennels, which has been owned by Pelissier's family since the
1950s, officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The problems were continuous, and during each of the four inspections, new
violations were found," said Tom Breslin, a spokesman for the state agency, in
Saturday's editions of the Courier News of Bridgewater.
</P>
<P>
	   Pelissier did not return calls for comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The state alleges that in 1998, the kennel euthanized over 600 animals by
using a neuromuscular blocking agent. Such a substance, which causes death by
paralysis, is illegal to use on animals. For each death, the state has fine the
kennel $25, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also in 1998, the state is alleging that over 300 cats were killed by
injecting medicine directly into their hearts, rather than intravenously. For
each death, the state fined the kennel $10.
</P>
<P>
	   From Jan. 12 1998 through December 28, 1998, 15 stray animals were killed
before they had been kept at the shelter for a required seven days. The one-week
time period allows owners a chance to find their pets.
</P>
<P>
	   The state said they plan to conduct follow-up inspections, and if conditions
do not improve, may recommend the kennel's license be revoked, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Cogentrix Walks Out on India Project  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- U.S. electric power giant Cogentrix Energy Inc. has
pulled out of a $1.3 billion thermal power project in southern India, a news
report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The 1,000-megawatt power project, one of the largest foreign investments in
India, now will be managed solely by Hong Kong's China Light and Power
International, which had been a 50 percent partner in the joint venture formed
to execute the project, United News of India reported.
</P>
<P>
	   "CLP's share percentage will now rise to 100," Tom Watters, director for
business development at Cogentrix, was quoted as saying by the news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   The news agency said Watters announced the decision Saturday to Chief
Minister S.M. Krishna, the top elected official of Karnataka state, where the
project is located. Cogentrix, based in Charlotte, N.C., had been working for
seven years on the project.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials at CLP could not immediately be reached for comment. An official
at the Cogentrix office in New Delhi confirmed that Watters met Krishna
Saturday, but declined to give details. The official declined to be identified.
</P>
<P>
	   Cogentrix announced last month it was abandoning the power plant project
because of legal disputes and delays in getting government clearances. But it
promised to review the decision, and the government later cleared the way for
the Cogentrix project by guaranteeing payment for its electricity.
</P>
<P>
	   The project ran into trouble when environmentalists filed a lawsuit alleging
that noxious emissions from the power plant would destroy the biodiversity of
the coastal region and that effluents released into the Arabian Sea also would
cause harm.
</P>
<P>
	   India's Supreme Court last month cleared Cogentrix of any wrongdoing related
to another lawsuit's allegations of cost padding, kickbacks and bribery.

<HEADLINE> President Thanks Bush for Candor  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The future of legalized abortion depends on the outcome
of the 2000 presidential race, President Clinton told Democratic Party donors
Saturday. ``To pretend otherwise is naive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   And he said Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush, by
endorsing a constitutional amendment banning abortion, laid out clearly for
American voters the choice facing them in November.
</P>
<P>
	   The next president will likely name more than two justices to the Supreme
Court, Clinton said. That could tip the balance in favor of overturning the Roe
vs. Wade Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is absolutely no question in my mind (that) whether Roe vs. Wade is
preserved or scrapped depends on what happens in the presidential election, and
to pretend otherwise is naive,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, the Texas governor, recently said he thinks the legal reasoning behind
Roe vs. Wade is thin, and he favors overturning the decision. He has also said
he most admires two of the court's most conservative justices -- Antonin Scalia
and Clarence Thomas -- who likely would vote to overturn the ruling issued 27
years ago Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush returned to the subject Saturday, saying the next Republican election
platform should support a constitutional amendment banning abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokeswoman Mindy Tucker noted that Bush, at the same time, has said that
``America is not ready'' now for such an amendment, ``and in the meantime we
should all work to reduce the number of abortions in America.'' She pointed to
his support in Texas for legislation on parental notification, abstinence
education and a streamlined adoption process.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Democratic candidates, Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey
Sen. Bill Bradley, support abortion rights and favor retaining the Supreme Court
decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Its not whether you're compassionate or good or bad, it's what you
believe,'' Clinton said in direct reference to Bush's signature slogan of
``compassionate conservatism.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We all just ought to tell the American people what we believe, and let the
American people decide,'' Clinton continued. ``And I appreciate Gov. Bush being
candid enough to say he didn't believe in Roe vs. Wade.''
</P>
<P>
	   To that, Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer replied, ``Bill Clinton giving advice
on candor is a little like getting advice on good behavior from Bart Simpson,''
the TV cartoon bad boy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Beverly Hills crowd, which had earlier heard Democratic National
Committee chairman Edward Rendell call Bush's comments alarming, laughed
nervously when Clinton cast the argument in a gentler light.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No, no, this is good,'' Clinton said. ``People should say what they think,
and we shouldn't be hateful about it. We shouldn't be mean. ... We should make
sure we know where everybody else is coming from.''
</P>
<P>
	   The speech was the last stop on a two-day trip to Southern California that
mixed business and pleasure for Clinton and his White House staff. After
proposing almost $3 billion in new federal science and technology research,
Clinton golfed, hobnobbed with Hollywood stars and wealthy West Coast moguls and
raised an estimated $150,000 for Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Life imitated art Friday, when press secretary Joe Lockhart and a crew of
White House staff visited the set of the television show ``West Wing,'' a drama
about White House staff.
</P>
<P>
	   In his weekly radio address, taped in California, Clinton said Saturday he
wants to send a ``fraud fighter'' to the office of every Medicare contractor in
the country in a new campaign to root out cheating.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton asked Congress to approve the $43 million cost of the initiative as
part of the federal budget for fiscal 2001. He said it is needed to stop a raid
on the Treasury that persists despite what he called aggressive detection,
enforcement and prosecution efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Medicare fraud and waste are more than an abuse of the system; they're an
abuse of the taxpayer,'' Clinton said. ``By over-billing, charging for phony
procedures and selling substandard supplies, Medicare cheats cost taxpayers
hundreds of millions a year.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton initiative would establish a team of more than 100 financial
management specialists working in the offices of every Medicare contractor.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. J.C. Watts Jr., the House Republican Conference chairman, commended
Clinton for tackling Medicare fraud but said it was a GOP idea first.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He now so trusts the Republican mantra of fighting fraud that he's even
borrowed our theme of eliminating `waste, fraud and abuse' from the Washington
bureaucracy,'' Watts, R-Okla., said in a statement.

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Squabble Over Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Hitting every corner of this sprawling state,
Republicans squabbled over abortion and taxes in a fight for their conservative
base Saturday, as presidential candidates in both major parties braved nasty
weather to rally supporters to Iowa's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every vote matters!'' said GOP front-runner George W. Bush, who attempted
to burnish his anti-abortion credentials for a third consecutive day. The Texas
governor pledged to keep the abortion plank in a staunchly conservative GOP
platform.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday night, about 10 percent of the state's 1.8 million registered
voters are expected to gather in living rooms, schools, church basements and
fire stations to announce their support of candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Few convention delegates are at stake, but the real reward in Iowa and the
Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary is momentum: Campaigns can take flight or lose
altitude in the first two contests of the presidential year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to make a good showing maybe and surprise a lot of people,''
said former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, the sole rival to Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president holds a wide lead over Bradley in Iowa polls and has
broken out of a long-running tie in New Hampshire surveys. ``I'm not quitting,''
Bradley told supporters in Maquoketa. ``We're going forward. We have another
day.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president played an expectations game of his own design. ``What are
the expectations if Senator Bradley scored a victory? Expectations in the event
that occurred would be that he would do exactly what he said he would do and
take as his model for leadership style ... Ronald Reagan,'' the vice president
said at a Fort Dodge rally.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's irregular heartbeat, a minor condition that dominated his campaign
for the better part of two days, did not come up in a question-and-answer
session in Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was more of a problem.
</P>
<P>
	   A wintry mix of wind and snow made Bradley's motorcade ride through eastern
Iowa a perilous one. The plane carrying Steve Forbes, one of five Republican
candidates stumping the state, made two false approaches to the Mason City
runway and pulled up quickly each time as his pilot had trouble in the murky
weather.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane landed on the third attempt. Forbes emerged safe but shaken.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The weather couldn't stop us, and the political establishment is not going
to stop us,'' he said
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the day's more colorful events, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah gave a
foreign policy address in a barroom full of reporters and set the lowest of
expectations for a six-man field: ``I'm going to have to do better than sixth
here, it seems to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion is a major issue for many caucus-goers, who tend to be more
conservative than voters as a whole. That may be why the topic came up often at
GOP campaign events Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer, who needs a strong third place to bolster his sagging campaign,
suggested that Forbes is a recent convert to the anti-abortion movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not a Steve-come-lately that believed something three years ago and
believed something different today,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning his sights on the front-runner, the Washington activist said,
``Governor Bush is completely out of step with the party he wants to lead.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everytime you get into a discussion about this issue and someone tries to
pretend that this pro-abortion regime is compatible with our constitution, you
ask them this question,'' Alan Keyes, who is making a surprisingly strong bid in
Iowa, said in a separate appearance. ``How does it secure the blessings of
liberty to unborn children in the womb and in our future that we kill them in
that place of birth?''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, like most Republican voters, is opposed to abortion but he does not
stress it on the campaign trail. He is looking ahead to the general election,
when the issue tends to alienate swing voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Pressed by reporters, the Texan said he was in favor of a party platform
that recommends a constitutional amendment banning abortion. ``I think that the
Republican Party ought to keep its pro-life plank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes accused Bush of pandering. ``I think it's too little, too late. It's
almost typical for an establishment candidate to suddenly realize he has to say
something so he does something like this,'' Forbes said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's anti-abortion position does not extend to cases of rape, incest and
when the mother's life if in danger. Those exceptions are not in the plank, but
Bush said the details of the amendment could be worked out later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first step is to convince Americans that we ought to value life,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides say the governor has made his support of the plank clear in the past,
but questions arose after Bush ducked a question about the platform in a recent
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   A memo sent to hundreds of supporters by his campaign says: ``While Governor
Bush respects those with differing views, he believes the current Republican
Party platform plank on abortion is an important statement of pro-life ideals,
and he does not believe it should be changed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign picked a long-distance fight over taxes, suggesting that
Arizona Sen. John McCain's tax-cutting package would undermine charitable
giving. McCain is the only GOP candidate not competing in Iowa, choosing instead
to focus his campaign on New Hampshire. He is, however, on the Iowa ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is a provision that would close what McCain calls a ``loophole'' by
allowing people who give contributions in forms of stock, real estate, bonds or
art work to get tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is important to encourage an outpouring of giving in America,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain wants to use money from closing the loophole to cut taxes for
middle-class Americans, while Bush is worried about ``a few wealthy Americans
who can get a tax cut when they're done looking at an old painting,'' McCain
spokesman Howard Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a satellite address to conservatives in Washington, Bush said McCain
sounds like a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
	   on the anniversy of roe vs. wade, alan keyes also condemned the ruling.

<HEADLINE> Fear of Nerve Gas Halts Processing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- A scrap metal company has halted processing of empty nerve-gas
shells from an Army depot after a former depot employee warned they could
contain dangerous residue.
</P>
<P>
	   The 36-pound, 105mm steel shells once held sarin, a liquid nerve agent so
lethal droplets on the skin could cause permanent disability or death.
</P>
<P>
	   No trace of sarin has been found at the DuWald Steel Corp. processing plant,
and there have been no accidents or unusual illnesses in the 2 1/2 years the
plant has handled the shells, company Vice President Michael Yourtz said Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Deseret Chemical Depot in Tooele, Utah., said Saturday that
every bit of hazardous residue is burned off in a furnace before the empty
shells are shipped.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those projectiles all go through a heating process that destroys any
residual agent,'' said Jon Pettebone, a spokesman for the depot, which stores
ammunition for the Army. ``I'd put them in my front room. There is no residual
left in them whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, officials with Denver-based DuWald say they are taking no chances
with the materials.
</P>
<P>
	   The company halted processing Jan. 11 after Gary Harris, a former permit
coordinator at Tooele who quit in 1996, accused the depot of safety violations.
</P>
<P>
	   Harris claimed that the Army and its contractor hid defects in a depot
incinerator to win permits from Utah and Oregon, falsified trial burn reports,
and allowed scrap metal laced with nerve agent to be sent to a recycler, among
other things.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Many questionable practices that were not environmentally protective,
safe, or legal occurred at Tooele during my five years of employment there, and
many documents were submitted to Utah regulators by the Army and its contractors
that were dishonest,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tooele Chemical Agent Disposal Facility, located at the Deseret depot
but operated separately, drains the nerve agent from shells and burns it in an
incinerator, then places the empty shells in a furnace to burn off any residue.
</P>
<P>
	   After Harris's comments, spokesman Greg Mahall at the Army's chemical
weapons destruction command in Aberdeen, Md., said the Army was investigating
and ``is confident (Harris') allegations will be proven untrue.''
</P>
<P>
	   Harris was the fifth former employee to allege environmental and safety
problems with the incinerator.
</P>
<P>
	   The incinerator began operating in 1996 at the depot, 50 miles west of Salt
Lake City. It is the first of eight proposed nationwide to dispose of the
country's 31,000 tons of chemical warfare agents.

<HEADLINE> Early-morning fire kills two  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WATERTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - Two people died in a fire that destroyed a pair
of boarding houses Saturday as firefighters struggled to open frozen fire
hydrants.
<P>
	   Watertown Fire Department Battalion Chief Craig Powell said frozen fire
hydrants may have let the 6 a.m. fire spread from one house to the second as
firefighters looked for a water supply.
</P>
<P>
	   There may have been as much as a 30-minute delay, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   It was brought under control - with the help of a half-dozen other agencies
- about noon, Powell said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two victims were adults, but no other identification had been made late
Saturday. Powell said investigators did not expect to find any more victims, but
were having some problems determining exactly who was staying at the homes when
the fire began.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not supposed to be a rooming house, but there were quite a few people
were staying there," he said. "It's taking quite a long time to figure out who
was there and who wasn't."
</P>
<P>
	   There were about 10 people living in both buildings, he said. "I think
everybody else has been accounted for, but it's such a hodgepodge of people that
if someone who didn't really belong was staying the night, other people might
not know."
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators had not determined a cause late Saturday. Powell said
firefighters had not made their way through the houses because of safety
concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   "It will be a while before we get through all the layers," he said. "The
roof collapsed into the second floor, the floor collapsed into the first floor.
There's still no structure that they can enter."

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Squabble Over Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Hitting every corner of this sprawling state,
Republicans squabbled over abortion and taxes in a fight for their conservative
base Saturday, as presidential candidates in both major parties braved nasty
weather to rally supporters to Iowa's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every vote matters!'' said GOP front-runner George W. Bush, who attempted
to burnish his anti-abortion credentials for a third consecutive day. The Texas
governor pledged to keep the abortion plank in a staunchly conservative GOP
platform.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday night, about 10 percent of the state's 1.8 million registered
voters are expected to gather in living rooms, schools, church basements and
fire stations to announce their support of candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Few convention delegates are at stake, but the real reward in Iowa and the
Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary is momentum: Campaigns can take flight or lose
altitude in the first two contests of the presidential year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to make a good showing maybe and surprise a lot of people,''
said former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, the sole rival to Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president holds a wide lead over Bradley in Iowa polls and has
broken out of a long-running tie in New Hampshire surveys. ``I'm not quitting,''
Bradley told supporters in Maquoketa. ``We're going forward. We have another
day.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president played an expectations game of his own design. ``What are
the expectations if Senator Bradley scored a victory? Expectations in the event
that occurred would be that he would do exactly what he said he would do and
take as his model for leadership style ... Ronald Reagan,'' the vice president
said at a Fort Dodge rally.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's irregular heartbeat, a minor condition that dominated his campaign
for the better part of two days, did not come up in a question-and-answer
session in Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was more of a problem.
</P>
<P>
	   A wintry mix of wind and snow made Bradley's motorcade ride through eastern
Iowa a perilous one. The plane carrying Steve Forbes, one of five Republican
candidates stumping the state, made two false approaches to the Mason City
runway and pulled up quickly each time as his pilot had trouble in the murky
weather.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane landed on the third attempt. Forbes emerged safe but shaken.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The weather couldn't stop us, and the political establishment is not going
to stop us,'' he said
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the day's more colorful events, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah gave a
foreign policy address in a barroom full of reporters and set the lowest of
expectations for a six-man field: ``I'm going to have to do better than sixth
here, it seems to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion is a major issue for many caucus-goers, who tend to be more
conservative than voters as a whole. That may be why the topic came up often at
GOP campaign events Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer, who needs a strong third place to bolster his sagging campaign,
suggested that Forbes is a recent convert to the anti-abortion movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not a Steve-come-lately that believed something three years ago and
believed something different today,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning his sights on the front-runner, the Washington activist said,
``Governor Bush is completely out of step with the party he wants to lead.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everytime you get into a discussion about this issue and someone tries to
pretend that this pro-abortion regime is compatible with our constitution, you
ask them this question,'' Alan Keyes, who is making a surprisingly strong bid in
Iowa, said in a separate appearance. ``How does it secure the blessings of
liberty to unborn children in the womb and in our future that we kill them in
that place of birth?''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, like most Republican voters, is opposed to abortion but he does not
stress it on the campaign trail. He is looking ahead to the general election,
when the issue tends to alienate swing voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Pressed by reporters, the Texan said he was in favor of a party platform
that recommends a constitutional amendment banning abortion. ``I think that the
Republican Party ought to keep its pro-life plank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes accused Bush of pandering. ``I think it's too little, too late. It's
almost typical for an establishment candidate to suddenly realize he has to say
something so he does something like this,'' Forbes said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's anti-abortion position does not extend to cases of rape, incest and
when the mother's life if in danger. Those exceptions are not in the plank, but
Bush said the details of the amendment could be worked out later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first step is to convince Americans that we ought to value life,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides say the governor has made his support of the plank clear in the past,
but questions arose after Bush ducked a question about the platform in a recent
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   A memo sent to hundreds of supporters by his campaign says: ``While Governor
Bush respects those with differing views, he believes the current Republican
Party platform plank on abortion is an important statement of pro-life ideals,
and he does not believe it should be changed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign picked a long-distance fight over taxes, suggesting that
Arizona Sen. John McCain's tax-cutting package would undermine charitable
giving. McCain is the only GOP candidate not competing in Iowa, choosing instead
to focus his campaign on New Hampshire. He is, however, on the Iowa ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is a provision that would close what McCain calls a ``loophole'' by
allowing people who give contributions in forms of stock, real estate, bonds or
art work to get tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is important to encourage an outpouring of giving in America,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain wants to use money from closing the loophole to cut taxes for
middle-class Americans, while Bush is worried about ``a few wealthy Americans
who can get a tax cut when they're done looking at an old painting,'' McCain
spokesman Howard Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a satellite address to conservatives in Washington, Bush said McCain
sounds like a Democrat.

Cuban Grandmothers Cry for Elian
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Janet Reno said today that the grandmothers of Elian
Gonzalez made a very compassionate and heartfelt plea to bring the boy back to
Cuba, but the matter is now in federal court. The INS has ordered the boy
returned to Cuba. Reno has agreed, saying the youngster belongs with his father
in the communist island where he was reared. The grandmothers sought the meeting
with Reno and Doris Meissner, the INS commissioner. While the matter goes
through the courts, lawmakers in Congress plan an attempt this week to declare
Elian a U.S. citizen. If such legislation becomes law, the boy no longer would
be an immigrant under INS jurisdiction.

Scientists To Study Ozone Loss
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Scientists from Europe, the United States and
other countries have launched one of the largest projects ever aimed at studying
ozone loss in the Arctic atmosphere and developing ways to counteract it. The
project, which involves the use of aircraft, high-altitude balloons, satellites
and ground-based monitoring stations, was scheduled to run through March of
2001. Ozone depletion in the Arctic stratosphere has reached up to 50 percent at
some altitudes during the past decade, scientists have determined. The ozone
layer prevents most of the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation from reaching
earth.

Suspect Arrested in Bishop Slaying

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) -- A third military suspect was arrested today in the
1998 slaying of a Roman Catholic bishop whose office had issued a human rights
report critical of the military. Army guard Jose Obdulio Villanueva was detained
in the city of Quezada, about 40 miles east of the capital. Bishop Juan Gerardi
was bludgeoned to death in his garage on April 26, 1998, two days after
presenting a report blaming the military and pro-government death squads for
most of the deaths during Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996.

Ecuador Names New President

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The political crisis in Ecuador was temporarily put
on hold today after Vice President Gustavo Noboa took the helm as the small
country's leader. Noboa's sudden ascension came after Ecuador's military chief,
buckling to U.S. pressure, dissolved a three-man junta that had claimed power
just a few hours earlier. Noboa becomes the sixth president since 1996 in this
troubled nation, which has suffered years of political and economic turmoil.
Angry at ousted president Jamil Mahuad's inability to stop Ecuador's economic
slide, hundreds of Indian protesters stormed the empty Congress building Friday.

Brazilians Work To Clean Oil Spill

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Hundreds of volunteers and experts cleaned up
muck-covered beaches and tried to save endangered birds Saturday as the massive
oil spill polluting Rio's Guanabara Bay continued spreading. The work continued
four days after a pipeline sprung a leak and spewed 338,000 gallons of crude oil
into the bay, according to Petrobras, the government-owned oil company. Local
environmentalists say it is the worst ecological disaster to hit Rio de Janeiro
in a decade.

games, while it was the third straight loss for the Pistons. Though the Bulls

in the second quarter alone.

<HEADLINE> Woman Charged With Abandoning Baby  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) -- A 21-year-old woman was arrested Saturday on charges
that she endangered the welfare of her newborn baby, days after she told police
she found the child in a garbage bag on a freezing night.
</P>
<P>
	   Jenny Suarez, who initially said the child was not hers, now says she did
give birth to the child but still denies putting it outside, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Suarez turned herself into police and also faces charges of reckless
endangerment and filing false reports to police, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Suarez had told police that she found the hours-old baby when she took
her family's trash to the curb on Tuesday night. Ms. Suarez's mother then called
911.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It appears she had no idea when she called police that the baby was her
grandchild,'' Lehigh County District Attorney James Martin said during a news
conference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Suarez was taken to Lehigh County Prison in lieu of $25,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
	   The temperature had dropped to 18 degrees at the time Ms. Suarez said she
found the child. The baby, dubbed ``Baby Jane'' by nurses, was in stable
condition at Sacred Heart Hospital on Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Demand Boy's Return  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN RICE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PINAR DEL RIO, Cuba (AP) -- While Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers continued
their visit to the United States, an estimated 150,000 Cubans echoed their
demand for the boy's return at a rally Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Announcers at the event in this western provincial capital denounced ``the
mafia of Miami'' for ``kidnapping'' the 6-year-old boy, referring to him as
``the small captain of happiness'' and the ``elfin prince.''
</P>
<P>
	   Folk singers wearing T-shirts with Elian's portrait sang of what they
consider his plight in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a huge injustice that they are not letting this boy return to his
father's side,'' said Gerard Castillo, 9, who hears about Elian every day at
school.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities estimated 150,000 people attended the rally, held in a field
beside the local baseball stadium. The crowds extended through surrounding
streets, where long lines of buses and trucks had dropped off many of the
people.
</P>
<P>
	   While the government had encouraged people to attend, many at the rally
insisted they were happy to be there on their day off because they said they had
strong feelings about the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been in Miami since Nov. 25, when he was found clinging to an
inner tube off the coast of Florida. He was one of three survivors following a
boating accident that killed 11 people, including his mother and her boyfriend,
during an attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, the boy has been at the center of an international tug-of-war
between his father, who wants him returned to Cuba, and his paternal
great-uncle, who is fighting to keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's grandmothers traveled to the United States on Friday. They were in
Washington on Saturday to lobby Attorney General Janet Reno to let them take
Elian home.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday's rally was the latest of dozens of gatherings organized by the
island's communist government. Like most of the rallies, Saturday's gathering
appeared almost as social as political, with many participants chatting and
laughing with friends and coworkers.
</P>
<P>
	   Raul Hernandez said he had walked more than two miles to attend. ``There is
not a single legal or moral justification for the boy to remain there,'' said
the 57-year-old economist.
</P>
<P>
	   As announcers at the rally concluded their remarks, the crowd waved a sea of
small Cuban paper flags.
</P>
<P>
	   Announcers' shouts of ``Free Elian!'' were answered by traditional political
chants from the crowd, such as ``Long live our commander-in-chief'' -- a
reference to President Fidel Castro -- and ``Homeland or death! We will
overcome!''

<HEADLINE> Elian's Grandmothers Want Him Back  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY MARGASAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers told Attorney General Janet
Reno ``how much they are suffering'' over the 6-year-old's continued stay in the
United States and appealed for help Saturday in reuniting the youngster with his
father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers gave her a letter expressing the wish that Elian be
returned to ``the normality of life with his father, brother, family, friends at
schools, his toys, dog and parrot.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reno, who has supported Elian's return, said in a written statement the
grandmothers ``made a very compassionate and heartfelt plea'' but that the
matter now is in federal court. One source familiar with the meeting, speaking
only on condition of anonymity, said the grandmothers were in tears through much
of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   They returned to New York City later Saturday night, but made no further
public appearances. In Cuba, meanwhile, authorities estimated that 150,000
people rallied Saturday night to demand the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We maintain that the law recognizes the unique relationship between parent
and child and that family reunification has long been a cornerstone'' of U.S
immigration law as well as Immigration and Naturalization Service practice,
Reno's statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the boy's relatives in Florida have asked a federal judge to
prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariela Quintana, the boy's paternal grandmother, and maternal grandmother
Raquel Rodriguez did not speak to reporters after the 45-minute meeting at the
Justice Department. But their three-paragraph letter was released, and officials
of the U.S. and Cuban Council of Churches described their sentiments afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The two grandmothers expressed how much they are suffering because of this
separation from their family on behalf of Elian Gonzalez, the Very Rev. Oden
Marichal, head of the Cuban church group, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This has been a very good opportunity for them to express their deep
feeling as grandmothers to the (attorney general) asking the return of Elian to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We understand that grandchildren belong to every grandfather and
grandmother.''
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ordered the boy returned to Cuba. Reno has agreed, saying the
youngster belongs with his father in the communist island where he was reared.
The grandmothers sought the meeting with Reno and Doris Meissner, the INS
commissioner, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from National Council of Churches, which represent mainline
Protestant denominations, have been serving as the grandmothers' hosts during
their stay of undetermined length in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Bob Edgar, a former Democratic House member and general secretary
of the church organization, said the grandmothers ``shared with the attorney
general their pain in the loss of this grandchild. Both grandmothers articulated
as clearly as anyone could the hunger and passion that they have to return their
grandchild to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   Edgar said the grandmothers' only plans so far were to return Saturday to
New York City. No plans have been announced for the women to visit the boy, who
is with his Miami relatives, or to return home. But the grandmothers wrote in
their letter: ``We only have Sunday to see Elian, and we not only want to see
him, but we also want to return with him to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
	   The women must go to Miami to visit Elian, said Armando Gutierrez, spokesman
for the Florida relatives caring for the youngster.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The doors are open and the welcome mats are out. The family would love for
them to come here to Miami. In fact, they are surprised they went to New York
and Washington and have not come here,'' he said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers so far have chosen to avoid Miami, where Cuban immigrants
staged massive protests after the INS ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Edgar told reporters the meeting was intended ``to open the dialogue and the
conversation'' with Reno. ``The grandmothers had a wonderful opportunity to
speak to them and that's really all that I can say at this time.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said Reno ``showed enormous compassion for these two courageous women.
There was a long opportunity where they simply talked back and forth with each
other. It was a very personal meeting.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been in the middle of a custody fight between the U.S. relatives
in Miami's politically powerful Cuban community and the father and grandmothers
living in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The fight has escalated far beyond a family feud, becoming the latest
centerpiece of the decades-long battle between anti-Castro Cubans and Cuban
President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov.
25 after the boat taking him to the United States capsized, killing his mother,
her boyfriend and nine other people.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers' letter said Elian's stay in the United States ``adds to
the tragedy of the family over the loss'' of the boy's mother, Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
	   They expressed gratitude that the U.S. government had affirmed the paternity
rights of father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, but expressed frustration over the
prolonged custody fight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We ask that you return Elian to his immediate family and not to his
distant family where there had not been a previous relationship. This is the
reason for being here, and we thank you for this interview,'' the grandmothers
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   While the matter goes through the courts, lawmakers in Congress plan an
attempt this week to declare Elian a U.S. citizen. If such legislation becomes
law, the boy no longer would be an immigrant under INS jurisdiction.

<HEADLINE> Cubans demand boy's return while grandmothers visit United States  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   PINAR DEL RIO, Cuba (AP) - While Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers continued
their visit to the United States, an estimated 150,000 Cubans echoed their
demand for the boy's return at a rally Saturday night.
<P>
	   Announcers at the event in this western provincial capital denounced "the
mafia of Miami" for "kidnapping" the 6-year-old boy, referring to him as "the
small captain of happiness" and the "elfin prince."
</P>
<P>
	   Folk singers wearing T-shirts with Elian's portrait sang of what they
consider his plight in Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a huge injustice that they are not letting this boy return to his
father's side," said Gerard Castillo, 9, who hears about Elian every day at
school.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities estimated 150,000 people attended the rally, held in a field
beside the local baseball stadium. The crowds extended through surrounding
streets, where long lines of buses and trucks had dropped off many of the
people.
</P>
<P>
	   While the government had encouraged people to attend, many at the rally
insisted they were happy to be there on their day off because they said they had
strong feelings about the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been in Miami since Nov. 25, when he was found clinging to an
inner tube off the coast of Florida. He was one of three survivors following a
boating accident that killed 11 people, including his mother and her boyfriend,
during an attempt to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, the boy has been at the center of an international tug-of-war
between his father, who wants him returned to Cuba, and his paternal
great-uncle, who is fighting to keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's grandmothers traveled to the United States on Friday. They were in
Washington on Saturday to lobby Attorney General Janet Reno to let them take
Elian home.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday's rally was the latest of dozens of gatherings organized by the
island's communist government. Like most of the rallies, Saturday's gathering
appeared almost as social as political, with many participants chatting and
laughing with friends and coworkers.
</P>
<P>
	   Raul Hernandez said he had walked more than two miles to attend. "There is
not a single legal or moral justification for the boy to remain there," said the
57-year-old economist.
</P>
<P>
	   As announcers at the rally concluded their remarks, the crowd waved a sea of
small Cuban paper flags.
</P>
<P>
	   Announcers' shouts of "Free Elian!" were answered by traditional political
chants from the crowd, such as "Long live our commander-in-chief" - a reference
to President Fidel Castro - and "Homeland or death! We will overcome!"

<HEADLINE> Elian's grandmothers have tearful meeting with attorney general  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers told Attorney General
Janet Reno "how much they are suffering" over the 6-year-old's continued stay in
the United States and appealed for help Saturday in reuniting the youngster with
his father in Cuba.
<P>
	   The grandmothers gave her a letter expressing the wish that Elian be
returned to "the normality of life with his father, brother, family, friends at
schools, his toys, dog and parrot."
</P>
<P>
	   Reno, who has supported Elian's return, said in a written statement the
grandmothers "made a very compassionate and heartfelt plea" but that the matter
now is in federal court. One source familiar with the meeting, speaking only on
condition of anonymity, said the grandmothers were in tears through much of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   They returned to New York City later Saturday night, but made no further
public appearances. In Cuba, meanwhile, authorities estimated that 150,000
people rallied Saturday night to demand the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   "We maintain that the law recognizes the unique relationship between parent
and child and that family reunification has long been a cornerstone" of U.S
immigration law as well as Immigration and Naturalization Service practice,
Reno's statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the boy's relatives in Florida have asked a federal judge to
prevent his return before he has an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Mariela Quintana, the boy's paternal grandmother, and maternal grandmother
Raquel Rodriguez did not speak to reporters after the 45-minute meeting at the
Justice Department. But their three-paragraph letter was released, and officials
of the U.S. and Cuban Council of Churches described their sentiments afterward.
</P>
<P>
	   "The two grandmothers expressed how much they are suffering because of this
separation from their family on behalf of Elian Gonzalez, the Very Rev. Oden
Marichal, head of the Cuban church group, told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   "This has been a very good opportunity for them to express their deep
feeling as grandmothers to the (attorney general) asking the return of Elian to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   "We understand that grandchildren belong to every grandfather and
grandmother."
</P>
<P>
	   The INS has ordered the boy returned to Cuba. Reno has agreed, saying the
youngster belongs with his father in the communist island where he was reared.
The grandmothers sought the meeting with Reno and Doris Meissner, the INS
commissioner, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials from National Council of Churches, which represent mainline
Protestant denominations, have been serving as the grandmothers' hosts during
their stay of undetermined length in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Bob Edgar, a former Democratic House member and general secretary
of the church organization, said the grandmothers "shared with the attorney
general their pain in the loss of this grandchild. Both grandmothers articulated
as clearly as anyone could the hunger and passion that they have to return their
grandchild to Cuba."
</P>
<P>
	   Edgar said the grandmothers' only plans so far were to return Saturday to
New York City. No plans have been announced for the women to visit the boy, who
is with his Miami relatives, or to return home. But the grandmothers wrote in
their letter: "We only have Sunday to see Elian, and we not only want to see
him, but we also want to return with him to Cuba."
</P>
<P>
	   The women must go to Miami to visit Elian, said Armando Gutierrez, spokesman
for the Florida relatives caring for the youngster.
</P>
<P>
	   "The doors are open and the welcome mats are out. The family would love for
them to come here to Miami. In fact, they are surprised they went to New York
and Washington and have not come here," he said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers so far have chosen to avoid Miami, where Cuban immigrants
staged massive protests after the INS ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Edgar told reporters the meeting was intended "to open the dialogue and the
conversation" with Reno. "The grandmothers had a wonderful opportunity to speak
to them and that's really all that I can say at this time."
</P>
<P>
	   He said Reno "showed enormous compassion for these two courageous women.
There was a long opportunity where they simply talked back and forth with each
other. It was a very personal meeting."
</P>
<P>
	   Elian has been in the middle of a custody fight between the U.S. relatives
in Miami's politically powerful Cuban community and the father and grandmothers
living in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The fight has escalated far beyond a family feud, becoming the latest
centerpiece of the decades-long battle between anti-Castro Cubans and Cuban
President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found clinging to an inner tube off the coast of Florida on Nov.
25 after the boat taking him to the United States capsized, killing his mother,
her boyfriend and nine other people.
</P>
<P>
	   The grandmothers' letter said Elian's stay in the United States "adds to the
tragedy of the family over the loss" of the boy's mother, Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
	   They expressed gratitude that the U.S. government had affirmed the paternity
rights of father Juan Miguel Gonzalez, but expressed frustration over the
prolonged custody fight.
</P>
<P>
	   "We ask that you return Elian to his immediate family and not to his distant
family where there had not been a previous relationship. This is the reason for
being here, and we thank you for this interview," the grandmothers wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   While the matter goes through the courts, lawmakers in Congress plan an
attempt this week to declare Elian a U.S. citizen. If such legislation becomes
law, the boy no longer would be an immigrant under INS jurisdiction.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Following the ouster of Ecuadorean President Jamil Mahuad,
the State Department called Saturday night on all parties to work together to
address the country's severe economic and social challenges.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman James Foley said these problems played a central role in bringing
about the crisis, one which, he said, Ecuador will continue to face.

<P>
	   Foley's statement was issued hours after Mahuad was forced out by by Indian
protestors and junior military officers.

	   He expressed regret at the circumstances that led Mahuad to call for public
support for the presidency of Gustavo Noboa, who had served as vice president.

<HEADLINE> Gore Leads in Iowa, N.H. Polls  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore has a strong lead over Bill Bradley in Iowa polls
just days before the state's presidential caucuses, while several New Hampshire
polls indicate Gore has an edge over Bradley in a very close Democratic contest.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent polls in Iowa have given Gore more than a 20-point edge and a new
survey in Iowa gave him an even larger lead, 63 percent-to-26 percent, over the
former New Jersey senator.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Republicans, Texas Gov. George W. Bush has been about 20 points or
more ahead of Steve Forbes in recent Iowa polls. And he was ahead 54 percent to
18 percent in the Heartland Poll by the University of Iowa Social Science
Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   In the New Hampshire Republican race, Bush and McCain remain very close:
They are tied in a Los Angeles Times poll, while McCain has an edge in a
tracking poll by the American Research Group and Bush has an edge in a Newsweek
poll.
</P>
<P>
	   The Iowa caucuses are Monday and the New Hampshire primary is Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   Likely Democratic voters in the Heartland Poll in Iowa saw Gore as stronger
than Bradley on international affairs, the economy and even health care,
Bradley's centerpiece issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Confidence in Gore on international matters has grown steadily since
November, while confidence in Bradley on this issue has dropped, according to
the Heartland Poll, which did not have a November-to-January comparison on
health care.
</P>
<P>
	   Arthur Miller, director of the Heartland Poll, said previously undecided
voters now were picking Gore by a 2-1 margin. And Gore's advantage over Bradley
on handling the economy has more than doubled from a 15-point difference in late
summer to more than a 35-point difference now.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The thing that really struck me the most is how much shifting around is
going on in the closing of the race,'' Miller said, noting the latest Heartland
Poll reinterviewed people questioned in the December poll.
</P>
<P>
	   While the front-runners seem to be holding big leads in Iowa, he said, the
movement still could offer some surprises in the margins and final order of the
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   The Heartland Poll of 660 likely voters in the Iowa caucus had an overall
error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points, larger for subgroups like
Democrats and Republicans. The Times poll of 427 likely New Hampshire voters in
the Democratic primary and 516 likely voters in the Republican primary had an
error margin of plus or minus 4 percentage points for likely Republican voters
and 5 percentage points for likely Democratic voters. Both polls were taken Jan.
16 through Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Democrats, the latest polls indicate Gore may have slowed Bradley's
momentum in New Hampshire, where Gore has an edge in four recent polls and is
tied with Bradley in a fifth.
</P>
<P>
	   In New Hampshire, Gore had a slight lead in four new polls, CNN-Time,
Newsweek, a tracking poll by the American Research Group and one by The Los
Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
	   A Mason-Dixon poll published Saturday in the Concord Monitor has the race
between the two Democrats too close to call.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Newsweek poll, more than half of those polled said Gore is ``likely
to get things done as president,'' while a third said that about Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore built a slight in the Los Angeles Times poll by getting strong support
from women and cutting down Bradley's previous advantage among men. And Gore
split the support of the independent, or undeclared, voters with Bradley, whose
earlier strength was built largely on support from that group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Bradley had been doing extremely well among undeclared voters,'' said
Susan Pinkus, director of the Times poll. ``They play a role that could change
the election. They're like the wild card in New Hampshire.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Arrested in Trevi Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A woman implicated along with Mexican pop star Gloria
Trevi and her manager in a sex scandal involving a teen-age girl arrived in
Mexico on Saturday after being deported from Brazil. She was immediately turned
over to authorities in the northern border state of Chihuahua.
</P>
<P>
	   Katia de la Cuesta Soria -- along with her two sisters and their two babies
-- arrived at Mexico City's airport Saturday morning, nine days after Brazilian
authorities ordered them deported, the Mexican state attorney general's office
said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
	   The three were found living with Trevi, her manager, Sergio Andrade, and
another entertainer, Maria Raquenel Portillo, in Rio de Janeiro. Trevi, Andrade
and Portillo were arrested on Jan. 13 under an extradition request presented by
the Mexican Embassy in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
	   Chihuahua state prosecutors accuse them of corrupting Karina Yapor, 17,
whose parents had turned her over to Andrade's care at the age of 12 for musical
training -- allegedly at Trevi's behest. Yapor abandoned a baby in Spain in
1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Trevi, Andrade and Portillo have denied the charges. They are being held
while Brazil studies an extradition request, which could take months.
</P>
<P>
	   De la Cuesta faces the same charges of abduction and statutory rape in the
case, the attorney general's office said.

<HEADLINE> Explosion wrecks Flemington building, injures two  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   FLEMINGTON, N.J. (AP) - An explosion leveled a former antiques store
Saturday afternoon, injuring a patrolman and the town's fire chief, officials
said.
<P>
	   Flemington Fire Chief Charlie Smith, 50, was in stable condition at Lehigh
Valley Hospital, according Dr. Austen Kutscher, the town's mayor. Patrolman
George Becker, 35, suffered third degree burns to his face and hands and was in
critical condition at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston.
</P>
<P>
	   A firefighter who was also in the building at the time of the explosion was
not injured, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The explosion happened about 3 p.m. at a Church Street building that
formerly housed an antiques store, the Antiques Emporium.
</P>
<P>
	   Christine Robertson, who lives four doors down from the blast site, said she
was napping on the couch when the explosion woke her.
</P>
<P>
	   "We all got out of our houses to walk outside to see what happened, and you
could smell the gas," she said. "The chimney blew away, and all the windows on
the first floor had blown out. I pass that place everyday. It was a mess."
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbors said the antiques store was vacated last fall, and workers had
been seen recently renovating the building.
</P>
<P>
	   Elizabethtown Gas Company spokesman Chris Reardon said the fire officials
and patrolman had entered the building before the explosion, and before
officials from the gas company had arrived. The three were investigating a
possible gas leak, according to Kutscher.

<HEADLINE> GOP Candidates Squabble Over Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Hitting every corner of this sprawling state,
Republicans squabbled over abortion and taxes in a fight for their conservative
base Saturday, as presidential candidates in both major parties braved nasty
weather to rally supporters to Iowa's caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every vote matters!'' said GOP front-runner George W. Bush, who attempted
to burnish his anti-abortion credentials for a third consecutive day. The Texas
governor pledged to keep the abortion plank in a staunchly conservative GOP
platform.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday night, about 10 percent of the state's 1.8 million registered
voters are expected to gather in living rooms, schools, church basements and
fire stations to announce their support of candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Few convention delegates are at stake, but the real reward in Iowa and the
Feb. 1 New Hampshire primary is momentum: Campaigns can take flight or lose
altitude in the first two contests of the presidential year.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're going to make a good showing maybe and surprise a lot of people,''
said former New Jersey senator Bill Bradley, the sole rival to Democrat Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president holds a wide lead over Bradley in Iowa polls and has
broken out of a long-running tie in New Hampshire surveys. ``I'm not quitting,''
Bradley told supporters in Maquoketa. ``We're going forward. We have another
day.''
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president played an expectations game of his own design. ``What are
the expectations if Senator Bradley scored a victory? Expectations in the event
that occurred would be that he would do exactly what he said he would do and
take as his model for leadership style ... Ronald Reagan,'' the vice president
said at a Fort Dodge rally.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's irregular heartbeat, a minor condition that dominated his campaign
for the better part of two days, did not come up in a question-and-answer
session in Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The weather was more of a problem.
</P>
<P>
	   A wintry mix of wind and snow made Bradley's motorcade ride through eastern
Iowa a perilous one. The plane carrying Steve Forbes, one of five Republican
candidates stumping the state, made two false approaches to the Mason City
runway and pulled up quickly each time as his pilot had trouble in the murky
weather.
</P>
<P>
	   The plane landed on the third attempt. Forbes emerged safe but shaken.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The weather couldn't stop us, and the political establishment is not going
to stop us,'' he said
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the day's more colorful events, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah gave a
foreign policy address in a barroom full of reporters and set the lowest of
expectations for a six-man field: ``I'm going to have to do better than sixth
here, it seems to me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion is a major issue for many caucus-goers, who tend to be more
conservative than voters as a whole. That may be why the topic came up often at
GOP campaign events Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer, who needs a strong third place to bolster his sagging campaign,
suggested that Forbes is a recent convert to the anti-abortion movement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not a Steve-come-lately that believed something three years ago and
believed something different today,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning his sights on the front-runner, the Washington activist said,
``Governor Bush is completely out of step with the party he wants to lead.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Everytime you get into a discussion about this issue and someone tries to
pretend that this pro-abortion regime is compatible with our constitution, you
ask them this question,'' Alan Keyes, who is making a surprisingly strong bid in
Iowa, said in a separate appearance. ``How does it secure the blessings of
liberty to unborn children in the womb and in our future that we kill them in
that place of birth?''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, like most Republican voters, is opposed to abortion but he does not
stress it on the campaign trail. He is looking ahead to the general election,
when the issue tends to alienate swing voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Pressed by reporters, the Texan said he was in favor of a party platform
that recommends a constitutional amendment banning abortion. ``I think that the
Republican Party ought to keep its pro-life plank,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes accused Bush of pandering. ``I think it's too little, too late. It's
almost typical for an establishment candidate to suddenly realize he has to say
something so he does something like this,'' Forbes said in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's anti-abortion position does not extend to cases of rape, incest and
when the mother's life if in danger. Those exceptions are not in the plank, but
Bush said the details of the amendment could be worked out later.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The first step is to convince Americans that we ought to value life,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   Aides say the governor has made his support of the plank clear in the past,
but questions arose after Bush ducked a question about the platform in a recent
debate.
</P>
<P>
	   A memo sent to hundreds of supporters by his campaign says: ``While Governor
Bush respects those with differing views, he believes the current Republican
Party platform plank on abortion is an important statement of pro-life ideals,
and he does not believe it should be changed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign picked a long-distance fight over taxes, suggesting that
Arizona Sen. John McCain's tax-cutting package would undermine charitable
giving. McCain is the only GOP candidate not competing in Iowa, choosing instead
to focus his campaign on New Hampshire. He is, however, on the Iowa ballot.
</P>
<P>
	   At issue is a provision that would close what McCain calls a ``loophole''
that allows people who give contributions in forms of stock, real estate, bonds
or art work to get tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think it is important to encourage an outpouring of giving in America,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain wants to use money from closing the loophole to cut taxes for
middle-class Americans, while Bush is worried about ``a few wealthy Americans
who can get a tax cut when they're done looking at an old painting,'' McCain
spokesman Howard Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a satellite address to the 27th annual Conservative Political Action
Conference in Washington, Bush said McCain sounds like a Democrat. A straw poll
conducted by the group gave Bush 42 percent, Keyes 23 percent, Forbes 14
percent, McCain 11 percent, Bauer 3 percent and Hatch 1 percent.

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- The political crisis in Ecuador was temporarily put
on hold today after Vice President Gustavo Noboa took the helm as the small
country's leader. Noboa's sudden ascension came after Ecuador's military chief,
buckling to U.S. pressure, dissolved a three-man junta that had claimed power
just a few hours earlier. Noboa becomes the sixth president since 1996 in this
troubled nation, which has suffered years of political and economic turmoil.
Angry at ousted president Jamil Mahuad's inability to stop Ecuador's economic
slide, hundreds of Indian protesters stormed the empty Congress building Friday.

faced quite a choice in November. Bush, the Texas governor, recently said he
thinks the legal reasoning behind Roe vs. Wade is thin, and he favors
overturning the decision. Spokeswoman Mindy Tucker noted that Bush, at the same

who can get a tax cut when they're done looking at an old painting,'' McCain
spokesman Howard Opinsky said.

	   In a satellite address to the 27th annual Conservative Political Action
Conference in Washington, Bush said McCain sounds like a Democrat. A straw poll
conducted by the group gave Bush 42 percent, Keyes 23 percent, Forbes 14
percent, McCain 11 percent, Bauer 3 percent and Hatch 1 percent.

Cuba Rallies Again For Elian
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   PINAR DEL RIO, Cuba (AP) -- While Elian Gonzalez's grandmothers met with
Attorney General Janet Reno in the United States, thousands in Cuba rallied yet
again for the return of the young boy. Authorities estimated 150,000 people
attended the rally, held in a field beside the local baseball stadium. The
crowds extended through surrounding streets, where long lines of buses and
trucks had dropped off many of the people. While the government had encouraged
people to attend, many at the rally insisted they were happy to be there on
their day off because they said they had strong feelings about the case.

Gore Leads in Iowa, N.H. Polls
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   Polls in Iowa and New Hampshire show that Vice President Al Gore leads Bill
Bradley in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. Recent polls in
Iowa have given Gore more than a 20-point edge and a new survey in Iowa gave him
an even larger lead, 63 percent-to-26 percent, over Bill Bradley. Likely
Democratic voters in the Heartland Poll in Iowa saw Gore as stronger than
Bradley on international affairs, the economy and even health care, Bradley's
centerpiece issue. For the Republicans, Texas Gov. George W. Bush has been about
20 points or more ahead of Steve Forbes in recent Iowa polls.

Ecuador Names New President
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador's vice president
assumed the presidency of this small Andean nation Saturday -- ending, at least
for now, a political crisis that exploded when Indian protesters aided by a
cadre of junior military officers seized power and ousted a highly unpopular
president. Vice President Gustavo Noboa's sudden ascension came after Ecuador's
military chief, buckling to U.S. pressure, dissolved a three-man junta that had
claimed power just a few hours earlier. Noboa becomes the sixth president since
1996 in this troubled nation, which has suffered years of political and economic
turmoil.

Chileans Demand Trial of Pinochet
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Several hundred people marched through downtown
Santiago on Saturday to oppose the release of Gen. Augusto Pinochet from
detention in Britain and demand that he be tried for human rights abuses. The
peaceful demonstration was called by human rights groups and relatives of
victims of repression under Pinochet's 1973-90 dictatorship. Pinochet was
arrested in London 15 month ago on a warrant by judge Baltasar Garzon. The
demonstration came as the British government sought more information from the
parties in the case before deciding whether to free the 84-year-old former
dictator for health reasons or send him to Spain.

New Ozone Depletion Study Launched
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Scientists from all over the world have launched
one of the largest projects ever aimed at studying ozone loss in the Arctic
atmosphere and developing ways to counteract it. Scientists have determined
ozone depletion in the Arctic stratosphere has reached up to 50 percent at some
altitudes during the past decade and is worst in the northern hemisphere in
winter. The project, which involves the use of aircraft, high-altitude balloons,
satellites and ground-based monitoring stations, was scheduled to run through
March of 2001.

Judge Bars DVD Copier From Websites

<P>
	   SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- A judge has ordered Web site operators to stop
disseminating a program that makes it easy to copy DVD movies and audio discs, a
victory for the digital video and film industries. The software, called DeCSS,
allows users to unlock the security code on DVDs and copy movies to personal
computers. A DVD trade group sued the Web site operators, alleging theft of
trade secrets. Internet activists said the decision abridged the Web site
operators' free speech rights, but the judge disagreed.
