<HEADLINE> Egypt: Diplomacy Makes Progress In Iraq-UN Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa Saturday expressed his conviction that diplomatic efforts
have made "some progress" towards reaching a peaceful solution to
the Iraq-U.N. crisis over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Moussa left here Saturday for Rabat on a one-day visit to
Morocco during which he will deliver a message from President
Hosni Mubarak to King Hassan II of Morocco on dispelling the
mounting tensions in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
In a pre-departure statement, Moussa told reporters that the
message deals with present conditions in the region, the current
Iraq-U.N. standoff and the latest developments of the stalled
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
He said that a flurry of contacts have been conducted by Egypt,
the Arab League, the U.S., Iraq, France and Russia in a bid to
find a way out of the current Iraq-U.N. crisis.
</P>
<P>
"All these endeavors are mainly aimed at reaching a diplomatic
solution to be agreed upon by both Baghdad and the U.N. and help
resume cooperation between the two sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our main goal now is to support the ongoing diplomatic good
offices in order to stave off the military option," Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic efforts, Moussa went on to say, being exerted by
Egypt and the world community are not only conducted with Iraq but
also with the U.N. and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
"I believe the diplomatic endeavors have yielded some
progress," he added.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened military strikes unless Iraq
grants free access to all its presidential palaces to U.N. weapons
inspectors charged with destroying Iraq's chemical and biological
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Egyptian diplomat criticized the
"double-standard policy" adopted by the U.S. regarding
implementation of the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that a general feeling prevails the Middle East
and even Europe on (U.S.) discrimination in dealings (with the
different countries in the region)," said Moussa, urging all
parties including Israel to respect the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Following his visit to Morocco, Moussa will fly to Paris for a
visit for consultations with his French counterpart Hubert Vedrine
on the Iraqi issue.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief: Iraq Shows Flexibility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Chief Esmat Abdel
Meguid has said that Iraq has showed "flexibility" in its standoff
with the United Nations Special Commission's (UNSCOM) arms
inspection team.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of State for Information Affairs Samir
Mutawi Saturday quoted the visiting AL chief as saying that "new
proposals" were under discussion in Baghdad but it was still early
to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general of the 22-member pan-Arab organization
made these remarks during his meetings with Jordanian Prime
Minister Abdul Salam Majali, Minister of Foreign Affairs Fayez
Tarawneh and other senior officials, after he arrived in Amman
from Baghdad on Friday, Mutawi added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, said Mutawi, Meguid also emphasized to Jordanian
officials the importance of respecting Iraq's sovereignty and
dignity while settling the standoff in a peaceful way.
</P>
<P>
Meguid also cautioned that the situation in Baghdad was still
very "dangerous" despite the fact that international efforts were
going on, according to Mutawi.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a war was still "very high," the minister
quoted Meguid as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meguid left for Cairo, the headquarters of the AL organization,
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meguid paid his visit to Baghdad right after special envoys of
Russian and French presidents as well as the Palestinians arrived
there in an attempt to broker a diplomatic solution for the
standoff between Iraq and UNSCOM, which was triggered off after
Iraq blocked U.N. arms inspectors from entering presidential
palaces.
</P>
<P>
Russian President's Middle East Special Envoy Viktor
Posuvalyuk now still in Baghdad to make more efforts for a
diplomatic solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has softened its stand by promising to open 45 suspected
presidential palaces conditionally. But the United States and
Britain still consider the use of force against Iraq in case that
diplomatic efforts fail to make Iraq open all the suspected sites
without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
Only when the UNSCOM certifies that all the mass-destruction
arms are destroyed in Iraq, can the U.N. lift the sanctions
imposed on this country since its invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Santer: EU Seeking Peaceful Solution to Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- President of the European Union
(EU) Commission Jacques Santer said Saturday the EU is keen on
finding a peaceful solution to the Iraqi-U.N. standoff, the Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Santer made the remarks after his talks here with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak on the situation in Iraq and the EU stance
on this issue.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that a military strike against Iraq would
negatively affect the whole peace process, stability and
atmosphere of investment in the region," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He called on all parties to reach a peaceful settlement of the
Iraqi-U.N. standoff as that would "serve Iraq, the whole region
and the entire world."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Santer underlined the necessity of Iraq's
compliance with the U.N. resolutions including those relevant to
weapons inspection missions.
</P>
<P>
"The EU urges Iraq to fully implement the U.N. Security Council
resolutions and give access to inspection teams to sites to
fulfill their missions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have threatened military strikes
unless iraq grants full access to all its presidential palaces to
U.N. inspectors charged with dismantling its chemical and
biological arms.
</P>
<P>
Santer's two-day visit here is part of his first tour in the
Middle East since taking office. He will also visit Israel,
Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Palestinian self-rule area.
</P>
<P>
Santer, who arrived here Friday, met earlier in the day with
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal al-Ganzouri and key representatives
of the Egyptian private sector to discuss Egyptian-European
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a move to seek European role in solving mounting tensions in
the Gulf, Moussa will visit France this week for talks with his
French counterpart Hubert Vedrine.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Students Threaten Class Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Students
Association Saturday called for a national class boycott by all
polytechnic, technical, agricultural colleges and universities
students to press their demands for an increase in student loan
and grant payouts.
</P>
<P>
After an executive council meeting attended by all 22 members
representing the different colleges in Harare, president of the
association Learnmore Jongwe declined to disclose the date of the
class boycott for strategic reasons.
</P>
<P>
"The class boycott will be held soon but I cannot disclose
when exactly. The consequences of such a boycott are apparent in
view of the current prevailing tense harsh economic situation.
We will, however, let the students know through our various
structures to make it very effective," said Jongwe.
</P>
<P>
According to minutes of the meeting held on Friday, the
education ministry pointed out there was no possibility of an
increase in payouts for students in 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The reasons raised for this were that there is a lot of
pressure from the government and the dodging of students to pay
back the loan/grant given to them," said the minutes.
</P>
<P>
However, Jongwe said the loan and grant payouts were last
increased in 1994 but the cost of living had gone up drastically
during the last four years.
</P>
<P>
He said students were experiencing difficulties now that most
services in colleges were being privatised and they were now
forced to buy food at commercial rates.

<HEADLINE> CAR Sales In Britain Climb 12 percent In January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) - January's new car registrations
in Britain were 12.1 percent higher than that of January of 1997,
according to the latest figures by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Trades (SMMT).
</P>
<P>
The registrations last month totalled 232,055, up on the
January 1997 total of 206,985. Among them, British-built cars
accounted for 33 percent of new cars registered, compared with
34.62 percent in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This is a splendid way to start the new year. Car buyers are
taking advantage of the great deals out there and this, combined
with a marvellous choice of models, will have led to this sales
increase," said SMMT Chief Executive, Roger King.
</P>
<P>
"Demand has also been stimulated by aggressive marketing and
attractive financing packages," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, observers of the car markets noted that sales this
year were expected to be about 2.1 million, slightly below the
2.17 million figure recorded last year.
</P>
<P>
They also warned that last month's figures showed a further
deterioration in UK-sourced production, with imported cars still
occupying a large proportion.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Seeks to Solve Refugee Problem With UNHCR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe held talks here Saturday with visiting United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata to seek ways of
solving the long standing refugee problem on the African
continent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters soon after the meeting, Ogata said she
had asked Mugabe for leadership and support in solving the
refugee problem especially in the troubled Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe is also current Chairman of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Ogata said she was on a nine nation tour of Africa which will
also see her going to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
"The problem of refugees on the continent is as a result of
conflict," she said.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to hold discussions with DRC President Laurent
Kabila and see how we can work together in bringing back Congo
refugees from Tanzania. We are going to discuss their problem,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
"Most have gone back but there are still some Rwandan refugees
who need to go back home or find another place to stay although a
lot of them had been hosted by Congo," she said.
</P>
<P>
"What happened in the past will not totally be out of concern
but we will not ignore that," she said.
</P>
<P>
Ogata said the population of refugees in the Great Lakes
region was some 1.2 million mainly concentrated in Tanzania and
Congo who had been repatriated during the last four months.
</P>
<P>
Ogata, however, said the African continent had a refugee
population of well over six million in UNHCR managed camps,
260,000 of them Burundis in Tanzanian camps and the rest in some
transit camps scattered throughout the Great Lakes regions.

<HEADLINE> Palestine Envoy Raps Israel on Settlements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Ambassador to
Zimbabwe Ali Halimeh Saturday described it as dangerous a move by
the Israeli Ministry of Home Affairs to authorize the building of
132 Jewish settlements in Ras Al-Amoud in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Halimeh said the move was dangerous especially
when there are serious efforts by the United States and the
European Community to revive the negotiations between the Israeli
government and the Palestinian authority.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is likely to cause and increase violence in the
region and may lead to an explosive situation in the West Bank
area," he said.
</P>
<P>
Halimeh said it seemed that whenever there is a positive move
to speed up the implementation of the peace agreement the Israeli
government takes decisions and measures to disrupt the process.
</P>
<P>
"This is another flagrant violation of the Oslo Accord, and a
reflection of the nature of the aggressive and hostile policies
of the present Israeli government," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Once again we call upon those parties who are involved in the
peace process and are interested in a comprehensive settlement to
intervene to save the Arab East Jerusalem from the hands of the
Jewish fanatics and preserve this city, as a symbol of religious
tolerance and a symbol of peace in this world," he said.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Important Progress Made in Iraq-UN Evaluation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 7 (Xinhua)-- An Iraqi official said Saturday
that important progress has been made in evaluation of U.N. arms
inspection in missile and chemical weapons in Iraq, the Iraqi News
Agency (INA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Hussam Mohammed Ameen, director-general of the National
Monitoring department, the Iraqi peer of the U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM on disarmament in Iraq), made the remarks
following conclusion of technical evaluation meetings between
UNSCOM and Iraqi experts Friday night.
</P>
<P>
The technical evaluation meetings, started from the first of
February, designed to evaluate progress made by Iraq in
disarmament and iron out differences between Iraq and UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the mounting tensions between Iraq and the U.S.,
11 U.N. arms inspection teams continued their activities Saturday
and visited 15 sites, among them, four sites are not under
monitoring, said Ameen.
</P>
<P>
He added that a biological team led by the American woman
Diyana Simoon has made a surprise visit to a drugs laboratory,
meanwhile, a chemical team visited three military sites which are
not under monitoring.
</P>
<P>
He said all those visits have been made with full cooperation
by the Iraqi side and no problem had been reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait can not be lifted unless UNSCOM certifies that it
is free of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
So far, Iraq refuses to grant full access to U.N. arms
inspectors to presidential sites, and the on-going diplomatic
efforts made by Russia, France, Turkey and Egypt to seek a
political solution to the current crisis have failed to make a
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been warning of air strikes against
Iraq to force it into full compliance with relevant Security
Council resolutions, though many countries are opposed to the
use of military actions against Iraq.

LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- UK manufacturing industry's
output recorded its sharpest fall for six years in the last
quarter of 1997, the biggest fall since the second quarter of
1991, according to the latest official figures.
</P>
<P>
The volume of goods produced in the fourth quarter was 0.4
percent lower than in the third and just 1 percent above the level
of a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Some of analysts said that the manufacturing economy is on the
brink of technical recession and that interest rates may well have
peaked.
</P>
<P>
They believe that industry has now been squeezed by the five
quarter-point base rate rises since Labor came to power on May 1,
the continuing strength of the pound and the fall in demand from
the Far East.
</P>
<P>
Statisticians said that the unexpected weakness in
manufacturing could see the existing estimate of overall economic
growth in the fourth quarter revised down from 0.5 to 0.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> mee020714hke - Iran Expresses Concern over US Military Buildup in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 7 (Xinhua) - Vice Speaker of the Iranian
Majlis (parliament) Hassan Rowhani Saturday voiced Iran's concern
over the recent military buildup of the United States in the
Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting vice speaker of Bulgarian
Parliament Alexander Djerov, Rowhani said that at present the
U.S. military build-up in the Persian Gulf has drastically
heightened the tension in the region, adding that independent
states should stand against the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official was referring to recent U.S. military
deployment in the Persian Gulf, preparing a military strike on
Iraq following a standoff between Iraq and the United Nations
over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the crisis, Iran repeatedly announced
its opposition to any military strike on Iraq by the U.S.,
calling for more diplomatic efforts to solve the standoff
between Iraq and the U.N. peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"For administering the world, we believe that the will of a
single country should not be imposed on the other states.
However, the U.S. is following the line of dictatorship in the
world and imposing its own will on the world," Rowhani was quoted
by Iranian official news agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rowhani said the U.S. has attempted to use the international
organizations and human rights for its own interests, stressing
that the U.S. is neither the police nor the world leader, but an
ordinary state like the others.
</P>
<P>
Iran expects its "friendly nations" not to enter into the
games of the big powers, he said. Rowhani called on Iraq to
comply with the U.N. Security Council resolutions, saying that
the Security Council is entitled to make decision about the
states that do not comply with its resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed pleasure with the visit to Tehran of the
Bulgarian parliamentary delegation, hoping that it would serve to
develop parliamentary relations between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Tehran is willing to develop cooperation with Sofia, especially
in the field of oil and gas, Rowhani said, calling for formation
of Tehran-Sofia joint economic commission.
</P>
<P>
In the meeting, the Bulgarian official said the parliamentary
contacts would be a positive factor for development of bilateral
relations, calling for promotion of mutual cooperation in
political, economic, oil and gas areas.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian parliamentary delegation arrived here earlier
this week to mark the 100th anniversary of formation of
diplomatic relations between Tehran and Sofia.

<HEADLINE> Iran Refutes Israeli Charges Over Nuclear Programs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran Saturday hit back Israel's
charges that Iran poses threat to the region by developing nuclear
programs, saying that Israel is "the most important center of
plots, danger and insecurity in the region."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said
that the Israeli regime is taking advantage of the ongoing crisis
in Iraq in order to escalate tension in the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's remarks to foreign ambassadors to Tel Aviv Friday that
Iran poses a threat as great as that of Iraq. Netanyahu also
called for urgent world action to halt Iran's efforts to develop
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that Israel is expanding its nuclear arsenals
and non-conventional weapons without supervision of international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
"This is in contradiction with international laws and
regulations and against peace, stability and security in the
region and the world," he stressed, adding that Iran's peaceful
nuclear activities are under supervision of the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
</P>
<P>
Underlining the need to dismantle weapons of mass destruction
in the Middle East region, he called on the regional states to
exert pressure on Israel in order to "foil the plots hatched by
the Zionist regime against Muslim and Arab states of the region
and encourage the IAEA to supervise the Zionist regime's
activities."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iranian daily Tehran Times Saturday also blast
the Israeli government for labeling Iran as threat to the region,
saying it is Israel, not Iran, that poses real threat to peace.
</P>
<P>
Israel is on the threshold to be a nuclear power by
stockpiling at least 200 nuclear warheads, the daily said, but it
refused to sign the Non-Proliferation Treaty and even did not
allow the IAEA inspectors to visit its nuclear institutions.
</P>
<P>
"Ironically while the U.N.-U.S. attempts are in full swing to
dismantle Iraqi military capabilities, Israel has kept a number
of U.N. resolutions in cold storage," said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It urged the U.N. to put pressure on Israel to open its doors
to international inspectors in order to prevent the emergence of a
dangerous nuclear power in the region.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Open All Sites to UN Inspection: Saddam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein has said that Iraq is to open all sites to the U.N. arms
inspectors if it will lead to the lifting of sanctions against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Saddam made the statement in a letter to Yemeni President Ali
Abdullah Saleh Saturday, which was delivered by Saddam's special
envoy Shabib Maliki who is also Iraqi Justice Minister.
</P>
<P>
The message pointed out that Iraq is ready to open all sites
required to be inspected by the U.N. weapons inspection teams
provided that this will lead to bringing the embargo laid on Iraq
to an end, the Yemeni official news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi President's message to the Yemeni President dealt
with Iraq's position on the crisis with the UNSCOM and emphasized
that Iraq would abide by all the U.N. resolutions and it is ready
to cooperate, especially with Russia and France, as well as a
number of sister and friendly countries which are making efforts
to end the crisis peacefully.
</P>
<P>
President Saleh wrote a letter back to the Iraqi president in
which he welcomed the position of Iraq on the crisis with the
UNSCOM, reaffirming that Yemen supports the diplomatic efforts

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Fighting Kills 3 Junta Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Three soldiers loyal to Sierra
Leone's military junta died in the current fighting with the west
African peacekeeping force (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile nine military personnel were wounded, with some of
them very seriously, in the fresh hostilities which started early
Thursday in the capital Freetown, the British Broadcasting
Corporation reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
On the civilian side, 29 were wounded and seven died, the
report said, quoting related authorities of the military
government.
</P>
<P>
The on-going fighting has forced business activities in the
city to stop as people in a bid to buy food to keep in their own
houses found all the shops are closed.
</P>
<P>
Despite speculations that this would be a new round of
campaign by ECOMOG and the anti-junta civil militias known as
Kamajors to capture Freetown, local people seem not to be in a
panic.
</P>
<P>
Most of the people are outside watching military vehicles
going up and down in the city, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, clashes have been continuing between the junta
forces and Kamajors in southwest Sierra Leone, especially the
second largest city of Bo, according to the report monitored
here.
</P>
<P>
A lot of people have been caught in the fighting and in the
past week traffic sustained a standstill in the highway leading
to the city.
</P>
<P>
A junta officer was quoted as saying that at least six people,
including one soldier, and 10 civilians have been killed, while
several others are suffering from serious injuries in a series of
Kamajor ambushes.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors, a group of traditional hunters, have been
fighting for the restoration of ousted President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah since the military coup on May 25 last year.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Plans Disease Control Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is to
set up a center for disease control with primary focus on
preventable diseases, according to Health Minister Rear Admiral
Jubrila Ayinla.
</P>
<P>
The project is scheduled to take off before the end of this
year, the minister said at the opening of this year's review
meeting of the national immunization days in the capital Abuja
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Many international agencies had indicated their willingness to
support the project, Ayinla disclosed, quoted by the News Agency
of Nigeria Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the move is informed by the emphasis placed
on primary health care as the pivot of the country's health care
delivery system.
</P>
<P>
The government is convinced that preventive rather than
curative health care "holds the greater potential of improving
the health status of Nigerians, a majority of whom reside in the
rural areas," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, such United Nations agencies as
World Health Organization and UN Children's Fund have been very
supportive of the country's health care programs, despite the
sanctions imposed on Nigeria by some western countries.

SANAA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni President Ali Abdullah
Saleh met here Saturday with French special envoy Christian
Pierret on the current Iraqi-U.N. crisis over arms inspection.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Russia Anxious about Economic Losses from Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Russian official
has expressed concern that if the United States used force against
Iraq it would bring to Russia heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
The official at the ministry for Foreign Economic Relations and
Trade was quoted by the Interfax news agency as saying Saturday
that using force against Iraq would not only increase Russia's
losses from contracts with Iraq, but also delay the repayment of
Baghdad's debt to Moscow.
</P>
<P>
In the worst cases, the Iraqi economy would suffer a blow,
which would affect Iraq's foreign trade and the interests of its
partners, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He noted Russia is already losing hundreds of millions of
dollars a year because of stalled business relations with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, if the economic sanctions imposed by
the U.N. Security Council against Iraq in September 1990 were
lifted, Russian-Iraqi trade turnover would soon recover and reach
1.2 billion -1.5 billion U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
Russian government experts hold that Russia has lost 10 billion
U.S. dollars in profits over the years of sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
They said continued sanctions or a military strike at Iraq
would increase the losses and raise Iraq's debt to Russia, which
has already reached 7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Although Russia has been making efforts to prevent the using of
force against Iraq, the United States and Britain still insist on
"preparing to take tough action" to deal with the Middle East
country.

AMMAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Algeria would not allow any
country to interfere in its internal affairs by sending weapons
to support terrorists, a visiting Algerian minister said here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Algerian Minister of Communication, Culture and Government
Spokesman Babib Chawki Hamraoui said that some foreign countries
are trying to send weapons across the Algerian border to support
the terrorists in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian government denounces these actions as
"interference in its internal affairs," said Hamraoui at a press
conference before ending his six-day official visit to Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Algeria would not allow any country, including Arab, Islamic
and African countries, to interfere in its internal affairs, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Hamraoui also called for efforts to crack down on terrorism
all over the world and put an end to the support for terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Amman, the minister signed a number of
cooperation agreements with Jordan in the fields of culture and
communications.
</P>
<P>
At least 75,000 have been killed in Algeria since an Islamic
insurgency erupted in 1992 when the government canceled elections

ADDIS ABABA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Minister of
Trade and Industry Kassahun Ayele Saturday stressed that all
efforts should focus on assisting exporters to produce and market
quality products efficiently and effectively.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a meeting on export here organized by the Ethiopian
Chamber of Commerce, Kassahun said the sophistication of
international trade has become more demanding and requires
products to meet certain standards for which capital and
knowledge are dispensable.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopian government, the minister said, well aware of the
problems, is implementing infrastructural development with
particular emphasis to roads, power and the telecom sectors in
its bid to encourage export trade.
</P>
<P>
Kassahun told participants that the government will spare no
effort in helping the private sector build up its capacity to
come out competitive in the world market.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that Ethiopia's application to join the
integrated initiatives for the least developed countries trade
development program launched by six multilateral institutions
including the world trade organization has won approval, adding
that the program envisages to assist least developed countries to
be integrated in the world economy.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Supports AL Efforts to End Iraqi-UN Standoff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan
Saturday said that Jordan would fully support the efforts of the
Arab League (AL) to help end peacefully the standoff between Iraq
and the United Nations Special Commission's (UNSCOM) arms
inspection team.
</P>
<P>
Jordan stood for activating the whole Arab and international
efforts, particularly those from the Arab League, the Organization
of the Islamic Conference and the U.N. Security Council's member
states, to find a peaceful solution for the standoff, Jordan's
official news agency quoted Hassan as saying during a meeting with
AL Chief Esmat Abdel Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Jordan also supports the Arab League in avoiding military
action which might inflict disasters over Iraq and the whole
region, Hassan told Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Jordan earlier declared that it would not allow any country to
use its territory or airspace to launch military attack against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
During his visit to Jordan from Friday to Saturday, Meguid
told Jordanian officials that Iraq had showed "flexibility"
thanks to the international efforts headed by Russia.
</P>
<P>
Meguid paid his visit to Baghdad right after special envoys
of Russian and French presidents as well as the Palestinians
arrived there in an attempt to broker a diplomatic solution for
the standoff.
</P>
<P>
Meguid returned to Cairo, where the AL organization
headquartered, later Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi-UNSCOM standoff was caused by Baghdad's prevention
of the UNSCOM arms inspection teams from entering suspected
presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
Although Iraq now has softened its stand by promising to open
about 45 suspected Presidential Palaces, the U.S. and Britain
still consider the use of military force against Iraq in case that
diplomatic efforts fail to make Iraq open all the suspected sites
unconditionally.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: Africa Determined to Eliminate Child </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The delegates of 22 African
countries are determined to eliminate child labor, identifying
poverty as the fundamental cause of child labour.
</P>
<P>
In their three-day child labour conference concluded here
Saturday afternoon, the delegates appealed for increased
international assistance to attack poverty.
</P>
<P>
Under the current social and economic situation in Africa,
some children might be required to work in the medium and short
term, but the final report of the conference noted that "the work
should be regulated and should not endanger the health and safety
of the child", and the work should "combine protected work
activities with some kind of education and social services", the
report added.
</P>
<P>
The priority should be given to the immediate suppression of
extreme forms of child labor within time bound programs of
action, the participants noted.
</P>
<P>
Extreme forms of child labor as the outright abuses of human
right, are constituting grave threats to the health, safety,
social and moral development of children, the delegates pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Participation of children in armed conflict and criminal
activities were also condemned as being "socially unacceptable"
at the conference.
</P>
<P>
While insisting the poverty should be eradicated as the
fundamental cause of rife child labor throughout the continent,
the final report of the tripartite conference noted that poverty
is not the only cause, nor can it provide an excuse for inaction.
The delegates asked for "keeping children in school now" as the
most important thing.
</P>
<P>
The International Labor Organization (ILO) estimated that
Africa has the highest rate of child labor where 41 percent of
children between age of 5 and 14 work, and where the total amount
of child laborers is approximately 80 million.
</P>
<P>
This could increase to 100 million by 2015 if the present
trends continued. During the meeting, the ILO Director General,
Michel Hansenne, said that such an outcome "would be a tragedy
not just for the children involved but for Africa as a whole."
</P>
<P>
African countries should participate in the drafting the
proposed new international labor standards on extreme forms of
child labor to influence their content, the delegates claimed.
</P>
<P>
The report and conclusion of the meeting called for African
states to cooperate with each other in the effort to address the
immediate and underlying causes of child labor and asked that the
results of the conference be submitted to the 21 ordinary session
of the OAU's labour and social affairs commission, which meets in
Pretoria, South Africa, from April 13 to 18 this year.
</P>
<P>
The ILO, which counts 174 member states, provided financial
and technical assistance to the Kampala conference on child
labor, which was organized under the auspices of the OAU and was
hosted by the Ugandan Ministry of Labor and social affairs.

<HEADLINE> AL Outlines Plan to Avoid Military Option to Iraq-UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdel Meguid said Saturday he will submit an Arab plan to
the United Nations Security Council on defusing crisis in the Gulf
over the U.N. inspection of Iraq's suspected lethal weapons.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Meguid made the statement after his return to Cairo
Saturday evening from Amman after winding up a mission to Iraq
entrusted by Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in his capacity as
chairman of the last Arab Summit held in Cairo in June 1996 to
stave off a military action vowed by the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Meguid began his mission in Iraq on Wednesday. In addition to
his talks with Iraqi officials, he met with the Russian and
French envoys, who were sent to Baghdad to discuss the crisis
between Iraq and the United Nations, and Arab ambassadors in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The AL secretary general said that as a result of his talks he
reached the bases of a draft resolution to be submitted to the
Security Council to avoid the military option.
</P>
<P>
The suggested plan, which combines different views, seeks Iraqi
compliance with the U.N. resolutions in good faith, and takes into
account Iraq's right to preserve its sovereignty, dignity and
security concern.
</P>
<P>
"President Saddam Hussein had said that he was willing to
cooperate with the Arab League in all that serves Arab interests,"
said Abdel Meguid.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. resolutions, economic sanctions on Baghdad
imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait can only be lifted after
the U.N. Special Commission on scrapping Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction verifies the completion of its job.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have threatened military strikes
if Iraq insisted on denying the U.N. arms inspectors full access
to the suspected sites including presidential palaces.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Meguid told Middle East News Agency that he will submit a
report to Mubarak on the results of his talks with Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein as well as French and Russian envoys on thrashing
out a diplomatic exit from the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The AL chief said Saddam and Iraqi officials appreciated
Mubarak's initiative which came after his contacts with 14 Arab
leaders.
</P>
<P>
He said that the report he will submit to Mubarak will also
include the results of talks he held in Jordan with Crown Prince
Hassan, Prime Minister Abdul-Salam Majali and other Jordanian
officials.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Contacts Saudi King Over Phone on Current </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States President
Bill Clinton Saturday telephoned Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz to
discuss the current developments in the Gulf, Saudi Press Agency
quoted reports from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also tackled bilateral relations, the reports
said, without giving the details of the phone call.
</P>
<P>
The phone call came amidst intensified international efforts
to seek a diplomatic solution to the Iraqi-U.N. standoff over
arms inspection in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It also came ahead of a scheduled tour by U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen to the region Sunday, which will take him
to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, and Qatar within efforts to
tackle the crisis.
</P>
<P>
During her visit to Saudi Arabia last Monday, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright discussed with the Saudi leaders ways of
pressuring Iraq into backing down from its present position on
denying U.N. inspectors' access to presidential palaces where
chemical and biological weapons are suspected to be hidden.
</P>
<P>
Both sides voiced their keenness to allow diplomacy to take its
full course towards convincing Baghdad to permit the U.N. arms
inspectors to resume its task unhampered.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi government favors a diplomatic solution rather than
the military option although Riyadh reiterated that it is
necessary for Iraq to comply with the U.N. resolutions and to
allow the arms inspectors to continue their operations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has underscored in a joint press conference with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair in Washington Friday that both
countries were ready to resort to a military option if Iraq
failed to comply with the U.N. resolutions and allow the arms
inspectors to enter unfettered the suspected sites in Iraqi
presidential palaces.

ISLAMABAD, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Aid workers Sunday were
setting up clinics and handing out supplies in northeastern
Afghanistan where as many as more than 4,000 people were killed in
a strong earthquake.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the International Committee of the Red Cross
(ICRC), which is coordinating relief efforts, said a foreign
medical team had reached Rustaq -- the epicenter of the quake,
according to a report reaching here from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary reports put the death toll at 3,300 in Rustaq and
12 surrounding villages, the ICRC spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Aid teams were bringing in tents and blankets for thousands of
homeless people amid the harsh Afghan winter, and installing
mobile clinics to treat the injured, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
However, aid workers could not confirm the varying death tolls
ranging from 2,000 to 4,500 dead, he said.
</P>
<P>
The first quake measuring 6.1 on the Richter scale Wednesday
night hit the isolated Rustaq district, nestled at the junction of
the Hindu Kush and Pamir mountain ranges. But news of the quake in
the remote Afghan province did not reach Kabul until Friday, and
details are still scanty and sometimes conflicting.

according to a senior expert with the complex.
</P>
<P>
The temple, which covers 273 ha, was built in 1420 during the
Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Ancient emperors visited the sacred site
to worship the Heavens. The complex was designated as a public
park in 1918.
</P>
<P>
The government allocates substantial annual funding to maintain
and repair the ancient temple complex. For example, new housing
covering 940 sq.m. was demolished during 1997 in order to restore
the original beauty and serenity of the temple complex.
</P>
<P>
The temple attracted well over 10 million domestic and foreign
visitors in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Set up Special Body to Collect Donations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad said Sunday that the government plans to set up a
special body soon to collect donations or contributions from the
public for economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
People could contribute in whatever form, like property, goods
and money, to the body and the proceeds could be sold to get
foreign exchange to form part of the national reserve, Mahathir
told a news conference after launching a women's fund here.
</P>
<P>
He said the establishment of the body had already been
discussed by the Cabinet but its composition had yet to be
decided. But the government plans to set it up as soon as
possible, he added.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the women's fund launching ceremony, Mahathir
said the collection by the body was not meant for investing in
shares but for increasing the national reserve.
</P>
<P>
"If this can be done, it will also be able to restore our
country's economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's economy has been hit by the regional financial
crisis which erupted after Thailand floated the baht last July
when the local currency fell sharply against the U.S. dollar and
share prices on the local stock market plummeted.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Thespians Win Acclaim (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Zhoima Yangzom, a young, shy
Tibetan girl who tended to blush when speaking in public, entered
the Shanghai Drama Institute a little over two years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhoima has studied acting for two years in China's
largest metropolitan area and has emerged as one of the best
students in the acting class for Tibetans. She, in fact, won
audience acclaim for her portrayal of a shrew in the class
graduate play entitled "Shared Kitchen"
</P>
<P>
"Absolutely superb. Zhoima and her classmates portrayed
Shanghailanders so well and convincingly that it was hard to
believe they were actually Tibetans," said one young man in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
Three hundred people packed the institute's small theater for
each of eight scheduled performances, and an extra show was added
to fulfill public demand.
</P>
<P>
The class, the fourth group of 18 stage performers the
institute has trained for Tibet since 1959, also won praise from
school officials.
</P>
<P>
The young Tibetan thespians were simply high school graduates
from Lhasa, Shannam and Xigaze prior to their arrival in
Shanghai. "I had never been out of Tibet before coming to
Shanghai. I spoke poor Putonghua (or spoken Chinese) and my
knowledge of stage plays was limited to a few Tibetan operas and
xiaoping, or popular short stage plays with simple plots, said
Phubu Cering, the class monitor.
</P>
<P>
Phubu, 20, and other Tibetan youngsters, as well as the school
and teachers, share credit for the success.
</P>
<P>
The institute charges Tibetan students half of regular tuition
feeds, and the few students unable to afford even that receive
financial assistance from the Shanghai Education Committee and
various ethnic minority committees, as well as the institute's
Association of Female Professors.

took the limelight in the day's last medal event on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Danilova, who has been drought of an Olympic medal before coming to
Nagano, won the women's cross country skiing 15km classical event with
46 minutes 55.4 seconds.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Gianni Romme of the Netherlands, with slap
skates, set a new mark in the men's 5,000m speed skating race with six
minutes and 22.20 seconds, eight seconds faster than his previous
record.
</P>
<P>
Danilova, mother of twin babies, held off a powerful Norwegian
skiers and her teammates in the cross country race, beating her
compatriot Larissa Lazutina and Norway's Anita Moen-Guidon to the
second and third respectively.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, five-time overall World Cup champion Elena Vaelbe --
still without an individual Olympic gold -- finished a disappointing
17th and Italy's Stefania Belmondo, ranked No. 1 on the World Cup
circuit, finished eighth.
</P>
<P>
The bad weather on the Japanese Alps forced the cancellation of
flagship event the men's downhill, which is rescheduled for Wednesday.
But the heavy snow of the day provided a beautiful scenery for
audiences, who watched cross country skiers skied through snow flakes.
</P>
<P>
While on the ice rink of M-Wave, three skaters, all armed with new
skates and from Dutch roots, broke world records in a span of 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
Before Romme entered into the ice rink, his world records of six
minutes 30.63 seconds were rewrote twice. One by his former Dutch
teammate Bart Veldkamp, who now represents Belgium, and the other by
veteran skater Rintje Ritsma.
</P>
<P>
Veldkamp, who joined Belgium after breaking with the Dutch Skating
Association in 1995, covered the distance in six minutes and 31
seconds.
</P>
<P>
Minutes later, Ritsma, who was overshadowed by Norwegian Juhann
Olav Koss at the last Olympics in Lillehammer, improved the mark by
0.07 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Ritsma, who has never won an Olympic gold since Albertville, might
have to wait for his time in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
Watching his marks being broken, Romme waited in patience for his
turn at the rink side.
</P>
<P>
As one of the final two skaters, Romme's skating sent the day's
competitions to a climax.
</P>
<P>
After five laps, the flying Romme was three seconds faster than
Ritsma, and 12 laps later, he had outskated Ritsma by six seconds,
which paid him back the world record and Olympic title.
</P>
<P>
His victory also earned the Netherlands some fame in speedskating.
In Lillehammer, Norway four years ago, Dutch skaters failed to win any
gold, the first time since 1964.
</P>
<P>
The only other gold medal of the day was claimed by Canada through
Ross Rebagliati, who won a historical Olympic gold in men's
snowboarding giant slalom event.
</P>
<P>
Snowboarding is making its debut at the Olympics, with two events
of giant slalom and halfpipe.
</P>
<P>
In the ice hockey tournament of the day, Kazakstan played to a 5-5
draw against Austria and Slovakia edged Italy 4-3 in the men's
preliminary round.
</P>
<P>
While in the women's section, Finland whitewashed Sweden 6-0,
Canada blanked Japan 13-0 and United States defeated China 5-0.
</P>
<P>
After first-day competitions, Russia and the Netherlands led the
medal standings with one gold and one silver each.
</P>
<P>
Monday's competition will decide four gold medals in the events of
men's cross country skiing 30km classical, women's snowboarding giant
slalom, luge men's singles and biathlon women's 15km.

<HEADLINE> Three Skaters Shatter World Record, Romme Wins Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Speed skaters armed with the
new skates strongly began to rewrite the record books on the opening
day of the Nagano Winter Olympics when the men's 5,000-meter world
record crashed three times at the "M- Wave" rink Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Recorld holder Gianni Romme of the Netherlands skated a great time
of 6:22.20 to slice 8.43 minutes off his own world record on the way
to claiming the gold medal.
</P>
<P>
Romme, who set the old record of 6:30.63 in the Netherlands on
December 7 last year, defended his record when he skated in the first
inner lane against Kjell Storelid of Norway after two challengers
smashed his previous record twice earlier.
</P>
<P>
In the 12th of 16 pair races, Bart Veldkamp of Belgium set a world
record with a time of 6:28.31 to draw cheers and claps as he crossed
the finish line.
</P>
<P>
However, Rintje Ritsma, a bronze medalist four years ago in
Lillehammer, silenced the crowds soon as he clocked a new world record
of 6: 28:24 in the 13th pair skating to take the silver medal.
</P>
<P>
Veldkamp, 30, the former Duch skater who only changed to Belgian
citizenship last year, won the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
"Ritsma was very fast. I'd rather watch him skating as a spectator
than race against him," said Japanese Keiji Shirahata, who skated
against Ritsma and finished seventh with 6:36.71.
</P>
<P>
Skating in the last pair, Romme was more faster than anyone from
the very beginning of his race.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old covered his first 1,200 meters in 2:17.46, 3,000
meters in 3:47.95 and 4,600 meters in 5:51.14, compared with Ritsma's
2:20.40, 3:52.52 and 5:57.09 in each distance.
</P>
<P>
"It was exciting to watch. After two or three laps, I knew I would
be second, Ritsma said of Romme's record-setting job.
</P>
<P>
"After that, it was easy to watch. I did my best, so I'm
disappointed. I had a great race, but Gianni did better," Ritsma
added.
</P>
<P>
Romme, a swimming instructor, regained his record and won the gold
15 minutes later but did not think he could do it.
</P>
<P>
"I saw what Bart and Rintje did, and I wanted to protect my record.
I didn't think I could do it at first, but I did," Romme explained
referring to Veldkamp and Ritsma's performances.
</P>
<P>
"It feels great. Really great. it was impressive to me, too, to do
29 (seconds) laps. It went to easy. It was so fast. It's the greatest
feeling for a skater to be fast and for it to be so easy. When I
crossed the finishe line, this was the greatest feeling in my life."

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The fall in international
prices and less-than-projected demand at home could help India
save one billion U.S. dollars in its oil import bill during the
1997-98 fiscal year starting April 1, Petroleum Ministry officials
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the lower prices, the government is
maximizing the import of crude oil and cutting down on costlier
petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The import bill for petroleum and its products is now likely to
be around nine billion dollars as against the projected over 10
billion, they said.

<HEADLINE> Albanians Call for Return of Death Penalty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Support for restoring the death
penalty in Albania is growing as violence in the Balkan republic
continues to claim lives.
</P>
<P>
The backing comes from both the ruling and the opposition
parties, as well as the majority of people.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the Socialist Party, number one party in Albania's
coalition government, said the return of death penalty would help
settle down problems threatening the country's public order and
security.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Party, the largest opposition party, also voiced
support for the restoration of the punishment.
</P>
<P>
Albania suspended the death penalty four years ago at the
request of the Council of Europe, which set this as one of the
conditions for Albania's entering the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
No one has been executed in Albania since 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, number of violent cases such as murdering, robbery,
rape and kid-napping has kept rising in the country.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 alone, more than 2,000 civilians and 60 policemen were
killed, but no murderers were ever sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
Most Albanian people also supported the return of the death
penalty. In a recent poll conducted by a non-government
organization, 66.18 percent of those being questioned said they
wanted immediate come-back of the death penalty, while only 4.17
percent were against it.
</P>
<P>
The suspension of death penalty is a mere commitment the
Albanian government made to the Council of Europe. The two sides
have not signed any official agreement on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Albanian parties suggested a re-negotiation with the EU so as
to win its understanding and agreement to the return of the death
penalty in the country.

<HEADLINE> Stolen Israeli Army Command Car Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The stolen command car of the
Israeli army was recovered Sunday morning by Israeli security
forces in northern Israel, ending the drama that caused serious
concern among the army senior officers.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army announcement said that although the command
car was recovered, weapons in the car, including heavy machine
guns, were missing.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said that the car was driven away on Saturday by
a man disguised in the uniform of the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)
after he cheated the guards of the northern border Barkan outpost
near Rosh Hanikra.
</P>
<P>
The man entered border post at about 3:00 AM and told the
guards there that he had got the permission of the local commander
to use the command car to pull out his jeep which had stuck down
the road.
</P>
<P>
As the man knew details of soldiers serving at the post and
even pretented to speak to the brigade commander on a telephone
and let the guards believe he had the officer's permission to
take away the vehicle fully loaded with heavy machine guns and
communication equipment.
</P>
<P>
The guards, therefore, granted the man entry and allowed him to
take the command car near the front gate of the outpost and drive
away.
</P>
<P>
The command car has been used to patrol the northern
border. Besides the weapons, it also contained several radios
which could be monitored to determine IDF movements in the area.
</P>
<P>
After the soldiers at the post realized later that the command
car had been stolen, widespread searches were conducted to locate
the man and the command car. But no details have been given about
how the car was found.

<TEXT>
<P>
China continued to expand trade ties with the United States,
Japan, Europe and Russia, and significantly improved trade
relations with Hong Kong and Taiwan last year.
</P>
<P>
Notable progress has been made in the country's efforts to
enter the World Trade Organization (WTO), said Wu, adding that
China has engaged in positive participation in the liberalization
process for trade and investment in APEC in order to promote
economic and technological cooperation between member states.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, macroeconomic regulations and control goals call for
China's 1998 import-export volume to hit 345 billion US dollars,
Wu said. The nations will record relevant progress in the use of
foreign funds, carry out contracted projects overseas, expand
labor service cooperation, develop various cooperative economic
and technological projects, increase foreign investment and reform
its aid program.
</P>
<P>
She acknowledged that China will face stark challenges in
foreign trade and economic cooperation during 1998 due mainly to
the financial crisis in some Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
Wu underlined that the crisis' possible negative impact on
China's foreign trade and economic work shoud on no account be
underestimated.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, she also pointed to the many favorable domestic
and international conditions for the country's foreign trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China's basic export principle is based on the premise of
seeking economic results, said Wu, adding that China will adopt
all practical and effective policy measures. Related efforts will
include encouraging enterprises to reach their true internal
potential, optimizing the export structure and further improve an
export tax refund system, as well as maintaining stable increases
in exports, and raising imports to an appropriate level.

Wu said that the national conference held at the end of last
year yielded a clear comprehensive plan for policy trends related
to the use of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Related policies should be itemized into detailed operable
initiatives which will allow every opportunity to be seized for
implementation in order to reverse the slump in direct foreign
investment over recent years and, at the same time, maintain and
expand the scale for attracting foreign funding, said Wu.
</P>
<P>
She went on to say that restructuring the use of foreign
investment in accordance with China's development strategy should
be accompanied by the introduction of steps to further open the
service trade, and ensure the efficiency of experimental retail,
foreign trade and tourism units.
</P>
<P>
With regard to reforming the administration of foreign trade
and economic cooperation, Wu pledged to accelerate the process of
approving trade rights and expanding the scope of the related
registration system from enterprises in China's five special
economic zones to 1,000 large state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>

fulfill the demands of the socialist market economy, she said.
</P>
<P>
China will strive to further lift controls by reducing the
scope of imported goods subject to quotas and licenses, and will
simplifying approvals for imports, said Wu.
</P>
<P>

and technology standards to control imports.

Investment from overseas represents an important channel for
gaining greater access to the international market and attracting
foreign resources, Wu said. She cited the necessity for the nation
to adopt measures to encourage financially sound businesses to
invest overseas, and enterprises with appropriate professional and
technological strength to open factories abroad.
</P>
<P>
Wu also touched on multilateral and bilateral trade relations
during a year in which the country will quite likely face
extremely difficult situations. She pointed to the great
significance in China's ability to reinforce multilateral and
bilateral trade tasks in order to create a better external
environment and an expanded sphere needed to ensure the sustainable
development of foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
China must take positive action to ensure a positive conclusion
to negotiations for its entry into the World Trade Organization,
and must act in our own best interests by participating in free
trade and the investment process in order to promote cooperation
between members of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
Organization.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that consolidating and developing trade
relations with major partners such as the United States, the
European Union and Japan should be accompanied by greater efforts
to strengthen bilateral ties with the developing countries in
Asia, Africa and Latin America. Moreover, she said, China should
devote special attention to opening markets in Africa and Latin
America, as well as to developing and effectively using resources
available in the two regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wu called for expanded trade activities with Taiwan,
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) and Macao. She
said related efforts will help maintain Hong Kong's prosperity and
stability, ensure Macao's successful return to the motherland, and
promote economic exchanges across the Taiwan Straits.

</P>
<P>
During his six-day visit to Japan, Chi held talks with Fumio

authorities of the two sides, as well as between the People's
Liberation Army and Japan's Self-Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
Chi also met Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and Foreign
Minister Keizo Obuchi and visited some facilities of Japan's

<P>
Baghdad has been refusing U.N. arms inspectors' access to
presidential palaces, which it regards as signs of its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. weapons inspectors must certify that Iraq has
eliminated all weapons of mass destruction before the Security
Council can order the lifting of crippling economic sanctions,
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Washington has beefed up military buildup in the Gulf and
heightened its threat of military attacks to force Iraq to comply
with U.N. resolutions to grant arms inspectors full access to its
sensitive sites if diplomatic efforts fail to defuse crisis.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused the U.S. of trying to block the removal of
embargo and prolonging the suffering of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The past several days have witnessed intense international
diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful way out of the crisis and
avert a possible U.S. military strike against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rises to 5.81 Percent in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- India's annual rate of
inflation climbed up further by 0.03 percentage points to 5.81
percent for the week that ended January 24, despite a slight fall
in the prices of food articles, the Press Trust of India (PTI)
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The inflation is based on the wholesale price index (WPI).
</P>
<P>
The week saw a marked improvement in the prices of food
products, which have been on the rise for the last few weeks due
to the unusual behavior of the southwest Monsoon and the cold wave
sweeping the north of India.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the price of vegetables, which rose by 16.62
percent in the previous five weeks, came down by 3.2 percent in
the week under review.
</P>
<P>
Of the three major groups, indices of primary articles moved
down, those of manufactured products went up and those of fuel,
power, light and lubricants remained unchanged.

<P>
BEIRUT, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Amid escalating tension in South
Lebanon, another Lebanese civilian was wounded Sunday morning in
an Israeli shelling, local radio Voice of the People reported.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old youth was hit by shrapnels of an Israeli shell
in the village of Yadrir, just north of the Israeli self-styled
security zone in south Lebanon, the radio said, adding that he was
quickly transferred to a nearby hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two days, one civilian were killed and two
others wounded during clashes between Israeli troops and Lebanese
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Clashes have been going on since Israel carved out the
1,200-square-kilometer area in 1985 in south Lebanon as a buffer
zone to protect its northern area from cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerillas.

<HEADLINE> Yassin Delays Trip Abroad Due to Israeli Hurdles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Hamas founder and spiritual
leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin has decided to delay his travel abroad
because of obstacles created by Israel, Israel Radio reported
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel has permitted Yassin, who is wheel chair-bound and
seriously ill, to travel from Gaza to Saudi Arabia for
treatment. Yassin also planned to meet Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and attend a big Muslim rally in London, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But Israel refused to allow several of Yassin's associates to
accompany him abroad for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, who had served in Israeli jail since 1988, was freed
last October in a prisoners swap deal with Jordan. Israel
exchanged Yassin for two agents of the secret service Mossad, who
were arrested in Jordanian capital Amman in a botched attempt to
assassinate Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal in late September.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, or Islamic Resistance Movement, is the leading militant
Palestinian group fighting to oust Israeli troops from occupied
Palestinian territories. It is opposed to the Israeli-Palestinian
peace process, and has gained fame through carrying out suicide
bombings against Israeli targets in buses, markets and streets.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- One of the black boxes which
could possibly lead investigators in determining the cause of the
crash of the ill-fated Cebu Pacific plane was believed recovered
in the wreckage of the aircraft Sunday morning, the Philippine
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Chris Datu, commander of the Composite Air Support
Force based in Cagayan de Oro City Airport, refused to comment on
the report, saying only that he was waiting for the instrument to
be airlifted to the headquarters of the Air Support Force for
examination.
</P>
<P>
The agency also quoted Jacinto Ligot, commander of the ground
search and rescue teams now scouring the crash site in Mt.
Sumagaya, Mindanao, as saying that the Cockpit Voice Recorder
(CVR) was now in the custody of a military official at the crash
site.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the morning, Jesus Dureza, head of the Presidential
Action Center (PAC) who supervises the overall rescue and search
efforts, said Flight 387 had two black boxes which may contain
important data about the probable cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
He said the CVR, which records all conversations in the cockpit
 between the pilots and the airport tower, contains important
information 30-minutes prior to the accident.
</P>
<P>
Dureza said the other black box, the Flight Data Recorder
(FDR), also contains the aircraft's nautical speed, velocity, flat
sitting engine power and other important information about the
aircraft's condition.
</P>
<P>
Dureza said the recovery of the black boxes will expedite
efforts to determine the cause of the passenger jet's crash Monday
on its way from Manila to Cagayan de Oro, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
All the 99 passengers and five crew members aboard the plane
are feared dead.

<HEADLINE> Unqualified Public Servants Dismissed in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Eleven public servants in
Liuyang city, central China's Hunan Province, have been dismissed
from their posts after they were appraised by public votes as
"unqualified" for two consecutive years.
</P>
<P>
"It is the masses who have the final say in enrolling and
dismissing public servants," said Xu Xiangping, a leading official
with the municipal government.
</P>
<P>
The city introduced the public appraisal system for public
servants two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The city's personnel affairs department says that the 11
dismissed public servants are involved in such illicit activities
as gambling and appropriation of public funds for personal use, or
have made serious mistakes.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, over 10,000 people from all walks of
life were invited to give marks to more than 6,000 public
servants in the city.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, the appraisal system has imposed enormous
pressure upon the public servants and promoted them to improve
their working styles," said Xu.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine rescuers Sunday
recovered the cockpit voice recorder of the ill-fated Cebu Pacific
Plane at the crash site in Mt. Sumagaya, Mindanao, the Air
Transportation Office said.
</P>
<P>
The cockpit voice recorder is one of the two black boxes at the
aircraft and it records the pilot conversations. The other one is
the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) which records the condition of the
aircraft before it crashes, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Both instruments can help piece together possible causes of the
aircraft's failure.
</P>
<P>
American aircraft investigators are searching for the flight
data recorder and key cockpit instruments at the crash site which
would help determine the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rescuers Sunday morning airlifted 30 more cadaver
bags of human bodies from the crash site, and forensic experts
started matching body parts for identification.
</P>
<P>
"We have improvised the hangar owned by the National Power
Corporation in Lumbia airport into a mortuary laboratory, where 30
forensic experts are on hand to undergo the segregation and
identification of body parts," said Jesus Dureza, head of the
Presidential Action Center (PAC) in Cagayan de Oro, a southern
city near Mt. Sumagaya.
</P>
<P>
As the bodies are so badly mutilated that it is impossible now
to tell how many bodies of the 99 passengers and five crew members
aboard the Cebu Pacific Air Flight 387 have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
Dureza said relatives of the victims would immediately be
informed once the experts are "100 percent" sure about the
identification of the victims, the Philippine News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Dureza said search and rescue operations would continue at the
crash site until the area is cleared and the black box containing
important data within the last 30 minutes before the crash
occurred is retrieved.
</P>
<P>
But it is difficult to tell when the operations, which have
often been hampered by bad weather in the mountain area in the
past six days, would end.
</P>
<P>
The Dc-9 passenger plane crashed Monday on its way from the
Philippine capital of Manila to Cagayan de Oro City in the
Southern Island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers have already found some parts of the plane and about
40 bags of mangled bodies, which were littered around the crash
site.

<P>
HONG KONG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong residents are
taking advantage of Asia's currency devaluation and are enjoying
cheaper holiday trips throughout the region, a local newspaper
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Census and Statistics Department show
departures of Hong Kong residents were up 14.7 percent in the last
quarter of 1997, compared with the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Among the most popular destinations were Thailand, the Republic
of Korea, Malaysia, Japan and Indonesia, reported the
English-language Hong Kong Standard.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's sharp currency devaluation made it an ideal target
for Hong Kong travel bugs seeking a short-haul break at a reduced
cost. Figures indicate departures from Hong Kong to Thailand rose
by 33.5 percent in the two months following the Thai baht's
initial devaluation.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is also expecting an increase in Hong Kong tourists in
the year. "The advantage we have is our currency. depreciation has
meant that hotel prices and the cost of entertainment have
virtually been halved," said Z. Zalizan, deputy director of the
Malaysian Tourist Board's Hong Kong Office.
</P>
<P>
But Hong Kong residents were not confining their trips to the
countries where they can get the most for the HK dollar, the only
major currency in Asia that has maintained its strength.
</P>
<P>
Long-haul destinations such as Britain, Germany, Canada and
Australia also enjoyed an increase of Hong Kong tourists.

</P>
<P>
In other worlds, 6 percent of the city's residents have mobile

municipalities and autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Jinxiang, deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Bureau
for Wireless Telecommunications, said that Beijing witnessed the
fastest development of mobile phone services in 1997, with
310,000 subscribers registered in the year.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhao, Beijing's first mobile phone was put into
use in 1987, and there were only 77,000 mobile phone subscribers
at the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said, mobile phone subscribers in Beijing are expected to
increase by over 400,000 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
To meet the needs of the increasing number of mobile phone
subscribers, Zhao said, Beijing Telecom has expanded its mobile
phone network capacity for four times and a fifth-phase expansion
project is under way, which will raise the total capacity to 1.15
million lines upon completion.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Election of the new President
of the Republic of Cyprus for a five year term got underway from
early Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
A record number of seven candidates, including incumbent
President Glafcos Clerides, are contesting the eighth presidential
elections in the Cyprus Republic since its establishment in
1960.
</P>
<P>
Around 3,000 policemen are on duty around the
government-controlled southern part of island to ensure the
smooth running of the elections.
</P>
<P>
A total of 446,731 voters will cast their ballots at 1,023
polling stations, which have opened in all five districts of
the southern areas.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Greek Cypriots and Maronites living in the Turkish-controlled
northern part of Cyprus will vote at four specially designated
polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Voting started at 0700 AM local time (0500 GMT) and will
end at 1700 local time (1500 GMT). Final results are expected
to be announced at around midnight.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that a second round of elections is
almost certain to take place next Sunday, as none of the
presidential hopefuls is likely to obtain the necessary 50
percent plus of the vote.
</P>
<P>
Under the Cyprus constitution, if no candidate secures more
then 50 percent of votes in the first ballot, a second ballot
will take place the following Sunday between the two
front-runners.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus gained independence from British colonial rule in
1960. Seven presidential elections have been held since then.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Set Up Security Zone in Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish government has
decided to set up a security zone in northern Iraq in case the
United States stages military strikes against Iraq, local
newspaper Milliyet reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted government sources, who declined to be named,
as saying that the Turkish government had decided at the cabinet
meeting late Friday night, that Turkey will take so-called
"humanitarian support actions" in a bid to establish "humanitarian
support centers" in northern Iraq when the U.S. launches strikes
against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The "humanitarian support actions" mean that the Turkish
security forces will enter into 15 kilometers inside northern
Iraq to establish a security zone ("humanitarian support
centers"), according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The setting-up of the security zone is aimed at stopping a
possible influx of Iraqi Kurdish refugees, especially preventing
the rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) from
infiltrating into Turkey. Most PKK guerrillas have sheltered
themselves in northern Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been hoping for the establishment of a security zone
in northern Iraq to prevent the PKK militants from staging attacks
against Turkish military and civilians in Turkey, but suffered
strong criticism from Iraq and Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 13-year-old separatist war for
autonomy, which has claimed over 28,000 lives in eastern and
southeastern Turkey since August 1984.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges to Prevent Military Strike on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Defense Minister Ali
Shamkhani Sunday urged the United Nations, international
community and regional countries to continue diplomatic efforts
to prevent any possible U.S. military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We hoped the U.N. Security Council, the Organization of the
Islamic Conference (OIC) and regional countries to control the
current crisis in the region and prevent the United States from
launching military strike against Iraq," Shamkhani said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
He noted the U.S. military actions in the region, particularly
the use of advanced weapons, would pose a great threat to all the
regional countries and would also damage the regional environment.
</P>
<P>
Despite intensified diplomatic efforts and Iraqi offer to open
eight presidential palaces to U.N. arms inspectors, the U.S. is
continuing to strengthen its military buildup in the Gulf for a
military strike to force Baghdad's acceptance of "unconditional
and unrestricted arms inspections."
</P>
<P>
Shamkhani voiced Iran's opposition to military confrontation in
the region, saying that Iran, as the OIC chairman, is against any
unilateral military actions against a Muslim country and believes
that peace and security in the region should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
He accused the U.S. of violating international norms by
insisting on military option despite worldwide opposition, saying
the U.S. is trying to turn its internal crisis to a military
confrontation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister pointed out that another reason behind the
U.S. insistence on unilateral muscle-flexing was to divert public
attention from the failure of recent Washington talks between
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Israeli and Palestinian leaders on
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
He stated that Iran would cautiously monitor the developments
in the region and would defend against any possible aggression.
</P>
<P>
"Iran will not tolerate any violation of its airspace and
sovereignty and will give strong reaction to any possible
aggression," he said, adding the possible U.S. military attack
would have serious impacts on Iran and would force more Iraqi
refugees to flood in.
</P>
<P>
However, he voiced Iran's readiness to accept new Iraqi
refugees in case of U.S. military attack.

<HEADLINE> US Strike Against World Norms: Iranian Speaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Majlis (Parliament)
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq Nouri said Saturday night the possible
U.S. military strike on Iraq runs counter to international norms,
practices and codes, the Iranian official news agency IRNA
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from a five-day visit to Syria and Lebanon,
Nouri said the two countries shared common views with Iran over
the issues of the region, the threat of the U.S. against Iraq in
particular.
</P>
<P>
All the three believe the U.S. threat against Iraq is not
within the international norms, practices and codes and will
disrupt the tranquillity and stability of the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran has expressed grave concern over possible U.S. military
attacks on Iraq, and called on the international community and
regional countries to continue diplomatic efforts to avoid
military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said Sunday at a press
conference here that Iran would cautiously monitor the
developments in the region and would defend against any possible
aggression.
</P>
<P>
Nouri stressed that international norms would not allow a
country to take military measures against another nation
unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed concern over military cooperation between
Turkey and Israel, saying that Iran, Syria and Lebanon, like other
Muslim nations, could not remain indifference to the war games and
military treaties between Turkey and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Nouri's visit to Syria and Lebanon was aimed to coordinate
stances with their leaders over the stalled Middle East peace
process and current Iraqi crisis.

<HEADLINE> Another Tremor Jolts Northern Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Aftershocks jolted northeast
Afghanistan before dawn Sunday, crumbling more villages as aid
agencies struggled to reach thousands of victims of an earthquake
that left up to 4,450 dead, said reports reaching here from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
A Red Cross plane laden with emergency supplies flew Sunday
morning from the Afghan capital to Takhor province, 240 km to the
north, but it may have to turn back if the airstrip closest to the
quake site was damaged by the tremors, the reports quoted Red
Cross officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday night, the first quake measuring 6.1 on the
Richter scale struck Takhor province's isolated Rustaq district,
nestled at the junction of the Hindu Kush and Pamir mountain
ranges, damaging or destroying a dozen villages.
</P>
<P>
Four move villages were crumbled when tremors rocked the area
Saturday night and again at 4 a.m. Sunday, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Tell King Hussein of Mossad Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Israel is to provide
Jordan's King Hussein a report on the probe into the botched
assassination of Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal in Jordan, The
Jerusalem Post newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Ciechanover Committee in charge of investigating the
Mashaal affair is expected to finish compiling its final report
within two weeks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The committee was appointed following the failed attempt last
September to kill Mashaal, a Hamas political leader, in Jordan's
capital Amman by two hit men sent by Israel's secret service
Mossad.
</P>
<P>
The incident had damaging effects on Israeli relations with
Jordan and Canada, which voiced protest over the use of forged
Canadian passports by Mossad agents in the operation.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources close to the investigation as saying
the final report will have harsh words on the decision-making
process in the attack. But the committee will not draw conclusions
on Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's controversial role in the
case.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has been held by opposition politicians responsible
for the operation and its damages caused to the country. Earlier
reports said even Army Chief of Staff Lipkin Shahak was not
informed beforehand of the assassination plan.
</P>
<P>
The final report compiled by the committee is to be divided
into three sections: the decision-making process, the operation in
Amman, and conclusions as well as recommendations. The report will
be released after being presented to Netanyahu and the cabinet,
which will be asked to adopt the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein is to receive a detailed version of the report,
including the section on lessons to be learned. Israel has
promised that Mossad would no longer operate in Jordan following
the Mashaal affair.
</P>
<P>
This is another Israeli effort to remedy the shattered
relations with Jordan, the only close friend of Israel among the
hostile Arab neighbors.

<HEADLINE> AL to Submit Arab Plan to Defuse Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said Sunday the situation over
U.N. arms inspection in Iraq "is still hot" and the Arab countries
are coming up with a plan to defuse the crisis.
</P>
<P>
After a one-hour meeting with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak,
the AL chief told reporters that his organization is to submit a
"draft resolution" to the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution was worked out in response to Mubarak's
initiative and following close consultations with 14 Arab leaders
as well as mediators from Russia, France and Turkey, he explained.
</P>
<P>
He refused to disclose the content of the draft, saying it was
trying "to find conditions to get U.N. inspectors into Iraqi
presidential sites" suspected of holding prohibited weapons.
</P>
<P>
The past several days have witnessed intense international
diplomatic efforts to find a peaceful way out of the
Iraq-U.S. standoff over weapons inspections and avert a possible
U.S. military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Washington has beefed up military buildup in the Gulf and
heightened its threat of use of force to wrestle out Iraqi
compliance should diplomatic means fail to produce results
satisfactory to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid began his four-day mission to Baghdad on
Wednesday. He briefed Mubarak on his talks with Iraqi leaders,
Russian and French envoys, and Arab ambassadors there, saying Arab
countries' mediation efforts are still underway.
</P>
<P>
"Most Arab countries insist on diplomatic solution to the
crisis," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"President Saddam Hussein had said that he was willing to
cooperate with the Arab League in all that serves Arab interests"
and agreed to set free all non-Iraqi Arab prisoners, including
Kuwaitis, in a good-will gesture, said the AL chief.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has been refusing U.N. arms inspectors access to
presidential palaces on grounds of sovereignty and national
security, which triggered off the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors must certify that Iraq has eliminated all
weapons of mass destruction before the Security Council can order
the lifting of crippling economic sanctions, imposed after
Saddam's troops stormed into Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused the U.S. of trying the block the removal of
embargo and prolonging the suffering of the Iraqi people.

<P>
KAMPALA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaria has killed 328 people
in south-western Uganda, a local medical official said.
</P>
<P>
Justus B. Katungu, Kabale District's Medical Officer said the
problem was caused by the prolonged rainy season from late last
November up to now and poor hyigene in the district.
</P>
<P>
Mosquitoes propagated in billions due to poor drainage and
sewerage systems and bushes around households in many resident
points, especially the trading centers, Katungu said when
speaking to health officials of Kabale District.
</P>
<P>
Local paper The Monitor today quoted Katungu as saying that in
order to prevent the spsread of the disease, the medical
authorities will try to educate people on hygiene and dredge
drainage for stagnant water and cut bush around households.
</P>
<P>
A team of medical experts with malaria drugs will soon be
dispatched to the affected areas, Katungu said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 34,000 people who have suffered malaria in Kabale
District, only 386 have access to medical treatment, he
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Another epidemic caused by the recent rainy weather is
cholera, which has invaded to 26 of the 45 districts in the
country and killed more than 400 people.

<HEADLINE> S. African Minister Ordered to Pay One Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Industrial
Court has ordered Labor Minister Tito Mboweni to pay an employee
more than one million Rand (200,000 U.S. Dollars) for violating
labor laws, local daily Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The Pretoria-based court ruled earlier this week that Mboweni
and his director general Sipho Pityana had committed an unfair
labor practice by not consulting an employee, Hans Schoemann,
about his impending retrenchment, the report said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Judicial experts described as "scandalous" the way in which
Mboweni and the Labor Department had ignored the basic principles
of labor legislation, saying the case was a "timely reminder'
that even the government must obey the law.
</P>
<P>
"This is the department which tells other employers how to
conduct their labor relations, and yet it does not have the
faintest idea of what is required when it comes to its own
employees," Phillip van Zyl, a senior member of the court, said.
</P>
<P>
Schoemann sued the Labor Department after repeatedly trying to
find out what the government planned to do with his post as the
Industrial Court was being phased out.
</P>
<P>
The court judgement revealed that Mboweni and Pityana did not
observe even the most fundamental labor relations requirement
which calls for consultation with someone who is in line for
retrenchment.
</P>
<P>
Alan Rycroft, Natal University's dean of law, said there was
no excuse for the state not to have followed widely accepted
retrenchment procedures.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Filipinos Caught in Financial Storm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Isagani Onato, 27, was an
elevator attendant in a building in Manila. Last Friday, when he
went to work in the morning as usual, he was told that he had been
laid off due to the financial storm pounding the country.
</P>
<P>
Terribly distressed, Onato murmured: "I was fired. How could my
family live through such a difficult period after I lose my job?
I've no idea!"
</P>
<P>
So far more than 10,000 people like Onato have joined the
country's massive army of the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
Since July last year, the financial storm has swept the
Philippines for more than seven months. The country's currency,
the peso, has lost half of its value and affected almost every one
and every industry.
</P>
<P>
A woman manager at the supermarket Shoemart told her struggle
in the crisis. The lady, dealing in imported electronic products,
said she didn't raise prices immediately after the peso began
falling, in hopes that the peso would soon stabilize.
</P>
<P>
Surprisingly, the storm did not come to an end as quickly as
expected. In October, she hiked the prices, but clients coming to
her shop dwindled. Checking the account book at the end of the
year, she found she lost at least 20 percent of business.
</P>
<P>
However, her loss was smaller compared with other
entrepreneurs. After the peso devaluated, interest rates soared in
the country. Many entrepreneurs, especially small and medium-sized
business owners, feared or failed to get credits. Some of them had
to reduce production or just close their businesses.
</P>
<P>
Victoria, the Philippines' century-old candy factory, has gone
bankrupt. Twenty-one companies had applied for moratoria for loans
payment. Petron, Shell and Calitex, the three major players in the
oil industry, each reported a loss of hundreds of millions of
pesos, while the sales of Toyota, Honda and Nissan (Philippine)
corporations declined by 30 percent respectively. The managers of
these companies said they would increase the prices this year.
</P>
<P>
Of course, there are also lucky ones in the meltdown. Mary Ann,
a furniture shop owner in China Town, said that since all her
furniture pieces were locally made and in a great demand, she did
not suffer a lot. She said her profit last year was almost the
same as in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Whenever the peso depreciated, a long queue would appear before
the dollar-to-peso changing counter in Shoemart. People holding
dollars in hands all beamed with satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
A woman in her 50s said that her son works abroad as an
overseas contract worker. She changed the dollars he mailed back
into more pesos and bought a refrigerator and a karaoke machine
last Christmas. she said her neighbors all envied her very much.
But when told that South Korea and Malaysia had begun to expel
Philippine workers, the smile on her face suddenly disappeared.
</P>
<P>
After the peso fell, prices climbed up, but the local people
said their daily life was not affected as much as expected. In a
China Town grocery shop, although the prices of some imported
foods went up by 25 percent, clients were still calmly choosing
their favorites. The shop manager explained that most clients
coming here are well paid, so the price hikes are not a problem to
them.
</P>
<P>
Vendors outside the shop or the poor living in shanty areas not
far away said they never bought things from the shop. Prices of
local vegetables and basic commodities have risen little, they
said, their life is almost as usual as before.
</P>
<P>
During the past few months, the Philippine government have
taken various measures to stabilize the financial situation.
People in all walks of life voice support to the government.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 women including business executives, TV
commentators and university professors recently went together to
sell dollars to the central bank. The Filipino-Chinese Commerce
Chamber ran a full-page advertisement on major newspapers, calling
on all Filipinos to help the government weather the crisis. These
two groups expressed the common hope to the media that the crisis
would be over as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> 11 Criminals Escape from Lusaka Police Cells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Eleven dangerous criminals have
broken out of the Lusaka central police cells and are on the run,
Sunday Times of Zambia reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Three police officers have been arrested for allegedly
facilitating the escape, according to the local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The three officers, who were on duty when the incident
happened last week, have since been put in custody to "help with
investigations" over the escape, Police Public Relations Officer
Beenwell Chimfwembe said.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, of the 11, seven were facing charges
of aggravated robbery while the remaining four were faced with
various charges ranging from theft of motor vehicles, assaults to
illegal possession of firearms.
</P>
<P>
And the police have mounted an intensive search for the 11
criminals.
</P>
<P>

robberies of motor cars on roads, and of house properties like TV
sets and radios. Some of the cases occur in day time.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Calls for Emergency GCC Meeting: Reports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait has called for an
emergency foreign ministers' meeting of the Gulf states to discuss
the developments of the situation amidst mounting possibility of a
U.S. military strike against Iraq, local media reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Arab Times quoted informed sources as saying the
meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) is expected to take
place this week in order to coordinate positions towards the
Iraq-U.S. standoff over arms inspections and possible consequences.
</P>
<P>
GCC, which was established in 1981 as a regional political and
economic organization, groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Minister of Cabinet Affairs Abdul Aziz Dakhil
Al-Dakhil has delivered letters from Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber
Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah to the Gulf leaders on the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Kuwait believes that countries that have been
involved in efforts to achieve a diplomatic solution to the
crisis are becoming frustrated as little results have been
brought about.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said Kuwait would bear the brunt of a possible
Iraqi retaliatory attack if the U.S. launches a military strike
against Iraq in case of a failure of the diplomatic efforts to end
the crisis. Kuwait is a close ally of the U.S. which led allied
forces to liberate Kuwait from a seven-month Iraqi occupation in
the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
A military strike this time will be very effective and
substantial and will be carried out by planes and cruise missiles
which are stationed aboard warships in the Gulf, the informed
sources said.
</P>
<P>
Military analysts said earlier that out of desperation, Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein may fire some ballistic missiles if he
still has any.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has put its small armed forces on full alert and Defense
Minister Sheikh Salem Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah Saturday authorized
the army chief of staff to call up the reserve forces.
</P>
<P>
Gas masks would be available on the local market in two days,
said Kuwaiti Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
Al-Abdullah Al-Sabah Saturday after a nine-hour parliamentary
emergency meeting to discuss details of the government's
contingency plan in the event of war.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa has appealed to international donors to help
repair the country's communication systems which have been
severely damaged by floods since last December.
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation of hinterland highways and the central railway
may cost a total of 45 million US Dollars, Mkapa told a group of
ambassadors and representatives of international organizations at
the State House on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa described the damages as "colossal" because the
government revenue has been greatly affected by the immense
impact of the floods on the movement of goods and trade with
neighboring countries, according to a report by today's "Sunday
News".
</P>
<P>
One day before the meeting, the envoys were arranged to get a
bird's-eye view of the flood-hit areas.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the president also renewed his appeal to donor
countries and international bodies to set up a Multilateral Debt
Fund for Tanzania to help the east African country undergo reforms
and develop education.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. special envoy Jesse
Jackson is scheduled to pay a two-day visit to Kenya beginning
from Sunday to hold talks with government officials and grassroots
group leaders.
</P>
<P>
Jackson who is President Clinton's special envoy for the
promotion of democracy in Africa will also visit the Democratic
Republic of Congo and Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for Africa, he was quoted by the press in
the U.S. as saying that "there are some real problems we must
address in Kenya, Liberia and the Congo".
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, Jackson said, he will urge President Daniel
arap Moi to "use the weight of his office to quell" the political
violence which has rocked parts of the Rift Valley Province and
claimed more than 100 lives during the past one month.
</P>
<P>
He will also urge the Kenyan government "to use its resources
to meaningfully address the tremendous poverty in the country",
he said.
</P>
<P>
During his last visit to Kenya last December, the civil rights
activist paid a visit to Nairobi slums.
</P>
<P>
Part of his current itinerary is reported to visit the
violence-hit parts of Nakuru District where he will address a public
meeting in Nakuru, about 165 kilometers northwest of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.S. Information Agency report, in Congo,
Jackson will urge for a lifting of the ban on political party
activities and urge President Laurent Kabila to move quickly
toward democratic institutions.
</P>
<P>
In Liberia, a traditionally close U.S. friend, he will also
urge President Charles Taylor to use the strength of his office
to end political violence in that country.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that what Jackson will stress during his
tour of all three African countries is "the end of violence and
the enforcement of human rights as a key to attracting capital
for investment and thus enhancing sustainable economic growth."

SHANGHAI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Electric Group,
China's largest manufacturer of power generating equipment,
produced such equipment in 1997 with a total generating capacity
of five million kilowatts, a record high, industrial sources here
said.
</P>
<P>
The group has become the fourth largest producer of thermal
power generating units in the world next to those in the US, Japan
and France, and its business volume reached 10 billion yuan in
1997, up 30 percent over 1996, and has become the country's
leading manufacturer and exporter of power generating equipment.
</P>
<P>
The firm now produces a wide variety of products ranging from
equipment for hydro-power stations to nuclear power stations. Its
output accounts for 50 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
During the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), the
firm invested a total of 700 million yuan in technical upgrading
efforts and helped develop several hundred high-tech products.
</P>
<P>
In the Ninth Five-Year Plan period beginning 1996, the group
has moved up to its world counterparts in designing and
manufacturing million-kw-class thermal and nuclear power
generating units through establishing Sino-overseas joint venture
projects.
</P>
<P>
The firm is currently producing power-generating equipment for
the second phase project of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station in
the neighboring province of Zhejiang.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai designed and manufactured China's first thermal power
generating unit and its first water-cooled turbo-generating unit.

<HEADLINE> More Bodies Retrieved at Philippine Plane Crash Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Philippine rescuers Saturday
morning airlifted 30 more cadaver bags of human bodies from the
crash site of a Cebu Pacific aircraft in Mt. Sumagaya, Mindanao,
and forensic experts started matching body parts for
identification.
</P>
<P>
The official Philippine New Agency quoted Jesus Dureza, head of
the Presidential Action Center (PAC) in Cagayan de Oro, a Southern
city near Mt. Sumagaya, as saying the cadaver bags are composed of
body parts consisting mostly of hands with complete or incomplete
fingers which are now ready for matching.
</P>
<P>
"We have improvised the hangar owned by the National Power
Corporation in Lumbia airport into a mortuary laboratory, where 30
forensic experts are on hand to undergo the segregation and
identification of body parts," Dureza said.
</P>
<P>
As the bodies are badly mutilated, it is impossible to tell how
many of the 99 passengers and five crew members aboard the Cebu
Pacific Air Flight 387 have been recovered.
</P>
<P>
Dureza said relatives of the victims shall immediately be
informed once the experts are already "100 percent" sure about the
identification of the victims.
</P>
<P>
He said search and rescue operations will continue at the crash
site until the area is cleared and until the retrieval of the
"black box" which contains important data within the last 30
minutes before the crash occurred.
</P>
<P>
The Dc-9 passenger plane crashed Monday morning on its way from
the Philippine capital of Manila to Cagayan de Oro city on the
southern Island of Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Experts said there are two black boxes on the aircraft: one,
the Cockpit Voice Recorder (CVR) which records the pilot
conversations and, the other, the Flight Data Recorder (FDR) which
records the condition of the aircraft before its crash.
</P>
<P>
Both instruments can help piece together possible causes of the
aircraft's failure, they said.
</P>
<P>
Rescue operations have often been hampered by bad weather in
the mountain area in the past six days. No one can tell when the
operations could end.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers have already found some parts of the plane and about
40 bags of dismembered bodies, which were littered around the
crash site with some hanging on tree branches and others sticking
on trunks of giant woods.

<HEADLINE> Rebagliati Wins Men's Snowboarding Giant Slalom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Ross Rebagliati of Canada
chalked up the first snowboarding title in Winter Olympics here Sunday
afternoon with a victory in the men's giant slalom race.
</P>
<P>
Snowboarding in heavy snow and thick fog, the Canadian was timed
two minutes 3.96 seconds from two runs weather
conditions before his second and final descent.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Prugger , who was timed 59.38 seconds and 1:04.60
from two runs, was second at 2:03.98 and Ueli Kestenholz of
Switzerland finished third at 2:04.08 from 1:00.20 and 1:03.88 from
two runs.
</P>
<P>
The second race was postponed for several minutes after the fifth
competitor had completed the course, due to a think haze of snow which
fell upon Mt. Yakebitai. The worsened weather conditions resulted in
significantly slower times than in the first sun as snow fell.
</P>
<P>
"I am so happy for gold. I've been thinking about this for the past
few years, ever since we found out I was going to come to the
Olympics," Rebagliati said.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian is a big name among boarding fans. In the year 1994,
he won the event at the U.S. open tournament and European Giant Slalom
Championships.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian kept cool after victory. He said his win would not
change his life.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still gonna be the same person, maybe I won't have to worry
about getting all the movie channels on my TV now, things like that,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"I am not gonna change. I'm still the same guy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Snowboarding is making its deput at the winter Olympics with two
disciplines on offer -- the Halfpipe and the giant slalom.
</P>
<P>
The sport began in the United States in the late 1960s and early
1970s when its founders tied skis together to create a "winter
surfboard".

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Russia to Further Bring Down Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
has vowed to further a "responsible" micro-economic policy this
year to defuse inflationary pressures and lower risks for credit
and investment.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Italian newspaper Corriere Della Sera that
was also carried Saturday by the Interfax news agency, Yeltsin
said fundamental changes had taken place in Russia's economy in
the past year.
</P>
<P>
Russia's gross domestic product (GDP) increased by 0.5 percent
last year with an industrial growth of 1.8 percent, and the
country's inflation was down by 11 percent, said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign direct investment increased by 70 percent to
4 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, Yeltsin said Russia still faced some economic
setbacks, adding that the country will continue to adopt current
economic reform guidelines to further push ahead economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president went on to say that Russia will create a
favorable environment to attract more overseas investment.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Severe cold spells will continue
to strike Vietnam's northern and central areas next week, the
National Meteorological Centre warns Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the centre, the severe cold spells will not abate
until mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, an unexpected 12-day cold spell so affected the
northern and central provinces that it brought the average
temperature down to 10 to 11 degrees celcius.
</P>
<P>
Low temperatures of 5 to 7 degrees celcius have been recorded
by the centre in the northern mountainous areas, 9 to 11 degrees
in the river deltas and 12 to 14 degrees along the central coast.
</P>
<P>
The cold spell has caused light rain and drizzle in Vietnam's
northern and central provinces.
</P>
<P>
Light rain during the cold period has lessened the impact of
droughts which have strikened the province of Quang Ngai to the
north.
</P>
<P>
In the central highlands, rainfall decreased 80 to 90 percent
from the average rainfall recorded there in previous years. Some
provinces in the north and the central completely lacked rain last
month. They haven't had any rain this month.

<HEADLINE> Diplomatic Solution to Iraqi Issue First Priority: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said Sunday the first priority to the Iraqi issue is a
diplomatic solution, and Australia will decide Tuesday whether it
would join the United States and Britain in any attack on Iraq,
the Australian Associated Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
"Our first priority, and it is something both President Clinton
and I emphasized in our discussions yesterday, is a diplomatic
solution," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard confirmed Saturday that United States President Bill
Clinton had asked him for some form of assistance from Australia
in the event of renewed conflict with Iraq, the Canberra Times
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We will intensify, renew and redouble our own diplomatic
efforts to press upon the Iraqi government and the Iraqi
leadership the folly, the ill-wisdom, the damage to their own
population of the course that is now being followed," the prime
minister was quoted by AAP as telling reporters during a midday
doorstop interview in Sydney Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said he had been encouraged by the support shown by Kim
Beazley, leader of Australian major opposition party, the Labor
Party, who shared his earnest hope that military action could be
averted.
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister hinted Australia would support the
United States, but not necessarily military one.
</P>
<P>
Australia should listen when its most important ally, the
United States, requested assistance in such an important area as
world peace, Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Howard would not speculate on what type of help Australia might
provide in response to Saturday's request from Clinton, but he
said it need not be military.
</P>
<P>
The decision of whether Australia would provide the United
States the unspecified assistance would be made by cabinet
Tuesday, he said.
</P>
<P>
He had met with defense chiefs Friday and would do so again
Monday to consider a "wide range of possibilities".
</P>
<P>
Australia in 1991 complied with a U.S. request by sending two
frigates and a supply vessel to the Gulf area, but they were not
directly involved in fighting.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Network Seven, a local Television,
Saturday, Howard indicated that any Australian assistance in the
event of further conflict might follow the 1991 pattern by
stating: "we also have to consider a whole range of contributions,
it's not only a purely military contribution."

<P>
COLOMBO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka has allocated 1
million rupees (16,129 U.S. dollars) to conduct women training
programs this year, Women's Affairs Minister Hema Ratnayake said
Sunday.
</P>

Ratnayake admitted the allocation from this year's budget for
her ministry was far from enough.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is trying to obtain assistance from the United
Nations Development Fund, the Canadian Development Fund and other
government organizations or non-governmental organizations to
implement its future programs for women.
</P>
<P>
Ratnayake said her ministry is also planning to carry out other
projects such as child abuse eradication and construction of

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The National Gem and Jewelry
Authority (NGAJA) of Sri Lanka has taken steps to make insurance
compulsory for gem miners, NGAJA Director General P.G.R.
Dharmaratne said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He said the move was to ensure safety and confidence among the
mining communities of the country.
</P>
<P>
He noted that annual licenses that issued for gem mining would
not get renewed in the future if the holders could not produce
insurance contracts with insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The director general said about 100,000 gem miners in the
nation will be insured by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the owners of gem mines have asked the NGAJA to
introduce an insurance scheme for them for many years, Dharmaratne
added.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 200 miners have signed insurance contracts
with the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd., the country's most
important insurance company.

<HEADLINE> Value of Homes Up 8 Percent in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The value of homes in
California rose more than 8 percent in 1997 thanks to the recovery
of the state's real estate market.
</P>
<P>
As shown by a survey released Saturday, California's 7 million
homes were worth 1.398 trillion U.S. dollars by the end of 1997,
up 8.2 percent from 1.292 trillion dollars a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The recovery added 106 billion dollars to the value, said the
survey by Acxiom/DataQuick Information Systems. And it will boost
homeowners' equity and help spark a surge in refinancing activity.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts say the main reason behind the hike of value
has been the rising real estate prices, which added about 10
billion dollars a month to houses and condominiums on the market.
</P>
<P>
But the gain from the recovery still leave the value of
Californian homes below their all-time high of 1.423 trillion
dollars reached in 1990, but up from the recent low of 1.256
trillion in 1995 after several years of property value declines.
</P>
<P>
Acxiom/DataQuick reached the figures by conducting a computer
appraisal of every home in California and adding up the total.
</P>
<P>
The survey included all properties the state tax assessors
designated as houses or condominiums. Newly built homes that have
not been sold were not included.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAGANO, Japan, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Olga Danilova has always been
dreaming of an Olympic gold medal, but she never thought her dream
would come in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
In the women's cross country skiing 15km classic race, Danilova
clocked 46 minutes and 55.4 seconds to win the first gold of the
Olympics, outpacing pre-race favourites her compatriot Elena Vaelbe
and Italian Stefania Belmondo.
</P>
<P>
Danilova, who began skiing in the year 1982, almost missed the
chance for the Olympics when she risked disqualification during the
relay at Thunder Bay in 1995 by going the wrong way in a curve.
</P>
<P>
The Russian skier, mother of two, had trained hard to become an
Olympic champion.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't know I would (become a gold medalist), but I was training
and getting ready for this," the 27-year-old said.
</P>
<P>
After winning the first gold, her thought were back home with her
two-year-old twins.
</P>
<P>
"It has been a long time since I've seen my boys. I don't know how
long it has been since I've seen them, " she became glassy-eyed and
could not continue to speak.
</P>
<P>
Danilova took only three-and-a-half months off after giving birth
before returning to train with the Russian national team.
</P>
<P>
The sport of cross country skiing almost lost a new queen when
Danilova was at cross-road to decide whether to continue in skiing
race eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
"I had to decide whether to drop out (of ski racing) or plunge
myself into sport when I was 20," she said. "My coaches helped to
convince me to continue."

CARACAS, February 7 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan basket of crudes
for export was quoted at 12.60 U.S. dollars per barrel Friday, 15
cents up from Thursday but down from the January average.

further down to 13.01 dollars per barrel for the entire year.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Search and rescue operations at
the crash site of a Cebu Pacific aircraft in Mt. Sumagaya,
Mindanao, entered its seventh day Sunday, as work was at a snail's
pace in the previous days due to rains and fog in the mountain
areas.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Cagayan de Oro near Mt. Sumagaya said the
airlifting of the body bags stopped at 17:00 Saturday because of
cloudy weather.
</P>
<P>
By Saturday, 13 cadaver bags had been delivered to Cagayan de
Oro city, Mindanao, for forensic examination. As the bodies were
badly mutilated, it was impossible to tell how many of the 99
passengers and five crew members have found, rescuers said.
</P>
<P>
The National Bureau of Investigation Saturday added the number
of forensic experts from 13 to 30 to undertake a methodical
process of identifying the body parts.
</P>
<P>
Recovering the remains of the victims may take longer time
because a landslide caused by the impact of the plane has buried
most of the passengers and a huge chunk of the plane. The digging
began Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The DC-9 plane crashed Monday morning on its way from Manila to
Cagayan de Oro, Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
The local press quoted aviation officials as saying that pilot
error in landing the Cebu Pacific Air Flight 387 may have caused
the worst air disaster in the Philippine history.
</P>
<P>
"There is an indication the pilot descended too fast, but we
still have to verify this," Air Transportation Office chief Carlos
Tanega said.
</P>
<P>
But other reports said that the plane was flying an unregulated
route that had not been used by commercial planes in at least five
years.
</P>
<P>
American aircraft investigators are looking for the flight data
recorder and key cockpit instruments in order to determine the
cause of the disaster.

<HEADLINE> Bank Stresses Enterprises Efficiency in Issuing Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The country's first national
shareholding commercial bank, the Shanghai-based Bank of
Communications, is forging ahead by focusing on profit-making and
risk control, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
President of the bank Wang Mingquan said that his bank will
make the economic efficiency of enterprises, rather than their
size or ownership form, the major criterion in issuing loans and
exploring the banking market this year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the bank will also pay more attention to
profitable medium-sized and small firms in addition to large
companies, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
However, Wang noted, priority will be given to basic, pillar and
high-tech industries and to those competitive enterprises with
products having market potential.
</P>
<P>
The bank reaped 4.784 billion yuan (about 576 million US
dollars) in profits in 1997, ranking the first among domestic
banks in terms of per capita earnings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the bank also decided to pay more attention to the
improvement of its internal management system and warding off
operational risks this year.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the bank has drafted nine sets of regulations to
ban activities including presenting fake accounts and invoices and
engaging in dealings on stock and futures markets at home and
abroad.
</P>
<P>
The bank will also take more steps in intensifying inspection
of the performance of its branches, checking its asset-liability
index and clearing non-performing loans.

held off a powerful Norwegian delegation and her favoured teammates in
winning the first gold medal of the 18th Olympic Winter Games with a
victory in the women's cross country skiing 15km classic race Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
Amid mostly clear skies but humid and warm temperatures, the
27-year-old Danilova won in a time of 46 minutes and 55.4 seconds.
</P>
<P>
She finished 5.6 seconds ahead of compatriot Larissa Lazutina, and
57.2 seconds clear of Norway's Anita Moen-Gruidon. Lazutina clocked
47:01.0 and Moen-Guidon 47:52.6.
</P>
<P>
Moen-Gruidon, frustrated by a number of fourth place finishes in
international competitions, was joyful for the third place.
</P>
<P>
"At last, I've got a medal," she said.
</P>
<P>
In capturing her first Olympic gold, Danilova outpaced several
Norwegians, including fifth-place finisher Marit Mikkelsplas, and
Bente Martinsen, and Trude Dybendahl-Hartz, who tied for sixth.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Irina Taranenko Terelia finished just out of medals in
fourth place at 48:10.2.
</P>
<P>
Starting at the 29th place, Danilova was seventh at the 1.8km point
and jumped to the second after 8.5 kilometers, 2.8 seconds behind
Lazutina.
</P>
<P>
Danilova, mother of two, had a strong race in the second half of
the distance.
</P>
<P>
After she finished the race, it began to snow heavilly on the
mountain.
</P>
<P>
To win an Olympic medal has been long-time dream for Danilova. "I
am very happy," she said at the finishing line.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, she could not keep from missing her two-year-old
twins. "It has been a long time since I've seen my boys. I don't know
how long it has been since I've seen them," she said, with tears in
eyes.
</P>
<P>
The win for the Russian is not only a dream that come true, but
signals a change at the top of a strong Russian team.
</P>
<P>
Five-time overall World Cup champion Elena Vaelba -- still drought
of an individual Olympic gold medal -- finished a disappointing 17th
in the race.

BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has expressed its
support to Thailand's latest efforts to bring the two Cambodian
rivals together for talks in a bid to ease their feud, a senior
Thai official said Saturday.

<P>
Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, who made a brief
stopover here Saturday, threw support to Thailand's move to hold a
meeting between Second Prime Minister Hun Sen and Prince Norodom
Ranariddh in Bangkok, according to Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan.
</P>
<P>
Surin held talks on the Cambodian issue with Ali Alatas, who
was on his way from Sri Lanka to Bangladesh, and it was part of
Thailand's efforts to get support from partners of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to break the impasse in
Cambodia, local newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Surin is also expected to meet Philippine Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon soon for talks on the Cambodian issue, the

Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines currently form ASEAN's
mediating team on the Cambodian issue and the foreign ministers of
the three nations are expected to meet within this month to

elections in July.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN currently groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. The
group delayed membership for Cambodia due to the conflict last

BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's economic turmoil has
led to an indefinite suspension of a project to build the first
railway line in Laos due to lack of funding, according to a local
press report Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Laos had hoped to get a 700-million-baht loan from the Thai
government and an investment of 12-million-U.S.-dollars lion from
a Thai firm, Pacific Transportation Co., so as to have a
17-kilometer railway line built from Vientiane across the Mekong
river on the Thai-Lao Friendship Bridge to northeastern Thailand's
province of Nong Khai.
</P>
<P>
However, the Thai government can not fund the project now due
to its own financial trouble.
</P>
<P>
The lack of funding also prevents Pacific Transportation from
meeting its commitment to setting up Lao Railways Transportation
Corp. (LRT) with the Lao government holding a 25 percent stake.
</P>
<P>
The joint venture is to oversee the construction of a
1,000-kilometer Lao railway network, with the Vientiane-Nong Khai

reported pledge of the United States to help the three Baltic
countries join NATO.

"Let me emphasize once again that this scenario has been and
remains unacceptable to Russia," Yeltsin was quoted by interfax

<P>
Liu Jianguo, an employee with a vegetable company in Shuozhou

<HEADLINE> Thailand Seeks Help From Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has asked Britain,
Belgium and Italy to lobby the European Union (EU) for an
extension of low import duties for Thai products, and a special
quota for shrimps.
</P>
<P>
The three countries, which are among 15 EU members, had
accepted the request, according to Thai Deputy Foreign Minister
Sukhumbhand Paribatra who just concluded a visit to Europe.
</P>
<P>
Italy would raise the matter in EU meetings, Sukhumbhand was
quoted Sunday by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
Starting next January, the EU will end low import taxes for
Thai products under the Generalized System of Preferences on the
grounds of Thailand's improving economic performance after a
decade of double-digit growth.
</P>
<P>
The GSP is the EU's aid scheme aimed at helping developing and
less developed nations to gain easier access to the European
market.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has been trying to convince the European grouping to
postpone the withdrawal of the trading privileges, especially in
time of economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Frozen shrimps are a major export to Europe that would be
severely affected by the withdrawal, and Thailand wants the EU to
consider a special quota with import taxes lower than what is
normally charged for the product to help shrimps exporters and
breeders.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 8 (Xinhua) -- The exhibition department of
the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT)
is readying plans to assist Chinese firms to expand their shares
of the international market.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted a division chief of the exhibition
department as saying that stress will be put on helping Chinese
firms to boost machinery, electronic and high-tech exports, improve
the country's central and western regions' trade relations with
foreign countries and help Chinese firms to diversify their export
markets.
</P>
<P>
China is the world's leading exporter of textiles and light
industry products due to its law labor costs and cheap raw
materials. It is now encouraging exports of machinery, electronic
and high-tech products in pursuit of high value-added earnings,
the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
CCPIT's exhibition department also helps firms from the
country's central and western regions to expand their business
relations with foreign countries by means of overseas exhibitions,
which provide golden opportunities to get acquainted with the
foreign market, the paper quoted the source from the CCPIT as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Records External Trade Surplus in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia registered a
surplus in its balance of trade in 1997 after being in deficit for
three consecutive years since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Exports and imports in the year under review expanded at an
annual rate of 12.4 percent to 221.4 billion ringgit ( 57.5
billion U.S. dollars) and 12.0 percent to 221.0 billion ringgit
(57.4 billion dollars) respectively, leaving a surplus of 400
million ringgit (103.9 million dollars), according to official
external trade figures.
</P>
<P>
If trade in lumpy items -- aircraft and ships/tankers including
 accessories -- amounting to 8.5 billion ringgit (2.2 billion
dollars) in imports and 3.1 billion ringgit (805.2 million
dollars) in re-exports was excluded, the 1997 trade surplus would
have amounted to 5.8 billion ringgit (1.5 billion dollars), the
Statistics Department said while releasing the December external
trade figures Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's trade deficit in 1994 amounted to 1.99 billion
ringgit (516.9 million dollars at the present rate), which
increased to 9.36 billion ringgit (2.43 billion dollars) in 1995,
but narrowed to a deficit of 253.651 million ringgit (65.88
million dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The export performance of manufactured goods and articles for
the whole of 1997 continued its strong growth while primary
commodities showed a rather mixed performance, the Statistics
Department said.
</P>
<P>
Electrical and electronic products, Malaysia's largest export
earner, netted receipts amounting to 112.3 billion ringgit (29.17
billion dollars) or 50.7 percent of total export earnings in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Palm oil, earning 10.8 billion ringgit (2.8 billion dollars) in
the year under review against 9.4 billion ringgit (2.44 billion
dollars in 1996, constituted 4.9 percent of total exports and
retained itself as the second largest revenue earner in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan and Singapore remained Malaysia's
major trading partners by collectively accounting for 51.5 percent
of Malaysia's total trade in 1997.

<HEADLINE> El Nino Blamed for Rise of Cholera Cases in Peru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- El Nino, the unusually warm ocean
current leading to abnormal climatic patterns, may behind an
increase of cholera cases in Peru, an official said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,084 new cholera cases have been registered in this
South American country this year, said Ana Adrianzen, director of
the Health Ministry's Epidemiological Vigilance.
</P>
<P>
The figure, the epidemiologist was quoted as saying by press
reports here Saturday, is very close to that of entire 1997, when
a cholera outbreak affected 3,488 persons.
</P>
<P>
The increase may be a result of El Nino, which leads to
temperature rises friendly to germs.
</P>
<P>
Another disease that may become an epidemic is malignant
malaria, a deadly infection that attacked, in the year's first
month alone, 3,069 Peruvians.
</P>
<P>
To prevent the increase of contagious diseases, Adrianzen said,
new cases are reported every day to the Health Ministry through
4,000 clinics nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In northern Peru, samples of blood and secretions of children
who have high fever are analyzed to determine what is producing
the symptom, she said.

<HEADLINE> Survey: German Firms in China Satisfied with Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- Most German-funded businesses
in China are satisfied with their business and are willing to
increase their investment, according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by Roland Berger &AMP; Partner GmbH
International, a respected German consulting firm, covered 134
German-funded businesses and 65 representative offices in
China. The German businesses, most of which have operated for
three-to-five years, have invested a total of 1.33 billion
U.S. dollars in China, accounting for more than half of Germany's
total investment in China.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the businesses surveyed said they were
satisfied or very satisfied with their overall business in China,
with 94 percent saying that they would continue to choose China
for investment if they made their decisions today.
</P>
<P>
Only four percent of the enterprises said that the issue of
China's political stability constitutes a risk element, while 53
percent of the enterprises said that for them the greatest risk
this year is increasing competition and a lack of highly qualified
local workers.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-two percent of the enterprises surveyed said that
insufficient infrastructure is a problem hindering their business
growth in China, down 12 percent from when the enterprises were
first established.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises that consider the issues of raw materials and
product quality as negative factors for their businesses accounted
for 28 and 35 percent, down from 52 and 56 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
China's huge market potential is most attractive for the German
enterprises, many of which consider their investment in China as
part of their global development strategy.
</P>
<P>
Relatively few German enterprises invest in China because of
cheap labor and low costs, according to the survey, which also
indicates that the majority of German enterprises in China have
demonstrated strong competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
In another analysis, German enterprises primarily invest in the
relatively more developed areas of China, such as Shanghai,
Jiangsu, Beijing, Shandong and Tianjin.

will activate domestic spending and help create jobs for the
growing labor force and laid-off workers from State firms now
undertaking restructuring and streamlining.

RIO DE JANEIRO, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President
Fernando Henrique Cardoso Saturday expressed his country's support
to the United Nations' Security Council resolution on the Iraq
issue.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian press quoted Cardoso as saying that his country

peaceful solution of the conflict between the United States and
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He added that Brazil maintains its traditional position of
supporting the discussion in the UN Security Council, whether it

</P>
<P>
In a related development, chamber of Deputies' Human Rights
Commission President Pedro Wilson released an official bulletin on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
He said in a communique that a U.S. attack would affect in a

embargo consequences, to be again the victims of this announced
confrontation.

<HEADLINE> Veltroni Urges Quick Passage of Anti-Violence Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Italian deputy premier Walter
Veltroni has called on all parties to lend their support to
quickly push through parliament the government's new bill to
combat violence in sports stadiums.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot combat violence in stadiums by turning them into
bunkers, but by making them places of enjoyment, bringing in
restaurants, shops, sports museums and organizing other
initiatives around the match itself," Veltroni, who is also
responsible for sports as minister for culture, said on Saturday
in Appiano Gentile.
</P>
<P>
The deputy premier warned troublemakers to watch out.
</P>
<P>
"Those who go to stadiums must know that they will pay dearly
for any acts of violence," he said. "We must protect the enjoyment
of all. And not just inside the stadium, but also outside and on
transport to and from the stadium."
</P>
<P>
Justice minister Maria Flick explained that the government's
bill defined specific laws on stadium violence, including one
against the throwing of exploding objects, which will be
punishable with sentences of three months to three years.
</P>
<P>
Punishment was also increased for those ordered to stay away
from sporting events, who will now be forced to remain at home not
just during the event but for the whole day, Flick said.
</P>
<P>
Judges will also be authorized to order violent fans to stay at
home even when their teams travel, the justice minister added.

<HEADLINE> Holcman Takes NBA 1 Million Dollar Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Saul Holcman, a resident in
Forest Hills, New York, will take the shot of lifetime during the
NBA All-Star Weekend on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
As a NBA three-pointer, the Million Dollar Shot will be offered
to Holcman as the winner of an in-store promotion conducted with
Circuit City stores.
</P>
<P>
The event, together with the Rookie Game and the Shootout, will
be telecast globally to a television audience in more than 140
countries and regions with an approximate 600 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
Holcman, his wife Robin and their six-year-old twin daughters
also receive tickets to the NBA All-Star Game slated on February
8. If Holcman makes the basket, he will be awarded one million
U.S. dollars, and a new car will be awarded if he misses.
</P>
<P>
"Whether Saul sinks the shot or not, we believe he is a big
winner," said Marty Homlish, president of the Sony Electronics
Group sponsoring the event.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth year that a fan had the chance to shoot for
1 million dollars during NBA All-Star Weekend. Mike Hoban of
Cleveland in 1995, Demetrius Houston of Fort Pierce in 1996 and
Jim Valente of Bradenton in 1997 have attempted the shot but all
missed. Each was awarded 10,000 dollars consolation prizes.
</P>
<P>
"This event has become one of the fans' favorite All-Star
Saturday events," said NBA chief marketing officer Rick Welts. "A
fan taking a shot for a million dollars from the three-point line
is very dramatic."

<HEADLINE> Bird, Carl to Coach 1998 NBA All-Star Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Larry Bird of Indiana Pacers
and George Karl of Seattle SuperSonics will guide the East and
West teams respectively in the 48th annual NBA All-Star Game to be
played on Sunday at Madison Square Garden in New York City.
</P>
<P>
Head coaches for the NBA All-Star Game are those whose teams
have posted the best winning percentage in each conference through
games played on January 25.
</P>
<P>
Bird has guided the Pacers to their best start since joining
the NBA more than 20 years ago and was 28-12 at the deadline. The
Pacers also own the best record in the Eastern Conference by
percentage points over two-time defending champion Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
Bird, a 12-time All-Star selection as a player with Boston
Celtics, will be making his first All-Star appearance as a coach.
</P>
<P>
Bird, the MVP of the 1982 All-Star Game in New Jersey, becomes
only the seventh man to coach in an All-Star Game in his first
season as an NBA coach.
</P>
<P>
Voted the rookie of the year in 1980, Bird has three NBA
championships to his credit and was named the league's MVP in
three straight seasons, and twice the NBA Finals MVP.
</P>
<P>
He was the member of the 1992 gold medal-winning U.S. Dream
Team in the Barcelona Olympic Games. Prior to joining the Pacers,
he had spent five seasons working as a special consultant to the
Celtics.
</P>
<P>
Karl's SuperSonics was then 33-9, the best mark in the NBA, and
the 48th All-Star Game will be his third All-Star coaching
appearance. Karl previously guided the West in 1994 and in 1996,
but his squads lost both games at 118-127 and 118-129.
</P>
<P>
A fiery and emotional leader on sidelines, Karl had previously
coached Cleveland Cavaliersand Golden State Warriors. In his
five-plus years, the SuperSonics has won Pacific Division three
times.
</P>
<P>
He took the team to the 1996 NBA Finals, losing to Chicago
Bulls in six games.
</P>
<P>
He also coached Real Madrid of Spanish League, and played in
ABA and NBA for San Antonio Spurs from 1973 to 1978 before
beginning coaching career.
</P>
<P>
The NBA All-Star Game will be broadcast in more than 190
countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Commerce Sector Booming In China's Biggest City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 8 (Xinhua) -- One in three workers in
Shanghai is engaged in commercial services as the sector, which
involves 1.45 million workers, has come to play a much more
important role in the economic growth of China's biggest
industrial city, the city government sources said.
</P>
<P>
This growth in the commercial sector is the result of the
city's preferential policies since 1990, said an official of the
Municipal People's Government of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Shanghai's retail sales volume in 1997
reached 132.5 billion yuan (about 16.5 billion U.S. dollars),
rising by 16.6 percent over 1996 and 6 percent higher than the
national average.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai currently has 200,000 commercial firms, 50,000 more
than in 1992. The number of commerce workers also increased from
930,000 in 1992 to 1.45 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The city's commercial sector has employed a large number of
laid-off workers during the past three years, which contributes to
the reform of Shanghai's state-owned businesses and the
readjustment of the city's industrial construction, officials
said.

<HEADLINE> Mahathir Calls for United Front of ASEAN in Dealing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Singapore agreed
here Saturday that ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations)
itself should present a united front in dealing with the currency
issues, visiting Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that ASEAN itself should present a united front in
dealing with the currency issues and not deal each one by itself,
because then we will not get the full effect," Mahathir said after
his meeting with his Singapore counterpart Goh Chok Tong at the
Sentosa Golf Club Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the two prime ministers agreed that there
were certain things they might be able to do about the regional
problem, but that would require some elaboration.
</P>
<P>
He said that he also agreed with Goh on the use of their own
currencies for the purpose of trade among ASEAN countries and the
need for a meeting of the governors of the central banks to work
this out.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN now comprises Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand,
Singapore, the Philippines, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir arrived here earlier Saturday on a brief visit for
talks with Goh and left for home after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
"This is part of my visit to the other ASEAN countries. I met
Prime Minister Goh only a few weeks back and we agreed to work
together. Today we went into greater detail about how we can
cooperate, in particular with regard to the economic problem and
currency turmoil and what role Singapore can have on investments
in Malaysia and generally how to improve relations between
Singapore and Malaysia," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also confirmed that there were some reports
of Singapore currency being used as a peg for trade, and said,
"but we are studying that".

<HEADLINE> Political Factor Important in Currency Crisis: Lee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew
of Singapore said here Saturday that the worst of the currency
crisis will not be over until after the Indonesian presidential
election in early March.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a local community event, Lee said that if there are
not upsets, the situation will stabilize and improve.
</P>
<P>
He added that in this crisis of confidence, the crucial
ingredient is the political factor.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto's decision to carry out the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) proposals did not stabilize the Indonesian
currency and stock market, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"It is the political factor. The market was disturbed by his
criteria for the vice president that required a mastery of science
and technology, announced shortly after the second IMF agreement,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"They believed that this pointed to a minister whom they
associated with Indonesia's high spending projects. If the market
is uncomfortable with whoever is the eventual vice president, the
rupiah would weaken again," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is vital the Indonesian rupiah stabilizes
and its stock market recovers. Otherwise, the fallout would be bad
for Indonesia and may again spread panic over the region.
</P>
<P>
Singapore should help where it can and that is why Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong had visited President Soeharto three times
since the currency crisis began, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Clash over Leak in Clinton-Lewinsky Matter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr on Saturday promised to "take appropriate action" if he
finds anyone on his staff leaking stories damaging to U.S.
President Bill Clinton, while Monica Lewinsky's attorney demanded
an independent Justice Department probe.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's attorney William Ginsburg issued a statement
accusing Starr of "clearly attempting to evade and avoid the
responsibility for his office's unethical, unlawful and abusive
acts."
</P>
<P>
Ginsburg, who represents Lewinsky alleged to have had an affair
with Clinton, also called Starr's promise to police his own staff
"self-serving," saying, "the American people would have more
confidence" in Starr's investigation of Clinton and Lewinsky if he
turned the matter of illegal news leaks over to the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton's attorney, David Kendall, was reportedly
preparing to take Starr to court as early as Monday. Kendall will
ask that Starr's office be found in contempt and punished for
allegedly passing to reporters secret, sometimes false,
information from grand jury proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Kendall detailed the allegations in a publicly distributed
letter to Starr on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"We'll look into those charges," said Starr, who is trying to
probe the allegation involving Clinton and Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
"We try to carry on this investigation in the most professional
way. Charges have been made.... Let's find out the facts," he told
reporters Saturday.
</P>
<P>
New polls showed Clinton's job-approval rating remained high,
at 66 percent, in separate surveys by Newsweek and U.S. News &AMP;
World Report.
</P>
<P>
Newsweek's survey additionally indicated that just over half of
Americans -- 54 percent -- believe it was bad for the country that
Starr began looking into the Clinton-Lewinsky question. The public
was also almost evenly split over approving Starr's tactics in the
case.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky and Clinton have both denied in legal proceedings
connected with the Paula Jones sexual harassment case that they
had a sexual relationship.

<HEADLINE> Measles Cases Rise in Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Canada reported a dramatic
77-percent jump in the number of cases of measles last year,
despite an overall drop of measles cases in the Americas, reports
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, 580 cases of measles were reported in the country,
compared with 327 cases the year before.
</P>
<P>
But that was a great improvement from 1995 when 2,357 cases
were reported.
</P>
<P>
To account for the rise, Health Canada points to an increase in
the number of cases among Canadians who may have had one dose of
vaccine or no vaccine at all.
</P>
<P>
The disease is common in people who had had only one dose,
since a single shot does not give full protection, the reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Measles is an acute viral illness with symptoms including fever
and malaise, cough, conjunctivitis and a rash.
</P>
<P>
In Americas as a whole, measles cases were reduced to 30,000 in
1997 from 250,000 in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Asian Students Hurt by Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Asian students are trickling out
of Canada as a result of the prolonged financial crisis back home,
a report said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Korean students alone are leaving Canada by the dozens, and
other are not coming to Canada as they planned, according to the
Ottawa Citizen newspaper.
</P>
<P>
"We definitely saw an impact in January," Sandra Bassett,
director of Algonguin College's International Education Centre,
was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The college had almost 25 percent fewer new foreign students
than expected in January, Bassett said.
</P>
<P>
About 4,000 foreign students come to Algonquin each year, about
half of them from Asia.
</P>
<P>
They each pay almost 10,000 Canadian dollars (6,900 U.S.
dollars) to attend the college and spend another 20,000 dollars a
year on rents and living expenses.
</P>
<P>
It is still unclear how many Asian students will leave Canada,
said a spokesman for the Canadian Bureau for International
Education, which has 110 college and university members.
</P>
<P>
However, the impact will be harder on Canadian schools that
teach English as a second language, an industry that has
flourished lately, the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Remains Opposed to Baltic States Joining NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
reiterated on Saturday that Russia remained opposed to the bids of
Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera
before his visit to Italy on February 9-11, Yeltsin said that he
was alarmed by some of the first comments by the Baltic
signatories of the Partnership with the U.S. Charter, and by the
reported pledge of the United States to help the three Baltic
countries join NATO.
</P>
<P>
"Let me emphasize once again that this scenario has been and
remains unacceptable to Russia," Yeltsin was quoted by interfax
news agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The president stressed that one can not forget that security is
indivisible. Russia, which has made a tremendous contribution to
overcoming the recent confrontation, also has the right to ensure
its own security, he said.
</P>
<P>
In exercising one's own right to security, Yeltsin continued,
one must consider the legitimate and quite understandable
interests of other states, especially one's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin noted what is needed now is not debates on who should
be the first to join NATO, but efforts to strengthen security and
stability in Europe.
</P>
<P>
That is the reason why Russia consistently advocates working
out a comprehensive security model for our continent and a
European Security Charter under the aegis of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia signed with the United States
Partnership Charter on January 16, which, Russia thought, clearly
indicates the beginning of eastward expansion of the Atlantic
alliance.

WASHINGTON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Saturday stressed that
the U.S.-British alliance is firm, warning again Iraq of possible
military strike.
</P>
<P>
"As we face the challenges of the 21st century, the alliance
between the United States and the United Kingdom remains
unshakable," said Clinton in his weekly radio address, joined by
Blair.
</P>
<P>
"Britain and America have so much in common -- language,
values, belief in family and community, in a real sense of
national pride," said Blair.
</P>
<P>
"We share many problems too. And it has been clear from our
discussions that we are agreed in general terms about some of the
solutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of Iraq, Blair said that he "stand four square with
you in our determination to bring" Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
into line with the agreement he made at the end of the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
"We are pursuing all the diplomatic avenues open to us. But if
they fail and force is the only way to get him into line, then
force must be used," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
"If that happens, Britain will be there, as we have been in the
past, at the forefront in our determination to uphold
international peace and security," he added.
</P>
<P>
In return, Clinton noted, "On Iraq as on so many issues, the
United States and Britain speak with one voice."

<P>
LONDON, February 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton is
to visit Northern Ireland later this year provided the peace
process remains on track, said British Prime Minister Tony Blair
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister told BBC television on the plane back from
the United States that during his visit to Washington he had been
told how Clinton "would be delighted to return to the province."
</P>
<P>
"President Clinton gave me a very clear signal and
understanding that he would be delighted to come to Northern
Ireland if the peace process goes according to plan," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Clinton is likely to go to Belfast in mid-May when
he is in Britain for a summit of the world's major industrial
countries.
</P>
<P>
Blair added that despite setbacks, the peace process is on
track for a good settlement and the May deadline set by the UK and
Irish governments for a settlement is still realistic.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish Republican Army,
welcomed the possibility of a visit by Clinton but said much hangs
on what happens in the next five weeks.

KUWAIT CITY, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti dinar has remained
firm and did not devalue as a result of the current
Iraqi-U.N. standoff over the arms inspection, Kuwaiti Finance
Minister Nasser Al-Rudhan said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The minister, after attending an extraordinary meeting of the
Parliament, also denied reports of a huge demand for foreign
currencies in the local market, according to the Kuwait News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Many people in Kuwait have been exchanging dinars to
U.S. dollars amidst fear that Iraq might launch attacks against
the small Gulf neighbor if a U.S. military strike against Iraq
takes place following a possible failure of diplomacy to end the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. led allied force drove the Iraqi troops out from
Kuwait, ending a seven-month Iraqi occupation of the small Gulf
state in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Al-Rudhan stressed that there is absolute agreement between
the government and parliament to take whatever actions necessary
to shield the country against any dangers.

<HEADLINE> US Military Delegation Arrives in Bahrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 7 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. military delegation
arrived the Bahraini capital Manama on Saturday on a two-day
visit to the Gulf country amid the U.S. and British military
build-up for a possible strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini news agency said the delegation, headed by
General Commander of U.S. Central Command Antoni Ziny discussed
with Bahrain's Defense Minister Sheikh Khalifa bin Ahmed al
Khalifa the latest developments in the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
It gave no further details, however, informed sources in
Manama told Xinhua that the two sides also discussed battle
plans against Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain warned Thursday that they were ready to
launch military strike against Iraq if diplomatic efforts fail to
ease the standoff with Baghdad on arms inspection.
</P>
<P>
The standoff was caused by Iraq's decision in October to
bar the U.N. inspectors, charged with dismantling weapons of mass
destruction from entering so-called "sensitive sites" in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain beefed up their military force
in the Gulf following the Iraqi decision and they warned they
would launch strikes against Iraq alone even without
international support.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military delegation came just one day before the
U.S. Defense Secretary Cohen's tour to the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
Cohen will tour all the capitals of the six Gulf Arab states
from Sunday to discuss with the Gulf leaders the possible military
actions against Iraq.

KUWAIT CITY, February 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait Saturday reiterated
its support for diplomatic efforts to end the current Iraqi-U.N.
standoff over the U.N. arms inspection operations in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait's Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
Al-Abdullah Al-Salem Al-Sabah said after attending an
extraordinary parliament session that "Kuwait supports the action
to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis."
</P>
<P>
Pointing out the present tour to Arab Gulf Cooperation Council
states by Kuwait's Minister for Cabinet Affairs, Sheihk Saad said
GCC leaders were briefed with the Kuwaiti stance towards the
current developments.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait National Assembly held the session to discuss
government preparations regarding the Iraq-UN stand-off.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Saad declared Saturday that anti poisonous gas masks
would arrive within the upcoming two days and distribution and
prices would be set.
</P>
<P>
Unofficial sources said Saturday Kuwait has taken delivery of
its first shipment of about 50,000 gas masks to be used
for emergency teams, volunteers and other government bodies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Kuwait's Ministry of Health outlined its
plan for any state of emergency. A ministry report said the
preparations covered the administration of medical emergencies,
hospitals, medical storage, the blood bank and public services.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has put its small armed forces on high alert in recent
days amidst fear that a possible U.S. military strike against
Iraq would bring about Iraqi retaliatory attack on Kuwait, one of
the U.S. close allies in the Gulf region. Kuwait was occupied by
Iraqi troops for seven months in 1990-1991.
