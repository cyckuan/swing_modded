<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Slows Sharply in First Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. productivity growth
slowed down sharply in the first quarter of this year, increasing
at an annual rate of just 0.2 percent, the labor Department
reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the slight gain in productivity, a measure of
output per hour of work in non-farm businesses, was the weakest
since a 0.7 percent decline in the third quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The slower growth in the first quarter followed a revised 1.4
percent advance in the final three months of 1997. For all of
1997, productivity had risen by 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some economists noted that even with the slowdown in the first
quarter, productivity over the past 12 months has risen by 1.9
percent, a sharp improvement over the trend of the past quarter
century.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. productivity posted average annual increases of nearly
3 percent in the 1960s and early 1970s, helping to lift American
wages and living standards. But since 1973 and the Arab oil
embargo, productivity has slowed sharply, with gains average
little better than 1 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
There has been a slight pickup in productivity in the past two
years. It rose 1.7 percent last year and 1.9 percent in 1996,
still far below the 3 percent gains of the 1960s but better than
the 1 percent average since 1973.
</P>
<P>
The pickup of the past two years could help explain why
unemployment has fallen to such low levels without boosting
inflation. If productivity is rising, employers can pay higher
wages without being forced to raise prices.
</P>
<P>
But for the first three months of the year, unit labor costs, a
key barometer of inflation pressures, rose 3.8 percent in the,
matching the 3.8 percent rise in the final three months of 1997.
That increase was the worst since the third quarter of 1996. The
unit labor cost is regarded as a signal of inflation pressures.
</P>
<P>
In a separate report today, the Labor Department said that
unemployment claims fell by 11,000 last week to 308,000, an
unexpectedly large decline that provided new evidence of the
strength of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The sharp slowdown in productivity was attributed to the fact
that while output increased in the first quarter, the number of
hours worked jumped as well. Hours worked rose at an annual rate
of 5 percent in the first quarter, the fastest increase since the
second quarter of 1994.

<HEADLINE> Refugees to Benefit from EU, World Bank Aid to Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The European Union and the World
Bank have agreed to promote the return of refugees to Bosnia with
the creation of economic growth and a strong private sector.
</P>
<P>
The two organizations agreed Thursday that after two years of
reconstruction, it was time for displaced persons to return to
their war-ravaged homeland.
</P>
<P>
The two-day meeting is expected to raise one billion to 1.1
billion U.S. dollars, half of which will be earmarked for
activities directly or indirectly facilitating the return and
reintegration of refugees.
</P>
<P>
It was the fourth such donor conference to review the progress
of the implementation of a 5.1 billion dollar reconstruction
program.
</P>
<P>
In late October 1995, immediately after the ceasefire and
before the signing of the Dayton Agreement, a joint mission of the
European Commission, the World Bank, the International Monetary
Fund, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the
U.S. Agency for International Development visited Bosnia and
identified priority reconstruction financing needs of 5.1 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission and the World Bank called the first
donor conference in November 1995. The previous three donor
conferences raised a total of 3.26 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> ECB Head Complains About Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Wim Duisenberg, the newly appointed
president of the European Central Bank (ECB), hit back at critics
of his compromise appointment on Thursday, saying he was unable to
serve the full eight-year term.
</P>
<P>
At a European Parliament committee hearing, the Dutchman denied
saying that he could only serve four or five years, but rather he
could not serve eight.
</P>
<P>
The statement to the European legislators was taken as
criticism of the row over the compromise worked out at the
European Union summit last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The compromise, masterminded by British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, aimed to smooth over a German-French row over the candidate
for the ECB chief.
</P>
<P>
Germany and the Netherlands backed Duisenberg, while France
championed its own central banker Jean-Claude Trichet for the
position, the most important in the euro zone that comprises 11
European Union member states.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac said prior to the summit that
the European Commission had to make it explicit that Duisenberg
would step down mid-term to make way for Trichet.
</P>
<P>
Blair went to the Hague one day prior to the summit and
discussed the issue with his Dutch counterpart Wim Kok before
heading for Brussels for the summit.
</P>
<P>
The one-day summit, originally intended to be a formal
ceremonial launching of the single currency, wore on for almost 10
hours with arguing and horse-trading.
</P>
<P>
It was not until the small hours on Sunday that Blair announced
that the summit finally confirmed on Duisenberg and that the
Dutchman would stand down in mid-term of his own will.
</P>
<P>
The bitter row was believed by European economists to have
undermined the image of the ECB and left the impression that the
central bank would be influenced by politicians in the future as
well.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament is scheduled to approve the appointment
of Duisenberg as ECB head next week.
</P>
<P>
European Finance Commissioner Yves Thibault de Silguy's had no
official comment on Duisenberg's statement at the parliament, said
his spokesman, Patrick Child.

<HEADLINE> Russia Welcomes U.S. Pullout From Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia has welcomed the U.S. plan to
reduce its military presence in the Gulf, the Interfax news agency
reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Vitaly Nesterushkin, a spokesman for the Russian Foreign
Ministry, said that the U.S. administration's plan "largely
suggests that Washington has recognized Baghdad's constructive
cooperation with the U.N. special commission in charge of
abolishing the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction".
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has decided to pull the
Independence aircraft carrier out the Gulf, and the U.S. military
presence there could be further reduced, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The United States sent a sizable force to the region at the
peak of the latest Iraqi crisis earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The reduction of the U.S. military presence objectively
alleviated the tension and the risk of hostilities erupting,
according to Nesterushkin.
</P>
<P>
Commending the Russian role in the settlement of the Iraqi
crisis, the ministry spokesman said Russia pressed for resolving
all the existing problems by diplomatic and political means.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf crisis subsided when an agreement was signed between
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and the Iraqi leadership over
U.N. weapons inspections on February 23.

<HEADLINE> Alberta Forest Fires Force Oil Wells Closings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Dry weather fed fires in northern
Alberta, Canada, that have shut down scores of oil and gas
producing wells and are burning forests at a "devastating" rate,
reports said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
By late Wednesday, 27 forest fires were burning, seven out of
control, 16 under control, and four in the process of being
contained.
</P>
<P>
At least 150,000 hectares of forests have gone up in smoke, the
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The fires, the worst in the Canadian province of Alberta in 30
years, have driven as many as 2,100 residents from their homes. So
far, no casualties have been reported.
</P>
<P>
The impact on the oil and gas sector has been severe, though
production losses are not yet expected to translate into major
financial setbacks.
</P>
<P>
The energy sector remains on high-alert and is poised to
curtail operations if condition deteriorate, the reports said.

<HEADLINE> USDA Plans New Package to Boost Agriculture Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration plans
to take new measures to enhance agricultural exports as well as
prices in a bid to stem the slipping trend of farmers income which
is projected to fall nearly 4 billion U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who revealed the plan
at a Senate hearing Thursday, said that despite free-market
reforms in U.S. farm policy, there are times when government must
step in.
</P>
<P>
"We must not forsake our own responsibility," Glickman stated,
"Rain or shine, bear or bull, we need to look out for our farmers
and ranchers."
</P>
<P>
The department plans to take a series of actions. Two steps are
being taken immediately:
</P>
<P>
-- Getting around an annual limit on dairy exports by using
amounts from prior years in which the allocations were never
actually sold. This would clear the way for sale of some 50
million dollars in U.S. dairy products abroad;
</P>
<P>
--Using the Export Enhancement Program to subsidize farm
products export in retaliation for unfair trade practices
conducted by other countries.
</P>
<P>
Another USDA proposal would allow the export program to be used
to subsidize exporters whose cargos are unexpectedly and unfairly
turned away from foreign ports.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Glickman is asking Congress to pass legislation
allowing any money left in the export program at the end of the
year to be used to purchase farm products for other food programs,
ranging from foreign aid to the U.S. food security reserve. That
carryover is often spent on unrelated items.
</P>
<P>
The department estimated that net farm income this year will
fall to 51 billion U.S. dollars, down from 55 billion dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
According to Glickman, wheat prices are currently at a
five-year low and corn prices at levels not seen in four years.
There is a glut of pork and beef, which has depressed those prices
as well.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the export moves, Glickman wants Congress to allow
USDA to extend federal commodity loans from nine months to 15
months, which would permit farmers to hold onto crops until prices
are more favorable.
</P>
<P>
These loans, which serve as a floor for crop prices, allow a
farmer to repay the government by forfeiting the crop instead of
paying the loan itself. This allows farmer s to use money to pay
other debts when prices for crops are low.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Government Ready to Loan Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government will offer
loans to farmers to offset effects of adverse weather conditions,
Vice-President Christon Tembo said.
</P>
<P>
Tembo said in Ndola, northern Zambia, that the agricultural
inputs will be distributed by August to assist farmers to boost
production, Zambia's Daily Mail reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said that unlike in the past his office now
has some money available for the peasants, but he stressed the
need to pay back whatever will be disbursed to them in loan.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for us to grow enough food for ourselves
instead of import," said Tembo.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government is aware of the plight faced by
the farmers and something is being worked out for them to revamp
production.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Minister of Community Development and Social Services
Dawson Lupunga urged the Zambians to discard the legacy of not
honoring agricultural debts.
</P>
<P>
Lupunga said that there are funds for agricultural production
but people who want to benefit from the loans should learn to
repay the money.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Arrives in Cairo for Talks With Mubarak </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat arrived here from Tunis Thursday on a
short visit for talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on the
future of the faltering Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Their meeting focused on the result of the separate talks
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in London early this
week to revive the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also briefed Mubarak on his visits to Morocco, Algeria
and Tunisia since Tuesday, during which he reported to the leaders
of the three Arab states on the London talks and coordinated
stances with them on the coming stage.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Mubarak meeting was later expanded to include
Egyptian Prime Minister Kamal el-Ganzouri, Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa, Secretary-General of Palestine Liberation Organization
(PLO) Executive Committee Mahmoud Abbas (also known as Abu Mazen)
and Arafat's Media Advisor Nabil Abu Redina.
</P>
<P>
Following two days of talks in London, Albright's latest
attempt to salvage Palestinian-Israeli peace meetings ended
without a breakthrough, but U.S. President Bill Clinton invited
the Israeli and Palestinian leaders to Washington for more talks
next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the invitation was conditional, noting that
Israel must accept the U.S. peace proposal before the summit,
which calls on Israel to hand over 13.1 percent of the West Bank
to the Palestinians during the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has accepted the proposal and agreed to make the trip,
while Netanyahu on Wednesday publicly called for U.S. Middle East
envoy Dennis Ross to return to the region before Monday to modify
the American initiative.
</P>
<P>
Israel has insisted that any redeployment of more than 9
percent would damage its national security interests. And the
right-wing parties have threatened to topple the government if
Netanyahu agrees to a 13 percent withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been an important mediator in the peace talks which
have been stalled since March 1997 over Israeli settlement
buildings and long-delayed troop redeployment in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Duisenberg Could Serve Full Term if He Wanted: Juncker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Wim Duisenberg, the appointed head of
the European central bank (ECB), could stay in office for the full
eight-year term if he chose to do so rather than to quit earlier
as he indicated, Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker
told a German newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Duisenberg did not make any statement before the EU leaders
that would make him appear as liar if he stayed that long (eight
years) in office," said Juncker in an interview with the German
newspaper Die Welt.
</P>
<P>
"What makes up a central banker's independence is also the fact
that he could decide to leave office when he will," Juncker added,
echoing a similar view voiced by German Finance Minister Theo
Waigel Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders appointed Duisenberg as the first president of the
ECB last Saturday after a 12-hour squabbling pitting German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl against French President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The former Dutch central bank chief apparently only got
Chirac's endorsement after indicating that he would step down
prior to the end of the full eight-year term to make way for his
French rival Jean-Claude Trichet.
</P>
<P>
Juncker confirmed Thursday that it was German Chancellor Kohl
who rejected a French demand to incorporate a deadline for
Duisenberg's retirement in the EU decision.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the European Parliament on Thursday, Duisenberg
reiterated that it would be unlikely that he would serve a full
eight-year term.
</P>
<P>
Pledging to stay in the job at least until the introduction of
the euro banknotes and coins in 2002, he also stressed that he
alone would make the final decision on when he will quit. enditem

<HEADLINE> Hamas Leader's S. African Visit Ill-timed: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The timing of an intended
visit this week by Hamas' spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin to
South Africa is not convenient, Palestinian National Authority
(PNA)'s ambassador to South Africa said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Alman el-Herfi said the Middle East peace talks
were at a delicate stage, and no other event should be allowed to
divert international attention from the essentials of the peace
process, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the timing of this visit is not good. We hope our
brothers in the Moslem community will understand our position,
and they will focus all their attention on the peace process,"
the ambassador was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hamas is a radical Islamic group which masterminded a series
of suicide bombings in Israel over the past decade. South
African President Nelson Mandela had indicated in the past that
he was willing to meet Yassin, who was released by Israel last
year.
</P>
<P>
South African Foreign Ministry said Thursday that Yassin's
application for a visa is being processed, but it declined to say
whether the visa will be granted.
</P>
<P>
Yassin was reportedly refused a visa last week, and the
presidential office said Tuesday that Mandela had no plan to meet
him. The Moslem committee which invited Yassin to South Africa
blamed these on the Palestinian authority, saying it attempted to
stop Yassin's visit.
</P>
<P>
El-Herfi on Thursday dismissed the accusations and criticized
the Moslem Committee for failing to invite Yassin through the
correct channel, namely the Palestinian embassy in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Stressing Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's support of
Yassin, el-Herfi said that they are responsible for Yassin's
security as he is traveling with a Palestinian diplomatic
passport.
</P>
<P>
The SAPA report quoted South African sources as saying that
the South African government also considered Yassin's visit to be
inopportune at this stage of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A local source reportedly said Mandela did not want to meet
Yassin at this moment because it could give Yassin a platform for
views which might not be conducive to a successful outcome of the
peace talks.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's overall surplus of
balance-of-payments registered 2,115 million Kuwaiti Dinars
(6,979.5 million U.S. dollars) in 1997, a hike of 5.75 percent than
the figure of 2,000 million dinars (6.6 billion dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kuwait said in a statement Thursday that
this resulted in a drop to 16 million dinars (52.8 million
dollars) in 1997 from 26 million dinars (85.8 million dollars) in
1996 in the state budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
The current account trade surplus rose to 2,327 million dinars
(7,679.1 million dollars) from 2,119 million dinars (6,992.7
million dollars), a hike of nearly 10 percent, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent study by National Bank of Kuwait,
Kuwait's leading commercial bank, Kuwait recorded a budget
surplus of 552 million dinars (1.82 billion U.S. dollars) in the
second half of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges Israel to Accept U.S. Peace Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
Thursday expressed hope that Israel would accept the U.S. peace
plan in the possible Washington talks so as to implement the
signed agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In a departure statement before leaving here for Cairo, Arafat
said he had a meeting earlier in the day with Tunisian President
Zine Al-Abidine Ben Ali to brief him on the recent London meetings
on the stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
On May 4 and 5, Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu took part in a series of separate meetings in London
with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in a bid to push
forward the peace process after a 14-month deadlock. But Albright
failed to persuade Netanyahu to accept the U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
Arafat pointed out that the London meetings were an attempt by
the U.S. and Britain to come up with a resolution that maintains
the rights of the various parties and put in force the signed
agreements between the Palestinians and Israelis.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli side rejected the U.S. peace proposal that calls
for an Israeli withdrawal from 13.1 percent of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has said an invitation of a possible Washington
meeting to the concerned parties is conditioned on Israel's
acceptance of the U.S. redeployment proposal.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinians were shocked again by Israeli
intransigence, said Arafat, adding that Netanyahu did not make any
move toward peace.
</P>
<P>
He said these were not Palestinian-Israeli bilateral
agreements, but international accords.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here at noon Wednesday within his tour which has
taken him to Morocco and Algeria.

SHANGHAI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE)
Composite Index rose to 1,357 points today, the highest since last

</P>
<P>
In general, the week's SSE Composite Index went up 1.05 percent

<HEADLINE> Ross, Netanyahu Hold Talks on U.S. Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East peace envoy
Dennis Ross held talks here Friday afternoon with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on U.S. ideas for a summit in
Washington next week to launch final-status talks with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Industry and Trade
Minister Natan Sharansky, two members of Netanyahu's inner
cabinet, also participated in the talks, but nothing has been
announced.
</P>
<P>
The Washington summit is scheduled for next Monday and before
that Israel has to make its final decision on whether it would
accept the U.S. proposal concerning its troop redeployment in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal asks Israel to hand over 13.1 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians in 12 weeks as the second stage
redeployment. It has been rejected by Israel.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Secretary Danny Naveh said here Friday that Israel
could only have a 9-percent redeployment based on Israel's
security needs.
</P>
<P>
Ross' return is seen here as the last-ditch effort to save the
collapsing peace process. He arrived here Friday at the request of
Netanyahu who phoned U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told Albright that he has to work out with Ross about
Israel's "yes" or "no" to the U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat
has already announced support for the U.S. plan. But Netanyahu
remained adamant in his intransigence during back-to-back talks
with Arafat in London on Monday and Tuesday with the help of
Albright and British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
The London meeting failed to make a breakthrough, and Albright
said that U.S. President Bill Clinton invited Netanyahu and Arafat
for a Washington summit next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Because Israel's decision-making process must take sometime,
Netanyahu said on Thursday that he is not sure if he will be able
to get to Washington on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu will call a whole cabinet meeting on Sunday to make
a final decision on the U.S. proposal.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 3.5 million Afghan
children under age of five are being vaccinated for eradication of
polio.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth vaccination campaign in Afghanistan in

For the first time, vaccination campaign is taking place in
Afghanistan's Bamyan province, which is located west of Kabul and
has been under blockade due to fighting between the Taliban
militia and the Northern Alliance, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
As a result of comprehensive negotiations between the WHO and
the Taliban, the report said, the militia agreed to provide a
corridor of peace and safe passage of supplies to the province
from Ghazni, an area under their control.

in the desert kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The deals, totally valued at 41.3 million U.S. dollars, mainly

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Needs Lasting Policies on Water, Power, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Water Resources Minister
Abdur Razzak Friday called for lasting policies in the country's
water, power and agricultural sectors.
</P>
<P>
"We must have permanent policies with medium- and short-term
provisions" for managing the three sectors, Razzak told a working
session of the Bangladeshi Engineers Institution here.
</P>
<P>
Frequent changes in policies concerning these sectors had
caused harm to the management of the three sectors, which were
inter-related and needed planned and coordinated management, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"If we can combine the efforts of professionals, generalists
and politicians, we can ensure our progress and reduce dependence
on foreigners," he said.
</P>
<P>
The country had scored some success in flood control, but that
was achieved at the cost of fisheries resources as project
formulators did not consider and foresee the environmental
consequences of their plans for water management, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged experts to take steps to minimize the system loss in
the power sector to help make the industry profitable, since the
sector was "supposed to be profitable, but the government has to
provide subsidies there."
</P>
<P>
The majority of the country's over 50 million labor force are
engaged in agriculture and frozen seafood export is one of its
major foreign exchange earners, but power supply has become a
bottleneck in the government's efforts to attract foreign
investment.

SHANGHAI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- More and more local residents in
this largest metropolis in China are donating their bodies or body
parts for medical research, according to a local meeting here
today.
</P>
<P>
The city's Red Cross Society held the meeting to mark World
Red Cross Day. A number of people were rewarded for their
contributions in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that by the end of last year nearly 7,000

deaths.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 4,000 people have offered to donate their
marrow, and so far, over 2,300 have had their marrow stored in
the local marrow bank.
</P>
<P>
The city started a body-donation campaign in 1983, and local
universities have undertaken to take charge of the donations.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 the Shanghai Marrow Bank was set up, and in 1996 the

<HEADLINE> 1 killed, 5 Wounded in Clashes in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Five Lebanese civilians were wounded
and a senior officer of the Israeli-allied South Lebanese Army
(SLA) was killed Friday in south Lebanon, the country's Orient
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The five were wounded at noon during the Israeli artillery
shelling on the villages of al Mansuri and Majdel Zoun, about 10
kilometers north of the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
The wounded have been admitted to the nearby hospitals in the
country's southern coastal city of Tyre for treatment, the radio
added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli shelling, which also destroyed some villagers'
homes and wrecked several civilian cars, came as a retaliation for
the early attacks launched by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or
Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Hours before, Hezbollah fighters set off a bomb planted in a
SLA senior officer's home inside the SLA-controlled Jezzine, just
north of the Israeli occupied enclave in south Lebanon. The
officer died instantly in the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah also stage a similar attack on an armed Israeli
patrol who were passing by a village in the western sector of the
enclave. But there was no report of casualties from the roadside
bomb.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is leading a guerrilla war in an attempt to dislodge
the 2,000-strong Israeli occupying forces and its allied SLA from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied a 1,200-square-kilometer border strip in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
towns from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attack.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Eyes More Capital from West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- As a countermeasure to the southeast
Asian financial turmoil, east China's Fujian Province is
developing the markets in Western countries and making efforts to
introduce more foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
To ensure an economic growth rate of 11 percent this year, the
province's fixed asset investment in 1998 is expected to reach 110
billion yuan, according to Deputy Governor Cao Degan, at a
briefing on projects for international investment in Fujian held
here today.
</P>
<P>
Cao said, to face up to the negative influence of the financial
turmoil, Fujian should try to attract more funds from the West
while maintaining its traditional markets in the Southeast Asian
countries as well as Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that the province's annual economic
growth rate stood at 19.3 percent during the Eighth Five-Year
Plan (1991-1995), ranking first in the country.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 1,300 foreign-funded enterprises in Fujian which
have gone into operation are profitable, said Cao.
</P>
<P>
The 50 projects announced at today's briefing and involving
four billion U.S. dollars, are mainly for infrastructure
construction, basic industries, comprehensive agricultural
development and tourism, according to Cai Zhongyi, deputy director
of the Fujian Provincial Planning Commission,
</P>
<P>
Some 400 people from the commercial sections of
foreign embassies, representative offices of international
organizations, branches of foreign transnational companies and
conglomerates in Beijing attended the briefing.

<HEADLINE> South Asia Grouping Chief on Trade Negotiations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The repeated postponement of the
final meeting of the third round of trade negotiations under the
SAARC Preferential Trading Arrangement (SAPTA) is also a concern
of the commerce ministers of the South Asian Association for
Regional Cooperation (SAARC), Naeem U. Hasan, the grouping's
secretary-general, said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
At their second meeting in Islamabad, Pakistan, in late April,
the commerce ministers felt the need to make up for the time,
Hasan told the press at the Kathmandu-based SAARC Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
He said the fourth round of trade negotiations is expected to
be announced at the 10th SAARC summit slated for July in Colombo,
Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The third round should have ended in January, but has been put
off three times. Its final meeting is rescheduled for June 8-10 at
the SAARC Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said that a meeting will be held in early
July in Dhaka, Bangladesh, to review the negotiations under the
SAPTA.
</P>
<P>
The previous two rounds of trade negotiations offered more than
2,000 items of products for tariff cuts ranging from 10 to 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
He said the commerce ministers also decided to reconsider the
criterion for rules of origin. At the moment, it requires 50
percent of local material for a product, but the least developed
member countries -- Bhutan, Bangladesh, the Maldives and Nepal --
for whom the SAPTA has special provisions, want this ratio to be
brought down so as to help them develop their own products and
trade, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Group of Eminent Persons, formed as directed by the
SAARC leaders at their ninth summit in Male, the Maldives, last
year to undertake a comprehensive appraisal of the SAARC, will
hold its fourth and final meeting in Male in early June before
submitting a report to the 10th summit.
</P>
<P>
He said the exact date of the 10th summit is yet to be worked
out, but Sri Lanka is consulting with six other member countries,
which include India and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"Most probably it will be the third week of July," he added.
</P>
<P>
The SAARC, formed in 1985, aims to establish a South Asian Free
Trade Area (SAFTA) preferably by the year of 2001.

<HEADLINE> NATO Considers Military Exercise in Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- NATO is considering staging a joint
military exercise in Albania to prepare for a possible spillover
of the ethnic conflict in Yugoslavia's Kosovo province, a NATO
official said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The official, who declined to be named, said the exercise,
which was still in the initial stage of consideration, was to
assure Albania, a member of a NATO partnership program, that it is
not alone.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic tensions has been growing since February in Kosovo, on
Albania's northern border, when Serbian police clashed with ethnic
Albanians, who make up 90 percent of the province's population and
have been seeking independence since 1981.
</P>
<P>
The official said the exercise may involve air and ground
forces and would probably take place some time next year.
</P>
<P>
Albania is a member of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council,
which was formed between NATO and its partner countries in 1997.
The council is a successor to the North Atlantic Cooperation
Council which was created after the end of the Cold War to fill
the security vacuum in Central and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Albania has been on high alert in its northern region bordering
Kosovo, but has so far ruled out the possibility of military
intervention.

<HEADLINE> Battle on Bidding for Rolls-Royce not Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- German auto maker Volkswagen AG said
Friday the battle with BMW, its domestic rival, for British luxury
car manufacturer Rolls-Royce was still being waged despite support
for the VW offer from Rolls-Royce's parent company.
</P>
<P>
The bidding war for Rolls-Royce took a surprise turn Thursday
after Vickers, the parent firm, turned to support Volkswagen.
</P>
<P>
The aboutface was due to an improved bid from VW, worth
430 million pounds (713.2 million U.S. dollars), well above the
340 million pounds (564 million dollars) offered by BMW.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen chief Ferdinand Piech told German reporters that BMW
was likely to raise its offer in order to outbid Volkswagen once
again.
</P>
<P>
BMW, however, declined to comment on the possibility of a new
offer. It also renewed an earlier threat to halt deliveries of
engines and other components to Rolls-Royce if Volkswagen
prevailed.
</P>
<P>
BMW had previously engaged in exclusive talks with Vickers on
the planned takeover. But the British company argued Thursday that
the higher offer made by Volkswagen would bring more benefits to
its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
A decision is due to be made by a special shareholders meeting
of the British company on June 4.

<HEADLINE> Petroleum Industry Focus for Sino-Kazakhstan Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The petroleum industry is the one of
the key cooperative areas between China and Kazakhstan, Kazakhstan
Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbaev said here today in a news
briefing.
</P>
<P>
On the progress of the large petroleum project undertaken by
the two governments last year, the prime minister said that
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji has pledged to implement the relevant
contracts of the Chinese side as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
"The feasibility study is to finish next December and the
laying of pipelines will be completed in 2004," Balgimbaev said.
</P>
<P>
The project, with a cost of 9.5 billion U.S. dollars, allowed
Chinese oil enterprises to develop oilfields in western Kazakhstan
and lay a 3,000-km-long pipeline linking the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Upon completion, the annual crude oil transport volume will
reach 25 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said rail transport is now the main
transport means for his country to export oil to China.
</P>
<P>
The oil and gas departments of the two governments are
still negotiating on details of the project, according to
sources.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the establishment of an
oil-drilling equipment enterprise in Kazakhstan with Chinese
investment.
</P>
<P>
Even though the crude oil price on the international market has
shown a tendency toward drop, the prime minister said the trend
had "no impact" for the cooperation between the two
countries. "Only certain minor adjustment" should be made to cater
to the new situation, he said.

<HEADLINE> Paraguayan Out of Chinese League Boosts World Cup Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Paraguayan international striker
Jorge Luis Campos boosted his first World Cup chance, as well as
to become the first player out of the Chinese professional soccer
league to play in France in June.
</P>
<P>
A recent fax from the Paraguay Football Association (PFA) to
Chinese first division side Beijing Guo'an asked the club to
release Campos, the league's Player of the Year 1997, for a series
of World Cup warm-up matches, Guo'an officials said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Guo'an, last season's runners-up in the league and winners of
the League Cup, have agreed PFA's inquiry, but hopes to keep
Campos for two crucial Guo'an matches: an away contest against
Vanguards Huandao on May 17, and a home game against defending
champions and league leaders Dalian Wanda on May 31.
</P>
<P>
Guo'an had sent a return fax to discuss the issue with the PFA.
</P>
<P>
Campos would fly directly to Japan to join his national team
for the Kirin Cup tournament in Tokyo slated through May 17-21,
the Guo'an fax said.
</P>
<P>
Campos will stay in the national squad when Paraguay play
friendlies against the Netherlands on June 1, against Romania on
June 3 and against Belgium on June 6 on tour in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Paraguay national head coach Carpeggiani called Campos in a
friendly against Italy on April 22 where Paraguay were defeated
3-1, but did not pitch the left-footed striker.
</P>
<P>
Carpeggiani had kept eyes on Campos since he came to China on
the capital club's invitation in January, and made his mind to
include him when Campos became the first foreign player in Chinese
soccer league being voted the Player of the Year.

ROME, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Venus Williams saw off her younger
sister Serena again with a 6-4, 6-2 victory and moved into the
semifinals at the Italian Open women's tournament on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Venus, seeded nine, beat her unseeded sister previously in the
second round of the Australian Open in January.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Venus needed one hour and a quarter to knock
out one-year younger Serena.
</P>
<P>
The tie was more like a match between real opponents rather
than a sisters clash as a visibly irritated Serena barely touched
Venus' hand after she lost.
</P>
<P>
Serena, who were playing her first tournament on red clay, made
a series unexpected unforced errors to give the first set to
Williams' senior.
</P>
<P>
She made it to 2-2 with serve going before Venus began to play
firmly and won the following games in streak.

<HEADLINE> Cholera, Measles Attack Somalia in Rain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOGADISHU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Cholera and measles are again
taking their grip on the population in Mogadishu and other areas
as the rainy Gu' season has started pouring in most of Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The Somali people, especially the children, in the capital
and elsewhere in the country are being attacked by the two killer
diseases simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
In Mogadishu, the temporary cholera quarantines which have
recently been closed down have once again lit on their lanterns
to accommodate the cholera victims. Benadir hospital's cholera
quarantine ward is accommodating more than a hundred people.
</P>
<P>
Forlanini hospital, the largest quarantine in the capital, is
accommodating nearly 150 cholera victims infected in the past few
days. Three people including a child died Thursday night in the
hospital, part of whose cholera ward had been destroyed by rains.
</P>
<P>
The doctors are now complaining about a severe shortage of
supplies and lack of chlorination in the shallow wells of the
capital accompanied by lack of public awareness programs.
</P>
<P>
Our reporter discovered that the people accompanying the
patients are coming with their solutions in the hospital after
they were informed of the scarcity of the supplies.
</P>
<P>
Forlanini hospital is offering only two litter-bins to each
of the cholera victims who made to the hospital where as the
patients sometimes need more than 10 litter-bins.
</P>
<P>
Abdirizak Hassan Ali, Director of the hospital, said
that the number of cholera victims are increasing by the
day even though the death is not yet at its highest peak.
</P>
<P>
Ali said that on average five patients die in his hospital
per day where as the cholera victims are reaching the hospital in
an average of 20 people per day, mainly children and women.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the country, six people died and nearly one
hundred others have been hospitalized for cholera in the
northeastern town of Bosasso in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Also, more than 15 people have died in the town of Jlib, 170
km north of the troubled port town of Kismaio in southern
Somalia, in the past ten days.
</P>
<P>
The measles disease is also killing its toll. Mount Sinai
clinic is being visited by more than 30 children suffering the
disease everyday.
</P>
<P>
One of the doctors said that he has seen a woman who
lost three of her children for measles last week.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Health Authority (JHA) of Mogadishu also expressed
concern over the rapid spread of the two diseases at a time when
all of the international aid agencies have pulled out from
Somalia following the nine-day long abduction of the ten
International Red Cross aid workers in Mogadishu last month.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr Osman Mohamud Dufle, coordinator of JHA, a
task force of five agencies from Somalia and the international
community has been formed on collaborating and forming an action
plan to combat against the diseases.
</P>
<P>
However, Dr Dufle said, little has been achieved. Their plea
has been ignored by the Somali Aid Coordination Body, and the
Somalis have been abandoned by the aid agencies for what is
termed as security-related problems.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Promotes Blood Donation on Red Cross Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Two ambulances parked this morning
in the compound of the Red Cross Society of China in downtown
Beijing, and received blood donations from employees of the Society
and other volunteers.
</P>
<P>
The compound was one of eight blood donation stations opened
across Beijing today to mark International Red Cross Day,
which falls May 8 each year.
</P>
<P>
It has become an annual ritual for China's Red Cross
organizations in various cities, along with the local public
health departments, to take to the streets on May 8 and call on
passersby to donate blood.
</P>
<P>
"The government has urged civil servants, servicemen and
university students to take the lead in blood donation
nationwide," said Qian Zhengying, chairman of the China Red Cross
Society.
</P>
<P>
The Society, which takes "humanity, fraternity and dedication"
as its guidelines, is obliged to play an exemplary role in
promoting the country's blood donation, she added.
</P>
<P>
Though called "voluntary blood donors," blood providers in
China used to receive so-called "nutrition compensation fees" from
their employers or from the hospitals where they donated their
blood. Blood donation in the real sense began in 1984, when only
19 volunteers turned up in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
According to an official with the Ministry of Health, the cause
of blood donation has developed rapidly in China over the past dozen
years, but the current situation is still far from satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that of the about 800 tons of blood consumed
for clinical use across China each year, only ten percent was
donated.
</P>
<P>
China promulgated the Law on Blood Donation at the end of
1997. The law, which will come into force on October 1 this year,
stipulates that "the state encourages all healthy citizens aged
between 18 and 55 to donate their blood voluntarily," and that all
donated blood must be used only in clinical treatment and not be
traded.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry official noted that, to make blood donation
acceptable to most Chinese, it is necessary to first help them
give up the wrong idea that blood donation is harmful to their
health through the spread of medical knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Beijing media recently publicized a number of the city's
leading blood donors, one of whom has donated nearly 20,000 cc
of blood in the past decade.

<HEADLINE> 6 Export Processing Zones to Be Established in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has decided to establish six
export processing zones (EPZ) in the six geo-political zones of
the country, said Nigerian Industry Minsiter Chief Onikepo
Akande.
</P>
<P>
The zones, chiefed divided according to areas inhabited by
different tribal communities, are the Southwestern Zone,
Southeastern Zone, Southsouth Zone, Northwestern Zone, Middle
Belt Zone and Northeastern Zone.
</P>
<P>
Announcing in the capital Abuja that the move was part of the
government policy for infrastructure development, the minister
did not mention whether or not the decision has any connection
with a balance among the tribal communities, the Nigeria News
Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Akande, the plan was designed to attract both
local and foreign investors to parts of the country where
manufacturing industries would establish and produce for export.
</P>
<P>
"Generous incentives and conditions available in EPZ are also
being extended to export processing factories to be located in
different parts of the country," she said, quoted by the News
Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there is one EPZ already established in
southeastern Nigeria. Although the government has made intense
efforts to woo investment, few investors have patronized.
</P>
<P>
The Calabar EPZ is yet to be officially commissioned mainly
due to lack of investment.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the issue of investment in EPZs
will be discussed during the National Council meeting scheduled
for June.

<P>
LUSAKA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The opposition National Patriotic
Alliance (NPA) will participate in the forthcoming local
government elections if the government renews the voters
registration and addresses objections raised by the umbrella
group, Zambia Daily Mail reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Th} NPA also demanded immediate resumption of the inter-party
dialog, which broke down last December following the arrest of
former President Kenneth Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting here on Thusday, five parties in the alliance
declared their intention to participate in the polls if the
voters register is to include more voters who have become
eligible voters since last general elections held in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are the United National Independence
Party, National Party, Liberal Progressive Front, National
Democratic Party (NDP) and the Grassroots Welfare Party.
</P>
<P>
The NPA felt that the participation in the local government
elections will help to return sanity to the collapsed local
authority system in the country, said Daniel Lisulo, the NPA
Acting Chairman and National Party (NP) President.
</P>
<P>
"We consider local government administration as the most
effective guarantee of national survival as genuine democracy
thrives with full and unbridled participation of local people in
the affairs of the community," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lisulo said efforts to have the government to produce a
complete new register has failed and the only option is for the
opposition to ask for the broadening of the voters register to
have more participants in the polls.
</P>
<P>
The opposition alliance also called for immidiate
resuscitation of the inter-party dialog on the terms and agenda
agreed uopn by 31 parties last December.

<HEADLINE> Asia Society Report Calls for Reforms in Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Major reforms ranging from
stricter oversight of financial institutions, to stronger social
safety nets, to more open political systems, are required for
Asian countries hit by the financial crisis, a report of the Asia
Society said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report was issued by an Asia Society Eminent Persons Group,
which met via teleconference during March and April. The report,
finalized on April 21, 1998, was released Friday afternoon before
the conclusion of the three-day Ninth Annual Corporate Conference
of the Asia Society held here.
</P>
<P>
The report included the findings of a group of Asian and
American statesmen and business leaders "from diverse backgrounds
to take a long look out over the horizon," said Nicholas Platt,
president of the Asia Society.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled Asia at a Crossroads -- the Path Ahead,
examined the causes, consequences, and cooperative steps necessary
to restore Asian growth and avert a widening wave of repercussions
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the crisis was caused by a combination of
interacting factors -- cyclical and structural, internal and
external, psychological and material, individual and
institutional, proximate and long-term.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, not one but many parties bear responsibility for
what happened. Lenders, borrowers, credit-rating agencies,
speculators, officials, national leaders, and international
financial institutions-each played a part, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"What is clear is that the restoration of economic growth,
trade, and investment is the surest way to reduce economic
hardship, avoid social unrest, maintain political stability, and
enhance security," the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Conversely, the longer and deeper the crisis, the greater the
costs and the risks to all," it added.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that the imperative is to restore
confidence and stability in currency and financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The long term task is to reduce the risk of crisis in Asia - or
anywhere - while enabling the international system to continue to
benefit from the advantages of an increasing globalized financial
system, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that policy changes are not enough. Also needed
are basic changes in institutions, attitudes, and practices, as
well as the expertise to make the new systems effective.
</P>
<P>
The reforms cannot be accomplished overnight, it said. They
require skill, flexibility, and patience from all.
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that provided the needed changes are put
into place, the countries of East and Southeast Asia should emerge
from the crisis better positioned to improve the lives of their
citizens and to contribute to peace, stability, and prosperity in
the region and the world.
</P>
<P>
The ninth annual corporate conference was opened on May 6.
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif made the opening address,
predicting that with the support and assistance from international
agencies and countries like Japan and China, a resumption of
growth will take place in Asia within this year.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) briefed the participants of the
conference on the latest development in Hong Kong after it
returned to China on July 1, 1997 and the SAR's measures to deal
with the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Other keynote speakers at the conference included Deputy Prime
Minister Pham Gia Khiem of Vietnam, Chairman of Planning and
Budget Commission Jin Nyum of the Republic of Korea, Vice Minister
of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Long Yongtu of China,
and President Mitsuo Sato of the Asian Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
The conference was organized by the Asia Society, Dow Jones &AMP;
Company, in cooperation with Hong Kong Trade Development Council
and Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1956, the U.S.-based Asia Society is dedicated to
fostering public understanding of Asia and communication between
the United States and Asia-Pacific.
</P>
<P>
The previous eight conferences were held in Hong Kong, Bali,
Taipei, Tokyo, Singapore, Beijing, Seoul and New Delhi,
respectively.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia
and the Office of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will
continue to follow the development of recent riots in some parts
of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the commissioner's office said here Friday in
reply to a press question that if Chinese citizens of Hong Kong
have any problems in Indonesia, they can contact the Chinese
Embassy there.
</P>
<P>
Noting that riots broke out in some parts of Indonesia and some
 overseas Chinese shops were reportedly attacked, the spokesman
said, adding that the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia and the
commissioner's office have closely followed the developments in
Indonesia and the Chinese Embassy has rendered prompt assistance
to Hong Kong compatriots who had asked for help.
</P>
<P>
In February this year, the spokesman said, the Chinese Embassy
in Indonesia began to register and contact Hong Kong Chinese
citizens there. So far, a total of 166 have registered.
</P>
<P>
"Of late, riots in Indonesia are escalating. But we have
received neither call for help from the Hong Kong Chinese citizens
nor reports from the Indonesian authorities on the attacks against
Hong Kong Chinese citizens there," he said.

<HEADLINE> Elderly Japanese Man Strives for Japan-China Friendship (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Most men in their 80s begin to take
it easy and enjoy a personal life, but that is not the case with
Ichizo Kimura, chairman of the Japan-China Economic and Trade
Center.
</P>
<P>
After visiting China more than 100 times, Kimura, 81, is here
again leading a 40-member delegation to discuss bilateral
cooperation in new- and high-tech industries, agriculture, energy,
environmental protection, and the development of China's central
and western areas.
</P>
<P>
Kimura, who is also president of the Japanese International
Petroleum Trading Co. Ltd., told Xinhua that during the past four
decades and more, he met with many Chinese leaders, including the
late Chairman Mao, Premier Zhou, Foreign Minister Chen Yi, and
Liao Chengzhi who he said made great contributions to Japan-China
relations, as well as current Chinese leaders.
</P>
<P>
Summarizing his work toward normalizing Sino-Japanese
diplomatic ties in 1972, Kimura said that in the more than two
decades before the normalization of bilateral relations he had
worked for the promotion of bilateral economic and trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
During that period, he shuttled back and forth between Tokyo
and Osaka trying to persuade business leaders one-by-one to expand
business with China, which was a "painstaking and very difficult"
task, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he spared no effort to do that resolutely and boldly
as a special director, although his family members were harassed
every day by threatening telephone calls from Japanese
right-wingers, secret agents and underground societies, Kimura
recalled.
</P>
<P>
The harassment did not end until several years after the
normalization of bilateral ties, which greatly hurt his family
members, but "it was nothing but a psychological tactic," he
said.

<P>
He went on to say that in September of 1971 he organized a
delegation of business leaders in the Kansai area to visit China,
and three months later he sponsored a similar delegation from
Tokyo to visit China.
</P>
<P>
In June of 1972 he led a big delegation from the Mitsubishi
Corp. to China, said Kimura, pointing out that these delegations
were aimed at preparing public opinion for the normalizations of
bilateral ties in a bid to exert pressure on the then Japanese
Cabinet with Eisaku Sato as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He recalled with pleasure the banquet at the Great Hall of the
People in Beijing marking the normalization of bilateral relations
when he delivered a speech on behalf of Japanese non-governmental
organizations.
</P>
<P>
Some years ago, Japanese right-wingers spread the fear of a
"China threat," which was refuted by Kimura, and he voiced
"China's contributions," focusing on the fact that China's rapid
economic development would cherish a huge market instead of
constituting a threat to Asia and the world. His effort helped
many Japanese people learn about China's realities.
</P>
<P>
The "China's contributions" opinion gained attention from
various circles in Japan, especially when China declared that it
would not devaluate its currency -- RMB -- and would maintain a
continuous economic development after the financial crisis
occurred in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
He stated that China's development is in the interests of the
whole world, wishing China a greater success.
</P>
<P>
The Japan-China Economic and Trade Center was named in 1984
from the former Headquarters of the Kansai Chapter of the Japanese
Association for the Promotion of International Trade set up in
1954.
</P>
<P>
The center has 300 member enterprises involved in the promotion
of Japan-China friendship and non-governmental economic and trade
exchanges in the Kansai area of Japan.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Foreign Minister Abdus
Samad Azad on Friday called for accommodation on major national
issues.
</P>
<P>
"There must be accommodation and respect for each other's
opinion for the smooth running of the state and building
confidence among the people for the good of the country," Azad
told a function here marking the gold jubilee of the Bangladesh
Dental Association.
</P>
<P>
Azad made the call following the approval at the Jatiya
Sangsad, the country's parliament, of four bills on the country's
southeastern Chittagong Hill Tracts early this week, despite
strong opposition from the Jatiya Party and the absence of the
major opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister welcomed the decision of the opposition to
return to Parliament in early March after a half-year boycott,
saying that to take part in parliamentary activities was the only
alternative for better functioning of democracy in the country.
</P>
<P>
The four bills on local and regional government councils in the
hill tracts Parliament passed this week were reportedly aimed at
giving legal effect to the peace accord signed last December
between the government and the tribals.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which was designed to end the decades-long armed
conflict in the hill tracts, has aroused fierce attacks from the
opposition which accused the treaty of "violating" the country's
constitution.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Found Illegal Arms in S. Leone Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping force
ECOMOG has discovered a large quantity of arms and ammunition in
the Sierra Leonean capital Freetown after a week's house-to-house
search.
</P>
<P>
Freetown police headquarters said some of the arms discovered
in private premises in both east and west of the city include
AK47 and AK48 rifles, and anti-personnel grenades.
</P>
<P>
According to the ECOMOG public relations officer in Freetown,
the intense house rearching was "very successful".
</P>
<P>
The operation showed to Sierra Leoneans "ECOMOG is in full
control of the security situation in the country," he said,
quoted by a British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile the police said a Ghanaian spy serving the
Revolutionary United Front rebel group, which became allied to
the junta shortly after last May's coup to overthrow the
legitimate government, was arrested in Freetown earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
The Ghanaian was in Freetown to commence espionage and other
activities that could have threatened the security of the state,
the police said.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG, which has been charged by the Sierra Leonean
government to police the country, began to search hidden weapons
and former junta soldiers last weekend following a violent
explosion in western Freetown Friday, which killed a village
woman and destroyed a considerable number of houses.

<HEADLINE> China Confident of Maintaining Growth Rate of 8 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's Chief Trade Representative
 Long Yongtu said here on Friday that China has full confidence in
 maintaining a growth rate of 8 percent this year despite the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ninth International Corporate Conference of Asia
 Society, Long, also vice-minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said the only solution for China to the issues like
the financial crisis lies in the continued implementation of the
policy of reform and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Staying immune and learning lessons from the disastrous
financial turmoil, China has taken "serious measures" to
strengthen the reforms in state-owned enterprises, the financial
system, the government institutions, the investment systems,
housing, medical care and many other sectors, Long said.
</P>
<P>
"We have learned the lesson and if China wants to join the
mainstream of the global economy we have to open market, including
 the capital market," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has taken particular measures to strengthen
the role of its central bank while "making commercial banks really
 commercial."
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial to make our financial system sound and healthy,
and anyone, no matter how high (his rank is), has no right to
issue instructions to commercial banks," he added.
</P>
<P>
Long said China, wishing to enter the World Trade Organization,
 must maintain a relatively high growth rate and low inflation
while it decided to accelerate the negotiations on the WTO entry
and market access.
</P>
<P>
According to Long, China scored a 13.2 percent growth in
foreign trade and a surplus of 10.6 billion U.S. dollars in the
first three months this year, displaying a strong momentum of
growth.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this favorable trend to strong domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
"All this gives us full confidence in maintaining a growth rate
 of 8 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China's currency, the Renminbi, Long said China
"can not devaluate the RMB at this critical moment because it
would trigger distrust of the general public in the country's
banking system."
</P>
<P>
It is not only for the sake of the interests of other countries
 in the region but for the interests of China itself, he said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question concerning the engines or leadership
of growth in Asia, which is the theme of the conference, Long said
 China has never sought leadership in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental thing to do is to get the economy more
efficient. It is not easy to build up a market economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China now will make every effort to stimulate domestic
market and keep domestic market strong.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Refugees Flee to Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Tens of thousands of refugees from
eastern Sierra Leone's diamond-rich Kono district have fled to
neighboring Guinea, bringing new problems to the host and
international aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
The people ran to escape persecution by remnants of the junta
forces and rebels allies that are fighting against the mopping up
exercise launched by the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG
weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
But the huge number of refugees entering into Guinea has
aroused concern from both the Guinean government and the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
</P>
<P>
The State Radio in the Guinean capital Conakry Thursday quoted
UNHCR as saying that a total of 148,000 Sierra Leonean refugees
had entered the country from Kono and been registered by UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
Guinea has already ordered the setting up of a number of
refugee camps at the border area some 700 km from Conakry,
according to a British Broadcasting Corporation report monitored
here.
</P>
<P>
Expressing great concern about the accommondation of the
refugees, since the largest refugee camps could hold only 12,000
refugees, the Guinean interior minister has called on UNHCR for
immediate help.
</P>
<P>
He also urged local communities to give a helping hand to the
fleeing Sierra Leoneans. According to the report, Sierra Leonean
refugees have recently arrived in Guinea at some 4,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted UNHCR officials as saying that all the refugees
received Wednesday looked in bad shape and hungry. A number of
people, including children, are now said to be living in the bush
and feeding on wild fruits to keep alive.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen Meets Central African Republic Visitor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China has always supported the cause
of national independence and liberation of African countries and
backed their efforts to develop their economies.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen made the remark today in a
meeting with Roland Dana, a special envoy of President of the
Central African Republic Ange Patasse.
</P>
<P>
He said that China dose not interfere in other countries'
internal affairs, and that China's assistance for African nations
is unconditional.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China resumed its diplomatic ties with the
Central African Republic and Guinea Bissau in the wake of the
forging of diplomatic relations with South Africa January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Qian told Dana that the Taiwan authorities, for their own
political schemes, spend money to split the motherland.
</P>
<P>
"But they promise more than they intend to carry out," Qian
said. "They forget their commitments once they have attained
their ends.
</P>
<P>
"In this way, no real support and assistance can be given to
African nations for their economic growth," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the Chinese government thinks highly of
the political decision made by President Patasse and the
government of the Central African Republic, proceeding from the
fundamental interests of the peoples of the two countries, to
resume diplomatic ties with China.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to offer as much assistance to the Central
African Republic as it can in a bid to support its economic
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Chinese government encourages Chinese
companies and enterprises to cooperate with their local partners
in promoting the economy of the Central African Republic, Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
Dana said that his country supported the restoration of
China's legitimate membership in the United Nations 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that President Patasse has never changed, and will
never change, his "one China" position, and that when bilateral
ties were faced with twists and turns, Patasse did not change his
position, and expressed opposition and regret.
</P>
<P>
He told Qian that Patasse is prepared to correct previous
mistakes and to resume ties with China step by step following his
taking of office and the restoration of political order in the
Central African Republic.
</P>
<P>
President Patasse expressed his gratitude and appreciation for
China's support for the peace-keeping actions of the United
Nations in his country, even before the two countries had restored
diplomatic relations, he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian expressed his appreciation for Dana's efforts to resume
and develop bilateral ties, and asked him to convey greetings from
Chinese leaders to President Patasse.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China Ocean Shipping Corp. (COSCO)
today signed a contract with Dalian Shipyard and Shanghai Shipyard
for nine 1,600-TEU container ships.
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the two shipyards will deliver the
ships before 2000, sources at COSCO said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Accuses Cameroun of Threatening Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has warned Cameroun's latest
deployment of additional 2,000 troops to the disputed Bakassi
Peninsula will threaten the peace in the area.
</P>
<P>
In a statement dated May 7, the Defense Headquarters said
Cameroun is intended to gradually draw Nigeria into a war over
its claims over the oil-rich peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The statement, signed by Acting Director of Defense
Information, said "the massive build up of troops by Cameroun
along our common border violates the International Court of
Justice (ICJ) Interim Measures Ruling of March 1996, particularly
in the disputed area of the Bakassi Peninsula."
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to reiterate that we strongly believe the
peaceful resolution and the use of bilateral machinery to solve
the land and maritime boundary matters with Cameroun."
</P>
<P>
The statement called on the international community to take
steps to ensure that Cameroun complied with ICJ's tentative
declaration on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been clashing since early 1994 on
Bakassi, a territory of about 1,000 sq km and believed to be rich
in oil and fishery resources.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time in six weeks that Nigeria is accusing
its eastern neighbor of warming up for war.
</P>
<P>
Cameroun's claim to land areas around the Lake Chad Basin and
the Bakassi Peninsula is now before ICJ.
</P>
<P>
In March this year, Nigeria objected to the suit before ICJ,
stating that the two neighbors have not exhausted peaceful and
bilateral machinery for resolving their differences.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Strives to Halt Organized Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- South African security
authorities have vowed to take drastic measures to crush
organized crime, gangs and syndicates in the country.
</P>
<P>
Justice Minister Dullah Omar told parliament Thursday that he
had set up a special task team that would draft the Organized
Crime Bill, a law aimed at strengthening the hand of the police
and prosecutors in their fight against organized crime.
</P>
<P>
He said the task team would draft the legislation modeled on
the so-called Rico Act (Racketeering Influenced Corruption
Organizations Act) used in the United States to deal with
problems of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the current law where the civil action is against the
person, with the new provision the action will be against the
asset. For example, a house used for drug dealing can be seized
even if there is insufficient evidence to prove that the owner
was guilty of selling drugs.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that this legislation will add significantly
to the firepower of the police and the prosecutors in the war
against crime," Omar said.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the Organized Crime Bill would be ready for
consideration by the cabinet in early August so that parliament
could pass it into law before the end of the year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Rules Out Oil Embargo on Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States has ruled out the
possibility of imposing oil sanctions against Nigeria at least for
now, saying it may not hit "the right target."
</P>
<P>
When sanctions are imposed as punitive measures against
governments, it is usually the common people who suffer,
said U.S. Ambassador to Nigeria William Twaddel, quoted
by local press Friday.
</P>
<P>
With the progress of Nigeria's transition to civil rule, the
five registered political parties of the country have adopted the
Head of State, General Sani Abacha as their sole consensus
candidate for the August presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Decrying this development as a failure to democratization, some
European countries have threatened to impose further sanctions on
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Effective since 1993 are limited sanctions most European Union
member states, the U.S. and Canada imposed on Nigeria for its
alleged violation of human rights and lack of transparent
democracy, which include arms and travel embargo.
</P>
<P>
The European countries, particularly Britain, have recently
begun talking about the U.S. oil embargo on Nigeria again as they
proposed years ago as a powerful means to force the military
regime of this Africa's leading oil exporter to quit office.
</P>
<P>
However, during a chat with journalists here Thursday, Twaddel
questioned the efficacy of a U.S. oil sanction on the Abacha
regime when Nigeria could always find customers elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
For sanctions on Nigeria to be effective, they must be imposed
collectively by the international community, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is not a surprise to observers that the U.S. would refuse
to impose oil embargo on Nigeria because half of the west African
country's quality crude oil exports is meant for the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the envoy reiterated his government's request on
the democratic transition program in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
To the U.S., he said, "what was described as transition to
democratic process that will result in a civilian administration
does not satisfy the standards of a democratic process."
</P>
<P>
In Nigeria's current transition process, "elements of
competition, open access, ability to circulate and freely attract
support have not been kept," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also denied the allegation by Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom
Ikimi that foreign countries were behind the May Day riot in the
western city of Ibadan, in which at least seven people were
killed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. doest not advocate or encourage in any way the use of
violence by citizens, Twaddel said, adding that he and other
diplomats were surprised to hear the accusation and demanded
evidence from the Nigerian government.

<P>
HONG KONG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations health official
Friday called for strong partnership within the community to fight
against AIDS, which is not simply a health crisis, but a social
and economic problem.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Peter Piot, executive director of UNAIDS, the joint United

<HEADLINE> Direct Sales Ban Not Directed Against U.S. Firms, Official Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor Wu Yi said
today that the ban of direct sales by the Chinese government is
not directed against any foreign businesses, including U.S. firms.
</P>
<P>
She made the remark during a meeting with representatives
of eight U.S. firms which have business in China.
</P>
<P>
Wu cited direct sales as one of business operation models
adopted by developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Since China is shifting from a planned economy to a market
economy, its consumer psychology is immature, legislation is
inadequate, market supervision needs improvement and the quality
of sales people is low, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
She added that, because of the above reasons, direct sales have
proved unsuitable for China.
</P>
<P>
Wu said she highly appreciates the U.S. firms' support to and
understanding of the Chinese government's decision, and hopes that
relevant U.S. firms should change their business operation as soon
as possible with the help of relevant departments of the Chinese
government.

<HEADLINE> Australian Scientists May Have Seen Black Hole </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian astronomers believe they
may be witnessing what has never been seen before -- a black hole
being born as the core of a super-massive star collapsed in on
itself.
</P>
<P>
A media release issued by the Commonwealth Scientific and
Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) Friday said that this
remarkable event could be the key to explaining the enigmatic
gamma-ray bursters -- the most powerful explosions in the universe
since the original big bang.
</P>
<P>
Telescopes at Mt Stromlo near Canberra, the Siding Spring
Observatories in New South Wales, the Anglo-Australian observatory
and the CSIRO's Australia Telescope (near Narrabri) were trained
on a spectacular fireball in the nearby galaxy ESO 184-82.
</P>
<P>
The release said that Australian astronomers believed that the
fireball looked like a supernova -- the gigantic explosion that
ends the lives of stars many times bigger than our sun.
</P>
<P>
Although supernova are well studied, but there is a
once-in-a-million chance of an exploding star being so massive
that the explosion crushes its innards into a black hole.
</P>
<P>
The first indication that something unique could be underway
was a blast of gamma-rays detected last month by a European
satellite.
</P>
<P>
The gamma-ray bursters -- enormous blasts of gamma-rays that
appear at random -- usually last for just a few seconds.
</P>
<P>
Astronomers say this gamma-ray burster is the strongest ever
leading them to believe the burst of gamma-rays came from the
sudden collapse of matter into a black hole.
</P>
<P>
"But in this case, the black hole has formed in the center of a
star," University of Sydney expert Elaine Sadler said.

<P>
Hu, also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of
the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, recalled his recent
official visit to Japan, and expressed thanks for the warm
hospitality from the Japanese government.

He expressed the hope that ruling parties of both countries
would increase cooperation and continue to contribute to the

developing Sino-Japanese relations. The further expansion of
good-neighborly relationship between the two countries will have a
great impact on the future of Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
Both Japan and China should abide by the principles and spirit
enshrined in the China-Japan Joint Communique and the China-Japan
Peace and Friendship Treaty, and further advance the friendship
cause initiated by statesmen of the older generation, Hiromu said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that both sides would take President

<HEADLINE> Israeli Allied Militiaman Killed by Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A senior officer of the Israeli
allied South Lebanese Army (SLA) was killed Friday in a bomb
explosion in south Lebanon, the country's Orient Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was believed to be planted by guerrillas at the
officer's home in the village of Farahoun in the SLA-controlled
Jezzine, about 30 kilometers north of the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the
killing.
</P>
<P>
But the radio said Iranian-backed Hezbollah claimed
responsibility for a roadside bomb early this morning in the
Israeli occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah said that one of its units donated the roadside
bomb targeting an Israeli patrol who was passing by the area of al
Solhani in the western sector of the zone. But it gave no further
details about the attack.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas also fired mortar rounds on the Israeli
positions in the area between the villages of Sujud and Bil
Klab in the central part of the zone.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer border enclave in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its northern
towns from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been engaged in a
guerrilla war trying to drive the 2,000 Israeli troops and its
allied SLA out of south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Maintain Status of Entrepot: Business Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's business leaders have
expressed the confidence that the city will maintain its status as
a regional trade and financial center.
</P>
<P>
James Tien, ex-chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce,
said at the on-going Asia Society Annual Corporate Conference that
Hong Kong's role as an entrepot and regional financial center will
be maintained despite the economic slowdown caused by the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has enjoyed political and social stability and is an
important trade partner of many countries and regions. It provide
abundant job opportunities not only for local people but also for
people of other countries in the region, Tien said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's role as an entrepot and trading center of the
Asia-Pacific region is determined by its relationship with China's
inland areas, Tien pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Whether China will be open or closed to the outside world and
whether it will be stable or not will have an effect on Hong
Kong's development, Tien said.
</P>
<P>
China's opening up to the outside world in the late 1970s had
promoted the development and expansion of Hong Kong's services
sector and the development of factories across the border, he
added.
</P>
<P>
In the 20 years since 1978, Hong Kong's economy has changed
dramatically and both domestically and throughout the world, he
said.
</P>
<P>
China's share in Hong Kong's external trade has increased to
more than a third of the total merchandise trade compared with 10
percent 20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Tien said that Hong Kong has its advantage in information
technology and infrastructure and is closely linked with the
inland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, he added, Hong Kong's investment in
China's inland area has totaled 72 billion U.S. dollars while the
latter invested about 40 to 50 billion U.S. dollars in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The continued development of Hong Kong, particularly the
opening of the new airport later this year, will better facilitate
 the international business community, Tien said.
</P>
<P>
Michael Sze Cho-cheung, executive director of the Hong Kong
Trade Development Council, said Hong Kong has become a "new model"
of entrepot over the past years.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's offshore trade is estimated at around 135 billion
U.S. dollars but tightly controlled in Hong Kong, according to
Sze.
</P>
<P>
In the future, he said, Hong Kong should maximize its advantage
at the global level, particularly its advantage in technology.
</P>
<P>
He added that Hong Kong's technology advantage can fill the
deficit in China's inland areas.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Initiates Drug Education in School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's National Drug Law
Enforcement Agency (NDLEA) has initiated drug education in school
curriculum and education awareness program in order to stem the
tide of drug abuse and preserve the future of the youths.
</P>
<P>
The project has already received the blessings of relevant
educational bodies in the country, according to press reports
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted NDLEA Chairman Maj.-Gen. Musa Bamaiyi as
saying that the components to the drug education in primary and
post primary schools have been infused into existing relevant
school subjects.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the infusion of drug education into school
curricula is to enable the students to be aware of the dangers
associated with drug abuse by providing them with factual
information as well as help the youths guard against a
development of drug dependency.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that some 300,000 Nigerians below the age of
40 are addicted to hard drugs, while 90 percent of crimes
committed in urban areas are related to drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
A non-governmental organization, Partnership for Drug-Free
Nigeria, further said about 50 percent of the country's road
accidents occurrd as a result of drivers' use of hard drugs.
</P>
<P>
With the drug education, Bamaiyi pointed out, students can be
equipped with problem coping skills and solving mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that schools were gradually being turned to
places where drugs are sold and consumed instead of being centers
for knowledge acquisition and learning.
</P>
<P>
This is a development calling for urgent attention and
solution.
</P>
<P>
He therefore also announced that in order to reinforce the
curricula, NDLEA, in collaboration with the Ministry of
Education, had launched the formation of drug-free clubs in
secondary schools nationwide as well as in tertiary institutions.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of these clubs would ensure that peer groups
in schools could serve as good role models for others and assist
in the early identification and management of pupuils with drug
problems.

<HEADLINE> China Confident of Maintaining Growth Rate of 8 Percent: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's Chief Trade Representative
Long Yongtu said here on Friday that China has full confidence in
maintaining a growth rate of 8 percent this year despite the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ninth International Corporate Conference of Asia
Society, Long, also vice-minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said the only solution for China to the issues like
the financial crisis lies in the continued implementation of
reforms and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Staying immune and learning lessons from the disastrous
financial turmoil, China has taken "serious measures" to
strengthen the reforms in state-owned enterprises, the financial
system, the government institutions, the investment systems,
housing, medical care and many other sectors, Long said.
</P>
<P>
"We have learned the lesson and if China wants to join the
mainstream of the global economy we have to open our market,
including the capital market," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has taken special measures to strengthen
the role of its central bank while "making commercial banks really
commercial."
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial to make our financial system sound and healthy,
and anyone, no matter how high (his rank is), has no right to
issue instructions to commercial banks," he added.
</P>
<P>
Long said China, wishing to join the World Trade Organization,
must maintain a relatively high growth rate and low inflation
while it decided to accelerate the negotiations on the WTO entry
and market access.
</P>
<P>
According to Long, China scored a 13.2 percent growth during
the first three months of the year and a foreign trade volume of
10.6 billion U.S. dollars, displaying a strong momentum of growth.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this favorable trend to strong domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
"All this gives us full confidence in maintaining a growth rate
of 8 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China's currency, the Renminbi, Long said China
"can not devaluate the RMB at this critical moment because it
would trigger distrust of the general public in the country's
banking system."
</P>
<P>
It is not only in the interests of other countries
in the region but in the interests of China itself, he said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question concerning the engines or leadership
of growth in Asia, which is the theme of the conference, Long said
China has never sought leadership in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental thing to do is to get the economy more
efficient. It is not easy to build up a market economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China now will make every effort to stimulate domestic
market and keep domestic market strong.

Hu, also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of
the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee, said that to bring
vigorous, long-term and stable Sino-ROK relations into the 21st
century accords with the interest of the two peoples, and will also
benefit the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and the
whole of Asia.
</P>
<P>
Both countries should follow the trend of history and the
willingness of their people to promote a stable and healthy
development of bilateral ties, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the purpose of the delegation is to further promote
the overall progress of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral links have progressed comprehensively in the last six
years since the establishment of diplomatic ties six years ago,
Lee said, and the ROK appreciates China's assistance with his
country's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The ROK delegation is here at the invitation of the Chinese
Communist Party and, apart from Beijing, it will also tour
Chongqing and Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Provide New Aid to Laos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Affairs Minister
Alexander Downer announced Thursday that Australia will provide a
new four-year aid program to the Laos People's Democratic
Republic, Pathet Laos News Agency (KPL) reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Downer said that he was pleased to announce that Australia
would provide a guaranteed minimum of $A 56 million (36 million
U.S. dollars) for Laos from July 1998 to June 2002. This will be
an increase of almost 20 percent over the previous four-year
pledge of $A 47.5 million.
</P>
<P>
It is also likely that substantial additional assistance will
be provided on top of the guaranteed minimum.
</P>
<P>
The pledge means Laos is one of only very few countries in the
world for which Australia has provided a multi-year guarantee of
funding. The Laos aid is among Australia's ten largest programs
and Australia will remain one of the largest bilateral donors to
Laos.
</P>
<P>
The assistance focuses on education, health and rural
development, with special emphasis on reducing the mortality rate
among mothers and infants. At present about one in ten children
born in Laos will die before their first birthday.
</P>
<P>
The new pledge will allow the continued support of projects
targeted at long-term poverty reduction. Two important areas of
concern are the promotion of primary education for rural women and
girls and clearing unexploded bombs.
</P>
<P>
Australia will also continue to focus strongly on supporting
activities that help mitigate the effects of the current economic
crisis.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Coffee Quality Lowers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's coffee quality has
lowered considerably due to adverse weather conditions, price
fluctuations and difficulties experienced in transition from
state control to free market system.
</P>
<P>
Only 22 percent of export coffee attained the top eight grades
in 1996 compared to 48 percent in 1980, Daily News Friday quoted Lesion
Ngigwana, the Arusha Regional Agriculltural Officer, as reporting.
</P>
<P>
Production of clean coffee in smallholder farms fell to an
average of 190 kilograms of per hectare, compared with an average
of 700 kilograms in Kenya, or equivalent to what Tanzania used to
produce in the 1970s, Ngigwana said at a workshop ended in Arusha
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At a farmers company linking workshop, Ngigwana called for
close links between farmers and companies in minimizing
production costs.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the government to create an environment in
which private farmers and private companies can work together and
ensure the quality of goods and environmental sustainability.
</P>
<P>
The workshop was organized by Finance and Advice in
Development Assistance to Small Enterprise Promotion (FAIDA-SEP).
</P>
<P>
Tanzania's coffee is mainly produced in Arusha, Kilimanjaro
and Mbeya regions. Coffee export earnings over the past three
years totalled 120 million US dollars and accounted for 15
percent of all commodity exports.

<HEADLINE> Ross Arrives In Israel to Save Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Middle East Peace Envoy
Dennis Ross arrived here Friday for talks with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the U.S. proposal ahead of the
Washington summit scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ross's return to the region was on the request of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
He phoned U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright Thursday,
saying that he had to work out with Ross Israel's "yes" or "no"
answer to the U.S. proposal, which calls for further 13.1 percent
Israeli troop pullback from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
But Israel has so far insisted on no more than 9 percent of the
handback, while the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Chairman
Yasser Arafat has accepted the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The London meeting on May 4, during which Albright held talks
separately with Arafat and Netanyahu to try to revive the stalled
Mideast peace process, failed to make a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
And U.S. President Bill Clinton extended conditional invitations
to Netanyahu and Arafat for a Washington summit Monday. Clinton
demanded Netanyahu accept the U.S. proposal before going to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu said on Thursday that he was not sure if he
could get to Washington on schedule considering that Israel's
decision-making must take some time.
</P>
<P>
Ross is to start his talks with Netanyahu Friday afternoon.
And an Israeli cabinet meeting will be held Sunday to make a final
decision on the U.S. proposal.

<HEADLINE> S. African Foreign Ministry Crippled by Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo warned Thursday that the current budget cuts
on the ministry were threatening the country's national
interests.
</P>
<P>
In a speech delivered on his behalf by his deputy Aziz Pahad
in parliament, Nzo said the budget cuts had forced a further 10
foreign missions to close and resulted in staff cuts, newspapers
published here reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I must point out that we simply cannot continue to reduce our
operations in the international field so severely, and still
expect to pursue our national interests effectively," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the spending levels for the three years of the
medium-term expenditure framework, from 1998/99 to 2000/01, meant
further closures and cutbacks in staffing.
</P>
<P>
The department's actual expenditure for the 1997/98 financial
year was 1.303 billion Rand (261 million U.S. Dollars) and this
had been reduced in the new budget to 1.211 billion Rand (242
million U.S. Dollars), a seven percent reduction.
</P>
<P>
With inflation, this meant a real decrease of more that 12
percent, despite a dramatic increase in demands on missions by
government and the private sector, Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
The department's allocation is expected to fall further to
1.197 billion Rand (239 million U.S. Dollars) in the 1999/2000
year and to 1.154 billion Rand (231 million U.S. Dollars) in the
third year of the framework, Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said the funding shortage would affect the pursuit of the
ministry's policy objectives, including setting up missions in
priority areas in Africa and Asia, a permanent seat on the United
National Security Council and an African peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
He said missions abroad were, in concert with the Trade and
Industry Department, playing an increasingly important role in
attracting foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
"We will not be able to maintain present levels of investment
and assistance if we have to decrease the efficiency and capacity
of our diplomatic missions," he said.

<HEADLINE> Intel Chief Sees Internet as Panacea for China's Small Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's small enterprises should be
ready for one leap into the age of online business without going
through the phase of using independent computers in their
operations, a leader of the global information industry said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Grove, chairman and chief executive officer of Intel
Corp., the largest manufacturer of computer chips in the world,
told Xinhua that in the global market, demands for data
communication far exceed demands for voice communication.
</P>
<P>
He said that this worldwide trend will sweep China in the near
future, though the country has seen rapid growth in telephone and
other voice communications in recent years because of its
relatively weak telecommunications base.
</P>
<P>
Telecommunications enterprises in China and the world should
"take a deep breath and plunge into the tide of data communication
in a purposeful way rather than as an afterthought," he said.
</P>
<P>
James W. Jarrett, Intel vice-president and president of Intel
China, said that the company has taken concrete measures to
promote the company's momentum. Intel's software laboratory in
Shanghai has shifted the focus of its cooperation with China's
software industry to the area of computer network applications for
small- and medium-size businesses.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1997, Intel has called together major software and
hardware producers in China to hold seminars promoting the
adoption of information technology in small enterprises in Beijing
and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
At these seminars, Intel explained the importance and growth
trend of network computing to decision-makers with Chinese
enterprises and administrators of the information industry.
</P>
<P>
Martin Wu, marketing manager of Intel China, said that the
U.S.-based firm will join hands with the major computer
manufacturers in expanding the coverage of this activity all over
China.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese computer manufacturers have already held such
seminars in the cities of Wenzhou and Fuzhou in east China.
</P>
<P>
Grove said that China is a major driving force in the global
computer industry. Total sales volume of computers in China is
expected to reach 4.5 million this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
The end of this decade will mark a turning point for all
businesses, he said, adding that commercial transactions will be
increasingly from computer screen to computer screen.
</P>
<P>
"Enterprises' investment in information technology is not
luxury, but a strategic necessity," he said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Hosts Computer Festival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The first Zhongguancun computer
festival, with the theme of "Zhongguancun -- Promoting Information
Technology in China," opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The five-day festival consists of a series of activities
including seminars, an exhibition of newly developed software,
search of information on the Internet, selling computers with
discounts and on-line exchanges of personnel.
</P>
<P>
The four-kilometer-long street, named "China's Silicon Valley"
in the Haidian District, was decorated with colorful balloons and
flags to celebrate the festival.
</P>
<P>
The festival is part of celebrations marking the 10th
anniversary of the founding of the Beijing High-tech Development
Zone, the country's first.
</P>
<P>
Zhongguancun now has more than 2,900 enterprises involved in
the development and production of computers and related
technologies.
</P>
<P>
Zhongguancun earned more than 2 billion yuan from the sale of
software in 1997, and its software exports accounted for more than
60 percent of Beijing's total.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 computer companies, including world computer
giants, attended the festival.

on Thursday became the first woman to compete in a professional
sports event in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Ingberg, 1995 world bronze medallist, won her event at an
international meeting here in which women's events were featured
for the first time.
</P>
<P>
In others races, Olympic champion Donovan Bailey won the 100
meters by beating fellow Canadian Bruny Surin, while Kenya's John
Kibowen, world cross country champion over four kilometers, won
the 1,500 meter.
</P>
<P>
The meeting would not have been granted Grand Prix status by
the International Amateur Athletic Federation if the Qatari
officials have excluded women's events.
</P>
<P>
But women athletes were only allowed to dress in T-shirts,
singlets, cycling shorts and track suit trousers, according to a
dress code introduced by Qatar.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20,000 crowd were presented in the historical event,
including thousands of women viewers.

JOHANNESBURG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The number of Internet users
in Namibia more than doubled last year and the country's cellular
phone subscribers also grow sharply, according to a United
Nations report released recently.
</P>
<P>
The report of the U.N. International Telecommunication Union
(ITU) said that the number of Namibian computers linked directly
to the Worldwide Web jumped from 262 in 1996 to 640 in 1997,
ranking Namibia the second most on-line sub-Saharan African
country, only after South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Cellular phone users in Namibia grew from 6,644 to 12,500 in
the same period, South African Press Association (SAPA) Friday
quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 15,000 new telephone lines were installed between
1996 and 1997, a 100 percent increase in the number of
conventional phone lines installed in the previous year, the ITU
said.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government is drafting a new telecommunications
policy which is expected to pave the way for further
liberalization of the sector, the SAPA report said.

SINGAPORE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Share prices declined further on
the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times Industrials
Index (STII) lost another 7.75 points to close at 1420.75 points
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that jitters following Thursday's volatility and
expectations of more nasty shocks on the regional front cast a

</P>

Investors were also unprepared to commit fresh positions ahead

The total market volume was thin at 104.62 million units,
valued at 235.68 million Singapore dollars (about 145.48 million
U.S. dollars). Declines led advances by 176 to 117, while 301
other counters remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
Easyknit was the most actively traded stock as it registered a
turnover of 13.92 million units. It was followed by Singapore
Technologies (ST) Engineering which had 6.44 million shares
traded. Hong Kong Land was next with 6.21 million units changed
hands.
</P>
<P>
CDL Ho led the gainers of the day as it rose by 1.1 dollars to
finish at four Hong Kong dollars. UOB (United Overseas Bank)
Foreign increased by 25 cents to end at seven Singapore dollars.
City Developments and Jurong Shipyard were up by 15 cents each to
close at 6.7 and 7.55 Singapore dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the downside, Tong Meng was the biggest loser as it declined
by 1.6 Singapore dollars to end at 2.8 dollars. Creative 50 fell
by 70 cents to close at 30.3 Singapore dollars, while Asean was
down by 50 cents to finish at 6.7 US dollars.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda Electricity Board (UEB)
has taken new measures to stimulate investment and increase power
distribution.
</P>
<P>
The UEB is to meet the cost of power materials incurred by
investors during installation so that the expenses can be
reimbursed through monthly rebates, the New Vision, a daily paper
published here Friday reported.
</P>
<P>
The board has also scrapped the legislated minimum amount it
was charging on some installations, replacing it with the actual
charge.
</P>
<P>
"Instead of the legislated minimum every investor will be
charged for the actual power consumed, for power which is less
than the minimum" said Daniel Musiitwa, an official with the
Uganda Investment Authority said.
</P>
<P>
The authority hailed the measures as a welcome gesture from
the key supplier of power.
</P>
<P>
"For those who install their own power, they will be
subtracted from what they should be paying until the full money
is recovered," she added.

<HEADLINE> Joint Venture Delivers Jet Engine Parts to Rolls Royce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A Sino-British joint venture based in
northwest China's Xi'an city has recently delivered its first
parts for the Tay engine to Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that China's air-component producing technology
has joined world leaders, said an official with the Xi'an firm at
a ceremony held here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
With an investment of 30 million U.S. dollars, X.R.
Aerocomponents was jointly set up by Rolls-Royce and China's Xi'an
Aero Engine Corp.
</P>
<P>
The demand for the product is increasing, said the official,
predicting possible sales by 2000 of 22 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The delivery of the first parts to Rolls-Royce well within a
year confirmed our confidence in the tremendous potential for our
future collaboration with China," said Colin Green, director of
operations for Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the low-pressure nozzle guide vanes (NGV) for
the Tay engine -- which powers the Fokker 100 and the Gulfstream
IV -- the firm also produces high pressure NGVs.
</P>
<P>
Rolls-Royce has cooperated with China for 36 years and its jet
engines are in operation or on order with 10 Chinese operators.

<P>
LAGOS, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Following are the major news items in
leading Nigerian newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
New Nigerian:
</P>
<P>
-- Nigeria Thursday said the Camerounian government has
deployed 2,000 troops to a missile center near the Nigerian
border, a threat to the current situation at Bakassi, an oil-rich
peninsula both countries have claimed the ownership.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States government has not considered an oil embargo
on Nigeria as a viable santion to force the military out of power
because such option would not necessarily affect the leadership but
rather the citizenry, U.S. Ambassador William Twaddel said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
This Day:
</P>
<P>
-- The Nigerian government, in keeping with its pledge to
ensure speedy disposal of cases arising from elections, announced
Thursday the constituting of election tribunals in all the states
to entertain petitions emanating from the State and National
Assembly elections.
</P>
<P>
Daily Times:
</P>
<P>
-- All those caught in connection with the May Day disturbances in
Ibadan, west Nigeria's Oyo state, which left at least seven people
dead, will be treated as prisoners of war, the state military
administrator announced Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Higher as Bad News Eases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar pushed higher
Friday as the negative shocks which have driven the currency to
its recent lows abated.
</P>
<P>
It closed the local session near its highs of the day at 63.83
U.S. cents from 63.58 U.S. cents late Thursday.
</P>
<P>
MMS currency strategist Alex Douglas said the round of negative
news that has weighed on the Australian dollar this week began to
ease Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the immediate shocks that have forced us down to the
low here have faded a little bit, they are certainly still there,
but the initial shock has gone," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar's slide this week began with Monday's
release of a record March trade deficit of 1.33 billion Australian
dollars (851.2 million U.S. dollars) which led to speculation that
Australia's sovereign credit rating might be downgraded.
</P>
<P>
Interpretations of the Reserve Bank of Australia's semi-annual
statement on monetary policy Thursday, and the threat that the
Asian crisis is going to flare up again, also conspired to knock
the currency down to a recent low of 64.40 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
However, reduced speculation of an interest rate in the near
term following testimony by Reserve Bank of Australia governor Ian
Macfarlane Thursday -- indicating a rates-on-hold stance -- has
provided some relief for the currency.
</P>
<P>
An MMS Standard &AMP; Poor's survey has found that 79 percent of
market analysts and economists now expect rates to remain on hold
through to the end of the June quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 84.77 from 85.72 against
Japanese yen, and at 1.1212 from 1.1236 against Deutsche marks.

<HEADLINE> Londoners Favor Own Powerful Mayor in Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
said on Friday he was delighted that Londoners had endorsed his
plan for an elected mayor for the capital, whose city-wide council
was abolished by former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in 1986.
</P>
<P>
"This will be a great boost for the capital. For many years I
have believed that elected mayors would strengthen local
government," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Referendum results released on Friday showed 72 percent backed
the plans to elect directly a powerful London Mayor. However only
34 percent of London's five million voters had turned out.
</P>
<P>
The future mayor of London, to be elected in the year 2000,
will inevitably become a national figure similar to the
often-controversial U.S. mayors in cities like New York and
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Blair's Labor party suffered the first substantial
electoral setback early Friday with a heavy loss of seats in
English local councils.
</P>
<P>
The voting on Thursday for over 4,000 seats on local councils
across England took place just a year after Blair's general
election victory gave him a massive 179-seat parliamentary
majority.
</P>
<P>
Labor won 38 percent of the vote on Thursday compared with
44 percent at last year's general election. The opposition
Conservatives were barely changed on 32 percent. The third largest
party Liberal Democrats won 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to BBC calculations, with virtually all results in,
Labor party had a net loss of just under 100 seats and the
Conservatives had won around 250. The Liberal Democrats had lost
about 100 seats.

<HEADLINE> Noise Controls Aim to Ensure Quiet College Entrance Exam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China will try to reduce noise
pollution to ensure quiet for college entrance examinations in
June and July.
</P>
<P>
Yearly college entrance examinations are always arranged on
July 7-9 in China. In previous hot summers, many applicants
complained that their study and exams were disturbed by excessive
noise by vehicles and construction work.
</P>
<P>
The State Environmental Protection Administration (SEPA)
recently issued a circular requiring governments at all levels to
adopt efficient measures to stop construction sites, recreation
halls and outdoor gatherings from making excessive noise.
</P>
<P>
The circular also bans the use of tweeters and horns in
residential quarters.
</P>
<P>
Hot lines will be open to the public and work units or
individuals who break the noise rules will be punished, officials
with SEPA said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A slide in News Corp shares
combined with a weaker resources sector pushed the Australian

percent, down to 21,352.6.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index still managed to add 8.9 points to
close at 4793.6, however lower commodity prices overnight saw the
resources index dip 9.4 points to 1169.8.
</P>
<P>
Resources giant BHP fell to 14.00 Australian dollars before
midday, and recovered most of its losses at close just half a cent
softer.
</P>
<P>
Rio Tinto tumbled 26.3 cents, WMC fell nine, Woodwide was off
12, Petsec shed 22 and Comalco lost seven cents.
</P>
<P>

300 U.S. dollars an ounce overnight. Locally, bullion was trading
1.00 U.S. dollar weaker at 298.80 per ounce.
</P>
<P>
The gold index finished 21.8 points lower at 1294.3.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Telstra sat at the top of the turnover table, with a hefty
25.85 million changing hands worth 94.44 million Australian
dollars.
</P>
<P>
National turnover reached 306.38 million worth 998.27 million

<P>
MOSCOW, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A Russian Proton-k booster-rocket
successfully launched the U.S. Echoster-4 communication satellite
at 3:45 Moscow time (0:45 GMT) on Friday from Baikonur cosmodrome,
Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax news agency quoted the press service of the
Strategic Missile Force as saying that in 6 hours 38 minutes after
takeoff the satellite should separate from the booster rocket and
enter its orbit at an altitude of 35,786 kilometers in apogee.
</P>
<P>
The satellite was manufactured by U.S. Lockheed-Martin on order
from Echoster Space Corp., the report said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the satellite the first three satellites in the series
were launched with the U.S. Atlas rocket while the launch of the
fourth was ordered by the Russian Khrunichev space center.
</P>
<P>
The value of the contract has not been disclosed but is
believed to be within the limits of a regular launch cost. Each
commercial launch of Proton-K costs 65-75 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Russian Megaruss group has insured
Proton-K against all risks during pre-launch preparations and
launching for about 4 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Stock Market's Bull Shows Tiredness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus stock market's bull run
which has led to a capital gain of 17.6 percent so far this year,
showed signs of tiredness this week.
</P>
<P>
A market review released by the Cyprus Investment and
Securities Corporation Limited (CISCO) here Friday showed that
this year's steep rise was arrested by profit-taking and
U.S. Presidential Envoy Richard Holbrooke's failure in his peace
mission on the island earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
The CISCO All-Share Index dropped by 16.3 percent Tuesday after
Monday's loss of 8.6 points.
</P>
<P>
However, investors moved in again Wednesday and Thursday and
the market started, despite at a slower pace, covering the lost
ground.
</P>
<P>
The CISCO All-Share Index closed Thursday at 457.9 points, with
a weekly loss of 15.5 points.
</P>
<P>
The week's total volume of transactions on the first four
trading days was 8.4 million Cyprus pounds (about 16.8 million
U.S. dollars) compared with last week's 14.9 million pounds (about
29.8 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the review predicted the with the 1998 economic
prospects remaining bright and especially in the tourist industry,
the stock market is poised to continue its uptrend, although
periods of consolidation are desirable, so as to give time to the
bulls to rest.

<HEADLINE> 17 Middle Schools Start Air Force Pilot Training Classes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese air force has increased
efforts to cultivate better pilots by providing training for
middle school students.
</P>
<P>
Senior middle schools students who pass the selection process
attend classes on aviation, flight psychology, general curriculum,
and reinforced physical training with good health care.
</P>
<P>
The early training in middle school will make recruitment work
easier, according to Col. Bai Liniu, who is in charge of pilot
recruitment. He says that they used to focus on selection, but
neglected early training, and that there has been a drop in the
number of pilots qualifying and the quality of air force pilots
since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
According to sources at the PLA air arm, 17 middle schools
across the country now have classes that serve as early training
centers, and Bai says that they've had some good results. One
middle school in Shandong Province, for example, has had 39 of its
students accepted since it started the training program three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by this initial success, the air force is planning
to increase the number of pilot training centers to about 100 over
the next five years, Bai says.

<HEADLINE> China Becoming Major Base of Leather Commodities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China has become a major center of
leather commodities in the world and is now home to more than
20,000 leather-making enterprises, according to information from
the State Statistics Bureau (SSB).
</P>
<P>
The SSB said China made leather equivalent to 90 million sheets
of cowhides, two billion pairs of leather shoes and about 70
million pieces of leather garments in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also indicate that China's growth in exporting
leather commodities has been continuous for the past few years,
while their quality has been improving.
</P>
<P>
China exported 10 billion U.S.dollars worth of leather goods in
1997 alone, a rise of 17 percent over 1996, coupled with marked
export increases in leather shoes, suitcases and satchels, and
leather garments.
</P>
<P>
China has also grown into one of the world's most important
consumer markets for leather goods. The per capita purchases of
leather shoes was 1.4 pairs annually in China, close to the global
per capita sales volume.
</P>
<P>
Chinese customers' demand for brand-name leather goods has kept
growing in recent years, which has not only created great market
potential for importing leather commodities, but also provided a
broad area for technological exchanges and cooperation between
Chinese and overseas leather-making enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Debate on Criterion for Truth Brings Truth Back to China: Hu Jintao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
After three years of nationwide debate, the whole Party finally
came to an agreement that the mistakes made by the late Chairman
Mao during the late years of his life, especially the disastrous
Cultural Revolution from 1966-1976, should be corrected and
practice should be recognized as the sole criterion for testing
truth.
</P>
<P>
"The debate was an ideological precursor for the great
transition in the history of our Party since the founding of the
People's Republic as well as the reform and opening-up drive over
the past two decades," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
To adhere to the ideological line of emancipating the mind and
seeking truth from facts, Hu said, one must treat Marxism with a
scientific attitude; test theories, lines, principles and policies
with practice; adhere to the principle that all work should be
based on the actual conditions of the primary stage of socialism;
seize the historical trend; and Strengthen the construction of
socialist political democracy.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that China is in an important historical period as
well as a crucial stage for its reform and development, Hu
observed that the greatest importance of commemorating the debate
is to adhere to the principle that practice is the sole criterion
for testing truth, and to the ideological line of emancipating
mind and seeking truth from practice more conscientiously and
steadfastly, to improve people's ideological awareness to the
level required by the present era.
</P>
<P>
Hu called on the whole Party to bravely practice and explore
new fields under the guidance of scientific theories, and "to
tackle with new problems and contradictions under a new situation."
</P>
<P>
The forum was presided over by Ding Guangen, member of the
Political Bureau and the Secretariat, of the CPC Central
Committee, and head of the Publicity Department of the CPC Central
Committee.

<HEADLINE> China Confident of Maintaining Growth Rate of 8 Percent: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- China's Chief Trade Representative
 Long Yongtu said here on Friday that China has full confidence in
 maintaining a growth rate of 8 percent this year despite the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ninth International Corporate Conference of Asia
 Society, Long, also vice-minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said the only solution for China to the issues like
the financial crisis lies in the continued implementation of the
policy of reform and opening to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Staying immune and learning lessons from the disastrous
financial turmoil, China has taken "serious measures" to
strengthen the reforms in state-owned enterprises, the financial
system, the government institutions, the investment systems,
housing, medical care and many other sectors, Long said.
</P>
<P>
"We have learned the lesson and if China wants to join the
mainstream of the global economy we have to open market, including
 the capital market," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has taken particular measures to strengthen
the role of its central bank while "making commercial banks really
 commercial."
</P>
<P>
"It is crucial to make our financial system sound and healthy,
and anyone, no matter how high (his rank is), has no right to
issue instructions to commercial banks," he added.
</P>
<P>
Long said China, wishing to enter the World Trade Organization,
 must maintain a relatively high growth rate and low inflation
while it decided to accelerate the negotiations on the WTO entry
and market access.
</P>
<P>
According to Long, China scored a foreign trade volume of 10.6
billion U.S. dollars in the first three months, displaying a
strong momentum of growth.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this favorable trend to strong domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
"All this gives us full confidence in maintaining a growth rate
 of 8 percent," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China's currency, the Renminbi, Long said China
"can not devaluate the RMB at this critical moment because it
would trigger distrust of the general public in the country's
banking system."
</P>
<P>
It is not only for the sake of the interests of other countries
 in the region but for the interests of China itself, he said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question concerning the engines or leadership
of growth in Asia, which is the theme of the conference, Long said
 China has never sought leadership in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
"The fundamental thing to do is to get the economy more
efficient. It is not easy to build up a market economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China now will make every effort to stimulate domestic
market and keep domestic market strong.

<HEADLINE> Over 25,600 Kurdish Rebels Killed in Past Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Over 25,600 rebels of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) have been killed by Turkish
government troops over the past decade, the Daily News reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Emergency Rule Region Office Aydin Arslan told
reporters in the southeastern city of Diyarbarkir late Thursday
that the government troops' routine military operations have dealt
a heavy blow on the PKK by killing 20,379 of their members in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
As a result, he said, urban areas have been free from the PKK's
harassment and only small groups are still at large in some rural
areas.
</P>
<P>
The official said that 4,501 soldiers, policemen, village
guards and 4,628 innocent civilians have also lost their lives in
clashes with, or attacks, by the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Arslan accused certain neighboring countries of giving
financial and military assistance to the PKK, emphasizing that
some effective measures must be taken to end the support. He did
not go into details or name them.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been criticizing neighboring Greece, Iran and Syria
for backing the PKK, but the charges have been categorically
denied.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a guerilla war against Turkish
government since 1984 in an attempt to establish an independent
Kurdish state in eastern and southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Currently, a military operation, code-named "Murat" and the
largest one since 1984, is under way in four southeastern
provinces aimed at wiping out the PKK, seen by the Turkish
government as a serious threat to state security.

<HEADLINE> Australian Committee Calls for Defense Funding Boost </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Australia needs an immediate
funding boost to fulfill a 19.5-billion-U.S.-dollar bill to
replace aging defense equipment early next century, an Australian
parliamentary committee said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Funding should be increased by up to 162 million U.S. dollars a
year to help ensure that vital defense capabilities were not lost,
the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade of
Australia's Parliament said.
</P>
<P>
In the report of its inquiry into defense funding, the committee
said it could cost up to 30 billion Australian dollars (19.5
billion U.S. dollars) to replace front-line equipment.
</P>
<P>
Australia's air force's F/A-18 fighters and F-111 bombers and
the navy's guided missile destroyers and patrol boats all reach
the end of their service life in the period 2010-2015.
</P>
<P>
The committee said defense funding needs to grow by 1.5-2.5
percent a year for the next five years to add up to 250 million
Australian dollars (162 million U.S. dollars) a year to the
current 6.5 billion U.S. dollar budget.
</P>
<P>
Australian Defense Minister Ian McLachlan said the government
was very conscious of the problem of obsolescence of equipment
early next century.
</P>
<P>
"While we have not yet analyzed the report in detail, I can say
that it will certainly provide a useful input into the
government's considerations," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The coalition government has quarantined defense from budget
cuts and introduced a defense reform program to boost efficiency
over the past two years. That program will produce estimated
savings of 585 million U.S. dollars a year by 2002.
</P>
<P>
David MacGibbon, chairman of the committee, said defense
spending had fallen from 2.8 percent of gross domestic product in
1980 to under 2 percent now.

<HEADLINE> Air Quality Report for China's Major Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Xinhua released today the latest
weekly air quality report on major Chinese cities from the China
Environmental Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
It gives the air quality atmospheric pollution index (API) of
sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxide (NOX) and total suspended
particles (TSP).
</P>
<P>
Air quality is listed on five levels by the State Environmental
Protection Administration. An API from 0 to 50 is level I, meaning
excellent air quality; 51 to 100 is level II, or good quality; 101
to 200 is level III, or slight pollution; 201 to 300 is level IV,
or medium pollution; and above 300 is level V, or heavy pollution.
</P>
<P>
This week's report says that, from May 1 to 7, no cities among
the 33 key municipalities had heavy air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Zhengzhou and Yinchuan had medium air pollution, where the
biggest problem was TSP.
</P>
<P>
Eight cities -- including Guangzhou, Beijing, Hohhot, Jinan,
Wuhan, Shijiazhuang and Harbin -- had slight air pollution.
</P>
<P>
Shantou, Fuzhou, Ningbo, Beihai, Xiamen and Zhuhai had
excellent air quality, and the remaining 17 cities had good air
quality.

insurance companies from overseas to make itself into an insurance
business center for China.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is China's largest trade and finance center and
estimates that it will be able to maintain an average annual
growth rate of 35 to 40 percent for the next five years, and have
a total premium income going from the present 9 billion to 22
billion yuan a year.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is one of only two Chinese cities where overseas
insurance companies can get involved in the insurance
business. Shanghai has about 10 domestic and foreign insurers.
</P>
<P>
This will grow to 50 by the year 2010, with the number of
overseas insurers licensed to operate in Shanghai expected to
reach 15, local industry analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Rural areas are one potential market, as well-off farmers turn
to insurance for social welfare, meaning that the life insurance
business is likely to grow faster than other insurance sectors
like property.
</P>
<P>
The Pudong New Area, a trade and finance zone in Shanghai, is
expected to become one insurance center of China, and more
insurance companies from overseas are expected to enter Shanghai's
market from there.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai also expects to establish Sino-overseas jointly-funded
insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
Overseas insurers will need to be licensed by China's central
bank and have a good credit rating and at least 10 years of
experience overseas, local officials say.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will also move to make the income tax rates of both
domestic and foreign insurance companies more uniform and give
equal treatment to overseas insurers, as more Chinese cities open
to overseas insurance companies.

<HEADLINE> Large Number of Fish Die in Central China's Donghu Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A large number of fish has died
recently in the Donghu Lake in central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The losses have so far been estimated at 150 tons by the
local environmental protection department, but fish farmers say
the actual losses are higher.
</P>
<P>
Blocks of dead fish were first spotted on May 1. Three days
later, dead fish weighing from 0.5 kilograms (kg) to 30 kg had
formed a "white belt of fish" 30 meters wide by 1,000 meters long
on the lake surface, fishermen say.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wuhan Environment Monitoring Center, the
problem was caused by serious pollution of the lake water.
</P>
<P>
Some 10 industrial enterprises around Quanqiao Lake, the
southern part of the Donghu Lake, discharge large amounts of waste
water into the lake. There are also two garbage stockpiling ground
on the lake's bank.
</P>
<P>
Last summer, many floating restaurants were on Guanqiao Lake,
polluting the water seriously.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Wuhan city government is taking measures to net
the dead fish on the lake. And, the rubish on the lake bank is
being removed.

<HEADLINE> Debate on Criterion for Truth Brings Truth Back to China: Hu Jintao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The greatest theoretical
contribution of a nationwide debate on the criterion for testing
truth two decades ago served to bring China back to the
ideological line of emancipating the mind and seeking truth from
facts, said Chinese Vice President Hu Jintao here today.
</P>
<P>
"And the greatest theoretical achievement during the past two
decades for our Party was the establishment of Deng Xiaoping
Theory," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and
head of the Party School, made the remark at a forum marking the
20th anniversary of the debate, which was jointly held by the
Publicity Department of the CPC Central Committee and the Party
School.
</P>
<P>
Looking back on the debate, Hu emphasized that the debate on
whether practice is the sole criterion for testing truth took
place when the CPC and the country were in a major historical
transition. The debate smashed the bonds of the "two whatevers"
and initiated a nationwide mind-emancipation drive guided by
Marxism.
</P>
<P>
The debate was sparked by an article titled "Practice is the
Sole Criterion for Testing Truth" published in a periodical of the
Party School in May of 1978, which revealed the innate error of
the "two whatevers" embraced by the leadership then, namely,
people should firmly uphold whatever decisions Chairman Mao Zedong
made, and steadfastly follow whatever instructions he gave.

by their families, had camped out around the warehouse since
Tuesday to demand food relief.
</P>
<P>
Cesar Camarillo, chairman of the farmer group, said they would
stop picketing if the government provides about 25 kilograms of
rice to hungry farmers each before next Monday's elections.

It was reported that some 3.4 million people in the south had
been affected by the drought and famine caused by the El Nino

fields of oil, gas and auto-making.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Kazakh Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbaev made the
pledge while attending a Sino-Kazakh economic and trade seminar

</P>
<P>
He said the six years since China and Kazakhstan established
diplomatic ties have been a time of rapid development in their

The Chinese entrepreneurs consider Kazakhstan as one of China's
important trading partners and the two sides have a sound
foundation for mutual economic and trade activities and
technological cooperation, Yu added.

Statistics show that bilateral trade volume in the first
quarter of this year reached 101 million U.S. dollars, up 19.1

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Transient Workers Rush to Fields </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Zhou Dakuang, once a surplus farm
laborer from China's largest transient labor center, Anhui
Province, has become an enviable figure in the eyes of his fellow
villagers with the profits he earned from farming a piece of land
in Shanghai's suburb.
</P>
<P>
His 1.7-hectare farm yields an average 50,000 yuan of net
profit annually, 10 times the income earned from his job in urban
Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
While it was not an easy choice for the former farmer-turned-
contract worker to quit his hard-found job two years ago, when he
became aware of the government's persistent priority on
agriculture he made the decision to be a farmer again, though this
time on land in Shanghai's suburbs.
</P>
<P>
Zhou is not the only one who has found this route to good
fortune. An increasing number of his fellows are eyeing the
trend. Many have been quitting their service or labor jobs in
large cities and gone back to the fields. Now, 50,000 people from
Zhou's home county, Huaiyuan, are engaged in farming elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
In addition to confidence in the overall development tendency,
the result should be attributed to a growing sense of
self-awareness in these transient workers, as Zhou was quoted as
saying, "I have learned from my experience these years that
farming is my only specialty, and better-developed areas need
workers as much as skilled farmers."
</P>
<P>
Coastal provinces where economies are growing rapidly have been
a prime area for these farm laborers. Large cities in the eastern
region -- like Shanghai, Suzhou and Hangzhou -- have welcomed a
large number of surplus farmers, mainly from Anhui, who have
contracted for 21,333 hectares of suburban fields for growing
vegetables to supply urban markets.
</P>
<P>
Recently, land exploration in labor-deficient provinces and
regions have proved effective in discharging redundant laborers in
the central and eastern provinces, where arable land occupancy
accounts for a mere 0.6 hectares per capita in some places.
</P>
<P>
Xiaoxian County in Anhui has bought 30 years of land use rights
on 2,000 hectares of wasteland in Shaanxi Province and selected
more than 1,000 skilled farmers to contract the land.
</P>
<P>
Another county, Fuyang, a famous grain production and
cattle-breeding center, has purchased 33,300 hectares of fertile
land in Heilongjiang Province in the northeast, where it has
projected 50 million kilograms of grain output and 30,000 cattle
in three years. So far, some 10,000 Fuyang farm veterans have been
or will be there to seek their fortune.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Woman Devotes Her Life to Caring For Giant Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Even though three months have
passed since Qiang Qiang, the oldest giant panda in the Shenyang
Zoo, died, people are fairly careful in case they will mention the
panda before Feng Huifang.
</P>
<P>
Everyone who knows Feng knows that she had a special feeling
for Qiang Qiang and that the panda's death was a real blow to her
-- after all, she looked after Qiang Qiang for 22 years.
</P>
<P>
Soon after she began work at the Shenyang Zoo in northeast
China's Liaoning Province, Feng was sent to Chengdu, the capital
of southwest China's Sichuan Province, which is the home of the
giant panda, in November of 1975 to bring Qiang Qiang, who was
less than ten years old, to Shenyang. And she became its keeper.
</P>
<P>
For 22 years, Feng devoted herself to caring for the animal and
seeing that its living conditions got better. Qiang Qiang
sometimes didn't get enough bamboo because of Shenyang's location,
so Feng and her colleagues would go to rural areas to cut reed
leaves to give to the panda, or Feng would go to local parks or
suburbs to look for bamboo.
</P>
<P>
Ten years ago, as Qiang Qiang grew older, Feng attended to the
giant panda's diet in strict accordance with a special diet
prepared by scientists.
</P>
<P>
And the years of contact allowed Feng to know Qiang Qiang very
well, to know what the panda was thinking, or whether it was happy
or not just at a glance, and she knew what the panda was doing
just by the noise it made.
</P>
<P>
Then, in January of this year, Qiang Qiang fell ill and was
sent to Chengdu for treatment. Twenty days after the panda arrived
in Chengdu, it died. Feng burst into tears when she got the news
about her friend.
</P>
<P>
Feng was a young woman when she began to look after Qiang
Qiang, and now she's middle-aged, but she says that she does not
regret one minute of the more than 20 years that she spent taking
care of the giant panda.

<P>
HARARE, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
launched the construction of the 70-million-U.S. Dollar- railway
line in southern Zimbabwe, The Herald reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The 160-kilometer line will reduce by more than 200 kilometers
the rail distance between Bulawayo, the country's second largest
city and Beitbridge in southern Zimbabwe near South Africa, and
is billed as the biggest non-mining investment in the country to
date.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ground breaking ceremony of the project at
Mazunga River Bridge in South Zimbabwe Thursday, Mugabe said the
line would also connect South Africa to the industrial heartland
of Zimbabwe, contributing to increased trade between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
It would also enhance integration and cooperation among
Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries such as
Zambia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) by carrying
transit traffic to and from these countries, Mugabe said. The
line is expected to be operational by May 1999.

</P>
<P>
The comic program was created 10 years ago, and Shanghai people
have been exposed to more than 860 episodes. It features the lives
of local people with a series of stories about Wang Xiaomao, a
fictional youngster in this Asian metropolis.
</P>
<P>
To help more people get to know Shanghai and its people in an
entertainment format, the program has been created as a cartoon

<HEADLINE> Sports Minister Sacked Soccer Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Poland's sports minister Jacek Debski
purged the entire leadership of the national soccer association
"to save the sport from scandal," he said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said; "Polish soccer is in crisis and I had to
react to this."
</P>
<P>
In April Debski suspended the long-entrenched president of
the association Marian Dziurowicz and two others, then this
week axed the rest of the committee after they backed Dziurowicz
as he continued in his duties.
</P>
<P>
Debski mentioned a row over the association's demotion of
respected referees, murky rules on imposing penalties on players
and clubs, a lack of proper club training for young people and
questionable methods for picking selectors for the underperforming
national side.
</P>
<P>
Debski has long argued that the 18-team premier league,
which often fails to interest television and attracts low gates,
should be made into a crowd-pulling super league of 10 sides --
a plan ignored by the ousted association chiefs.
</P>
<P>
The Polish national team has repeatedly failed to qualify for
European Championship and World Cup finals while the domestic
league is troubled by endless controversy.

<HEADLINE> Chinese City Dwellers Show Concern for Air Pollution (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, May 8 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of city
dwellers in China is paying attention to air pollution, which has
become one of the major concerns of the Chinese urbanites.
</P>
<P>
This is the result of a survey of 5,000 families in 10
Chinese cities done by the Lingdian Company at the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
A 65-year-old woman living in this capital of east China's
Jiangxi Province has her decades-old briquet stove lugged to a
garbage dump after her grandson tells her that the gas given off
from burning coal is harmful to her health.
</P>
<P>
The woman, Sun Shuqin, admits that she was very reluctant to
do away with the stove that she had grown so used to, but, after
all, it was polluting the air, and she is certain that what her
grandson has learned about environmental protection in school is
absolutely right.
</P>
<P>
Some 80,000 other families in the city, a fifth of its total,
are doing the same Sun did, after the urban Environmental
Protection Bureau began a project earlier this year to phase out
coal-burning stoves in two years. And, 140 small coal-burning
industrial boilers will go the same way.
</P>
<P>
The efforts seem to be paying off, according to Wang Guozhu,
of the city's Meteorology Bureau, as the air quality in the city,
which has some of the country's worst acid rain, has shown obvious
improvements in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Wang quotes local weekly air quality reports as saying that the
current amount of suspended particles and sulfur dioxide in the
air in the Nanchang area were down 31 percent and 7 percent,
respectively, from last year. And daily oxygen and nitrogen
compound indices dropped more than 93 percent, while the PH rose
from 3.26 to 4.23.
</P>
<P>
A teacher at a local primary school says the change can be seen
in the clear sky and that the fresh air makes a person feel
good. Locals have noticed that motor vehicles' exhaust fumes are
not as "aggressive" as before, and even seem a bit "friendly", and
that the heavily smoking chimneys are vanishing.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Consuming Market Facing Challenge in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's commodity market is
facing a challenge in the second quarter to meet its goal of a 10
percent increase in total sales.
</P>
<P>
An official forecast estimates the city's total sales for this
year at 147 billion yuan, up 10 percent on a yearly basis. The
target for the second quarter is 35 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
With last year's per capita gross domestic product of 3,000
U.S. dollars, Shanghai has been listed among well-off cities.
</P>
<P>
As consumer sprees for certain commodities disappear, a steady
sales growth is expected to replace the highs and lows of the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
Due to a stagnant demand for consumption, exports and
investment, Shanghai's industrial output value and exports in the
first three months recorded a slight increase compared to the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The infrastructure investment and commodity retail price
indices dropped 14 percent and 3 percent, respectively, during the
period.
</P>
<P>
A high rate of lay-offs in the city's consumer force has
resulted in prudent residential spending. Commodities such as home
appliances, automobiles and housing suffered slow sales during the
first quarter and are unlikely to change in the short run.
</P>
<P>
Spending has shifted to the securities market, medical care,
insurance and education. Public shares in corporations have also
become a common investment because of shareholding reforms.
</P>
<P>
According to an analysis by economists, some economic stimulus
has already been demonstrated. In addition to the interest cut in
March, which has reduced the debt burden on some industrial and
commercial enterprises, 40 key projects are expected to be under
way soon.

"We are increasing the use of purifying equipment in most
industrial enterprises and motor vehicles," Wang says, explaining
that environmental protection has been put high on the list of
government priorities.
</P>
<P>
The city is also trying to increase production of non-polluting
coal and the use of gas. One plan calls for the city to prohibit
the use of raw coal and increase the use of gas to 90 percent of
the city dwellers by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
When Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province, began releasing
weekly urban air quality reports last May, 27 other cities
followed suit, and that number continues to grow, sources say.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is reported to have brought air pollution under
control, with pollution index at the normal level, while Beijing,
which is home to 1.2 million vehicles, has begun to ban the use of
leaded gas.
</P>
<P>
Air quality is improving across China on the whole. However,
scientists warn that exhaust fumes from an increasing number of
motor vehicles are causing serious pollution and measures should
be taken to deal with it.

GUANGZHOU, May 8 (Xinhua) -- More overseas Chinese businessmen
are being attracted to Meixian County in south China's Guangdong
Province, with 65.14 million U.S. dollars invested and 34
agricultural projects established.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the northeastern part of Guangdong with a
population of 580,000, Meixian County is the hometown of 800,000
overseas Chinese.
</P>
<P>
An official from the county government says that most of the
investment is used to develop local agriculture. Until now, about
6,500 hectares of land have been cultivated, accounting for
one-fifth of the county's arable land.
</P>
<P>
Relatives of overseas Chinese in Meixian County also have
invested in high-yield agriculture, with 16,800 families and 41
million yuan of funds involved, exploiting 5,500 hectares of
arable land.
</P>
<P>
Meixian County government gives preferential policies to
encourage overseas Chinese investors. It strengthens
infrastructure facilities like water conservation and
communications.
</P>
<P>
Projects funded by overseas Chinese investors have also
stimulated the development of local agriculture. Meixian is now
among the country's top 100 counties for fruit production, with an
annual output of 330,000 tons and a planting area of 26,000
hectares.

investment, though this has not been shared by all countries."
</P>
<P>
The summit will also focus on the long-term implications of
the Asian financial crisis with a view of coming up with an
improved management of the trend towards a globally
interdependent financial market.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Green Vegetables Becoming a greater Part of Tibetans' Diet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A revolution is quietly taking
place on the dinner tables of an old ethnic group living on
China's Tibetan Plateau, as green vegetables enter their lives.
</P>
<P>
Tibetans used to get by only on zanba (roasted qingke barley
flour), beef, mutton, and butter tea, and humorously referred to
vegetables as "grass", a food of the Han, but they're now getting
used to the taste of "grass."
</P>
<P>
A primary school teacher in Lhasa, Gaisang Zhoima, says that
her family is now much more interested in vegetables than beef and
mutton and that they even feel odd if a meal comes without
vegetables. She says they usually have zanba and butter tea for
breakfast, rice, fried vegetables, and meat for lunch, and noodles
or steamed buns with beef or mutton filling for supper.
</P>
<P>
Then, on weekends and holidays, she is often busy cooking sea
food and vegetables. "We didn't have much knowledge of nutrition
in the past," she explains, "but with the increasing contacts with
people outside the region, we Tibetans are paying more attention
to a variety of food." And, what is more important, she says,
almost any vegetable can now be found in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1980s, the government of the Tibetan
Autonomous Region has had policies encouraging people to produce
vegetables.
</P>
<P>
Tibet now has 10 large vegetable centers, with Lhasa, the
capital, at the center, with a total of 1,200 ha of land that
produce nearly 100 million kg of vegetables each year.
</P>
<P>
They satisfy 90 percent of the local demand for vegetables,
which have grown 10 percent in popularity each year, among both
urban and rural people, in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Some other fresh vegetables and seafoods are regularly shipped
to the region.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan, Tanzanian Police Smash Car Racket </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan and Tanzanian police have
joined forces to smash a car hijacking syndicate, arresting three
suspects and recovered several luxury vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Acting on information from the Nairobi-based Car-track
company, police from the two east African countries raided a
hideout last week in Arusha, northern Tanzanian town which is
three-hour drive away from Nairobi, said a Daily Nation report
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"Police on both sides of the border moved swiftly," said
Car-track Director Chris MacDonald.
</P>
<P>
Among the detained was the suspected ringleader, a middle-man.
</P>
<P>
One of the cars, a Toyota Land-Cruiser, was stolen at
gun-point in Nairobi four days ago.
</P>
<P>
Four other vehicles recovered were also suspected to have been
stolen in Kenya. Their registration numbers had been changed.
</P>
<P>
Car-track was introduced in Kenya about a year ago. It uses a
system that tracks down a stolen vehicle through a miniature
transmitter concealed in the vehicle.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Judgeship Nominee Delayed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Senators delayed a judicial
nominee on Thursday despite an agreement by Republicans to end
resisting President Bill Clinton's choices in exchange for his
promise to appoint a conservative to another judgeship.
</P>
<P>
The Senate Judiciary Committee postponed until next week a
vote on the nomination of William Fletcher, a University of
California-Berkeley law professor, to the 9th Circuit Court of
Appeals.
</P>
<P>
Fletcher, 52, a Clinton friend who was first nominated three
years ago, has been criticized as too liberal by some
Republicans. Democrats have accused Republicans of slowing
confirmation of Clinton's nominees.
</P>
<P>
Fletcher was supposed to have clear sailing after Clinton
agreed earlier to nominate Judge Barbara Durham, a conservative
and chief justice of the Washington state Supreme Court, to the
9th Circuit court.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Senator Slade Gorton, a Republican, called
Clinton's decision to nominate Durham "a victory for the judicial
nominations process."
</P>
<P>
Senator Orrin Hatch, a Republican and chairman of the Judiciary
Committee, reportedly was surprised Thursday to learn a senator
had asked that a vote on Fletcher be delayed again.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly, this has been held up for far too long," Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the agreement to clear more Clinton nominees, some
conservatives continue to oppose Fletcher. Senator John Ashcroft,
a Republican, has contended that Fletcher appears to be a
"judicial activist" who would follow his own agenda and not legal
precedent once on the bench.
</P>
<P>
Several opponents also noted that Fletcher's mother, Betty
Binns Fletcher, already is a 9th Circuit judge. She has agreed to
take senior status -- a type of semiretirement -- once her son is
confirmed. Durham would succeed her.
</P>
<P>
The committee approved three other judicial nominations
Thursday and sent them to the Senate for consideration.

explanation as to why they have not given it to me for four years,
I think I'm not going to the Commonwealth Games," said Fredericks.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian President Looks Forward to China Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian President Peter Stoyanov said
he looks forward to visiting China on May 10 and he believes his
trip will boost the development of bilateral relationships between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Stoyanov is
scheduled to make a five-day state visit to China.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese reporters prior to his Beijing
tour, Stoyanov, the first Bulgarian president to visit China in
about ten years, said he "is anxious to make the trip."
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes the visit will stimulate the development of
Bulgaria-China ties in a variety of fields.
</P>
<P>
He believes the friendship and mutual trust between the two
peoples will help them locate areas of common interests.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of his 1992 China tour as deputy minister of justice,
Stoyanov said he still cherishes beautiful memories of the trip
that enabled him to better understand China's opening policies.
</P>
<P>
He said despite various differences in the reform patterns
adopted by the two nations, the fundamentals underlying their
reform drive are much the same.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two countries have the same wish for their
people, which is to become wealthy as soon as possible and live a
better life, he said, adding that the ultimate goal is to build a
stable economy.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov expressed the hope to further strengthen economic and
trade cooperation between the two countries. He said Bulgaria can
take advantage of China's experience while carrying out its own
reform.
</P>
<P>
Although Bulgaria is a small country, it enjoys a favorable
geographical position on the Ancient Silk Road, he said. He
believed revival of the Silk Road will draw attention from Chinese
investors.
</P>
<P>
On the trend of multi-polarization in the world, the Bulgarian
president said Central and Eastern European countries, including
Bulgaria, now face chances and challenges. They can make use of
the latest achievements in the world for their own economic
development.
</P>
<P>
He said he has heard much about China and is eager to go and
see the great country. He is looking forward to holding dialogues
with Chinese leaders in Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Killer's Letter Disclosed, Grudge Motive Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Young Swiss guard Cedric Tornay killed
his commander and the commander's wife because he had not been
given a medal, according to a letter, or suicide note, left by
Tornay that was disclosed here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The ANSA news agency said it obtained a copy of the letter
Thursday as investigations continued into the death of Swiss
Guards Commander Alois Estermann, 44, his wife, Gladys Meza
Romero, 49, and Thornay, 23.
</P>
<P>
The letter, written in French by Tornay a few hours before he
shot dead the couple and himself, appeared to confirm the
Vatican's view that Tornay acted in a "fit of madness" after being
dropped from a list of Guards to be honored by the pope this week.
</P>
<P>
"After three years, six months, and three days, they have not
given me the medal, I must prevent other injustices," ANSA quoted
Tornay as writing.
</P>
<P>
"I have been forced into what I am going to do... I do it for
the Corps," Tornay was quoted as writing.
</P>
<P>
At Tornay's funderal in the Vatican Thursday, Tornay's mother
turned and shook hands with Estermann's mother, father, brother
and sister.
</P>
<P>
Estermann and his wife received a state funderal in the Vatican
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Estermann was appointed head of the Swiss Guards about 10 hours
before he was killed.
</P>
<P>
Tornay had stayed away one night from the barracks in February
and was given a written warning by Estermann, who was then deputy
commandant of the Swiss Guard.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1506, the Swiss Guard is the world's smallest army
and one of the most colorful.
</P>
<P>
On May 6, 1527, 147 of them were killed in St. Peter's Square
protecting Pope Clement VII during the sack of Rome by the forces
of Emperor Charles V.
</P>
<P>
From then on, the Popes have preferred to have only the Swiss
nationals only to guard the Vatican.

<P>
Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of teh Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee
delivered an important speech at the forum.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Hu, also head of the Party School of the CPC

testing truth that happened 20 years ago, stressing that the
debate was launched when the party and country was at a historical
turning point and the it was led by Deng Xiaoping and other
Chinese revolutionary veterans.
</P>
<P>
Hu said the debate was an ideological guideline for the Third
Plenary Session of 11th CPC Central Committee held in late 1978,
which marks the beginning of a significant turn in the Chinese
Communist Party's history.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the debate also served as an ideological
guideline for the country's opening-up and reform drive in the
past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the debate has a significant and profound
impact on the history of the party and the country.
</P>
<P>
The forum was jointly organized by the Publicity Department of
the CPC Central Committee and the Party School. Presiding over the
forum is Ding Guangen, member of the Political Bureau of CPC
Central Committee and head of the Publicity Department of the CPC
Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
On May 11th of 1978, an article titled "Practice Is Sole
Criterion of Testing Truth" was published in Chinese
newspapers. It sparked a nationwide debate and helped lay the
ideological foundation for China's economic reform after the
disastrous, decade-long "Cultural Revolution."

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Move Ahead From Much Higher Base: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will be moving ahead from a
much higher base after its successful handling of the Asian
financial crisis, said a senior Hong Kong official here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Donald Tsang, financial secretary of China's Hong Kong Special
Adminstrative Region, made the remark at the opening ceremony of
the new Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office Building in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
One month after its historic return to China on July 1, 1997,
Hong Kong faced speculative attacks against the Hong Kong dollar,
Tsang recalled.
</P>
<P>
But thanks to the practice of Hong Kong's autonomy in line with
the Basic Law and the support of the central government in
Beijing, "Hong Kong is riding out the storm much better than
most," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang listed four reasons for the successful handling of the
financial difficulties:
</P>
<P>
-- Firstly, Hong Kong has a stable currency and a linked
exchange mechanism backed up by more than 97 billion U.S. dollars
in foreign reserves, the world's third largest such holdings, and
eight times the money in circulation.
</P>
<P>
Speculators "will not be able to make money betting against the
Hong Kong dollar," Tsang said. Those "who got burnt in October
last year learned that lesson."
</P>
<P>
-- Secondly, Hong Kong has fared better than most is that Hong
Kong has very open and well-regulated markets.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Tsang said, Hong Kong has learned that it
should also strengthen the regulatory framework to protect
investors while ensuring and maintaining the fast, free flow of
information and funds.
</P>
<P>
Improvements to enhance the ability of Hong Kong to withstand
market volatility and strengthen investor education are made on
the basis of two fundamental principles: to maintain Hong Kong's
status as an international financial center and to preserve the
linked exchange rate system which has served Hong Kong very well.
</P>
<P>
-- Thirdly, Hong Kong's long history of prudent fiscal
management has also played a key role. "We spend what we earn and
we rarely, if ever, borrow money," Tsang said. Budget surpluses
are the norm. Hong Kong's fiscal reserves now stand at 57 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
-- And, fourthly, the rule of law and a level playing field for
all who do business in Hong Kong is another reason for Hong Kong's
successul handling of financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"Our common law system remains intact, and our courts rule on
the law as impartially as they ever have," Tsang said.

<HEADLINE> India to Fortify Patent Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 8 (Xinhua) -- India would soon join the Paris
Convention on intellectual property rights to fortify its patent
front, official sources said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Joining the convention would make India eligible to join the
Patent Cooperation Treaty, Trademark Law Treaty and the Madrid
Agreement on Trademarks. This would give an Indian entrepreneur
patent and trademark protection in all member countries.
</P>
<P>
The Paris Convention would also help India gain some extra
advantages from the various agreements at the World Trade
Organization, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The government took steps to join the Paris Convention in 1992,
when a cabinet note was prepared for the proposal. At that stage,
however, it was felt that the Indian Patents Act would have to be
amended before joining the convention.
</P>
<P>
Now that India is obliged to have patent legislation by April
1999, it would do good to join the Paris Convention and help
Indian inventions and products seek patent protection in markets
abroad, the same sources further said.
</P>
<P>
Signing the convention would also send the right signals to the
foreign investors, who have been chary about India's approach to
intellectual property rights, the sources added.

<HEADLINE> Capital Inflow to Lift Thai Economy: Researchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Fresh capital worth about 38.6
billion U.S. dollars is expected to flow into Thailand in the next
12 months, which will provide a stimulus to the economy, a
financial research institute said.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Capital Research said the projection is based on five
factors, the Bangkok Post reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
They are the estimated current account surplus of about 8
billion dollars in the period, a 4.1 billion dollar increase in
banks' registered capital, about 7 billion dollars from the
Financial Restructuring Authority (FRA)'s auctions of assets of
closed finance institutions, another 7 billion dollars to be
disbursed by the International Monetary Fund, and government bond
issues worth 12.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The current account surplus now stands at 3 billion dollars,
which should be attributed to the huge turnaround after the baht
was floated last July.
</P>
<P>
Though the baht has been gaining strength in recent weeks,
stabilizing between 38-39 baht against the greenback, the current
account surplus is still expected to top 8 billion dollars by the
end of the year, researchers said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts by commercial banks to attract funds from
foreign investors have proved to be successful.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Thai Farmers Bank, Bangkok Bank and other
commercial banks launched their massive recapitalization plans.
Bangkok Bank issued 400 million new shares worth about 1 billion
dollars, which received positive responses from investors abroad.
</P>
<P>
FRA's plans to put up assets of 56 defunct finance companies
for auction are also expected to be well received. Assets of
closed companies are estimated to earn about 400 billion baht
(10.5 billion dollars), 70 percent of which are expected to come
from foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
However, researchers also predicted a capital outflow totaling
14.1 billion dollars over the same period.
</P>
<P>
Of the total outflow, 6.1 billion dollars will go to repaying
short-term offshore debts and 8 billion would be needed to repay
the Bank of Thailand's swap obligations.
</P>
<P>
Taking into account capital flight totaling about 12 billion
dollars from October 1996 until February this year, Thailand needs
 least 26.1 billion dollars if it wants to overcome the tight
domestic liquidity, researchers said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Marines to Take Thai Jet Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Marine Corps will take
eight f/a-18 jet fighters which Thailand has ordered but can not
afford after the economic crisis, the newspaper Bangkok Post
Friday quoted a U.S. Embassy statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government has not yet decided whether Thailand will
have to forfeit any of the 74.5 million U.S. dollars in deposits
paid for the planes, which are being built by McDonnell-Douglas,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
During Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai's U.S. visit in March, the
United States agreed to allow Thailand to find a third buyer for
the planes as part of a 1.7 billion dollar assistance package.
</P>
<P>
In April, there were reports that Kuwait showed interest in the
jet fighters. But the country failed to sign any contract with
Thailand. It now seems that a third country sale is no longer
possible.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton said earlier that the U.S.
government was prepared to take over the contract, limiting the
Thai obligation to the deposits and sparing Thailand 250 million
dollars in cost for terminating the contract.

<HEADLINE> Private Eurobank Closes Uruguayan Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Eurobank, a private institution,
announced closing down its Uruguayan operation because of losses
incurred -- 35 million U.S. dollars alone last year.
</P>
<P>
The bank, funded by Spanish and Chilean capital, was the first
to close down its operation in Uruguay since the return of
democracy to this Latin American country in 1985.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the Central Bank of Uruguay said Eurobank will
return deposits to savers and its closure is unlikely to affect
the country's financial system.
</P>
<P>
After the Wednesday announcement about the closure, employees
occupied the bank's installations to protest their dismissal.
</P>
<P>
With 140 employees, the Eurobank has four branch offices in
Montevideo and one in Punta del Este.
</P>
<P>
The bank has assets of 107 million dollars, liabilities of 98
million dollars, a patrimony of 9 million dollars, deposits of 96
million dollars, and credits of 85 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Uruguayan Bank Employees Association attributed the
bank's failure to inefficiency of its executives and is demanding
relocation of the dismissed employees.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine Urges Belarus to Approve Border Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine on Thursday urged Belarus to
approve and implement, as soon as possible, a border treaty signed
by presidents of the two countries last May and not to link other
issues with the document.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian foreign ministry said a country that signs an
international accord should not, by international norms, do
anything against the purpose and principle of that accord.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian Interfax news agency reported that the foreign
ministry's statement was in response to the remarks made by
Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko in Minsk on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko reportedly said Belarus was not in a hurry to
approve the border treaty as far as Ukraine still owed Belarus 215
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Summoning the Belarus ambassador in Kiev, the Ukrainian foreign
ministry expressed its astonishment at Lukashenko's remarks.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, both former Soviet republics, had already
agreed to open expert-level talks on outstanding property and
financial problems between them, the ministry noted.
</P>
<P>
The earlier implementation of the border treaty, now a key
factor in developing good-neighborly relations, is in the interest
of both countries and their peoples, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The Ukrainian-Belarus border treaty, signed on May 12, 1997, is
the first of its kind between the two countries, now both members
of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka's Per Capita Income Reaches US$814 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's per capita income has
increased to 814 U.S. dollars in 1997 from 760 dollars in the
previous year due to a significant increase in gross domestic
product (GDP), a central bank official said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka's economy grew by 6.4 percent last year compared with
3.8 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The GDP increased by 15.9 percent to 15,140 million dollars in
1997 with a mid-year population of 18.6 million.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka is gradually approaching a middle-income-level
country as a result of the rise in per capita income and
continuous good economic performance, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Hence it is believed that Sri Lanka will gradually lose the
concessional foreign funds for development from world financial
institutions and other sources in the future, the official pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka will have to raise funds in the future from foreign
capital markets unless domestic savings are raised substantially.
</P>
<P>
The official said recent statistics reveal that domestic
savings have gone up at a faster rate in recent years due to
substantial increases in the real incomes of the people.
</P>
<P>
Domestic savings accounted for 17.3 percent of GDP in 1997
compared with 15.3 percent in 1996, the official said.

STOCKHOLM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Swedish government stepped up
its fight against Nazism Thursday by hosting a seminar on the
"holocaust" and offering an eight million Swedish crown (about
1.05 million U.S. dollars) donation to the Nazi Persecutee Relief
Fund.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly-worded speech, Swedish Prime Minister Goeran
Persson told the seminar that there is "no room for compromise, no

<P>
"We have to use all democratic means at our disposal. We have

</P>
<P>
A survey among Swedish school children last year found that

<HEADLINE> Supplies Reach Cambodians in Northeast Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) has supplied rice and canned food to two refugee
camps in Northeast Thailand's province of Si Saket to alleviate
the hardship of Cambodian refugees who earlier complained about
food shortages.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here Friday, 48 tons of rice
were delivered to Huay Samran and Phu Noi camps on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Canned fish supplies are scheduled to arrive at the camps
Friday while beans and oil are due to be supplied Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR also maintained that there are sufficient food and
water supplies at both camps.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, there were reports that a number of Cambodian refugees
were facing food shortages and needing help from Thailand and
international agencies.
</P>
<P>
According to Thai Foreign Minister Surin Pitsuwan, at present
there are about 84,000 Cambodian refugees in Thai camps along the
Thai-Cambodian border and about 30,000 more have gathered at the
border ready to move across into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Thailand Thursday called for international assistance and
cooperation to help the displaced Cambodians.
</P>
<P>
Surin was quoted Friday by a report as saying that although
various Thai and foreign agencies have given support to the
displaced Cambodians, the help is insufficient as the situation
has reached a critical point.
</P>
<P>
He said additional assistance and cooperation from the
international community is essential to provide shelter and food
for the refugees on a humanitarian basis.

<P>
BELGRADE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Prime Minister Radoje
Kontic said Thursday international sanctions have seriously
hindered his country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Kontic told Astrid Hejberg, visiting president of the
International Committee of Red Cross, that his country has
received 700,000 refugees from other regions of the former
Yugoslavia, a press release issued by the Information Ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
If the international sanctions are resumed, the prime minister
said, the lives of Yugoslavians and refugees will turn even worse.
</P>
<P>
On her part, Hejberg expressed the belief that the sanctions
hurt only innocent people, and praised the Yugoslav Red Cross for
taking care of the refugees in their most difficult time.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Official: WTO Ought to Admit China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Trade Organization (WTO)
should strengthen the multilateral trading system by admitting
major world traders like China to full membership, said a senior
Hong Kong official here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Firstly, we are proud to be part of China," said Donald Tsang,
the financial secretary of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR) of China.
</P>
<P>
"We in Hong Kong very much want to see a successful and stable
China playing an important role in world affairs," Tsang said at
an official opening ceremony of the new Hong Kong Economic and
Trade Office Building in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
He also gave other reasons why Hong Kong hoped to see China's
early accession:
</P>
<P>
-- The mainland of China is Hong Kong's biggest trading
partner. It has a vested interest with Hong Kong;
</P>
<P>
-- The mainland market is so huge that it is surely a matter of
necessity -- and for the multilateral trading system itself --
that China should be fully incorporated.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said that China's early accession "will not only preserve
the integrity of the multilateral trading system, but also enhance
it considerably."

<HEADLINE> Eximbank Supports Company's Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The Export and Import Bank of China
(Eximbank) yesterday inked a package of loan agreement with
Shanghai Electric (Group) Corp (Sec) in Shanghai to back up the
company's export of power generation units and machinery and
electronic products, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, Eximbank will grant up to 240 million US
dollars in export seller's credits within three years to Sec,
according to bank sources.
</P>
<P>
The bank's financial support will help improve the structure of
China's export commodities and enhance the country's
competitiveness in the world market.
</P>
<P>
These kinds of pacts represent new trials for the Eximbank to
intensify financial support to key State-owned enterprise
groups. Such agreements will allow the bank to simplify procedures
in project assessment and guarantees, based on good credit
standing, and provide timely credit to the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Sec, one of the State-listed 57 large enterprise groups,
specializes in designing, manufacturing and marketing electricity
generators, electricity transmission equipment and other
engineering machinery, as well as home appliances. It is also
engaged in contracting engineering projects.
</P>
<P>
It has set up 130 joint ventures in developed countries,
including the United States, Germany, Japan, Switzerland, France
and Britain, while its products are exported to more than 90
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The Eximbank, one of the country's policy-oriented banks
established in 1994, is aimed at facilitating the exports of
high-tech and high value-added machinery and electronic products.
</P>
<P>
The bank plans to provide loans to 2.93 billion US dollars this
year to machinery and electronic exports, an increase of 60
percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Priorities of the bank's loans are given to exporting ships,
complete sets of equipment, tele-communication and electronic
items. It also actively supports the restructuring of the
State-owned firms and assists them to improve their operation, the
paper said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Coal Production Continues to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's coal production has been
increasing sharply in the last 20 years and it may well continue
to increase for many years to come, a mining expert said.
</P>
<P>
In the early 1970s, when an oil crisis started to strike the
world, the government began to turn to coal as an alternative
fuel, former Secretary General of the Mines and Energy Ministry
Sigit Soetarjo said Thursday in Banjarmasin, South Kalimantan,
reports reaching here Friday said.
</P>
<P>
In those days, he said, the coal produced in Bukit Asam in
South Sumatra and Ombilin in West Sumatra reached only 148,826
tons, but in 1995 production shot up to 45 million tons and
further to 55 million tons in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The higher output has also boosted the export of the commodity
following requests from many countries for the high-quality coal.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia, which exported 36.4 million tons of coal in 1996, is
currently the world's third largest exporter of thermal coal.
</P>
<P>
Decreasing oil resources in Indonesia in the last 10 years have
given coal an increasing role as an alternative fuel, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has a total of 36.6 billion tons of coal deposits in
different parts of the country, including East Kalimantan, South
Kalimantan, South Sumatra, West Sumatra, Sulawesi and Irian Jaya,
Soetarjo said.

<HEADLINE> Panama Ready to Take Control of Canal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Panama is ready to take over the
operation of the Panama Canal in the year 2000, Jorge Eduardo
Ritter, the minister of state for canal affairs, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The United States will turn over the Panama Canal to
Panamanians on December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"We have advanced a lot in that terrain and we will have the
necessary regulations for the operation of the canal before
December 31, 1999," said Ritter.
</P>
<P>
Ritter, also one of the negotiators of the canal treaties and
member of the Canal Commission, said the present commission is a
federal agency of the U.S. government and all the laws and
regulations are of that country and supported by international
agreements such as the Torrijos-Carter Treaty signed by the two
countries in 1977. The commission will be replaced by the Panama
Canal Authority starting the year 2000,
</P>
<P>
"If an accident were to occur before the indicated hour, the
entity to resolve the incident would be the United States Supreme
Court of Justice, and if it happened after the date of the
reversion it will be resolved by Panamanian laws," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ritter said a complete title was added to the Panamanian
Constitution to give the canal administrative and financial
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
The minister illustrated with statistical data that when the
Torrijos-Carter Treaty went into force in 1979, 31 percent of the
labor force was formed by U.S. citizens and 69 percent Panamanians.
</P>
<P>
After 19 years, 93 percent of the workers are Panamanians and
only 7 percent are U.S. nationals.

<HEADLINE> Two Minor Planets Named For Chinese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Two minor planets have been named
for Li Yuan and Bian Depei, two leading popularizers of science
and astronomy in China, with the approval of the International
Astronomical Union.
</P>
<P>
Minor planets nos. 6741 and 6742 were discovered by Japanese
astronomers K. Endate and K. Watanabe, on March 31 and April 8 of
1994, lying between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter and circling
the sun along with the nine major planets of the solar system.
</P>
<P>
According to international conventions, discoverers of minor
planets that have got confirmation from the Minor Planet Center
have the right to name the new planets.
</P>
<P>
Following a suggestion of the Japanese astronomers A. Fujii and
T. Sato, the discoverers agreed to name them after the two Chinese
who have dedicated themselves to the popularization of science for
more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Fewer than ten Chinese scientists have minor planets named
after them. This is the first instance of the name of someone in
this field being used.

CARACAS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Bahamas became the 28th member of
the Latin American Economic System (SELA), the Caracas-based
Permanent Secretariat of the SELA said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Bahamas' entry into SELA was approved by the SELA Latin
American Council, the top authority of the entity during its 1996
annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
The SELA was established in October 1975 when 23 Latin American
countries signed the Panamanian Agreement in Panama City.
</P>
<P>
The Panama Agreement stipulates that the SELA, an
intergovernment organization, is open to every Latin American and
Caribbean country.
</P>
<P>
Bahamas, an archipelago of more than 700 small islands with an
area of 161,000 square kilometers, has a population of 300,000 and
its gross domestic product is 14,000 U.S. dollars per capita. Its
major income comes from services in the finance and tourism

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia's Exports Grow in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's exports totaled 770
million U.S. dollars in the first four months of this year, up 11
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
However, Director of Statistics Bureau Milovan Zivkovic said
Thursday that the country's imports were 1.56 billion dollars, up
4.7 percent, creating a deficit of 790 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the main cause of the huge deficit to the
European Union's decision to suspend Yugoslavia's
most-favored-nation trade status at the European market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, businesses of some European countries,
out of political reasons, didn't execute contracts with their
Yugoslavian counterparts, which resulted in a 29.4 percent drop in
the country's exports in April.

three-day visit to Egypt and for attending the Group of 15 (G-15)
Summit of developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's visit to the ancient country famed for its pyramids
and as a cradle of world civilization, comes less than six months
after Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak made the first-ever trip to
Malaysia by an Egyptian president in November last year to attend
the previous G-15 Summit in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Mahathir and his Egyptian counterpart, Kamal
Ahmed el-Ganzoury, will ink an agreement between the two countries
on science and technology to kick off cooperation in Information
Technology (IT) and a memorandum of understanding on religious and
endowment affairs mainly for the exchange of Islamic scholars and
experiences in Islamic administration, according to official media
reports.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers signed a memorandum of understanding to
enhance cooperation during el-Ganzoury's visit to Malaysia in
April last year.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Mahathir will also be conferred an honorary
doctorate of letters by Egypt's renowned Al Azhar University, the
world's oldest university with more than 1,000 years of history.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who will give a lecture at the university, will be
the first foreign chief of government to be conferred the
doctorate by the university in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
A 24-member business delegation is accompanying Mahathir, who
will also address a business forum organized by the Federation of
Egyptian Chambers of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir will also be taken on a night cruise along the Nile,
the world's longest river.

MANILA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The armed forces based in Mindanao,
the southern Philippines, have been put on red alert as more areas
are identified as hot spots by the Commission on Elections.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Daily Inquirer Friday reported that Southern Command
chief Joselin Nazareno has ordered the troops to be on alert and
they are not allowed to take a leave of absence.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 Marines from the 2nd Marine Brigade have been
deployed since Tuesday in 11 towns of "immediate concerns." The
Commission on Elections Thursday added 19 more towns to the list
of hot spots where violence is expected to disrupt the May 11
elections.
</P>
<P>
So far 27 people have been killed in election-related violence
since the campaign season began in February in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
To prevent election-related violence, the Commission on
Elections has ordered police to seize all firearms, licensed or
unlicensed, and cancel gun-ban exemptions in 33 hot spots and 364
sensitive areas across the country.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, President Fidel Ramos said he opposes calls
for suspension of elections in Mindanao, saying the Commission on
Elections has already taken measures to check feared electoral
fraud in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
In the 1992 presidential elections, some 169 people were
reportedly killed in election-related violence.

</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The chance of an early federal election in Australia
increased sharply Thursday, with unemployment falling below 8

<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The man at the center of an aborted Dubai waterfront
training scheme against the unionized labor, a former Vietnam
veteran Mike Wells, said Thursday night that he has notes of
meetings which confirm that a senior Australian federal government
adviser "masterminded the entire matter" which turned out to be a
public relations disaster for the government.
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- Australian Prime Minister John Howard was linked as early as
July last year to plans to replace the union-dominated waterfront
workers with former soldiers trained in Dubai in preparation for a

Australia, or the strong waterfront labor union in Australia.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Consumer Goods Market Has Sufficient Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 8 (Xinhua) -- A survey conducted by China's
commercial departments on 601 major consumer goods found that
there will be a sufficient supply in the half of this year.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that, at present, the market has no goods in
short supply. The situation of supply exceeding demand has
generated considerable pressure on sales, with the sales volume of
many goods declining.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from 230 large retail bazaars show that, in the
first two months of this year, 10 of the 21 major goods closely
related to residents' daily life declined in sales.
</P>
<P>
Yet some goods are still selling well, including medicine,
books and journals, audio and video equipment, food and home
appliances. In addition, the national catering trade increased
by 20 percent in the first two months of this year.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Township Enterprises Tap World Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, May 8 (Xinhua) -- Township enterprises in east China's
Shandong Province have in recent years made successful attempts to
tap the international market.
</P>
<P>
Exports of Shandong's township enterprises totaled 56.3 billion
yuan in 1997, up 10.5 percent from the previous year, according to
official statistics.
</P>
<P>
While exports keep growing, more and more of the rural and
township enterprises are attracting overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
In the city of Yantai, rural and township enterprises have
utilized 800 million U.S. dollars in overseas
investment. Twenty-five of the enterprises have been authorized to
conduct foreign trade on their own.
</P>
<P>
Following the outbreak of the Asian financial crisis last July,
Shandong's rural and township enterprises have made earnest
efforts to tap new markets in Europe, Oceania and Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Huamei Group, equipped with advanced technology introduced
from the United States, produces more than 100 varieties of auto
components, all of which have been sold overseas. The company's
foreign exchange earnings were worth 62 million yuan last year.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Strives to Drag State Firms Out of Red </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, May 8 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Tibet Autonomous
Region will make 80 percent of its money-losing state-owned
enterprises profitable over the next three years, a local government
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Known as the "Roof of the World", Tibet has an inhospitable
environment and lacks technical personnel and up-to-date
expertise. Consequently, 55 percent of its 625 state-owned
enterprises are money-losers.
</P>
<P>
To reverse this trend, Tibet is to build a modern enterprise
system and reorganize the assets of state firms over the next
three years, said Mao Xiaomao, director of the Regional Economic
Trade and Restructuring Commission.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Tibet has achieved remarkable results in
revamping state enterprises. By the end of last year scores of
state firms had been turned into limited companies. In addition,
five local companies have been listed on the stock market, with a
combined capital stock worth 400 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The region invested 196 million yuan in developing new products
and upgrading existing enterprises last year.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved Thursday
two credits totaling nearly 50 million U.S. dollars equivalent for
the agricultural and irrigation projects in Kyrgyz.
</P>
<P>
First credit of some 14.98 million dollars is provided for an
agricultural support services project. The project aims to improve
incentive framework, productivity, profitability and sustainability
of Kyrgyz agriculture by using a combination of public, private
alleviation programs currently being pursued by the government.
</P>
<P>
Second credit of 35 million dollars equivalent is earmarked for
the irrigation rehabilitation project.
</P>
<P>
This project will increase the productivity of irrigated
agriculture in the project area through improved water supply. The
project will increase agricultural output from areas benefiting
from inter-farm irrigation rehabilitation and will also increase
the amount of water that is diverted and delivered to the boundary
of former state and collective farms.
</P>
<P>
The interest-free credits will be channeled through the
International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's
concessional lending arm for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the Kyrgyz Republic joined the World Bank and IDA in
1992, credits to the country totalled 421.48 million dollars for 15
projects.

<HEADLINE> BMW Threatens to Cease Supplying Engines to Rolls-Royce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Germany's BMW AG Thursday threatened to
cease supplying engines to Rolls-Royce after the parent company of
the British luxury car manufacturer, Vickers, suddenly backed down
from an earlier decision by announcing that it now prefers BMW's
German rival Volkswagen to take over Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
In reaction to Vickers' announcement earlier Thursday that it
would recommend Volkswagen instead of BMW as the preferred bidder
for Royce-Rolls, a BMW spokesman said in Munich that his company
would stop the delivery of engines and other car parts to
Royce-Rolls at short notice if its bid fell through.
</P>
<P>
Vickers has so far been in exclusive talks with BMW on the
planned takeover. But Volkswagen emerged as the latest winner
after tabling an improved offer worth 430 million pounds, 90
million pounds more than the BMW offer.
</P>
<P>
The BMW spokesman Thursday declined to say whether his company
would now consider a new offer.
</P>
<P>
The final decision will be made by a special shareholder
assembly of the British company on June 4.

<HEADLINE> 1st Result in Referendum Shows Londoners Favor Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The city of London returned the first
result of the London referendum Thursday night with a resounding
Yes, BBC radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Of the total of 1,553 votes, 63 percent voted for a London
mayor and an elected assembly while 37 percent voted against.
</P>
<P>
There has been no mayor of London since 1986 when Conservative
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher abolished the old Greater London
Council and delegated the capital's power to the hands of 32 local
borough councils, with no democratic coordinating body.
</P>
<P>
After the turnout of the first result, the Labor government
expressed delight at this early indication, and was confident this
would be a sign of things to come during the night.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the first result, Lord Geoffrey Archer, one of the
main contenders for the position of mayor, said, "If it's going to
be like that, then I think that's very good. The city has a very
small electorate and the result indicates excellent support for a
London mayor."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Tony Blair has already declared that the mayor
will be the most powerful politician outside the parliament.
</P>
<P>
The future mayor of London will inevitably become a national
figure similar to the often-controversial U.S. mayors in cities
line New York and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
The 25-strong assembly will have an electorate of more than 5
million and, like the mayor, will serve for five years.

<HEADLINE> German Parliament Adopts Tougher Anti-Monopoly Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The German parliament Thursday adopted
a tougher anti-monopoly legislation in a bid to encourage more
competition and improve market chances for small and medium-sized
companies.
</P>
<P>
Under the new law which will be effective in 1999, big
companies would be forced to seek advance approval of their
planned merger from anti-trust authorities instead of the current
practice which only requires them to apply for approval after the
merger deal is completed.
</P>
<P>
In order to improve legal transparency and to avoid backroom
deals, the new legislation would also oblige the German Federal
Cartel Office to state the reasons for its approval of a merger,
not just to do so in case of a rejection.
</P>
<P>
German Economics Minister Guenter Rexrodt said that the reform
would bring the German anti-monoply law in line with European
Union regulations and would open up more chances for small and
medium-sized companies.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that Germany and France had already agreed to
to seek the establishment of a EU cartel office.

NEW YORK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar edged higher
against the mark Thursday as German central bankers indicated to
maintain the interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was also slightly higher against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 133.24 yen,
up from 133.18 late Wednesday. The dollar bought 1.7676 marks, up

</P>
<P>
Investors have been expecting Germany's central bank to raise
interest rates to further strengthen the mark and other European
currencies.
</P>
<P>
However, the president of Germany's central bank, Hans
Tietmeyer, countered that perception Thursday by saying that
interest rates may remain unchanged for some time.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Britain's central bank, the Bank of
England, decided Thursday to leave Britain's interest rates
unchanged at 7.25 percent as expected by City experts.
</P>
<P>
The bank's monetary policy committee said that the base lending
rate will remain steady amid growing evidence of a slowdown in the
economy.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the governor of the Bank of England Eddie
George has recently hinted that he thinks rates are high enough.
</P>
<P>
Industry and exporters were pleased with and welcomed the move,
saying it was right that rates had not been hiked again.
</P>
<P>
Kate Barker, chief economist of the employers group the
Confederation of British Industry, said, "while some sectors of
the economy, like business services, are still expanding robustly,
the plight of many exporters is set to put the brakes on the UK
economy through 1998".
</P>
<P>
She added that with signs showing retail demand growth is
slowing and inflation pressure in manufacturing remains at a very
low level, the inflation target will be met.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts believed that given the recent evidence of lower
growth and easing pressures in the labor market, the next move on
rates should be downward.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Supports Creation of Independent Palestinian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"I think it will be in the long-term interests of the Middle
East for Palestine to be a state," Mrs. Clinton said in a
satellite question-and-answer session on Wednesday from
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The first lady said the creation of a Palestine state was
"very important for the Palestinian people" and for the "broader
goal of peace in the Middle East."
</P>
<P>
Mrs Clinton's comment was seen here as going beyond the U.S.
policy of her husband's administration, which says the statehood
is a matter for Israel and the Palestinians to work out
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Her spokeswoman Marsha Berry issued a statement, saying Mrs
Clinton was expressing her personal view and that U.S. policy is
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry reiterated her comment
"was not reflecting any administration policy."
</P>
<P>
The reaction from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
to Mrs Cltinto's comment was: "Our position on this is well known."

<HEADLINE> Democrats Opposed to Campaign Reform Vote Delay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Democrats Thursday protested
reports that Newt Gingrich, speaker of the House of
Representatives, plans to delay a vote on campaign finance reform
until June.
</P>
<P>
Although Gingrich had said the bill would come up for a vote
before May 15, when the House adjourns for Memorial Day recess,
there is no mention of it on the leadership schedule for next
week.
</P>
<P>
The bill, drawn up by a bipartisan coalition of freshmen
members, was scheduled for a floor debate only after members began
circulating a discharge petition that would have forced the bill
out of committee, over Gingrich's objections.
</P>
<P>
Campaign finance reform has been a difficult issue for Gingrich
all year. He was criticized for bringing an unpopular reform plan
to the floor in March under rules that did not allow members to
change it. It was defeated soundly.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Gingrich cut a deal with Republicans who had
signed the discharge petition: he would bring the freshman bill to
a vote if they removed their names from the petition. The petition
was less than a dozen signatures shy of the majority needed to
force the bill to the floor.
</P>
<P>
House Democratic Whip David Bonior said he was "disturbed" by
the schedule for the final week. According to Representative Mark
Foley, a Republican, the schedule is still being negotiated, but
Bonior said neither Democrats nor the bill's sponsors have been
invited to join the negotiations.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Assists Agriculture and Irrigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank approved Thursday
two credits totaling nearly 50 million U.S. dollars equivalent for
the agricultural and irrigation projects in Kyrgyz.
</P>
<P>
First credit of some 14.98 million dollars is provided for an
agricultural support services project. The project aims to improve
incentive framework, productivity, profitability and sustainability
of Kyrgyz agriculture by using a combination of public, private
alleviation programs currently being pursued by the government.
</P>
<P>
Second credit of 35 million dollars equivalent is earmarked for
the irrigation rehabilitation project.
</P>
<P>
This project will increase the productivity of irrigated
agriculture in the project area through improved water supply. The
project will increase agricultural output from areas benefiting
from inter-farm irrigation rehabilitation and will also increase
the amount of water that is diverted and delivered to the boundary
of former state and collective farms.
</P>
<P>
The interest-free credits will be channeled through the
International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank's
concessional lending arm for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Since the Kyrgyz Republic joined the World Bank and IDA in
1992, credits to the country totalled 421.48 million dollars for 15
projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Stocks sank for a third straight
session on Wall Street Thursday as investors looked to Friday's key
job data for clues about the direction of interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 77.97 points to 8,976.68,
down more than 200 points from Monday's record high of 9,192.66.
</P>
<P>
The decline came despite today's news that Chrysler had agreed
to be acquired by Germany's Daimler-Benz for stock initially
valued at about 38 billion U.S. dollars, or 60 U.S. dollars a
share.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler's shares, which soared more than 7 points on Wednesday
after the two companies confirmed their merger talks, rose sharply
again, but Daimler's U.S. shares surrendered some of the prior
day's gains.
</P>
<P>
Stocks seesawed last week amid conflicting signals on whether
the Fed might try to slow the economy with higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 fell 9.78 to 1,095.14, and the Nasdaq
composite index fell 21.54 to 1,835.14.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Expects Investment Ban on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Thursday
it had seen no real progress by Yugoslavia in opening a dialogue
with Kosovo Albanians and expected big powers to impose an
investment ban on Belgrade later this week.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the six-nation Contact Group will meet in
London Saturday to consider whether Belgrade has met its deadline
for opening a dialogue and pulling back forces from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"I would fully expect that (the ministers) are going to be
taking, confirming or implementing a decision to impose the
investment ban as they agreed in Rome," State Department spokesman
James Foley told a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group set the deadline, which expires Saturday, at
its meeting in Rome on April 29. The group said it would block
investments in Serbia if its demands were not met although Russia
opposed the decision.
</P>
<P>
"We've not seen real progress" in Kosovo, Foley said. "We've
not seen any move toward unconditional dialogue between Belgrade
and the Kosovar Albanians."
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, we see an escalation of (Yugoslav army)
deployments in Kosovo that bode ill for future events there," he
added
</P>
<P>
Foley said that although Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov had reported that Belgrade was considering agreeing to
allow international mediation in talks with the Albanians, a key
Western demand, "we don't have that confirmed in any way."
</P>
<P>
"That would be certainly a welcome development if it's true.
We'll want to see if it's borne out by the facts," Foley added.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group comprises Britain, France, Germany, Italy,
Russia and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Nicosia Rejects U.S. Assertion on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Thursday rejected the
U.S. assertion that all Cypriots are not represented in the
Cypriot government, saying the Cypriot people are one.
</P>
<P>
At his daily press briefing here, government spokesman Christos
Stylianides said "the Cyprus government recognizes that there is
only one people, represented by the President of the Republic
Glafcos Clerides."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was commenting on a recent reference by
U.S. State Department spokesman Jim Foley that "not all the people
on Cyprus see themselves as represented in the one government of
Cyprus that we recognize."
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, U.S. Presidential Emissary Richard
Holbrooke, had said "no one has disputed that Glafcos Clerides
does not represent or have control of the people of northern
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke's statement was criticized by Clerides, who said that
he has never ceased to represent the Republic of Cyprus, which is
recognized internationally.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he believes Foley was trying to rectify Holbrooke's
statements, Stylianides said "There is a differentiation in the
wording used."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that in line with U.N. Security
Council decisions "talks for a Cyprus settlement are carried out
by the leaders of the two communities."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash told Holbrooke during his
three-day shuttling between the two sides over the weekend, that
he will not participate in peace talks unless his self-styled
regime in northern Cyprus is recognized and Cyprus' application
for European Union membership withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
The preconditions set by Denktash stalled the U.S. official's
efforts to resume negotiations between the two sides, which have
been in a stalemate since last summer.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriots-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriots-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops on the island and took over the northern third
following a failed coup by Greek Cypriots seeking union
with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Leader Attacks Israeli Withdrawal Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of Lebanon's
Hezbollah, or Party of God, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah Thursday
accused Israel of attempting to driving a wedge among Lebanon,
Syria and Iran by offering its conditional withdrawal plan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a mass rally to mark the Islamic Arshura Day, he
said the Israeli offer was aimed at creating strife inside
Lebanon, and between Lebanon and Syria as well as Syria and Iran.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that Hezbollah will never stop fighting against
Israeli forces in south Lebanon unless they leave unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
On April 1, the Israeli Cabinet formally endorsed the
20-year-old United Nations resolution 425 and offered to withdraw
its troops on the condition that the Lebanese government gives
guarantees for its security before its pullout.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, the main foreign power in Lebanon with
the deployment of 40,000 troops, flatly rejected the offer,
insisting that the withdrawal must be applied without any
conditions.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah, who is leading a guerrilla war trying to dislodge
2,000 Israeli troops from south Lebanon under Lebanese
government's acquiescence, is backed by Iran.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a 1,200-square-kilometer security zone in south
Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its
northern areas from Lebanese guerrilla cross-border attacks.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Continues in Northern Afghanistan: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Fighting is continuing Thursday in
northern Afghanistan between the Taliban militia and opposition
forces led by Tajik warlord Ahmed Shah Masood.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the Afghan Islamic Press based in
Peshawar, Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, the fighting
between the two Afghan warring factions is still continuing in
Bhangi district of Takhar province in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The fighting broke out Wednesday although the Taliban militia
agreed to allow the U.N. humanitarian food relief to be provided
to the central Afghan province of Bamiyan controlled by the rival
faction.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Taliban sources as saying that the Taliban
forces repulsed the attack launched by the Masood forces.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban sources also claimed that they had captured three
military posts in Bhangi and two villages in Askamash, Takhar
province.
</P>
<P>
However, sources close to the Anti-Taliban Northern Alliance in
Peshawar denied the Taliban claim and said that the Askamash town
is still under their control.
</P>
<P>
Details of losses in Thursday's fighting in Bhangi district
were not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
The Bhangi front lines heated up after the breakdown of the
latest intra-Afghan peace talks held in Islamabad between the
Taliban and the Northern Alliance under the auspices of the U.N.
and the Organization of Islamic Conference.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Offers to Assist Sudan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said Thursday it is willing and
ready to give all possible assistance to the people living in the
north and south of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued by the Foreign Ministry said that Egypt
follows with concern "deteriorating conditions in southern
provinces of Sudan and the suffering of the people from drought
and military operations."
</P>
<P>
Southern rebels have been fighting against the Khartoum
government since 1983 for more autonomy for the south's Christians
and animists from the Islamic North. More than 1.3 million people
died in the civil war and related famines.
</P>
<P>
Egypt appealed to all parties to give every possible assistance
to facilitate the arrival of relief supplies to Sudan and urged
all regional and international efforts to seek a just and
comprehensive political solution to settle one of Africa's most
intractable conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt called on the different parties and the Sudanese of all
orientations to rise above narrow choices and engage in a common
action to return the nation to its vitality and regional and
international position," it added.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as the Sudanese government in Khartoum and
rebels of the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) in the south
agreed Wednesday to an internationally supervised vote on
self-determination for the south of the country.
</P>
<P>
The pressure for a settlement has increased as famine directly
related to the fighting has gripped three southern provinces of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Egypt are at odds over a border dispute and have
traded accusations of harboring militants and oppositions, but
there are signs of a tentative thaw in relations.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Leader's Visit Will Be Private: S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 7 (Xinhua) -- An intended visit to South
Africa this week by Palestine's Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) leader will be a private one, Deputy Foreign Minister
Aziz Pahad said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The visit of Hamas' spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin is
not an issue which will affect South Africa's relations with the
United States, Pahad told a press conference in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The South African government's position remained that the
rights of private citizens should not be interfered with, Pahad
said, apparently referring to a report that Yassin was refused a
visa last week.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said, "We have not made a decision on the issue (of a
visa)."
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, "we are looking at the issue from the point
of view of the impact it would have on the whole Middle East
Peace Process."
</P>
<P>
Pretoria's position is that nothing shill be done which can
affect the peace process. If the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) told the South African government that Yassin's visit to
South Africa would not be opportune currently, the government was
not required to make any decision, Pahad said.
</P>
<P>
Hamas, a radical Islamic group, was allegedly responsible for
a series of suicide bombings in Israel over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Alman el-Herfi, PNA's ambassador to South Africa, said
Thursday that the timing of a visit to South Africa by Yassin
this week is not convenient.
</P>
<P>
El-Herfi said that the Middle East peace talks are at a
delicate stage, and no other event should be allowed to divert
the international attention from the essentials of the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela once said that he was
willing to meet Yassin, who was released by Israel last year.
</P>
<P>
But Mandela's spokesman Parks Mankahlana said Wednesday that
were Yassin's visit to materialize, there would be no meeting
between Yassin and Mandela.

<HEADLINE> Price Decline Has No Significant Impact on Wheat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) - Trade in wheat and flour in 1997/98 is
forecast at 95.6 m. tons, virtually unchanged from last projection
and marginally above the 1996/97 figure (95.4 m.), according to an
authoritative forecast.
</P>
<P>
The latest forecast by International Grains Council (IGC) said,
the recent decline in wheat prices is unlikely to have any
significant impact on the global trade figure, although the
availability of large amounts of cheap low grade feed wheat,
especially in central and eastern Europe triggered several new
sales.
</P>
<P>
While there were signs that buyers in South East Asian
countries were returning to the market, flour demand has been
affected by the sub-region's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
IGC said that developments in the global rice market are also
of some relevance. Substantially increased import demand in 1998,
the bulk of which is accounted for by an expected increase of 2.5
m. tons in Indonesia's rice imports will lift global rice trade to
a new record.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase in import demand, estimated at over 35%, to
be met from higher shipments by nearly all major exporters, has
contributed to much stronger rice prices, at a time when wheat
values have moved lower, it added.
</P>
<P>
IGC believed that this may lead to some shift in import
decisions in favour of wheat, although traditionally the rate of
substitution between the two major foodgrains is fairly limited.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Reaffirms Position on Russian Missile Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Thursday vowed to deploy
Russian anti-aircraft missiles on the island unless there is
sufficient progress toward a negotiated settlement or an agreement
for the demilitarization of the island.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a report from Ankara, government spokesman
Christos Stylianides told his daily press briefing that "our
position is clear and we insist that the Cyprus issue is not a
matter relating to (Russian) missiles."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Cyprus question is an issue which
should be discussed under the aegis of the good offices mission of
the U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan and the goal is to reach a
bizonal, bicommunal federation.
</P>
<P>
Stylianides reiterated the Cypriot government's readiness to
embark on a dialog for a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus
problem.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government decided last year to purchase Russian
S-300 surface-to-air missiles to upgrade its defense
capability. The missiles are scheduled to be delivered later this
year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has reacted strongly to the deal, threatening to block
delivery or if that fails, to destroy the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third in the wake of a failed
pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has so far maintained around 40,000 troops in northern
Cyprus, which was declared unilaterally by Turkish Cypriots in
1983 as "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," recognized only by
Ankara.

<HEADLINE> Continental Express Orders 75 Rolls-Royce Powered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 7 (Xinhua) - Rolls-Royce plc announced Thursday
that an order placed by Continental Express for Embraer RJ-135
regional jets represents more than 275 million US dollars in new
AE3007 engine orders for its Allison Engine Company.
</P>
<P>
The order is for 25 firm aircraft and 50 options. Launched last
autumn, first flight of the 37-passenger ERj-135 is scheduled for
July. Entry into service will be mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
Allen S Novick, Vice-president for Large Commercial Engines at
Allison, said: "This new order not only continues to strengthen
the AE3007 order book, but also confirms the confidence that
Continental Express has in the Embraer aircraft and our AE3007
engine family."
</P>
<P>
Continental Express also flies the AE3007-powered ERj-145. The
90%-plus commonality between the two aircraft is an asset that
enables airlines to better manage costs through
interchangeability.
</P>
<P>
Embraer plans to produce more than 500 ERj-135s over the next
10 years. Firm orders for the ERj-135 currently stand at 73 with
122 options. Launch customer Flandre Air of France ordered eight
aircraft with 12 options last October.
</P>
<P>
Wexford Management LLC has also ordered 20 ERj-135 aircraft
with 20 options. Additionally, Business Express placed a firm
order for 20 aircraft with options for 40 more.
</P>
<P>
Rolls-Royce plc is a global company focusing on aerospace,
defense and energy markets, with facilities in 14 countries.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Labor Party Wins Election: Result </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Wim Kok won another
term of four years as his Labor Party won the Dutch general
elections, the Dutch press agency ANP reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The official election result, to be formally announced by the
election committee next Monday, listed the Labor Party as taking
45 seats from a possible total of 150 in the lower house of the
Dutch parliament.
</P>
<P>
The party won 29 percent of the votes though persistent
drizzles were blamed for a low turnout of 73.2 percent of the 11.7
million eligible voters in the country.
</P>
<P>
The current coalition is likely to carry on as major coalition
the People's Party for Freedom and Democracy got 38 seats and
minor coalition the Democrats 66 got 14 seats.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch press said that the Labor Party and the People's
Party for Freedom and Democracy already started government-forming
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
But the Democrats 66 had expressed the intention to stay away
from the next coalition if it lost too many seats.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Negotiated Solution to Sudan Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan was pleased to hear the outcome of the just-concluded peace
talks between the government of Sudan and anti-government forces
in South Sudan, his spokesman said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day talks in Nairobi, Kenya, which ended on
Wednesday, the parties to the conflict made progress by agreeing
in principle on the right of self-determination for the people of
South Sudan.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to an internationally supervised vote on
self-determination for the south, but differences on the region's
boundaries and the issue of religion still remain unsolved.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who is touring Africa, "is encouraged that the next
session of the negotiations will be convened in three months' time
in Addis Ababa", the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief reiterates his full support for the peace
initiative on Sudan and "calls on the parties to sustain the
political momentum to find a negotiated solution to one of the
most protracted conflicts on the African continent," he added.
</P>
<P>
Since 1983, the Sudan People's Liberation Army has fought for
self-determination of the south and the 15-year civil war has
caused 1.3 million casualties.
</P>
<P>
The previous round of peace talks between the parties to the
conflict was held between October and November with no agreement
reached.

five have been vaccinated against poliomyelitis in two
consecutive immunization campaigns across the country, an
Ethiopian health official announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference, Yohannes Tadesse, official
from the ministry of health said that 7.2 million children had
been inoculated against polio in the first round immunization
drive launched last November.

Ethiopia to immunize such a large number of children within a few
days.

He said that 3.2 million children were given vitamin A
capsules along with the polio vaccines during the second round of
the national immunization campaign.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S. of Leaking Untrue Information to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq Thursday accused the U.S. for
releasing untrue information to the press and trying to block its
efforts to get the U.N. sanctions lifted, the Iraqi News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
An Iraqi spokesman for the Ministry of Culture and Information
was quoted as saying that the U.S. government was seeking to
buttress its rejection of a Russian proposal presented to the
Security Council in late April.
</P>
<P>
The Russian proposal called for closure of Iraq's nuclear
file and a transition to the long-term monitoring phase from the
current inspection phase.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was commenting on news leaked by U.S. officials
on American magazine Newsweek to the effect that the International
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is verifying an offer submitted by
Pakistani nuclear scientist Abdul Qadir Khan to Iraq to help it
produce nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
The news, published in the magazine's latest issue, was denied
by Khan himself and the Pakistani government as well, and was
characterized by IAEA as distortion of facts, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman explained that in mid-1990, a Greek offered to
supply Iraq with designs for the production of nuclear weapons,
claiming that he would get them from Abdul Qadir Khan, chairman
of the Pakistani Nuclear Programme.
</P>
<P>
Iraq ignored the offer at the time, fully convinced that the
whole issue was an intelligence game meant to entangle Iraq, said
the spokesman, stressing that Iraq had handed over the relevant
papers to IAEA and given the necessary explanation, and that the
subject was over ever since.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the IAEA had made reference to this offer in
a report to the Security Council while linking non-closure of the
Iraqi nuclear file to the failure to ascertain the information
provided by Iraq on the offer with the other state concerned.
</P>
<P>
Some Security Council members were of the opinion that Iraq
should not pay for other's failure to respond to IAEA's request,
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that afterwards, events took their course, and the
IAEA submitted its mid-April report, tacitly suggesting a
transition of its activities in Iraq to the long-term monitoring.
</P>
<P>
"This subject was over long time ago. It no longer has effects
on the work or the reports of the IAEA. The U.S. government seems
to have brought it back to the surface and leaked it to the press
as a part of a campaign intended to block Iraq's legitimate
demands for lifting the sanctions," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions were imposed on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990. They can only be lifted when the U.N. weapons
inspectors verify that Iraq is free of weapons of mass destruction.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Medicine Enjoys Great Development Since 1959: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The Tibetan traditional medicine has
developed greatly since 1959, the year when Tibet was liberated
from its serfdom system, said Dr. Karma Choepel, the personal
doctor of the late 10th Panchen Erdedi, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Choepel, who was on a visit in France as a member of cultural
exchange delegation from the Tibet Autonomous Region, said that
before 1959, the official medical institution in Lhasa only had a
60 member staff, most of whom were engaged in teaching Tibetan
medicine.
</P>
<P>
But now, there are a major hospital of Tibetan traditional
medicine in Lhasa with 250 patient beds, and Tibetan hospitals in
all the 70 counties across the autonomous region, as well as in
neighboring provinces of Qinghai, Sichuan, Yunan and Gansu where
inhabit ethnic Tibetan people.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Tibetan medical scientists are engaged in both
medical research and astrological and Tibetan calendrical studies,
while studying modern medical sciences as well.
</P>
<P>
The local government has recently subsidized 70 million yuan
(about 8.4 million U.S. dollars) in building two factories
producing Tibetan medicines, he said.
</P>
<P>
Choepel, who is Director of the Institution for Traditional
Tibetan Medicine and Pharmacology and head of the Traditional
Tibetan Medicine Hospital of the Tibet Autonomous Region, has set
up a clinic in the Holiday Inn hotel in Lhasa.
</P>
<P>
He treats 800 Western tourists each year in the clinic. His
patients cover 30 nationalities.

<HEADLINE> PNA: Washington Talks Only for Signing Agreements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Senior Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) officials said on Thursday that the upcoming
Israeli-Palestinian Washington talks will be held only for signing
agreements, not for further negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Redeineh, advisor to PNA President Yasser Arafat,
told the Voice of Palestine (VOP) radio that the PNA will refuse
to go to Washington for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The PNA has called on the U.S. to officially announce its new
proposal, which calls for a 13.1 percent Israeli withdrawal from
the West Bank and has been discussed in the recent London talks,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Arafat held
separate talks last Monday and Tuesday in London with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair on the U.S. proposal, but no agreement was
reached. The Israeli side has not accepted the proposal.
</P>
<P>
The projected Washington talks tentatively set for next Monday
appear uncertain. Netanyahu said on Wednesday that he would ask
the U.S. to delay the talks for a few more days to give him more
time to discuss the redeployment proposal with his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Shaath, PNA minister of planning and international
cooperation, also told the VOP on Thursday that U.S. President
Bill Clinton should not meet with Netanyahu unless he agrees to
the U.S. proposal.
</P>
<P>
He said the PNA is working to ensure that the Washington talks
will resolve the matter once and for all, adding that the London
talks represented the beginning of U.S. pressure on Israel to
halt its continuing intransigence toward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu discussed with his inner cabinet ministers on the
U.S. proposal on Wednesday and will call a full cabinet meeting
on Sunday to finalize Israel's position on redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Israel is a sovereign country
and it will not accept any U.S. dictate.
</P>
<P>
Responding to Netanyahu's remarks, Clinton said in Washington
on Wednesday that he has no intention of imposing peace terms or
security requirements on Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The first person to advocate a more rapid movement to the
final status was Prime Minister Netanyahu. I have tried to find a
way, actually, to do what he suggested," said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Several senior Israeli politicians from both the ruling and
opposition parties have criticized Netanyahu for his remarks,
asking him to take urgent measures to correct them.
</P>
<P>
As asked by Netanyahu, U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross is to
return to the region Thursday evening or Friday.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Richard Butler, Executive
Chairman of the United Nations Special Commission in charge of
disarming Iraq, on Thursday recommended to lift the UN travel ban
on Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the Security Council of the United Nations,
Butler said since the Memorandum of the Understanding reached
between the UN chief and Iraq on February 23, 1998, Iraq has
cooperated fully with UNSCOM by granting them unconditional,
unrestricted and immediate access to the sites it wants to verify.
</P>
<P>
But said Iraq has met with relevant provisions of UN Resolution
1137, and the travel on Iraqi officials should be lifted.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council adopted Resolution 1137 in November 1997
after the breakout of the crisis over UN weapons inspection in
Iraq. The resolution decided to impose travel ban on Iraqi
government officials and military officers who were thought to
have blocked UNSCOM's work in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed Chief Calls for Upgrading Banking Supervision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- In order to prevent or at least
to deal with future Asian-style crises, there is a critical need
to upgrade the quality of financial regulation worldwide, U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan told a international banking conference held in
Chicago, "better and more forceful" supervision by bank
regulators was necessary because both the Asian crisis and the
earlier 1994-95 Mexican peso crisis had their roots in shaky
financial systems.
</P>
<P>
"In all countries, we need independent bank examiners who
understand banking and business risk, who could in effect, make
sound loans themselves because they understand the process," he
said in his remarks quoted by an Ap report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"Experienced bank supervision cannot fully substitute for poor
lending procedures, but presumably it could encourage better
practice," he said.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan said the training needed to develop this improved
banking supervision in many countries will take time. But he said
it was crucial to move as quickly as possible in the area of bank
supervision and general understanding of how the new global
financial system operates with its ability to speed billions of
dollars of investment around the world with the click of a few
computer keys.
</P>
<P>
"It is urgent that we accelerate our efforts to develop a
sophisticated understanding of how this high-tech financial system
works," he added.
</P>
<P>
Better understanding was needed, Greenspan said, to lower the
risks of a crisis developing that would be "beyond our degree of
comprehension or our ability to respond effectively."
</P>
<P>
In the area of better understanding, Greenspan called for
expanded reporting of financial data from governments and banks
and other financial institutions to allow investors to operate
with as much knowledge as possible.
</P>
<P>
The Fed chief said bank regulators had to move as quickly as
possible to deal with bad loans being carried on the books of
banks they regulate. He said failure to do this in Japan had led
to Japanese banks being forced to pay higher interest rates on
global markets.

KAMPALA, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Mrs. Sadako Ogata, Thursday
called upon African societies to enforce solidarity with refugees
in their efforts for prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR chief made this call in a lecture hosted by the Law
Faculty of Makerere University.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Ogata said the absence of solidarity on the african
continent will eventually erode societies and destroy the work of
nation builders.
</P>
<P>
She said refugees in many countries are not only isolated by
the countries they flee to but also isolated when they return to
tneir own communities.
</P>
<P>
Ogata urged African governments not to treat refugees as
outcasts, but as partners in development who, when given the
necessary facilities, can transform the society.
</P>

from nine central African countries here Friday to review refugee
and asylum issues across the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece Thursday denied once again
that the Kurdish Workers Party (PKK) had an office in Athens,
however, it did allow the group's political wing to have an office
there.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a written statement, Greek Foreign Ministry
spokesman Kostas Bikas said that there were no offices of the PKK
in Greece, nor did such a matter exist.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that there were in Greece, as in earnly all
the other European Union (EU) countries as well as in the United
States, offices of Kurdish political organizations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government was well aware of Athens' position
concerning Kurdish organizations, both from recent official
announcements and from a briefing giving at the U.S. embassy in
Athens, he said, in reference to Wednesday's statement made by
U.S. State Department spokesman Lee Mcclenny that some Greek
legislators supported the PKK and Washington had asked the Greek
government to confirm whether there was a PKK office in Greece or
not.
</P>
<P>
It was the self evident that the development of activities
containing elements of violence or terrorism were not allowed in
Greece, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a related development, Greek Parliament President
Apostolos Kaklamanis Thursday criticized Mcclenny's statement,
saying that the U.S. spokesman's claims had no basis in reality.
</P>
<P>
He added that if Washington really wanted to play the role of
third party, it was not entitled to cover up for the well known
expediencies of the Turkish side.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: Israeli Approval of U.S. Initiative Possible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said Thursday that in the coming few days, Israel might accept the
U.S. initiative and move the peace process forward, Egypt's Middle
East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"There is a possibility that in the next days, the Israeli side
will accept the American initiative because this is the only way
to make progress towards peace," Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"Everything in the peace process now depends on the attitude of
the Israeli government and the Israeli prime minister and we hope
that they will accept the American initiative," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the remarks following talks between Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak on
the future of the faltering Mideast peace process here.
</P>
<P>
Their meeting focused on the result of the separate talks
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in London early this
week to revive the deadlocked peace process, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The only development which could be considered a progress
(after the London talks), which has not happened yet, would be for
Israel to agree to withdraw from more than 13 percent of
Palestinian territories in accordance with a definite timetable,
to stop settlement activity and to begin further redeployment,"
said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Moussa pointed out that the Palestinians have accepted the
American initiative in principle although it has not made public.
</P>
<P>
Following two days of talks in London, Albright's latest
attempt to salvage Palestinian-Israeli peace meetings ended
without a breakthrough, but U.S. President Bill Clinton invited the
Israeli and Palestinian leaders to Washington for more talks next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Albright said the invitation was conditional, noting that
Israel must accept the U.S. peace proposal before the summit,
which calls on Israel to hand over 13.1 percent of the West Bank
to the Palestinians during the second redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has accepted the proposal and agreed to make the trip,
while Netanyahu on Wednesday publicly called on U.S. Middle East
envoy Dennis Ross to return to the region before Monday to modify
the American plan.
</P>
<P>
Any progress from the London talks to the Washington meetings
depends on Israel's acceptance of the U.S. proposal "in its parts
and details," Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that it is a short time before the two sides accept
the initiative so that movement could be made in the peace
process," he added.
</P>
<P>
Arafat wrapped up two days of talks in London Tuesday to start
a tour of Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia, where he briefed the
leaders of the three Arab states on the London talks and
coordinated stances with them on the coming stage.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has been an important mediator in the peace process which
has been stalled since March 1997 over Israeli settlement
construction in East Jerusalem and long-delayed troop redeployment
in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Russia Stresses Position on Nonproliferation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Russia Thursday once again stated its
position on nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction and
delivery systems, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev in a statement issued by
the ministry's press service said that Moscow is faithfully
abiding by its international commitments on nonproliferation of
weapons of mass destruction and delivery systems.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is as aware as any other country of the danger of
violating the nonproliferation regime, especially by countries in
direct proximity to its borders", Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
The National Security Concept approved by President Boris
Yeltsin December 17, 1997, says clearly that "the proliferation of
nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction and the technologies
of their manufacture and delivery systems especially in countries
bordering on Russia or in regions close to its borders poses a
serious threat."
</P>
<P>
"Russia applies the nonproliferation policy to every country,"
Sergeyev said, and "the policy is designed to protect Russia's
security because the leak of defense technologies, weapons of mass
destruction and delivery systems may eventually damage our
defenses."
</P>
<P>
On the cooperation in other fields Sergeyev said that Russia
does not see any impediments to the development of traditional
defense technological cooperation with other countries,
in particular in the field of conventional arms and intend to
continue this cooperation in line with existing accords.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Blames Annan for Failing to Halt 1994 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.N. Secretary General
Kofi Annan was greeted Thursday with a ferocious attack in
Rwanda's parliament, with deputies blaming the world body for
failing to prevent or halt the country's 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana attacked the U.N. and
its predecessor, the League of Nations, for its treatment of
Rwanda since 1922, reports reaching here from Kigali said.
</P>
<P>
Gasana demanded compensation over the genocide and singled out
the failure of U.N. troops to stop the slaughter of more than
500,000 people at a time when Annan was in charge of U.N.
peace-keeping operations.
</P>
<P>
Annan, much taken aback by the attack, said, "Obviously, I had
not expected this in the parliament," he said, describing some of
the minister's complaints as legitimate.
</P>
<P>
"In any event, I did not come here to get into polemics and I
am sure you know the old proverb that the guest is always the
prisoner of the host," he told his audience of parliamentarians
and diplomats before reading his prepared speech.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, the U.N. chief agreed that the world failed
Rwanda in 1994 by not mustering the political will to halt
genocide.
</P>
<P>
"All of us who cared about Rwanda, all of us who witnessed its
suffering, fervently wish that we could have prevented the
genocide," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, he noted that killings of over 500,000 people
were not only directed against Tutsis but "aimed at anyone who
would stand up or speak out against the murder."

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is ready
to help search for peace and progress in Rwanda, said U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The United Nations is prepared to help, and to advise in
whichever way your people may wish. We are ready to work with you
in partnership," he told Rwanda's parliament.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda is one of the eight countries in East Africa which Annan
is touring. A text of his speech was made available here at the
U.N. Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
He said with his recent report to U.N. Security Council on
peace and development in Africa, the U.N. is seeking to open a
new chapter in its relations with the nations of Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said Rwanda's tragedy was the world's tragedy, referring to
the 1994 ethnical genocide which killed at least half a million
people, mostly the country's minority Tutsis. There are still
about three million refugees waiting for resettlement.
</P>
<P>
"In their greatest hour of need, the world failed the people of
Rwanda," Annan said, adding the international community today "is
showing a genuine commitment to Rwanda's future".
</P>
<P>
He called for trust by the Rwanda people in their state and in
themselves. "You must teach your children that the return from
genocide must be paved with tolerance, mercy and friendship," he
said.

<HEADLINE> UN Says Indonesia Faces Food Shortage as Result of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Many provinces of Indonesia
are facing food shortages as a result of a severe drought caused
by the strongest El Nino phenomenon in fifty years, UN sources
said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), the Indonesian Government's ability
to mount relief operations at required levels is seriously
hampered. OCHA says that ongoing poverty alleviation program
are being curtailed.
</P>
<P>
OCHA also points out that large areas of central Irian Jaya
Province continue to be severely affected by the drought that is
creating major food shortages.
</P>
<P>
The annual dry season which is usually during June and July
began in May 1997 and continued until the end of 1997. Although
some rainfall occurred at the end of 1997 and beginning of 1998,
encouraging the local population to plant, crops will not be ready
for six months from the date of planting, says OCHA.
</P>
<P>
Citing government sources, OCHA reports in the four districts
of Jayawijaya, Puncak Jaya, Mimika and Merauke, more than 670
people have died of drought related diseases.
</P>
<P>
In March 1998, the World Food Program (WFP) and the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organization undertook an assessment
mission to Indonesia. WFP estimates that 7.5 million people will
likely experience household food insecurity as a result of the
drought and the deterioration of the economy unless food aid is
provided.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Announces New Actions for Irish Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced on Thursday a series of new actions in support of the
peace in Northern Ireland, including travels by U.S. officials to
the place and an aid of 5.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced the actions in a written statement following
his meeting with ten women and men representing the WAVE Center in
Northern Ireland, a support group for those who have been touched
by the political violence of the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
The administration will work with Congress to provide five
million U.S. dollars to support the new West Belfast Springvale
Campus project completed, said Clinton.
</P>
<P>
He also requested the United States Information Agency (USIA)
to support the Springvale Campus with its full range of education
programs.
</P>
<P>
"Second, the United States is committed to helping the
communities in Northern Ireland build the new institutions created
by the April 10 accord," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement signed by all sides involved in the
Northern Ireland peace process, a new assembly will be set up.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that the administration will work with Congress to
make available 500,000 U.S. dollars soon to fund programs to
support the creation of new institutions.
</P>
<P>
He also announced that Commerce Secretary William Daley will
visit Northern Ireland in early June with a high-level U.S.
business delegation to "intensify what is already a substantial
economic relationship."
</P>
<P>
"With peace holding firm, there are strong business
opportunities we must pursue now to boost prosperity and the hope
for the future that is crucial to the foundations of peace,"
Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
He also said that a Vital Voices Conference will be held in
Belfast in early fall. "This conference will showcase and support
women's role in the economic and political life of their society."
</P>
<P>
"I've asked the First Lady to travel to Belfast to take part in
this important conference," Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
He praised the April 10 peace accord as "the chance of a
lifetime to secure a lasting peace." "It is time for all the
parties to say no, once and for all, to violence and yes to
hope, to make a decisive break with the past and to launch a
brighter future."

<HEADLINE> FAA Orders Rapid Inspections of Older Boeing 737s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) Thursday ordered rapid inspections of some
older model Boeing 737 aircraft after holes were found in one such
plane's pipe that carries electrical wires through a fuel tank on
the wing.
</P>
<P>
FAA and Boeing officials determined that the two pin-sized
holes were caused by electrical arcing within the pipe, creating
the potential for the type of tank explosion that is suspected of
downing TWA Flight 800 off Long Island in July 1996, the
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
The order applies to 152 Boeing 737-100 and -200 models. The
inspections were required to be done within seven days. Repairs
that may have to be made could cause some delays to the flying
public.
</P>
<P>
The agency also ordered the operators of Boeing 747 and 767
aircraft to do some similar inspections within 60 days.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the FAA proposed changes in wiring and fuel vents
on Boeing 737s in the same caution. The order would affect all but
about 100 of the nearly 3,000 Boeing 737s in operation worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the agency made similar proposals on Boeing
747s.
</P>
<P>
The actions were taken following results of an ongoing
investigation into the TWA accident, which killed all 230 people
aboard. While investigators still have not determined the cause of
that accident, they suspect that electricity from wiring around
the Boeing 747's center fuel tank may have sparked an explosion.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hopeful Netanyahu Attends Washington Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The United States said Thursday
that it still hopes Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will
attend a summit in Washington next Monday for salvaging the peace
process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We remain hopeful," State Department spokesman James Foley
told reporters. "We believe the Israeli mind is still open,
certainly. I don't believe we have heard the final word on that."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Netanyahu told CNN television in an interview that he
had not yet made up his mind whether to attend the Washington
summit.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we'll get to Washington by Monday because
there are a lot of issues that are left open," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton has invited Israeli and Palestinian
leaders to Washington for further negotiations in an attempt to
break the deadlock on the peace process after Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright failed in London to persuade Netanyahu into
accepting a U.S. proposal on Israel's withdrawal from the West
Bank.
</P>
<P>
Before Netanyahu's interview with CNN, his adviser David
Bar-Illan also indicated to Reuters that it was "very unlikely"
that the Israeli leader would go to Washington next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu asked U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross to
return to the Middle East for last-minute discussions before he
decides whether to attend the Washington summit.
</P>
<P>
Foley said the United States had agreed to that and Ross would
leave for Israel Thursday evening.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Official: Sanctions' Impact on Iraqi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The current situation in Iraq's
education sector, damaged by the U.N. sanctions, would greatly
affect the future and spirit of millions of Iraqi school children
and university students, a U.N. spokesman said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news briefing, Eric Falt, spokesman for the
U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Office in Iraq, said Iraq's
education sector has got less attention where the needs are
enormous, and the impact of the sanctions on the current situation
is equally damaging.
</P>
<P>
"So far the efforts of UNESCO (United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization), the leading U.N. agency in
the educational sector, and the support of the (Iraqi) government
have been hampered by the limited funding provided in the context
of SCR (Security Council resolution) 986," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. sanctions were imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Falt pointed out that under the first phase of the oil-for-food
deal between Iraq and the U.N., some contracts concerning the
eduction sector still remain blocked, adding that only eight of
them have been approved. Only nearly half of the aid to schools
have arrived in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
For the second phase of the deal, few commodities for the
contracts have arrived, he said. For the third phase, the
contracts are currently being reviewed in the U.N. Sanctions
Committee, he added.
</P>
<P>
Falt quoted U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator Denis Halliday as
saying on Thursday that "it is critical that the (Iraqi)
government be able to rebuild the entire education system as
quickly as possible in order to recover from initial damages and a
severe lack of funding."
</P>
<P>
He said if endorsed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the
expected increase of funding for the Iraqi education sector will
be very substantial.
</P>
<P>
Under U.N. Resolution 1153, from the third phase of
oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to export 5.2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil over six months, compared to 2 billion
dollars for the first and second phases.
</P>
<P>
Falt said that around 3 billion dollars of the whole oil
proceeds will be allocated for humanitarian purposes, including
the education sector.

<HEADLINE> Another Plane Begins Air-dropping Food in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
announced Thursday that the first of the three C-130 aircraft has
begun air-dropping emergency relief food to 50,000 people in
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
In a news release issued here, the WFP said this followed the
decision by the Sudanese government to allow the U.N. relief
agencies to use three more C-130s in their operations, bringing
the total amount of authorized C-130s to five.
</P>
<P>
The newest C-130 aircraft arrived overnight at the U.N. base
ca in Lokichoggio of Kenya from South Africa and the
remaining two are expected to come shortly with one from Angola
later this week.
</P>
<P>
The release quoted David Fletcher, WFP southern-sector
coordinator for Sudan, as saying that "these planes are the
lifeline for tens of thousands of Sudanese right now."
</P>
<P>
Aid workers said the three planes were arriving in time as
reports from a WFP team distributing relief food in Rumbek area
in southern Sudan indicated that women had been collapsing from
sheer hunger, desperation and exhaustion at food distribution
sites.
</P>
<P>
The situation in southern Sudan is extremely serious because
the combined effects of insecurity, drought and floods have
caused widespread crop failure, the WFP said.
</P>
<P>
The WFP estimated that 30 to 60 percent of the Sudanese people
in Bahr el Ghazal Province were suffering from starvation and
diseases.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old civil war and repeated restrictions of access
and aircraft clearances in the past few months by the Sudanese
authorities have hampered attempts to reach the hungry, the WFP
noted.

WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
announced Thursday a series of new actions in support of the peace
in Northern Ireland, but decided not to visit the province.
</P>
<P>
Clinton announced the actions in a written statement following
his meeting with 10 women and men representing the WAVE Center in
Northern Ireland, a support group for those who have been touched
by the political violence of the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton has scrapped plans for a visit to Northern
Ireland out of concern that his presence might disrupt the
campaign for a May 22 referendum on a peace accord, the White
House said earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had considered visiting Belfast and Dublin in mid-May
at the end of the annual summit of the group of seven
industrialized nations.
</P>
<P>
"He's satisfied he would have been warmly welcomed," said White
House spokesman Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
"But his presence there would have become a factor that would
have affected the political dynamic. He elects to leave it to the
people in Ireland to make that choice," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Clinton said the administration will work
with Congress to provide 5 million U.S. dollars to support the new
West Belfast Springvale Campus project completed.

<HEADLINE> Sharon Doubts Washington Summit could Take Place </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 7 (Xinhua) -- An influential Israeli minister
said on Thursday that he could not predict whether a proposed
Washington summit on the Middle East peace process would take
place next Monday.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if the meeting will take place or not. I have
to talk to the prime minister (Benjamin Netanyahu)," Ariel
Sharon, the Israeli minister of national infrastructure, told a
Washington conference.
</P>
<P>
The Washington summit was proposed by U.S. President Bill
Clinton after Secretary of State Madeleine Albright failed to
persuade Netanyahu to accept a U.S. proposal for further
withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Clinton invited Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat to Washington to break a 14-month deadlock in the peace
process and start talks on the final status of Palestinian
self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton made the summit conditional on Israel's agreement
to withdraw from 13.1 percent of the West Bank, a demand Israel
has so far rejected.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu himself told CNN television in an
interview that he still had not decided whether to go to
Washington to attend the proposed meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know if we'll get to Washington by Monday because
there are a lot of issues that are left open," he said.
</P>
<P>
And his adviser David Bar-Illan also said it was "very
unlikely" that Netanyahu would be going to Washington next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The United States, however, believed the Israeli leader would
come here for the summit.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the Israeli mind is still open," State Department
spokesman James Foley said at a regular briefing.
</P>
<P>
Sharon, speaking to reporters after the conference, said it
would be dangerous for Israel to go beyond its current
withdrawal offer of 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Anything which is beyond 9 percent endangers Israel
tremendously," he said.
</P>
<P>
He echoed Netanyahu's remarks that Israel would not accept
any dictates from the United States as the U.S. proposal could
be at the expense of Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that no pressure will be put on Israel, no
dictations when it come to our future security," he said.

<HEADLINE> Greece's Inflation Up to 5.3 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece's inflation rose from 4.6
percent in March to 5.3 percent in April, according to figures
released by the Greek National Statistics Service (NSS) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The NSS attributed April's rise in inflation to the price
increases of cars, lamb and goat meat, hotel rates and the easter
bonus paid to employees, which increased demand in the market.
</P>
<P>
The NSS believes that Greece's inflation was likely to revert
to its downward course in May.
</P>
<P>
All the price increases stemming from the devaluation of
drachmas in March had now been absorbed by the market, said the
NSS.
</P>
<P>
To speed up its pace to join the European Economic and Monetary
Union (EMU) in January 2001, the Greek government in March allowed
its national currency to incorporate with the European exchange
rate mechanism (ERM), and the drachmas was devalued by 14 percent.

<HEADLINE> Annan Recommends to Extend Mandate of UNMOT </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the
United Nations Kofi Annan on Thursday recommended to extend the
mandate of the United Nations Mission of Observers in Tajikistan
(UNMOT) for a further period of six months until November 15,
1998.
</P>
<P>
In his report to the Security Council of the United Nations,
Annan said during the past three months, progress in the country's
peace process has been very slow, and it has become clear that the
task of building confidence between the former adversaries is more
difficult than anticipated and will take longer than allowed for
in the ambitious timetable of the peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, it now seems unlikely that elections can be
held in 1998," Annan said in the report.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that comprehensive international support remains
essential for the continuation of the peace process," the U.N.
chief said.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, there is a need for financial assistance to help
Tajikistan, which is one of the poorest countries," he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. observer mission has been in the country since 1994
to monitor the cease-fire reached between Tajikistan's
Government and the United Tajik Opposition and to help carry out
peace accords between them.

ATHENS, May 7 (Xinhua) -- Greece has produced a new drug
