<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: South Lebanon Army Not Ignored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today promised that any peace accord in the
Middle East will take into account South Lebanon Army's (SLA)
interests, state-run Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with the pro-Israel SLA Commander General Antoine
Lahad here, he also reiterated Israel's commitment to its ally in
its self-proclaimed "security zone" in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were in an apparent attempt to boost the low morale
of Israel's ally in the Lebanon war.
</P>
<P>
The meeting took place amid reports that Israel had recently
initiated a proposal to replace the Israeli army and the SLA in
the "security zone" with an interim force from France, Egypt and
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from Paris, Israel relayed the proposal
to Lebanon through French diplomatic channels.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Lebanese sources, Syria intends to reject
the Israeli proposal, considered by Damascus as another attempt
to separate the Lebanese and Syrian peace tracks.
</P>
<P>
Syria sees the Israeli proposal as a new version of the
"Lebanon First" idea, broached by the Netanyahu government a few
weeks after its formation and then rejected by Damascus.
</P>
<P>
By proposing the "Lebanon First" plan, the Israeli government
wanted to end hostilities in Lebanon first before tackling the
fate of the Golan Heights which was captured by the Jewish state
in the 1967 Mideast war and Syria wants to take back.
</P>
<P>
Syria accused Israel of trying to distract attention away from
the main issue of the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> New York City Reported Safer Than Most Cities in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK,January 6 (Xinhua) -- New York City, known for crime
ridden, is now reported safer than most cities in the United
States, with its ranking down from 136th to 144th in total crime
for the first six months of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to a preliminary report issued yesterday by the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, in the first six months of last
year, New York saw a decline of 0.2 percent compared to a
nationwide decrease of one percent in all the categories except
rape. Burglary declined 15.3 percent in the city while it was
going down 5 percent in the rest of the country. Murder declined
by 11.7 percent in the city while going down 7 percent nationwide.
The report shows that 983 murders were committed in the city for
all of 1996, the lowest in 28 years.
</P>
<P>
The rankings move New York down from its position on the list
of the same period in 1995, in which it is ranked 136th of 182
cities.
</P>
<P>
The city's crime drop goes to the Police Department's new
strategies and to factors like the decline in the crack cocaine
trade and the aging of the baby-boom population.
</P>
<P>
Mayor of the city Rudolph W. Giuliani told a news conference
yesterday that the crime drop in the three consecutive years made
people feel comfortable putting businesses in New York City. That
means increased tourism and jobs.

<HEADLINE> Bank Director Arrested on Charge of Forgery in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Phnom Penh, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A director of a local bank
has been arrested on a warrant alleging forgery and embezzlement.
</P>
<P>
The English language newspaper, "Cambodia Daily", reported
that Heng Kim Y, director of Thaneakear Khmer (Khmer Bank), was
arrested last Thursday and was being held in prison. The paper was
quoting the deputy chief of the penal department of the Phnom Penh
Municipal Police.
</P>
<P>
Chea Sok, director general of the National Bank of Cambodia
(NBC) was quoted as saying that a warrant for Heng Kim Y's arrest
was issued by Municipal Court director, Un Sarith, and the NBC had
taken over administration of the Khmer Bank, which was closed for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
According to the daily, Chea Sok said shareholders complained
that Heng Kim Y forged documents allowing him to pocket part of
the four million U.S. dollars that the bank was required to have in
reserve under Cambodian banking laws. But he did not specify the
amount the shareholders claimed Heng Kim Y had embezzled.
</P>
<P>
NBC officials were now auditing the books at Khmer Bank to find
out if there was any sign of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
The Khmer Bank opened its doors for business on September 27,
1996. It did not have a National Bank license, and the NBC had
threatened to close it on this account.
</P>
<P>
The daily said Heng Kim Y protested that he had deposited the
required four million dollars in capital at the central bank, but
NBC officials still refused to give him a license.

<P>
NICOSIA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's President Robert
Mugabe arrived in Cyprus this afternoon for a three-day state

</P>
<P>
He called on Turkey to withdraw its troops from the island

"They (the people of Cyprus) are mature and wise enough to
settle their own internal problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
While welcoming Mugabe, Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides said
that the president of Zimbabwe has been "a great friend of

<HEADLINE> Bildt Opens Regional Office in Mostar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The International High
Representative for Bosnia, Carl Bildt, opened a United Nations
regional office today in Mostar to succeed the European Union (EU)
mission.
</P>
<P>
The new regional office will have wide authority in the
implementation of the Dayton accord throughout southern
Herzegovina, according to Croat radio in Mostar.
</P>
<P>
The office will be headed by the present EU Special Envoy,
Martin Garrod, who told Radio Sarajevo on New Year's eve that his
mission in Mostar over the past few months had been a political
failure.
</P>
<P>
Mostar, in the south of Bosnia, remains a divided city with
Muslim control in the east and Croats in the west.
</P>
<P>
Despite strong pressure from the international community, there
was still no freedom of movement between the two sectors, and no
single police force there to guarantee safety.
</P>
<P>
In the city, two administrative systems function separately.
Schools are separate, and so are health and financial systems.
</P>
<P>
According to Muslim Radio Sarajevo, instead of safe refugee
repatriation to their homes, Croats in Mostar had driven 74 Muslim
families out of their homes since the signing of the Dayton accord
in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees reported Sunday in
Sarajevo the latest case of expulsion was carried out on Sunday by
Croat police, who expelled a pregnant Muslim woman from her
home.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Army Promises not to Use Force Against Protesters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Belgrade student leaders said
Monday that Federal Yugoslav Army has promised not to intervene
against their anti-government protest to restore opposition
election victories annulled by President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made by the head of the army, Chief of General
Staff Gen. Momcilo Perisic on Monday at a meeting in Belgrade with
a five-member student delegation, the students said.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from an hour-long meeting held at the army
headquarters, the student leaders said they received further
assurance from Perisic that the Federal army wanted the political
disputes to be solved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
A statement released by the General Staff's Information Service
confirmed the army position by saying that Perisic told the
students the current problems had to be overcome in the "legal
institutions" of the state, as in other democratic countries, in
order that Yugoslavia may be incorporated into the international
community as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
The opposition coalition Zajedno has been organizing massive
but peaceful demonstrations in Belgrade over the past seven weeks
to protest the annulment of the local elections in November by the
ruling Socialist Party of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
Zajedno claims it had won the local elections in 14 out of 18
biggest cities and demands the reinstatement of the election
results and the recognition of their election victories.
</P>
<P>
But the government said last week that Zajedno had won in a few
of the smaller cities and insisted that in other districts no
party gained a majority or the results were inconclusive and
neeeded further study.
</P>
<P>
Zajedno was particularly concerned recently that the government
might use force to end the political crisis as it did in March
1991.
</P>
<P>
Zajedno leaders called for another protest march to the main
cathedral on Monday evening, the Christmas eve, to mark the
Orthodox Christmas. So far there is no immediate sign of a
peaceful settlement of the political crisis in Serbia.

<HEADLINE> EU Car Sales Down 5.5 Percent in November 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 6 (Xinhua) -- New car registrations in the
European Union(EU) fell by 5.5 percent in November 1996, compared
with the same period in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
This was reported by the twice-weekly news publication European
Report quoting the latest figures published by the European
Automobile Manufacturers' Association(ACEA).
</P>
<P>
It reported that the situation was broadly similar over the
seventeen European markets covered by ACEA figures(the 15 EU
member states plus Norway and Switzerland).
</P>
<P>
France suffered the sharpest decline(-21.8 percent), while
Ireland enjoyed the strongest growth(+83 percent). The Volkswagen
group remains the leading car maker with 17.9 percent of market
share.
</P>
<P>
Besides Ireland, new vehicle sales rose in eight countries in
November 1996, compared with the corresponding month in 1995:
notably in the Scandinavian countries, but also in Spain and
Portugal, and to a lesser extent the Netherlands and Greece.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said, these figures could not hide the fact
that a majority of countries had recorded an average 5.5 percent
decline on November 1995. The downward trend is unequivocal in
Belgium and Italy.
</P>
<P>
Notwithstanding, EU car sales have risen 6.3 percent between
January and November 1996.
</P>
<P>
Volkswagen has consolidated its leading position with a 9.3
percent increase in sales over the first nine months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Japanese car sales have risen 6.8 percent, while South Korean
manufacturers now account for two percent of the market, with sales
up 38.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader: IRA Attack "Regrettable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Gerry Adams, President of the
Irish Republican Army's (IRA) Sinn Fein political wing, said today
the IRA attack was a "regrettable" symptom of problems which must
be tackled.
</P>
<P>
But he said that a peace settlement would still be found.
</P>
<P>
IRA guerrillas, fighting for an end to British rule in Northern
Ireland, fired a rocket at high courts in Belfast today, injuring
two people.
</P>
<P>
A caller to a Belfast radio station, claiming IRA
responsibility for the rocket attack, said the guerrillas had also
left bombs at four hotels, at the city's main railway station and
a bus station.
</P>
<P>
The IRA ended a 17-month cease-fire last February and is
demanding admission of Sinn Fein to the Belfast peace talks
without preconditions.
</P>
<P>
But Britain and the Irish Republic, co-sponsors of the talks,
say Sinn Fein can only take part when the IRA has called a
permanent end to its guerrilla war.
</P>
<P>
The IRA bombed British army headquarters in the province last
October, killing one soldier and injuring 30.
</P>
<P>
On New Year's Eve the IRA said it had abandoned a van carrying
a land-mine in the grounds of Belfast castle. Tight security had
prevented them from reaching their intended target.

<P>
The meeting was proposed by Uganda during the the last East
African Commission meeting held on December 6.
</P>
<P>

The paper quoted one delegate who will attend the meeting as
saying that "in order to strengthen our relationship we must have
free movement of people."

<HEADLINE> Reduction of Interest Rates Called for in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Association of Chambers
of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI) has urged the Zambian government
to reduce interest rates to promote economic growth.
</P>
<P>
ZACCI Chairman George Chabwera also said the country's
agricultural policy must focus on food self-sufficiency and a
surplus for export.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted him as saying that in order to
promote economic growth, the government should first reduce its
borrowing by way of treasury bills and then broaden its tax base,
even if it means revising the poll tax, and cut public spending.
</P>
<P>
He said that many people feel frustrated at the poverty and
tragedies afflicting Africa in spite of the several billions of
Dollars poured on African economies since 1960s by donors.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, Africans in sub-Saharan Africa are poorer now than
in 1960s. This need not be the case in Zambia," said the
chairman.
</P>
<P>
"We must provide extension and marketing and introduce new
export for such crops as beans, cassava and rubber, which can
easily be grown by small-scale farmers," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for incentives to promote investment in
education to help parents to push their children to do well in
school.

<HEADLINE> Maize Shortage Causes Flour Price Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The cost of maize flour has
gone up by 20 percent in the last three months and the flour
prices shot up steadily due to shortage of maize, the East
African Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted sources from the agricultural sector as
saying that prices of maize meal are about to double what they
were in June last year.
</P>
<P>
Erratic rains in April last year at the start of the growing
season in Kenya adversely affected early planted crops, according
to a food situation report compiled by the Inter-governmental
Authority on Development.
</P>
<P>
Further more, the report added, low farm prices discouraged
farmers from expanding the production of maize, the main staple
food of Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
The long rains maize production for 1996 is estimated by
Kenyan Ministry of Agriculture at two million tons, 20 percent
decline compared with 1995, the report pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The overall cereal production is estimated at 3.8 million tons
for the 1996/97 marketing year while the total consumption needs
4.5 million tons in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that Kenya's cereal import requirements for
1996/97 are estimated at 674,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Following poor rains in the vulnerable areas of Eastern,
Northeastern and Rift Valley provinces, about 1.5 million Kenyans
may require relief food in the east African country which has a
population of 28 million.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi in a New Year address
declared that shortage of staple food is one of the major
challenges facing Kenya in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan leader noted that food shortages had been brought
about by mainly droughts in the eastern and northeastern
provinces as well as poor harvests of maize in the main producing
areas in the country.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Customs Revenue Up 46 Percent in 11 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Customs Service
recorded a revenue of some 69.3 billion Naira (about 866 million
U.S. Dollars) in the first 11 months of last year, an increase of
46 percent over the same year-earlier period.
</P>
<P>
According to the government-owned New Nigerian newspaper
today, the general increase in all customs houses across the
country was attributed to the resolve of the customs management
to ensure its revenue collection machinery is strengthened in
furtherance of the economic interests of the country.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Sole Administrator of the Customs, S.O.G.
Ango as saying that 48.4 billion Naira, or nearly 70 percent, of
the total revenue was credited into the federation account, which
represented total collections from imports, excise and fees.
</P>
<P>
The remainings were collected by the customs on behalf of some
other government agencies, including the Nigerian Port Authority.
</P>
<P>
To sanitize the industry in an image-building effort, the
customs service has recently carried out some reorganization with
dismissals and disciplinary measures.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more than 20 senior customs officers have been
fired for official misconduct ranging from illegal clearance of
containers, undervaluation of imported goods to collusion with
unscrupulous importers and clearing agents in evading duty.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Defense Industry Exporting Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Small arms manufactured by
Nigeria's Defense industries Corporation (DIC) are currently
being exported to neighboring west African countries, despite
sanctions from the European Union and the U.S. and poor funding.
</P>
<P>
The arms include rifle, pistol and 7.62mm calibre ammunition
types, the Daily Times newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the official 1997 diary of the Defense Ministry,
efforts are being made to ensure that the nation's military
requirements are met locally, especially under the sanctions of
the international community imposed at the end of 1995 following
the Nigerian government's execution of nine minority activities.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the problem of funding, which Defense Headquarters
said had bedeviled all federal agencies recently, the military
is still able to keep abreast of time and has demonstrated that
it is a force to reckon with not only in the west African
sub-region but in the entire continent," the publication said,
quoted by the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Most of Nigeria's military equipment comes from abroad. The
DIC, established in 1964, is reported to have so far met the
nation's defense needs, especially the production of small arms
and ammunition.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria attended a meeting of
eight nations, mainly Islamic states, in Istanbul, Turkey, to lay
the foundation for the formation of a nascent organization to
boost economic ties among them, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Other participating countries at the two-day meeting of
foreign ministers or other senior officials, which closed Sunday,
are Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Malaysia and Pakistan,
all Islamic nations.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, the host nation, is a secular state but more than 90
percent of its citizens are Moslems.
</P>
<P>
The creation of the group, dubbed as the D-8 (Development 8)
which is patterned after the G-7 gathering of the seven most
industrialized nations in the world, was proposed by Turkish
Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan last year.
</P>
<P>
After the ministers' meeting, the summit of heads of state or
government of the participating nations will be held, also in
Istanbul, "within the first six months" of this year to further
discuss the establishment of the organization, according to the
final communique of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Instead of being an entity based on religion, the D-8 will be
an organization to boost economic and trade ties among the member
states, as well as South-to-South trade.
</P>
<P>
"The great potential of these countries, which altogether have
a population of around 800 million, has not been reflected in
trade relations among each others," said Turkish Foreign Minister
Tansu Ciller, quoted by the reports.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the eight countries will
cooperate in several economic fields, including finance, banking,
investments, privatization, coordination of private sectors,
technology and small and medium-scale industries.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation will also be open to the future participation
of other states.

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Five government soldiers
arrested by the Sierra Leone Naval Patrol Unit early November
last year have been jailed for 10 years each with hard labor,
Justice Ministry officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The soldiers who were sentenced to jail on Saturday had
attacked a Spanish fishing boat offshore Freetown, capital of
Sierra Leone, according to the officials.
</P>
<P>
"We are now determined to stamp out piracy and make the
country's territorial waters safe," one official said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's statistics, piratical attacks for
the past three years on fishing boats plying the country's
coastal waters have increased five fold to about an average of
four a month, with the highest falling in the month of November
last year.
</P>
<P>
Naval Commander Alimamy Sesay in an interview said, "stiffer
penalties should be given to pirates as from now on."
</P>
<P>
Last September, Spanish and Canary Island boat owners
protested to Sierra Leone over what they called "the high
incidence of piracy and they threatened to withdraw their boats
from Sierra Leone if the government does not step up the battle
against piracy."

<HEADLINE> Donors Blamed for Stopping Disbursement of Zanzibar Development Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice-President
Omar Ali Juma today blamed some donor countries for threatening
to stop disbursement of development funds earmarked for Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
He said although the Zanzibar government appreaciated aid,
donors should not use cheap excuses to embarrass it.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here, Omar stated this when
opening a water well project at Kaburi Kikombe near the town of
Zanzibar as part of celebrations to mark the 33rd anniversary
of the Zanzibar January Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Analysts in Zanzibar believe that Omar's remarks were in reaction
to the move by Finland to suspend development aid to Zanzibar's rural
water supply project.
</P>
<P>
Finland is reported to have pulled out of the multi-million
Shilling project because of the failure by the government to estblish
the water authority and introduce water service charges to meet
running costs and maintenance.
</P>
<P>
At present, Zanzibaris are supplied with water free of charge. The
government foots the bill.
</P>
<P>
Vice-President Omar insisted that it was only through self help
projects that the people could solve problems facing them and at the
same time save the government from embarrassments against donor
countries.
</P>
<P>
He thanked the Zanzibar government for its efforts to solve water
problems for the people, saying it is encouraging the government
managed to accomplish the Kaburi Kikombe water project without
external support.
</P>
<P>
The Kaburi Kikombe water project can produce about 125 litres
of water per hour. It will serve about 100,000 residents in
Zanzibar Town.  enditem

<HEADLINE> Apple Computer Plans to Shrink </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Apple Computer, one of the
leading computer makers of the world, will suffer greater losses
during the last quarter of 1996, according to a report of the USA
Today.
</P>
<P>
The company faces more cost cutting and possible layoffs after
announcing late Friday that it expects an operating loss of 100
million to 150 million the quarter ended December, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The company underwent a year of turmoil and restructuring.
</P>
<P>
The size of the loss indicates Apple has yet to get its
business plan in shape, and that many consumers are unconvinced
that it can survive long term.
</P>
<P>
Gilbert Amelio, who became Apple's chief executive officer in
February, said Apple will shrink more than he expected, to about 8
billion U.S. dollars in revenue this fiscal year. That would be
down 18 percent from last year's 9.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
On December 20, Apple announced its 400 million U.S. dollar
purchase of NeXT Software, founded by Apple co-founder Steven
Jobs. Apple will use NeXT's technology to create a new operating
system, which controls the look and feel of computers.
</P>
<P>
Apple managed a 25 million U.S. dollar profit in the
July-September quarter after three quarterly losses, according to
the report.

every Zambian of school going age can attain the minimum of grade
nine education by the year 2015, according to a national policy
on education document obtained from the Ministry of Education.
</P>
<P>
The government will rehabilitate existing infrastructure and

"The first element of the approach will be to ensure that
every child can enter school at the appropriate age and receive
at least seven years of good quality education," said the
document which was signed by Education Minister Syamukayumbu
Syamujaye last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"The second element will be to ensure that every pupil who
completes grade seven can enter grades eight and nine," according
to the document.
</P>
<P>
Communities will be expected to provide the infrastructure
while the government will provide technical advice, teachers,
equipment and materials for the exercise, the document said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Zambian education system, grades one to seven
are for lower basic education, grades eight to nine for middle
basic education and grades 10 to 11 for higher education.

The companies, most of them in mining, financial services and

</P>
<P>
The release of the survey came few months after the Central
Bank and Finance Ministry introduced steps to ease foreign
exchange restrictions on South African firms investing in
Southern African region.
</P>
<P>
Growth potential of the consumer and retail industries in
South Africa will depend on the performance of the African
economies, some of which were growing faster than the modest 3.0
rate of South Africa last year, said the survey.
</P>
<P>
Economic reforms in these countries appeared to have created
significant middle classes, a main power that bolstered the
consumer industries.
</P>
<P>
Financial services also advance into the African market
following mining and retailing companies and there are more and
more banks participating in doing business with South African
corporations.
</P>

HARARE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe needs to formulate a
strategy to develop the small and medium scale sector if the
indigenisation of the economy is to succeed, the Zimbabwe
National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) said in a paper released
today.
</P>
<P>
The ZNCC said it realised that there is need for
sub-contracting to allow blacks to move into the mainstream
economy.
</P>
<P>
" A small scale industry strategy should be integrated within
the framework of the economy as a whole to ensure compatibility
between macro-economic and micro economic interventions,'' the
ZNCC said.
</P>
<P>
According to the ZNCC, sub-contracting could open avenues for
many struggling small and medium scale enterprise, create
employment and enable larger companies to do away with peripheral
services and improve their efficiency.

<HEADLINE> Infant Mortality Rate Goes up in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Infant mortality in Zimbabwe
rises from 52 per 1,000 in the 1980s to currently 77 per 1,000,
Hagar Mapondera, the Coordinator of Zimbabwe's Midwives Group,
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the maternal mortality rate has doubled from 100
per 100,000 to 200 per 100,000 live births, she said.
</P>
<P>
The increase is due to the high HIV (virus which can cause
the fatal AIDS disease) infections, said Mapondera.
</P>
<P>
However, "in other African countries, maternala mortality is as
high as 600 per 100,000 live births," she said.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that one-tenth of more than 11 million
Zimbabweans have been infected with HIV and 300-to-500 people are
killed by AIDS-related diseases every week in the country.

GENEVA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) will not
withdraw its demand for an arbitration by the World Trade
Organization (WTO) on U.S. anti-Cuba Helms-Burton Act although
U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered a six-month suspension of the
act's implementation last Friday, Roderick Abbott, head of EU's

<P>
Roderick Abbott told reporters that Clinton's decision to delay
the implementation of the Helms-Burton Act does not mean that the
U.S. government will modify the act, under which foreign companies
doing business in Cuba would be sued by U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
On November 20, 1996, WTO decided to set up an independent

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Officially Confirms Missile Deal with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government has
confirmed to have signed a deal to buy Russian-made S-300
surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides told a private television
network today that the deal "is a reality, the process has been
concluded and the relevant agreement signed."
</P>
<P>
The minister, however, pointed out the missiles can not be
delivered immediately, but he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
The multi-million dollar arms deal, believed to have been
signed Saturday, has caused the United States, European Union
countries and Turkey to express grave concern over the military
build-up in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"Our ambassador to the U.S. was summoned to the State
Department where the American administration expressed its deep
concern about our moves," Michaelides told Antena TV.
</P>
<P>
A European country has taken similar stance about the deal, the
minister disclosed, but refrained from naming the specific country.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said Ankara has issued warning that the
deal will not help the peace process in Cyprus and threatened to
take "counter-measures."
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, a spokesman for the Russian Rosvoorouzhenie company
which signed the deal has said the deal is unlikely to upset the
military balance in the region, because they are defensive
military hardware.
</P>
<P>
Michaelides explained that this deal conveys the message that
efforts towards a settlement to the Cyprus issue must be
intensified and speeded up.
</P>
<P>
"The missiles will boost our defense capability and are not in
any way an act of aggression," he added, noting that President
Glafcos Clerides' proposal for the demilitarization of Cyprus is
still on the cards.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believed that the new missiles, with a range
of 150 kilometers, will be deployed to protect naval and air
bases under construction on the west coast of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The bases are being built under a joint defense pact between
Cyprus and Greece, agreed in November 1993 to face possible
Turkish threats.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkey sent troops
and seized the northern third of the island following a
short-lived coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> US Committed to Kuwaiti Security: Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
continue to carry out its commitment to the security of Kuwait
mainly through its military presence both in the Gulf and Kuwait
in the new year, a senior American diplomat said here today.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Kuwait Ryan Crocker said in an interview
with the Kuwait News Agency that "the U.S. commitment to the
security of Kuwait is absolutely unshakable, we have reaffirmed
this on numerous occasions and throughout President Bill
Clinton's term of office."
</P>
<P>
He said that "with respect to our military levels in Kuwait
which are the embodiment of that commitment, the numbers and the
composition of our forces will change according to operational
requirements and according to circumstances."
</P>
<P>
The United States currently has 25,000 military personnel in
the Gulf region, including Kuwait. It sent two aircraft carriers,
B-52 bombers, F-117a Stealth fighters and Patriot missiles to the
Gulf last September in its confrontation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said that "we have a number of very flexible
options to assure that at all times we have adequate forces in
the area to back-up our commitments that is the case now and
continues to be the case."
</P>
<P>
He insisted that Iraq remains the major threat to its
neighbors, saying "as we enter this new year and look back at
nearly the six years that have passed since the liberation of
Kuwait, the regime in Baghdad has demonstrated (this) time and
again."
</P>
<P>
The United States and Kuwait signed a military agreement
following the Gulf War under which the U.S. promised to defend
the small oil-rich Emirate against foreign attacks and frequent
military exercises were held between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Since last September, U.S. and Kuwait have been conducting a
series of joint military training maneuvers.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb President Says No Haggling About Brcko </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb president Biljana
Plavsic said Monday that the town of Brcko was important for the
Republika Srpska and there could be no haggling about it.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no deals or sale regarding Brcko," a town in
northeastern Bosnia which links the northwestern and eastern parts
of the Republika Srpska, Plavsic told a political gathering in
Banja Luka, the Serb largest city in the northwest, Tanjug news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Both the Serbs and Muslims claim sovereignty over the
controversial town which is of strategic importance to both sides.
Under the Dayton agreement, the status of Brcko will be decided
under international arbitration by the end of 1996 but the
deadline was postponed till February 20 of this year.
</P>
<P>
In the same day, the Serb Vice-President Dragoljub Mirjanic
held a meeting with U.S. official Jim Coel in Banja Luka. He told
reporters after the meeting that the U.S. state department
representative had been informed about a decisive stand of the
Republika Srpska -- the Serbs would fight for ensuring that Brcko
remains part of the Serb territory.
</P>
<P>
Coel promised to inform the U.S. state department about talks
with Serb leaders so that the U.S. administration could take a
clear stand on all controversial issues regarding the
implementation of the Dayton agreement, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Mirjanic and Coel raised the issue of the
exchange of prisoners of war and information about missing persons
between the Bosnian Serb, Croat and Muslim sides.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Concerned About Military Build-up in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkey expressed today grave
concern over the military build-up in Cyprus following the
signing of an arms deal of purchasing Russian-made missiles
between Russia and the island state.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Spokesman Omer Akbel told reporters that
Turkey firmly opposed a change of the power balance on the
divided island.
</P>
<P>
He said the Turkish government would never allow any
endangerment of the Turkish Cypriots living in the northern part
of what he called the heavily militarized country.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Turkey would take necessary actions if the
situation on the island continued to deteriorate. However, he
did not elaborate on what actions Turkey might take.
</P>
<P>
"What we say to Russian authorities, first, is to remind them
of their special responsibilities as a U.N. Security Council
permanent member, secondly, not to change the balance on the
island," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Cypriot ministers and representatives of the
Russian state-controlled Rosvoorouzhenie company concluded a
multi-million-dollar surface-to-air missile contract at a meeting
on the eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides confirmed the arms
deal today. He told a private television network that the deal
"is a reality, the process has been conducted and the relevant
agreement signed."
</P>
<P>
The arms deal between Greek Cypriots and the Russians has
aroused strong opposition from both Turkish Cypriots and Turkey,
which is the only country in the world to recognize the
self-claimed "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktas accused Moscow of
displaying enmity toward Turks by selling missiles to Greek
Cypriots, warning that Cyprus was now on the verge of an armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, both members of the NATO, are at odds over
the divided strategic island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into two parts since 1974 when the
Turkish troops landed on the island and took control of the
northern part following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriots
seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies Letter Bombs from Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt today renewed its denial
that the letter bombs sent to Washington had been mailed from
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Osama el-Baz, political advisor to Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak told reporters, "There is no evidence as yet that the
letter bombs discovered at a Washington newspaper office and a
Kansas jail in the United States were sent from Egypt."
</P>
<P>
Eight letter bombs disguised as Christmas cards, carrying the
seal of Alexandria post, were dispatched separately to the
Washington bureau of the London-based Saudi newspaper Al Hayat's
and to a jail around Leavenworth, Kansas in the U.S. Friday.
</P>
<P>
Emerging from a meeting with the U.S. Ambassador Edward
Walker, he said it would be premature to jump to any conclusion
and that the agencies concerned are examining the issue very
accurately.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador also discredited reports about a visit by a team
of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to Egypt to probe the
possibility of the dispatch of letter bombs from Egypt to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Walker stressed that security agencies in both countries
maintain normal relations and "seek clarifications from each
other." No committee was set up to examine the matter, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that it is natural that the two sides discuss the topic
of letter bombs and try to resolve the case.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, security bodies here dismissed the possibility that
these bombs had slipped out of Egypt. They suggested that fake
stamps can be made on letters to confuse investigators.

<HEADLINE> International Observers to Be Stationed in Hebron </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Palestine decided
today to ask international observers to station in Hebron
following partial Israeli troop withdrawal from the West Bank
city.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after Israeli and Palestinian
negotiators signed a protocol in Jericho this afternoon, according
to a state-run Israel Radio report.
</P>
<P>
It said that under the accord, an additional 180 observers from
Denmark, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland and Turkey will join the 30
Norwegian peace-keepers already stationed in Hebron. Invitations
are to be sent out immediately to the countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
The document, initialed by Israeli Foreign Ministry Director
General Eitan Bentsur and Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat, will be appended to the impending Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai said that
the Hebron redeployment agreement has been wrapped up in writing
by both sides and that differences now focus on further Israeli
redeployments in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Appearing at the Knesset (Israeli parliament) Foreign Affairs
and Defense Committee, Mordechai said that under the security
arrangements, Israel will solely be responsible for safeguarding
the area of the Tomb of Patriarchs.
</P>
<P>
As to the Shuhada Street closed to the Palestinian citizens
for two years now, a solution has been found complete with a map,
Mordechai said, adding that American, Israeli and Palestinian
engineers have worked out a map to widen the street and install
sidewalk and lighting, so as to separate the Jewish settlers and
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai declared that shortly after the agreement is singed
the army can complete redeployment in Hebron in a very short
time.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Middle East peace coordinator Dennis Ross today continued
his efforts to narrow differences between the two sides. He met
with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu this morning and is
scheduled to have a meeting with Palestinian National Authority
President Yasser Arafat in the West Bank city of Bethlehem tonight.
</P>
<P>
Ross is reportedly trying to arrange another summit between
Netanyahu and Arafat.

<HEADLINE> UK Commercial Property Market Forecast to Boost in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- More industrial and commercial
companies in Britain are expecting to increase their property
holdings, according to a survey published Monday by the
Confederation of British Industry (CBI).
</P>
<P>
The survey, carried out by the CBI in conjunction with Grimley,
the international property advisers, showed that a net balance of
six percent of companies planned to increase property holdings in
the first half of this year, compared with three percent for the
previous six months.
</P>
<P>
The fifth biannual property survey, which covered 645 companies
in the country, found that big companies were more optimistic than
smaller ones of increasing output and hiring staff as well as
increasing office space.
</P>
<P>
The recovery in the commercial property market will be more
widespread, and the biggest increase is expected to come from
companies in the distribution, metal manufacturing, chemical
processing, transport and communication sector.
</P>
<P>
The strongest growth in demand for property is expected to be
in the northwest of England, Northern Ireland, greater London and
Scotland, but other parts of the southeast are likely to see a
downturn.
</P>
<P>
The main Reasons for capital spending on property are capacity
expansion, replacement and increasing efficiency.
</P>
<P>
"Companies are now noticeably more optimistic about employment

<HEADLINE> Angolan Former Rebel Leader Invites Mandela to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, January 6 (Xinhua) --Angola's former rebel leader
Jonas Savimbi left here today for a visit to South Africa where
he will invite South African President Nelson Mandela to mediate
between him and Angolan President Eduard dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is believed to hold his fifth talks with President
Eduard dos Santos soon, the Angolan News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It is the third time for Mandela to meet Savimbi, the chairman
of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola
(UNITA), said the report.
</P>
<P>
The main topic at the Savimbi-Mandela meeting would be the
difficulties facing Angola's peace process and the delays of the
solution to various problems facing the peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
One of the disputes between Savimbi and Santos is reportedly
the status of Savimbi in the future Angolan goverment. The
Angolan president once offered the position of Vice President to
Savimbi, but was refused.
</P>
<P>
The South African government has on many occasions expressed
its support for the peace process in Angola. Mandela has attended
the summit of the southern African leaders held in Launda in last
October at which peace in Angola was discussed.
</P>
<P>
Mandela has maintained regular telephone contacts with the
Angolan president.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar To Introduce Cost-Sharing System into </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zanzibar Health
Ministry is planning to introduce cost-sharing system into the
originally charge-free health services in the town of Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
Saleh Sadik Osman, the ministry's Principal Secretary, told
the Daily News newspaper in the town today that the plan has gone
to the government.
</P>
<P>
"We are waiting for the outcome of our proposal," Osman said.
</P>
<P>
If the plan gets approval and takes into effect, patients will
have to pay 100 Tanzania Shillings (about 16 U.S. cents) for
blood tests in the state-owned hospitals.
</P>
<P>
However, it will still be far lower than the similar charges
in private hospitals, which are currently between 150 and 300
Shillings (25 to 50 cents), said Osman.
</P>
<P>
He said that patients who can't afford the charges will
be exempted from paying for their health services.
</P>
<P>
The Zanzibaris have enjoyed health service free of charge for
many years.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's Economy Picks up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President
Benjamin Mkapa said today the country's economy has picked up as
its exports are increasing faster than imports, which leads to a
improved trade balance.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa told foreign diplomatic corps that the inflation in the
country fell from November's 27 percent to currently 16 percent
due to the government's tightened fiscal policy.
</P>
<P>
"Private investments are picking up, notably in the tourism and
mining sectors as well as manufacturing," he said.
</P>
<P>
All these achievements have been made by the continuing
restructuring of the economy, including divestiture and
pritivization, said Mkapa.
</P>
<P>
The governmental policies implemented last year also boosted
the confidence of donors and investors in the country's
economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania hopes to negotiate with the Paris Club members on
debt relief by the end of this month so as to get continuous
understanding and support from the donors, Mkapa said.
</P>
<P>
Debt relief will help the country achieve a stronger,
sustainable and self-reliant development, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the regional cooperation, Mkapa said since the inauguration
of the East African Cooperation Secretariat, comprising Tanzania,
Uganda and Kenya, in March, currencies of the three countries
are now convertible inside the region.
</P>
<P>
Financial aids are being sought for the East African digital
telecommunications project and for improving roads in the region,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the same time the three countries are taking steps to develop
East Africa as a single trade and investment area, as well as to
improve the navigational and environmental status of Lake Victoria,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa vowed to continue to make every efforts to promote East
African Cooperation and pledged to remain a firm and ardent
member of the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC),

<HEADLINE> Egypt Reports 32 Oil Finds in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Egypt made 32 oil finds and signed
14 agreements for oil prospection with global companies last year,
Egyptian Minister of Oil Hamdy el-Banbi said today.
</P>
<P>
These companies are expected to spend some 300 million
U.S. dollars on drilling 83 wildcats over a total area of 142,000
square kilometers across the country, the oil minister said in a
report made before the People's Assembly's Industry and Energy
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Among the 32 oil finds, 12 produce oil while the remaining 20
give natural gas, Banbi added.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's oil output amounts to 44 million tonnes and natural gas
production reaches 10.1 million tonnes, in comparison with the 32
million tonnes of overall output in 1983, the oil minister said.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas fields in the Nile Delta and on the Mediterranean
coast make up 60 percent of Egypt's total output while the
remaining comes from the Western Desert, he said.
</P>
<P>
As for crude oil, Delta and Mediterranean coast produce 50
percent, the Western Desert produces 33 percent and the Gulf of
Suez 17 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local consumption of petroleum products has reached 16.5
million tonnes along with two million tonnes of natural gas, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has tried hard to boost the role of the private
sector in oil exploration and increasing the capacity of
refineries as well as encouraging gas-fueled industries, the oil
minister said.

TEHRAN, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Three members of an
anti-government organization of Iran were killed when they hit
mine fields in Iran's western province of Kermanshahan.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA reported that the two men and

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Speaker Rules out Achieving Peace With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese House Speaker Nabih
Berri today ruled out the possibility that Lebanon and Syria will
achieve peace with Israel in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here, the Shiite house speaker
also ruled out a full-scale war with Israel, saying that "the
Israelis are going on a destructive war" in south Lebanon and
would not stop it.
</P>
<P>
"I don't believe that the year 1997 will be a year of peace,
but it will be a year of pressure especially on Lebanon and
Syria," Berri told reporters in the Parliamentary Building.
</P>
<P>
"We should pay attention to this and should reassert our
national unity," said the house speaker, who is also the head of
the pro-Syrian Amal Movement.
</P>
<P>
"You should look at what is happening in south Lebanon, there
are daily fightings," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned against creating fracture between the resistance
and the people and between the resistance and the government,
and causing fracture or separation between Lebanon and Syria.
</P>
<P>
On the fate of the peace negotiations on the Lebanese and
Syrian tracks, Berri noted that both Lebanon and Syria
participated in the peace talks on the basis of the October 1991
Madrid peace conference decisions and United Nations
resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks between Syria and Israel were suspended last
February amid a spate of suicide bombings in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Berri emphasized Syria's demand to resume the peace talks
with the Jewish state from where they stopped without going back
to the zero point.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that when he met Hosni Mubarak in Cairo at the
weekend, the Egyptian president told him a secret that he had
been informed by former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin a
readiness to give up the Golan Heights the Jewish state occupied
in 1967.
</P>
<P>
But the former Labor prime minister, who was shot dead by a
Jewish extremist at a peace rally in November 1995, had preferred
to wait and see what Syria would give in normalization in
exchange for the Israeli pullout, Berri quoted the Egyptian
president as saying.
</P>
<P>
Berri said that Lebanon is "a strong point rather than a weak
point" in the Middle East peace process as long as the Lebanese
uphold the national unity and internal solidarity.
</P>
<P>
"If (Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin) Netanyahu think that
Lebanon is a weak point, we tell him that we are a strong point,
and in our hands a lot of cards on condition that we continue to
uphold the national unity and the internal solidarity," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We will not be a weak point unless we are split and the
Lebanese track is separated from the Syrian track and a fracture
is created between the resistance and the state," the house
speaker said.

JOHANNESBURG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- South Africa and Togo are
to set up formal diplomatic relations soon and have reached
agreement to boost mutual economic cooperation, said a South
Africa-Togo joint communique issued in Cape Town today.
</P>
<P>
The two countries are ready to establish diplomatic relations
under an accord signed in March, 1996, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
The news came following a weekend two-day visit by South
African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki to Togo, located in
western Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mbeki held talks with Togolese President Gnassingbe Eyadema on
common interests and bilateral, continental and international
issues, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Both of them expressed satisfaction with their newly-promoted
friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
They also called for the heads of states concerned and
the international community to work together to regain peace and
stability in the region of Lake Victoria.
</P>
<P>
Eyadema said South Africa should play a key role in restoring
peace in the region and in the efforts aimed at getting the whole
Africa rid of economic stagnation.

<HEADLINE> New Genes for Cassava in Nigeria Developed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Techniques for the transfer of
"foreign" genes into cassava in Nigeria and Colombia have been
developed, the News Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
The development would open up the possibilities of improving
cassava, one of the major food sources for Nigerians, in ways which
have hitherto eluded researchers, the report said,
quoting the "Spore", a bulletin of information for agricultural
development in African, Carribean and Pacific countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the bulletin, the breakthrough would make it possible
to regenerate cassava plantlets from single cells from which mature
cassava plants could be produced.
</P>
<P>
Researchers at the University of Bath in England, achieved this with
two improved cultivars from Nigeria and Colombia, but the workability
of the new techniques with all cassava varieties has not yet been
established, it said.
</P>
<P>
Similar techniques have also been developed by scientists in the
United States and Switzerland, which should also make it possible to
introduce pest and disease resistance to improve the quality and
storing properties of the crops in some countries.
</P>
<P>
In another development, scientists in the nigeria-based
international institute of tropical agriculture have evaluated the
drought tolerance of about 900 different strains of cowpea together
with their Japanese colleagues.
</P>
<P>
The findings show that drought-tolerant strains yield about one ton
per hectare without irrigation during the dry season in tropical
Africa, good for areas in lack of rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Experiement carried out in north Nigeria's Kano State has proved
the good properties of the drough-tolerant strains, the bulletin said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Takes Measures to Prevent Looming Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has taken urgent measures
to avert a looming fuel shortage caused by the recent damage of
Tanzania's Single Point Mooring (SPM) on off-loading oil from
ships, Energy Minister Suresh Desai said today.
</P>
<P>
Zambia imports most of its crude oil from Tanzanian ports.
Therefore, the SPM, gutted by fire during Christmas holidays, is
critical to the oil supplies to Zambia.
</P>
<P>
However, the SPM facility now is being repaired and
arrangements for using smaller crude oil off-loading facilities
instead have been made in case the repairing work continues
beyond 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's oil reserve can last for 60 days, said Desai.
</P>
<P>
Oil tanks may use the secured smaller crude oil off-loading
facility to get closer to the shore of the Dar Es Salaam port in
Tanzania, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SPM was damaged last September, resulting in a fuel crisis
in Zambia.

<HEADLINE> Job Chances for UK Graduates Forecast to Rise in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Job prospects for graduates in
Britain are the best since 1990 and vacancies will grow rapidly
this year, according to a survey published today by the
Association of Graduate Recruiters (AGR).
</P>
<P>
The annual survey of 260 leading companies found that vacancies
for graduates are increasing at a faster rate than student numbers
for the first time in five years.
</P>
<P>
The association said that the number of graduate jobs stayed
the same almost throughout the recession, but the number of
graduates coming out of the university system has doubled over the
past five years, so graduates had to battle hard for top jobs
during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
However, the AGR, which represents both private and public
employers, forecast an 11.5 percent growth in vacancies for
graduates this year, and said that employers will offer markedly
higher starting salaries in an effort to hire the best young
graduates.
</P>
<P>
The rush for the best graduates is partly caused by economic
growth and partly by the increasing impact of globalization, which
is driving companies to recruit more highly-educated staff than in
the past, said the AGR.
</P>
<P>
More than a third of companies said that they could not find
suitable graduates for scientific, engineering, technical,
research and development jobs, particularly those in computing.
</P>
<P>
Roly Cockman, chief executive of the association, said that the
AGR would like to see university courses deliver the skills
employers needed, which means more teamwork and project work and
less straightforward lecturing.

the delay, Mandela met Savimbi in government residence in Umtata,
in Eastern Cape Province, rather than at his home in Qunu.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Government Apologizes to Mulroney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government
apologized today to former Prime Minister Brian Mulroney for
suggesting that he was involved in criminal activity in the Airbus
affair.
</P>
<P>
The government also agreed to pay the legal bills, somewhere
around 730,000 U.S. dollars, in Mulroney's libel suit against it.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Canada and the RCMP (Royal Canadian Mounted
Police) regret any damage suffered by Mr. Mulroney and his family
and fully apologize to them," said the settlement agreement, which
was made public this morning.
</P>
<P>
"Some of the language contained in the Request for Assistance
indicates, wrongly, that the RCMP had reached conclusion that Mr.
Mulroney had engaged in criminal activity," it said.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the evidence received to date, the RCMP acknowledges
that any conclusions of wrongdoing by the former prime minister
were -- and are --unjustified," the agreement said.
</P>
<P>
The RCMP will pay to Mulroney all court fees, which will be
determined by an arbitrator. And Mulroney agrees to waive his
demand for damages.
</P>
<P>
Mulroney was suing the government for 36.5 million U.S. dollars
for alleging in a letter to Swiss authorities that he accepted as
much as 3.65 million dollars in kickbacks in the purchase of 34
Airbus planes in 1988 when he was the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The settlement, initiated by the government, was reached about
12 hours before the trial was to begin this morning in the Quebec
Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement is in the best interests of the Canadian
government, the Canadian justice system and the Canadian
taxpayers," Justice Minister Allan Rock told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"The government's decision to resolve this case out-of-court is
good news," said RCMP Commissioner Philip Murray.
</P>
<P>
Having the civil case settled, the RCMP can focus its attention
on the criminal investigation of the Airbus affairs, Murray said,
adding "that probe is active and ongoing."
</P>
<P>
Mulroney also stressed that he has no objection to the RCMP
investigating him.
</P>
<P>
He launched the libel suit in November 1995 because the letter
sent by the Justice Department to the Swiss stated categorically
that he had accepted the kickbacks.
</P>
<P>
The letter sent in October 1995 requested assistance to search
bank accounts for evidence of the suspected payoffs.
</P>
<P>
Mulroney has also denied that he has any bank accounts in
Switzerland or anywhere else outside of Canada.
</P>
<P>
The RCMP first heard allegations in 1988 but dropped the case
for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
The case was reopened in 1995 after CBC-TV and Der Spiegel, a
German news magazine, suggested that Airbus may have paid 12.4
million dollars in kickbacks to Canadians.

<HEADLINE> US Treasury Permits Food Export to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S Treasury has given
Cargill Inc., a Minneapolis firm, permission to export 500,000
tons of food to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in a
barter transaction, an administration official said today.
</P>
<P>
The permission followed a statement issued by the DPRK a week
ago, which expressed "deep regret" over its submarine running
aground off South Korea's coast in last September.
</P>
<P>
A Cargill spokeswoman said the license to export the food to
the DPRK had been approved on December 30 in response to an
application submitted by Cargill, the world's largest private
grain company, to sell the DPRK up to 2 million tons of grain.
</P>
<P>
"We have received a license to export up to 500,000 tons of
good, consisting of wheat and/or rice," spokeswoman Laurie
Johnson said. "We probably will not have much more to say about
this, as a courtesy to the customer."
</P>
<P>
Reports said that U.S. experts this week will resume encasing
the DPRK's 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods in steel and concrete for
safe storage before moving them out of the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Canning of the fuel rods was part of the nuclear agreement
between the United States and the DPRK, in which a U.S.-sponsored
Western consortium would provide funds for the replacement of two
Graphite reactors with light-water ones.

<HEADLINE> EU More Than Self-sufficient in Wine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 28 billion litres of
wine will be available within the European Union (EU) during the
1996/97 marketing year, to satisfy an estimated average per capita
consumption of 34.57 litres by the Community's citizens.
</P>
<P>
These figures emerge from the official forward estimate for the
1996/97 wine year, published recently by the European Commission
(EC), the executive body of the EU.
</P>
<P>
Based on data forwarded by EU member states, the EC experts
reckon EU wine-grower will produce 176.18 million hectolitres (a
hectolitre (hl) is 100 litre) during the year.
</P>
<P>
Existing stocks of just over 110 million hl and exports of over
five million hl will swell the total wine availability to the
final estimate figure.
</P>
<P>
The Commission calculated that 127.37 million hl of these wines
would be consumed within the EU, making the Community "121 percent
self-sufficient" in wine.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Links between three key economic
zones and trans-Vietnam land, rail and water routes will take
priority in Vietnam's transport master plan for 1997-2000, it was
announced a here today.
</P>
<P>
Acting Minister of Transport and Communications Le Ngoc Hoan
said Vietnam had worked out an overall plan for transport and
communications development in the period between 1997 to 2000. Top
priority would be given to links between the economic areas as
well as major airports and sea ports of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
He said in the north, transport facilities would be built and
upgraded to help quickly develop the Hanoi-Haiphong-Quang Ninh
economic triangle. In the south, all efforts would be made to
build infrastructure for the Ho Chi Minh city-Dong Nai-Vung Ttau
economic zone.
</P>
<P>
In the central economic zone, the capacity of Da Nang port
would be expanded, and a road network constructed to link up Dung
Quat port, a new deep water port in central Vietnam, Hoan said.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam would finish upgrading the whole 2,000 kilometers,
north-south backbone highway by the turn of this century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hoan said that Vietnam was considering building a trans-nation
expressway linking Noi Bai international airport in Hanoi with Ha
Long in Quang Ninh province and Ho Chi Minh city, Long Thanh and
Vung Tau in southern Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Hoan said the ministry had adopted concrete measures in
collaboration with Hanoi, Ho Chi Minh city and other major cities
to tackle urban traffic problems by building more city-belt roads
with more overpasses.
</P>
<P>
Apart from state allocations and foreign investment and loans,
traffic charges in Vietnam would be increased to create another
financial source to meet the growing demands for development of
transport and communications facilities, he said.

<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- An arbitration court agreed
by Yemen and Eritrea will hold its first meeting in London next
week on how to resolve their dispute over the Hanish Islands, a
report reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
There had occurred a serious confrontation between Yemen and
Eritrea which both claimed their sovereignty over the small, arid
Hanish Islands on busy oil tanker routes not very far from the
outlet of the Red Sea and sent their troops there.
</P>
<P>
Fighting involving warships and aircraft broke out last year,
and each side accused the other of intruding into its territories
where potential oil deposit may abound.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the two countries signed an accord in October, 1996
in Paris to set up an arbitration court in London.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Yemen appointed an Egyptian and an
American to the court while Eritrea named an American and a
Briton. The fifth person, whose nationality has not been
identified, will head the court.
</P>
<P>
The dispute led to clashes in which at least 12 people were
killed last year.

Speaking at the meeting, which opened today, Vice-Premier Wu

The industry has developed at a yearly growth rate of 25
percent, faster than the average expansion of the national
economy, thanks to the efforts made by the sector's entire
workforce, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The government has designated the building industry and the
building materials sector as two of the country's pillar
industries, but the building materials sector is still far from

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's key manufacturing
sector, which had depressed for most of 1995 due to lack of
demand, recovered last year to register an estimated four percent
growth.
</P>
<P>
The sector, which contributes about 25 percent of the
country's annual GDP, benefited from increased output in the
agro-based industries, whose performance was boosted by the
record agricultural harvest in the 1995/96 season.
</P>
<P>
Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries Chief Executive Joe
Foroma today said, "the first half of 1996 was a particularly
difficult period, with a combination of high inflation and
interest rates, as well as depressed local demand contributing to
sluggish performance."
</P>
<P>
"But the second half was better and as a result of that, I
believe we are going to have overall positive growth rate of
about four percent for the whole of 1996," Foroma said.
</P>
<P>
He said, however, the estimated growth level was "not good
enough" because of unused production capacity in many companies.
</P>
<P>
Foroma said his confederation believed there is potential for
more investment in Zimbabwe to create jobs and support efforts to
industrialize the economy.

MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- San Miguel Corp., the largest
beer producer in the Philippines, will float 550 million pesos (21
million U.S. dollars) long-term commercial papers (LTCP) in 1997,
the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>

The five-year securities are the second part of a series of up

in 1996 as part of its efforts to finance its modernization
program.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> China's Liaoning Cancels Arbitrary Fees for Overseas Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province today canceled 118 kinds of fees worth a total of more
than 300 million yuan (about 3.6 billion US dollars) charged to
overseas investors, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the latest moves by the Chinese province to
improve its investment environment, vice-governor Gao Guozhu said
this afternoon at a press conference on eliminating arbitrary fees
for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
To date, Liaoning has approved the establishment of over 14,600
overseas-funded enterprises, with contractual foreign investment
exceeding 20 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning launched a massive check on the collection of fees for
overseas-funded enterprises between April-August last year and
discovered many problems, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
Over 1,000 units were involved in randomly collecting fees from
overseas-funded enterprise, Gao added.
</P>
<P>
"The provincial government has realized that arbitrary fees have
tarnished Liaoning's image and will damper investor interest in
our province," the vice-governor said.
</P>
<P>
"We're determined to wipe out all unreasonable and illegal fees
for overseas investors," Gao told the conference, which was
attended by consuls general from Japan, Germany, France, the
United States, Russia, the Republic of Korea, Switzerland and
Holland, as well as by representatives of some big overseas
companies.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Japanese consulate told Xinhua that he is
"very pleased that the Liaoning provincial government has taken a
resolute measure to eliminate arbitrary fees. It's something good
for overseas investors.

BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China's pharmaceutical sector
achieved marked successes in 1996 and made important contributions
to the national economy, Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo said today at a
national conference attended by industry representatives.

The vice-premier called on those involved in the industry to
improve its efficiency, and to attempt to develop China into one
of the world's major pharmaceutical producers by relying on the
country's distinct advantages.
</P>

The pharmaceutical industry has special significance, as it is
directly related to people's health, he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu also stressed the need to promote professional ethics among
workers in the industry.

<HEADLINE> Social Sciences Research Booming In 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman for the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences -- often regarded as a think tank for
the Chinese government -- said here today that research conducted
by the country's scholars in the social sciences last year will
add to the development of the economy and society.
</P>
<P>
In particular, scholarly attention has been focused on
economics, said the spokesman for CASS, the top research
institute of social sciences and liberal arts in the country.
</P>
<P>
Research projects have been completed covering a range of
subjects, such as methods for coordinating the development of the
urban and rural economy, and determining the ways out for some of
China's state-enterprises that are in the red. Some of their
reports, such as "China's Industrial Development in 1996," have
been noticed by foreign institutes in Beijing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other important findings are related to the reforms of
taxation, finance, and housing systems as well as the industrial
decision-making process, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
"Many of our suggestions have been adopted by government
departments," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that "the scholars' work is playing a big role in
China's democratic and legal construction."
</P>
<P>
The academy has finished research on intellectual property
rights, human rights, and the history of the legal system of the
People's Republic of China. Many researchers took part in drafting
and revising key laws last year, including the "Criminal Law," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
They have also made their own forecasts regarding the country's
social situations, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Literature, philosophy and history were dynamic sectors,
despite a shortage of funding for academic studies.
</P>
<P>
And some lengthy books, including "The History of Chinese
Literature," are being compiled. Scholars still value the study of
Marxist philosophy, but are stepping up the research of Chinese
language, ancient history, the moral questions in the
ever-changing contemporary society, and the relationship between
culture and a market economy, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
China also boasts smaller academies of social sciences at
provincial and city levels, he added.

<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said here today that the overall
international situation is heading toward detente and
polarization, as the big countries are restructuring their
relations, and the theme of the times is peace and development.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is also member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), made the remarks
at a meeting on the world situation for leading officials of the
non-communist parties and the All China Federation for Industry
and Commerce, and for people without party affiliations.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to carry out an independent foreign policy
of peace and develop friendly and cooperative relations with
countries worldwide on the basis of the five principles of
peaceful co-existence, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Hong Kong, Qian said that the election of the
first chief executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region and the formation of the Preliminary Legislative Council
have created a very favorable condition for the smooth transfer of
Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and
the support of entire Chinese people, the smooth transfer of Hong
Kong and its long-term prosperity will certainly be guaranteed,
the foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
A successful implementation of the policy of "One country, two
systems" in Hong Kong will play a positive role in accomplishing
the great cause of national reunification, he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Budget Surplus Drops in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government posted
a budgetary surplus of 6.8 billion pesos (26 million U.S. dollars)
as of October 1996, a sharp drop from the nearly 10 billion pesos
(38 million dollars) recorded a year ago, the Finance Department
said today.
</P>
<P>
This is the third consecutive year for the government to enjoy
a fiscal surplus. In 1994, the cash-starved government obtained
its first budgetary surplus of more than 15 billion pesos (57.3
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
In its year-end report, the department said the government also
registered a surplus of 14.5 billion pesos (55.3 million dollars)
from the consolidated public sector financial position in the
first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The strong performance of the fiscal sector was a major
contributory factor in the economic stability that the country is
currently enjoying," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said the interest rate of the 91-day treasury bills is at a
low level of 11.5 percent as of September, while inflation is at a
downtrend of 4.5 percent as of November 1996.
</P>
<P>
The total revenues earned by the government reached 341.4
billion pesos (13 billion dollars) as of October 1996, an increase
of 12.9 percent over the 302.5 billion pesos (11.5 billion
dollars) generated a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
To further improve its financial position, the government will
continue to push for more tax reform measures and the continuation
of the economic liberalization and deregulation efforts.

<P>
TEHRAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Iran's oil prices of light
and heavy crude hit a record of 22.5 U.S. dollars per barrel
in the international market in the past nine months, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Persian daily Iran, Iran's oil export revenue
would exceed the pre-set annual target by 2.67 billion
U.S. dollars, in view of the price hikes in the international
market.
</P>
<P>
The oil export revenue is expected to amount to 18.67
billion dollars during this Iranian calendar year which ends
March 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, an official from the Oil Ministry did not disclose
the detailed prices of light and heavy crude oil.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the average price of the Iranian oil
was 18 dollars per barrel during the last Iranian fiscal year.
The figure shows that the Iranian oil price has risen by 4.5
dollars per barrel during this Iranian year.
</P>
<P>
The official from the Oil Ministry warned that the crude
prices would not stay as high as they are now due to the
re-entry of Iraq into the oil market and the expected drop
in oil consumption in Spring.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan People's Party Announces Manifesto for Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- In its manifesto announced
here today, Pakistan People's Party (PPP), led by deposed prime
minister Benazir Bhutto, vowed to repeal the 8th amendment to the
constitution.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the manifesto at a press conference, Bhutto said
that her party prefers a four-year term for president, prime
minister and members of the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"However, the term for senators will be five years," she added.
</P>
<P>
So far, the terms of office for president, prime minister and
members of the National Assembly are five years.
</P>
<P>
Benazir Bhutto, who had come to power again in October 1993,
was sacked on November 5, 1996, by President Farooq Leghari who
exercised the power of the 8th amendment which authorizes the
president to dismiss a government when it cannot lead a country
properly.
</P>
<P>
Fresh elections are scheduled for February 3 this year.
</P>
<P>
The PPP's major legislative agenda for 1997-2002 includes an
increase in the number of national and provincial assembly seats,
a census under the supervision of the Judiciary and provision of
certain percentage of seats in the national and provincial
assemblies on proportional representation basis.
</P>
<P>
The economic agenda focuses on reducing tax levels in the 1997
budget to encourage more people to pay taxes. Tax revenues will be
increased by vigorous pursuit of tax evaders and search for
undeclared assets abroad.
</P>
<P>
The manifesto calls for maintaining a stable macro-economic
framework by keeping a low budget deficit, a prudent expansion in
money supply, equilibrium in balance of payments and stability in
prices.
</P>
<P>
The education agenda stresses the need to make basic education
universal and achieve 85 percent literacy by the year 2005.
</P>
<P>
The defense agenda calls for full support for the modernization
of the armed services to provide effective defense against outside
aggression.

PARIS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Tens of thousands of striking South Korean workers Monday
began an arms wrestling with the government of Seoul to protest the
new labor law, which aims to ban pluralism of trade unions,
authorize massive lay-offs and sack striking workers. This is the
largest labor movement in South Korea since President Kim Young-Sam
came to power in early 1993.
</P>
<P>
-- The Belgian Minister of Justice Stefaan de Clerk has
complained about the lack of transparency and communication from his
French counterpart, Jacques Toubon, over a case of corruption in
Belgium, which involves the French Dassault-Aviation group and a
number of Belgian politicians. Serge Dassault, the boss of the
Dassault group and the mayor of the ruling PRP party of Corbeil,
south of Paris, is suspected to have offered kick-backs to Belgian
politicians to obtain contracts.
</P>
<P>
-- The French presidential office has denied a story told by
journalist Georges-Marc Benamou in his new book ``le Dernier
Mitterrand,'' in which the author said that President Francois
Mitterrand sent a personal envoy to Jacques Chirac on November 1,
1994, asking the latter to rapidly announce his candidature for the
1995 presidential election. Chirac did so three days later in the
northern city of Lille, the town of General Charles de Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The French state railway company SNCF has already lost 10
million francs (2 million U.S. dollars) because of the bad weather
which has been plaguing France since Christmas. About 10,000 to
30,000 SNCF travelers have been affected by weather-caused
incidents and 6,000 completely stranded on trains. The SNCF has to
refund tickets by 100 percent if the trains do not arrive on
schedule beyond three hours.
</P>
<P>
-- An investigation team of the European Parliament on bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease, said in a
latest report that both British government and European agricultural
commissioners serving from 1989 to 1994 are responsible for the
spread of the BSE. London was accused of covering up some facts over
the BSE, while the commissioners are blamed for neglecting sanitary
controls of beef products.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Import Thousands of Tons of Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines is considering
importing 300,000 to 500,000 metric tons of rice this year,
Agriculture Secretary Salvador Escudero said here today.
</P>
<P>
He said the projection was based on the fact that the
production of unhusked rice in 1996 dropped to 11.3 million metric
tons.
</P>
<P>
Escudero, however, stressed that this year's import is being
carefully studied and that no recommendation for rice import has
yet been presented to the Presidential Palace for approval.
</P>
<P>
He admitted however that there is a need for such import. "But
as to when the rice import will come in, that we don't know yet."
</P>
<P>
Agriculture registered a good performance last year, with an
annual growth rate of 6.6 percent. Although as a result, the rice
situation was much better than in 1995, the country still has to
import the needed amount, he said.
</P>
<P>
National food authorities said the Department of Agriculture
should be serious about when the import of rice should start,
adding that it is better to import it within the third quarter to
prevent any rice shortage like the one brought about by typhoons
in 1995.

<HEADLINE> South China Province to Wipe Out Absolute Poverty by Year-End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 7 (Xinhua) -- South China's prosperous
Guangdong Province has vowed to wipe out absolute poverty this
year for the 600,000 people who now exist without enough to eat
and wear.
</P>
<P>
If all goes as planned, Guangdong will be three years ahead of
China's national deadline for eliminating absolute poverty in the
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
"We made considerable progress in reducing absolute poverty
last year and we want to alleviate it this year," said an official
of the Chinese province, which has a population of more than 60
million.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the province's totally destitute population
shrank by 390,000 in 1996, cutting the ratio of people without
enough food and clothing to the provincial population by 0.64
percentage points, to 0.96 percent by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Just ten years ago, Guangdong had four million people that did
not have enough of the basic necessities, or who had an annual
income of less than 250 yuan (about 30 US dollars in current
value) and a yearly grain consumption of less than 200 kg. And
there were another 14 million people under the more
broadly-defined poverty line, which covered those with an annual
income of less than 500 yuan.
</P>
<P>
As a showcase of the country's reform and opening-up policies,
Guangdong has outperformed most other Chinese provinces and
regions in terms of overall economic development. Its coastal
areas have become affluent.
</P>
<P>
However, its mountain-bound areas, where the greatest
concentration of poor people live, have lagged behind in economic
growth, sometimes by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, Guangdong has taken a number of serious
measures, including setting up special aid-the-poor funds,
tailoring annual examinations of local officials to poverty
relief, and issuing rules that oblige the more developed coastal
areas to help the less developed interior areas.
</P>
<P>
"We have made poverty alleviation part of our system," the
provincial official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said that it could be a hard nut to alleviate the remaining
absolute poverty in the hilly and mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore we need to make an even greater effort for poverty
relief," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in the first group of poverty alleviation
projects this year has been set at 1.48 billion yuan, compared
with 152 million yuan last year, he said, adding that provincial
fiscal allocations for poverty relief increased by 200 million
yuan in the first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said that money will be invested mainly in agricultural and
energy projects in the 16 poorest counties, to ensure that the
goal of alleviating absolute poverty will be accomplished this
year.
</P>
<P>
What can pose yet another challenge for Guangdong, a developed
area measured by Chinese standards, is that it has been ordered by
the State Council to help the poverty relief effort of neighboring
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which has a large number of poor
people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has set a goal of eliminating absolute
poverty by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
When an official poverty-relief plan was first drawn up in
1993, 80 million Chinese were destitute. The figure fell to 65
million at the end of 1995.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Management of Radio Frequency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen the
management over radio services throughout the country in a move to
safeguard state security and promote economic development, vice
premier Zou Jiahua said today at a conference in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Zou said at the working meeting of the State Radio Management
Committee that while the world has entered the information era,
the widespread use of radio technology has complicated China's
radio management and created problems.
</P>
<P>
It is important to protect limited radio frequency resources,
which are owned by the state, said Zou, who is also director of
the committee.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to research the technologies used for radio
frequency and to keep opening new channels, but at the same time
it is a must to adopt administrative, legal, technological and
economic means to manage and make use of frequency resources."
</P>
<P>
By 2000, China will set up a nationwide radio frequency
management computer network and a nationwide radio monitoring
system, Zou said.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jichuan, minister of posts and telecommunications and vice
director of the committee, said at the conference that radio
telecommunications have provided important information services to
people, thereby promoting the development of society.
</P>
<P>
By last November, China had set up nearly nine million radio
stations of various kinds, reaching 6.61 million
listeners. Meanwhile, the country reported 40 million pager users,
ranking first in the world.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged various radio management departments to
supervise paging stations as well as the production and sales of
radio signals transmission equipment, and to severely punish the
unauthorized set-up and use of radio stations.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan People's Party Announces Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Benazir Bhutto, the deposed
Pakistani prime minister and leader of the Pakistan People's Party
(PPP), said here today that the foreign policy of her party is
Muslim and Asian in character.
</P>
<P>
"Our friendship with China remains the cornerstone of our
foreign policy," Bhutto said, announcing the PPP manifesto for the
upcoming general elections at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto told the press conference that the People's government
of Pakistan will counter anti-Islamic propaganda and make Pakistan
the model of an enlightened, modern, progressive and moderate
Islamic society.
</P>
<P>
The PPP manifesto said, "Being Asian we will be reaching out in
particular to the Gulf and Central and East Asia."
</P>
<P>
"The growing tension in the Muslim world requires us to help
our friends without taking sides," it said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan should base its relations with Afghanistan and the
Central Asian republics on strong economic ties and on the
principle of non-interference, it added.
</P>
<P>
"Iran remains of strategic importance to Pakistan," it noted,
adding, "Pakistan must establish strong political and economical
ties with South Africa and other fast-developing African States."
</P>
<P>
"In setting foreign policy and objective, we must remember that
the Cold War is over and that Pakistan must establish its own
identity and stand on its own feet," Bhutto said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan must also rely on better economic ties with other
countries as a long-term basis of developing relations with them,
she added.
</P>
<P>
Bhutto's government was dissolved by Pakistani President Farooq
Leghari on November 5, 1996, on charges of mismanagement and
rampant corruption in the country.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Pakistan Muslim League (Nawaz group),
which has the greatest potential to win the polls scheduled for
February 3, also stressed the need to consolidate and further the
friendship between Pakistan and China in its manifesto for the
elections.

<HEADLINE> Death Rate Remains High on Kenyan Roads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The death rate on Kenyan roads
is among the highest in the world, and it stands at 7.7 per 1,000
vehicles, much higher than South Africa with a death rate of 1.9
per 1,000 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's road death rate is alarmingly high, towering over
those of Britain and the United States, which have death rates of
0.2 per 1,000 vehicles, a report compiled by the International
Road Federation revealed.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, about one accident in five is fatal while one in 45
in Canada, said the report, adding that Kenya's roads are among
the most dangerous in the world.
</P>
<P>
Recent estimates show that Kenya has the higher number of road
accidents among developing countries with an average of 8.2 lives
lost daily.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of Economic Affairs, a local civic
non-governmental organization, disclosed recently in a report
that Kenya loses about 73 million U.S. Dollars annually in
material damage, and more than 100 million Dollars in manpower as
a result of accidents on local roads.
</P>
<P>
In 1990, 10,308 accidents occurred on Kenyan roads, claiming
1,856 lives, and three years later the number of accidents rose
to 12,355 in which 2,516 people died in the east African country
which has only around 325,000 vehicles.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the trend of higher road death rate in
the country has caused its economy dearly.
</P>
<P>
The high death rate is attributed to the crowded public
transport, ill-kept roads, ancient vehicles and poor medical
services.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks Restarts in S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of Sierra Leone's
rebel movement, the Revolutionary United Front (RUF), has arrived
in capital Freetown for peace talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
This would be the second round of peace talks following the
first one held 18 days ago.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said the current round of talks to begin by
Wednesday will be centered on the demobilization and encampment
of RUF combatants which should have commenced in December.
</P>
<P>
In fact, RUF spokesmen Fayia Musa and Ibrahim Jalloh had
already held informal closed-door talks late on Monday with
government representatives at the headquarters of the peace
commission in Freetown after their arrival that day.
</P>
<P>
Sheka Mansaray, national security adviser to President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah, said, "the talks are moving but at a painfully slow
pace."
</P>
<P>
"We are still waiting for the international community to
respond to our appeal to provide troops to monitor the
implementation of the peace process," said Mansaray.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the government has asked the RUF to form
itself into a political movement or party to keep in line with
the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"But this cannot be done overnight as certain conditions such
as the establishment of a trust fund for the RUF have to be met,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
The cease-firetion accord signed in Abidjan stated that the RUF
shall begin to function as a political movement with "the rights,
privileges and duties provided by law immediately after the
signing of the peace agreement."
</P>
<P>
The agreement further provided that necessary conditions shall
be created to enable the RUF to register as a political movement
within 30 days of the implementation of the peace accord.

<HEADLINE> China Selects 33 More Enterprises to List B Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Another 33 Chinese enterprises
have been given the green light to list B shares in the domestic
stock market, with the preliminary namelist recently approved by
the Securities Commission of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The selected firms were from industries of electric power,
energy resources, transportation, electronics and
telecommunications, metallurgy, machinery, petrochemicals,
textile, building materials, light industry and medicine,
according to the securities watchdog, the China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
</P>
<P>
"Basic industries and key enterprises have received top
priority during the selection, and only firms of certain size and
with good profits were qualified," said a spokesman of the CSRC.
</P>
<P>
B shares, which are listed in the domestic stock market but
target only overseas investors, have served as an effective means
of channeling foreign capital into Chinese state enterprise, the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The B share market not only supports the technical renovations
of such enterprises, but also helps international securities
expertise to flow into the domestic securities market, which is
conducive to its standardization and maturing," he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also urged strengthened supervision on the
current B share market in accordance with the recent State Council
rules of B share-trading, stressing that domestic investors be
strictly banned from trading of B class stocks.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 86 Chinese enterprises have issued and
listed B shares on the two stock exchanges in Shanghai and
Shenzhen, raising about three billion US dollars in foreign
capital.

<HEADLINE> India May Fail to Meet Industrial Growth Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government's hopes
of achieving a 12-percent industrial growth in fiscal 1996-97
appear to be a distant dream if recent trends are anything to go
by, the National Herald said today.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the continuous downtrend in industrial
production during the first nine months of April-December of
fiscal 1996, experts here feel that industrial growth will likely
slow down to 8 percent, as against an official target of 12
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, industry registered a
9.08-percent growth in the first six months of April-September in
fiscal 1996 over the same period in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Following the same trend, the growth dropped to below 7 percent
during November-December 1996 when industry was expected to
perform better in the second half of the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Provisional estimates showed that during the two months of
November and December, growth in core sectors including steel,
cement, coal, power and petroleum declined further.
</P>
<P>
The broad industrial sectors which also include fertilizers,
crude oil, sugar, jute and ferro-alloys recorded deceleration in
growth rates over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, the government seems quite upbeat about achieving
a higher industrial growth. Industry Secretary N. Monhanty
recently said industrial growth in this fiscal year would pass the
10-percent mark. Finance Minister P. Chidambaram said in November
that "Industry is likely to touch previous year's growth of 12
percent."

<HEADLINE> China's Eximbank Named Best Samurai Bond Issuer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of China
(Eximbank) has been named the best issuer of Samurai bonds for the
year 1996 by the International Financing Review, a London-based
financial magazine.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese bank was selected for the honor out of more than
140 Samurai bond issuers in Japan last year, following its
successful floating of 20 billion yen (about 180 million US
dollars) in five-year Samurai bonds in Tokyo last August.
</P>
<P>
The bond issue, the first by the Eximbank in Japan, prospered
because it was rationally priced, well designed and attracted a
broad mix of investors, the IFR said.
</P>
<P>
The Eximbank is one of China's three policy-oriented banks
established in 1994 to finance the country's exports of machinery,
electronics and complete sets of equipment. It was given an AA-
rating for bond issues in Japan in early 1996.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Pressure Reduces in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Inflation pressure was improved
last December in Kenya with the month-to-month inflation
indicator falling for the first time in four months, according to
a weekly statistical bulletin issued by the Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK).
</P>
<P>
The month-to-month inflation indicators which had been rising
gradually since last September declined in December to 10.84
percent from 11.38 percent in November which reached the peak
since September.
</P>
<P>
Inflation was felt hard in July 1996 when the three-month
annualized rates were highest in the year, standing at 20.11
percent, much higher than the 10 percent inflation target set by
the Kenyan government.
</P>
<P>
A similarly heavy inflationary impact was also felt in March and
August last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation pressure is expected to ease towards the first
quarter this year on account of an expected slow-down in monetary
expansion, according to an earlier statement by the CBK.
</P>
<P>
the growth in money supply is projected to slow down
considerably to the targeted 13.1 percent in the early part of
1997, the statement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kenyan government is expected to exercise
further fiscal discipline in order to increase revenues and
reduce expenditures by the government departments to ease the
inflation pressure.

<HEADLINE> Macao Economy to Grow Moderately in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Macao's economy is expected to
grow moderately in 1997 following a less than one percent growth
rate in 1996, according to economists.
</P>
<P>
According to an article in the Hong Kong and Macao Economic
Quarterly magazine published by the Bank of China, Macao's
economic growth in 1997 will be better than in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The forecast is based on several factors in the new year: a 4.1
 percent growth of the world economy on average, a 10.5 percent
economic growth rate in China's mainland, Hong Kong's return to
the embrace of the motherland and Macao's growth of consumption.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's return to the embrace of the motherland is foreseen
as a major encouraging factor for Macao, serving both as a model
for Macao's return and bringing prosperity to such industries as
tourism, hotels and retails.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of the domestic national product -- the value
of goods and services produced -- is estimated at less than one
percent in 1996, mainly because of decreased investment and
consumption and a declining external trade. The inflation rate in
1996 is expected to reach five percent, 3.6 percent lower from in
the previous year.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Pak Sugar Industry Still in Dire Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's ailing sugar
industry, which has been caught in a deep crisis since early last
year, is still facing enormous problems precipitated by a shortage
of raw material and an increase in production costs.
</P>
<P>
Sugar price remains at the center of the crisis. A price war
started early last year when sugarcane growers in Punjab and North
West Frontier province demanded exorbitantly high prices for their
raw material.
</P>
<P>
And the situation took a turn for worse when the government
increased the prices of electricity and gas in the last quarter of
1996, thus pushing sugar mills' cost of production to a new high.
</P>
<P>
Sugar mill owners are facing a difficult situation where they
seem to have no choice but to go out of business as they cannot
increase the price of sugar to match the increased cost of
production.
</P>
<P>
To avert a possible backlash, the government is pumping huge
quantities of imported sugar into the local market to keep the
price situation under control.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan imported more than 700,000 tons of sugar last year to
meet its domestic demand. The government has decided to import
another 50,000 tons to avoid sugar shortage during the forthcoming
holy month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the sugar industry noted that Pakistan's sugar
production in 1995-96 fiscal year was only about 2.4 million tons,
registering a 12.5 percent decline from the previous fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The decline in sugar production is mainly caused by a shortage
of sugarcane. The harvest of sugarcane, the basic raw material for
sugar production, was largely affected by rain, floods and cloudy
weather.
</P>
<P>
Because of the severe shortage of sugarcane, four sugar mills
have already been forced out of business, and many of the sugar
mills in the country are running far below their capacity.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to expectations, the row over the prices of sugarcane
intensified this year and sugar mills have to delay the crushing
season by 30 days to reduce the pressure on the supply of raw
material.
</P>
<P>
However, the move did not produce the desired results and
growers continued to demand higher prices, triggering a cut-throat
competition between mill owners for the limited supply of
sugarcane.
</P>
<P>
With an expected five percent increase in sugar production
worldwide, there are almost no chances for Pakistan to export the
commodity.
</P>
<P>
As far as prices of sugarcane is concerned, there seems to be
no easy way out as neither the government nor the Sugar Mills
Associations (SMA) can force growers to sell sugarcane at a price
acceptable to the industry.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the sugar industry believe that the present
situation facing the industry is not only the short supply of raw
material, but also the poor quality of sugarcane which has far
less sucrose content than that of other sugar producing countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Agricultural Research Council has been working on
new seeds during the last few years to produce better quality
sugarcane. However, no major breakthrough has been achieved so
far.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is among those countries where per hectare yield of
sugarcane is very low. Despite millions of rupees spent on
research every year, the per hectare yield has not gone above 47
tons.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by SMA show that Pakistan's sugarcane
production in the last fiscal year went down to 45.23 million tons
from 47.17 million tons in the previous year. The supply of
sugarcane to sugar mills has already gone down to 60 percent from
80 percent a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
As nothing has so far happened to suggest that the present
situation prevailing in the sugar industry will be any better, it
is believed that Pakistan will have to continue its sugar import
to meet the domestic demand.

<HEADLINE> Howe Warns Hong Kong Against Trying to Transform China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Former British Foreign
Secretary Lord Geoffrey Howe said today that Hong Kong should not
be expected to be a bridgehead to trigger political change on the
Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a luncheon here today, Lord Howe said: "Hong Kong is
not entitled to regard itself, and they're unwise to regard itself
as a bridgehead of revolutionary change in the rest of the country
(China)."
</P>
<P>
"'One Country, two systems' is, what all we expected to be, a
two-way deal," said Howe, who was Britain's chief negotiator of
the Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong signed in 1984.
</P>
<P>
The Joint Declaration stipulates that Britain will return Hong
Kong to China on June 30, 1997, and China will in return grant a
high degree of autonomy to Hong Kong people in accordance with the
principle of "one country, two systems". Capitalism will continue
to prevail in Hong Kong and socialism will continue on the Chinese
mainland.
</P>
<P>
Saying that Hong Kong is entitled to its traditional way of
life, without interference from the mainland, Howe stressed: "The
proposition should work in the opposite direction as well,"
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong cannot and should not expect to transform China, and
trying to do so will risk Hong Kong itself," he warned.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the democratic process in Hong Kong, the former
foreign minister said: "If the advancement is too far or too fast,
as the Western democratic pattern, it is alleged to be
unacceptable for this stage of the Hong Kong story." He called on
different parties and sectors in the Hong Kong community to join
hands for continued success and prosperity of Hong Kong.

HONG KONG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's new airport at
Chek Lap Kok, which is still under construction, will soon have
its first landing when American pilots carry out critical tests,
according to today's South China Morning Post.
</P>
<P>
A small jet airplane will be flown by two pilots from the
United States' Federal Aviation Administration in a month-long

The maiden landing is expected on February 17, more than a year
before the scheduled opening of the airport in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's Civil Aviation Department chief electronic engineer
Leung Woon-yin said the new airport would be safer than Kai Tak
because different terrain allowed it to use higher precision
equipment for landing in all weather.
</P>
<P>
The tests, which will be repeated every four months, will set
radar equipment for guiding planes on to the runway, according to

<HEADLINE> Foreign Exchange Inflow Declines in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign exchange inflow through the
Bank of Zambia (BOZ) in 1996 declined drastically mainly due to a
halt slapped on balance of payment support by some donors and the
retention of 100 percent earnings by Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines
(ZCCM).
</P>
<P>
This led to the country's outflow overshooting the inflow by 4.47
percent, according to the statistics from the country's Central
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange inflow amounted only to 432.118 million
US Dollars, of which 193.092 million dollars came from
non-government sources, and 153.227 million dollars from donors
as most bilateral donor countries froze aid to Zambia due to the
controversal constitutional amendment bill, which successfully
barred former President Kenneth Kaunda from running for the
presidency in the elections last November. And ZCCM contributed
85.799 million dollars to the inflow from January to March before
BOZ stopped selling foreign exchange to the market.
</P>
<P>
The total outflow was 451.443 million dollars, of which 169.581
million dollars went to service external debt, 33.786 million was
used by non-government services while 83.941 million dollars was for
government's other uses.
</P>
<P>
This means that the government once again overspent on its foreign
exchange inflow by 4.47 percent, but this was relatively much lower
than those of the previous years.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exchange inflow in 1995 was 758.562 million dollars
while outlow amounted to 1,338.842 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's foreign debt reduced to 6.573 billion dollars in
1996 from 7.288 billion dollars in 1991. enditem

<HEADLINE> Hawke Upbeat About Hong Kong's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Former Australian Prime
Minister Bob Hawke today expressed his full confidence in the
future of Hong Kong, whose economy, he believed, will continue to
prosper with increasing integration with the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
"I am basically optimistic about the future of Hong Kong,"
Hawke said at a luncheon hosted by the Australian Chamber of
Commerce here.
</P>
<P>
"I certainly and absolutely have no doubt about Hong Kong's
capacity, the capacity of its business leaders and workers, to
continue into the future to adapt to the economic challenges."
</P>
<P>
In retrospect to Hong Kong's economic progress, Hawke said Hong
Kong enjoyed a significant rise in economic prosperity in the
period of negotiating the Sino-British Joint Declaration which was
signed in 1984. The approach has been increasingly linked to
economic development on the Chinese mainland, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's GDP per capita reached 23,472 US dollars in 1995,
ranking second in the world. The dramatic growth has been
characterized by increasing integration with the mainland," Hawke
said, citing the large-scale relocation of manufacturing factories
from Hong Kong to southern China, and the huge flow of
cross-border investment.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong now is the single largest investor in China,
accounting for about 60 percent of the total external capital
realized in the country. Hawke estimated that nearly one third of
investment in Hong Kong's banking, properties and transport
sectors came from China.
</P>
<P>
In assessing Hong Kong's future, he pointed out that one must
also address the issue of how to see the future of China. Having
visited China many times, Hawke gave an overall view of the
Chinese economy, ranging from market reform to economic growth
rates and to agriculture produce and domestic savings. He believed
that the prospects for China are good. "It is not a question of
if, but when," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Boost Industrial Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
decided to provide incentives for boosting the export of textiles
and textile products, leather shoes, wood products and
electronics, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Industry and Trade Tungky Ariwibowo said Monday
after a parliament plenary session that the incentives are closely
related to export facilities, including tax breaks, given to
certain exporters and not to the industry.
</P>
<P>
He said the government needs to select exporters of these
products to help them boost their exports by increasing their
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The four industrial commodities have been the country's biggest
foreign exchange earners since the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Ariwibowo added that the government is considering granting
similar incentives to other commodities.
</P>
<P>
Pulp and paper are reliable export commodities and are also
encouraged to boost their exports.

<HEADLINE> Chinese More Open in Spouse Soliciting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- More than ten single men and
women in Nanjing, capital of east China's Jiangsu Province, have
agreed to have their color photographs published in a local
newspaper as part of spouse soliciting advertisements.
</P>
<P>
Usually, spouse soliciting advertisements in China consist of
a brief text of self-introduction, and respondents can only make
contact with the advertiser via a designated person or matchmaking
center.
</P>
<P>
The Nanjing-based "Xinhua Weekend" newspaper recently launched
a column entitled "Bridge Between Hearts", which offers free
spouse soliciting advertising to people who are willing to also
publish their personal photos.
</P>
<P>
More than ten local single people have already responded to the
bold idea. Song Weifeng, a local matchmaker in charge of the
column, said that several of them have quickly found prospective
partners.
</P>
<P>
"The photo has added more transparency to the advertisement,
and made the partner-seeking messages more popular than ordinary
ones," Song explained.
</P>
<P>
Local sociologists said that the change in spouse soliciting
advertising, along with thriving TV matchmaking in recent years,
indicates that Chinese people have become more open-minded in
marriage concepts after nearly two decades of reform and opening
up.

<HEADLINE> President Rawlings to Be Inaugurated in Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Re-elected Ghanaian President
Jerry Rawlings and the parliament are due to be inaugurated in
capital Accra today, one month after the general elections,
said a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The inauguration marks the beginning of Rawlings's second term
of office, which, according to the country's constitution, must
also be his last.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings, 49, won the December 7 poll with 57.2 percent of
valid votes cast, while his party, the National Democratic
Congress (NDC), dominated the 200-seat parliament after having
won 133 of the 199 seats contested in legislative polls.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, even before the new parliament
convenes, its members have argued about the choice of speaker.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the People's Convention Party (PCP), the smaller of
two parties making up an opposition alliance, bitterly announced
the break of the coalition, complaining that its partner, the New
Patriotic Party (NPP), had deliberately marginalized the PCP.
</P>
<P>
Accra's political analysts said the NDC had been moving to
rally the support of the PCP's five members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The NPP, the dominant force of the opposition with 60 seats in
parliament, has also argued with the government about the venue
of the presidential inauguration.
</P>
<P>
Rawlings first came to power in Ghana in a military coup in
1979 before ceding power to a civilian government later that
year. But in 1981, he staged another successful military coup to
topple the government and had since become head of state of the
west African country.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, Rawlings won the presidential election and the
newly-formed NDC swept legislative polls which were boycotted by
the opposition.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Pressure Reduces in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Inflation pressure was improved
last December in Kenya with the month-to-month inflation
indicator falling for the first time in four months, according to
a weekly statistical bulletin issued by the Central Bank of Kenya
(CBK).
</P>
<P>
The month-to-month inflation indicators which had been rising
gradually since last September declined in December to 10.84
percent from 11.38 percent in November which reached the peak
since September.
</P>
<P>
Inflation was felt hard in July 1996 when the three-month
annualized rates were highest in the year, standing at 20.11
percent, much higher than the 10 percent inflation target set by
the Kenyan government.
</P>
<P>
A similarly heavy inflationary impact was also felt in March and
August last year.
</P>
<P>
Inflation pressure is expected to ease towards the first
quarter this year on account of an expected slow-down in monetary
expansion, according to an earlier statement by the CBK.
</P>
<P>
the growth in money supply is projected to slow down
considerably to the targeted 13.1 percent in the early part of
1997, the statement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kenyan government is expected to exercise
further fiscal discipline in order to increase revenues and
reduce expenditures by the government departments to ease the
inflation pressure.

<HEADLINE> China Calls for Britain to Settle Vietnamese Boat People Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman Shen Guofang hopes that the British government would
solve the Vietnamese boat people issue completely and thoroughly
before July 1, this year, when China resumes its exercise of
sovereignty over Hong Kong, and not throw any of the burden on the
future government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
Shen made the remarks this afternoon at a press conference in
reply to a reporter's question concerning Vietnamese boat people's
request last November for a "human protection" decree from the
Supreme Court in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the issue of Vietnamese boat people
staying over in Hong Kong is a result of a wrong policy by the
British government, promising to take Hong Kong as the first
shelter harbor. The British government is unshirkablely
responsible for its settlement.
</P>
<P>
Shen said he hopes the British side will proceed from Hong
Kong's long-term prosperity, and the interests of the Hong Kong
residents and take effective measures to prevent the Vietnamese
boat people from getting into Hong Kong society.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese boat people, he said, are illegitimate
immigrants, and should be repatriated to where they came from in
line with international conventions.
</P>
<P>
In the past years, the British Hong Kong authorities sought
excuses many times to get them released, sending a wrong message
to the boat people, and hence obstructing the smooth progress of
repatriation work.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman warned that if the boat people were released once
again this time by abusing legal means, a large number of boat
people would enter Hong Kong society, bringing about a negative
impact on future repatriation work.
</P>
<P>
"We are seriously concerned about this issue, " he noted.

</P>
<P>
Yazdi requested all people to refrain from any behavior
dishonoring sacraments in public during Ramadan which falls on

In accordance with the Islamic principles, those who violate
the rule will be punished with 60 whips.

According to the rule, any pretension of breaking the fast in
public is prohibited. All restaurants and coffee shops are
prohibited from serving from dawn to dusk.

<HEADLINE> China's Guangdong to Alleviate Absolute Poverty by Year-End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 7 (Xinhua) -- South China's prosperous
Guangdong Province has vowed to alleviate absolute poverty this
year for the 600,000 people who now exist without enough to eat
and wear.
</P>
<P>
"We made considerable progress in reducing absolute poverty
last year and we want to alleviate it this year," said an official
of the province, which has a population of more than 60 million.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the province's totally destitute population
shrank by 390,000 in 1996, cutting the ratio of people without
enough food and clothing to the provincial population by 0.64
percentage points, to 0.96 percent by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Just ten years ago, Guangdong had four million people that did
not have enough of the basic necessities, or who had an annual
income of less than 250 yuan (about 30 US dollars in current
value) and a yearly grain consumption of less than 200 kg. And
there were another 14 million people under the more
broadly-defined poverty line, which covered those with an annual
income of less than 500 yuan.
</P>
<P>
As a showcase of the country's reform and opening-up policies,
Guangdong has outperformed most other Chinese provinces and
regions in terms of overall economic development. Its coastal
areas have become affluent.
</P>
<P>
However, its mountain-bound areas, where the greatest
concentration of poor people live, have lagged behind in economic
growth, sometimes by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, Guangdong has taken a number of serious
measures, including setting up special aid-the-poor funds,
tailoring annual examinations of local officials to poverty
relief, and issuing rules that oblige the more developed coastal
areas to help the less developed interior areas.
</P>
<P>
"We have made poverty alleviation part of our system," the
provincial official told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
He said that it could be a hard nut to alleviate the remaining
absolute poverty in the hilly and mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore we need to make an even greater effort for poverty
relief," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Total investment in the first group of poverty alleviation
projects this year has been set at 1.48 billion yuan, compared
with 152 million yuan last year, he said, adding that provincial
fiscal allocations for poverty relief increased by 200 million
yuan in the first half of 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said that money will be invested mainly in agricultural and
energy projects in the 16 poorest counties, to ensure that the
goal of alleviating absolute poverty will be accomplished this
year.
</P>
<P>
What can pose yet another challenge for Guangdong, a developed
area measured by Chinese standards, is that it has been ordered by
the State Council to help the poverty relief effort of neighboring
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, which has a large number of poor
people.

special packages for the 30th anniversary of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) this year.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN's 30th anniversary has been considered an important
event for the region's tourism industry with plans afoot to sell
the seven member countries as "must" destinations for tourists.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN members are Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
At the ASEAN Tourism Forum (ATF) here today, the ASEANTA board
agreed to create special packages with promotional airfares to
boost intra- and inter-regional travel, according to official
sources here.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia will kick off the celebration in August but many of
the events to mark the 30th birthday of the regional grouping are
set for September.
</P>
<P>
In its 1997 business plans issued to board members at the
meeting, the ASEANTA noted that it would establish booths in Kuala
Lumpur as part of a "private sector salute to ASEAN's
anniversary."
</P>
<P>
The meeting supported the concept that the anniversary is an
opportunity to promote inbound travel through an ASEAN fare, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Tourism Conference was also held here today in
conjunction with the week-long ATF which opened here on January 5
to promote regional tourism.

<HEADLINE> China Faces Severe Challenge at Sydney Olympics, Wu Shaozu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China, which clinched fourth
place on the medal table at the Atlanta Olympics last summer, will
face severe challenge in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, president of
the Chinese Olympic Committee Wu Shaozu said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
China got 16 gold medals, ahead of France, Italy and Australia
in Atlanta, but "we must make our minds clear that our position
face severe challenge from those countries, especially from host
Australia at Sydney," Wu told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Australia ranked fifth in the Atlanta Olympics with a total of
41 medals against China's 50.
</P>
<P>
"Australia has mapped a six-year sports developing plan, aiming
to enter top five places by leaving home 60 medals including 20
golds at the Sydney Olympics," said Wu, also a minister of the
Chinese State Physical Culture and Sports Commission.
</P>
<P>
Wu also said the China's Eighth National Games to be held in
Shanghai in October this year will be a preparation for both the
1998 Asian Games and 2000 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The Eighth National Games will feature 28 sports events,
instead 45 of the Seventh National Games in Beijing, with 7000
athletes from 45 delegations participating.
</P>
<P>
"On July first, three months before the opening ceremony of the
national game is held, Hong Kong will return to the embrace of the
our motherland, and We welcome the government of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region to send its delegation to Shanghai,"
Wu said.

<HEADLINE> China Outlines New Poverty Eradication Plan  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China is to redouble its efforts
to wipe out poverty in its rural areas in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
According to a decision of the Central Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council, the
fulfillment of a national key task plan to help millions of poor
people escape poverty is a strategic goal.
</P>
<P>
When a poverty-relief plan was first drawn up in 1993, there
were 80 million people living in poverty throughout the
country. By the end of last year, the figure had fallen to 65
million.
</P>
<P>
The CPC Central Committee and the State Council have vowed to
ensure that all poverty-ridden people in the country's rural areas
have enough to eat and wear by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The 7,000-character document, entitled "Decision of the CPC
Central Committee and the State Council on Solving the Problem of
Having Enough to Eat and Wear for Poor People in Rural Areas As
Soon As Possible," was released today.
</P>
<P>
The document follows an important meeting held last October on
the issue of eliminating poverty held by the CPC and the State
Council last October.
</P>
<P>
"It is of great significance to realize this goal, but the time
is urgent and the task is very arduous," says the document.
</P>
<P>
The decision calls on all Party members, especially leading
officials at various levels, to increase their awareness of
poverty elimination, and unify their way of thinking, be firmer
with their decisions, and take more effective measures to ensure
the completion of the great historical task as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to complete the key task of poverty eradication
in an unswerving way, adds the document.
</P>
<P>
Since 1979, and especially since mid-1980s when China started
to carry out a great number of large-scale aid-to-the-poor
programs in an organized, planned way, the number of the country's
poor people has fallen sharply, from 250 million in 1978 to 65
million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This has also brought down the proportion of poor people from a
previous 26 percent to the present 5.4 percent of the population.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, conditions for production and living, as well
as basic facilities have improved enormously in poverty-hit
areas, coupled with fresh progress in cultural, educational and
public health causes.
</P>
<P>
The achievement has effectively advanced the development of the
national economy and social stability, fully demonstrating the
advantages of China's socialist system, the decision notes.
</P>
<P>
The decision has also listed the basic principles, task and
requirements for the key task of tackling of poverty eradication.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, China will continue to consider
solving the problem of having enough to eat and wear for poor
people in rural areas as a primary task, and continue the campaign
of helping the poor by starting up new economic development
projects.
</P>
<P>
Plantations, breeding and processing industries based on farm
and sideline products in respective localities, which are
conducive to generating more profits and helping more poor people
become prosperous quickly, will remain the priority of
aid-to-the-poor work.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, it is also necessary to do a good job of applying
science and education to aid-to-the-poor work, and to making a
success of family planning programs in poverty-hit areas, and give
guidance suited to local conditions.
</P>
<P>
The document also emphasizes the importance of implementing
aid-to-the-poor work on a household basis, carrying forward the
spirit of self-reliance and working hard, and mobilizing all
sectors of the society to participate in help-the-poor work.

<P>
Outlining major measures to be taken in coming years, the
decision explains that the central government will allocate an
additional 1.5 billion yuan to help economic development in
poverty-stricken areas in each of the next few years starting from
this year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, government loans to help the poor will be
increased by three billion yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
More large projects, such as irrigation schemes, infrastructure
work and transport facilities, will be built in areas where
people live in compact communities.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels should keep a tight control on funds
to be used in boosting economic development of poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Households which have difficulty in getting adequate food and
clothing will be exempted from state fixed quotas on grain
purchasing, agricultural taxes and taxes levied on special farm
products.
</P>
<P>
Industrial enterprises built in poor areas by well-developed
provinces and cities, or by the poor areas themselves, will be
exempted from the income tax in the first three years of operation.
</P>
<P>
The amount of special funds for the construction and
maintenance of resettlement villages at areas to be flooded for
the sake of large water control projects will be raised.
</P>
<P>
Economically-developed coastal areas, and municipalities
directly under the central government are urged to forge
sister-ties with poverty-stricken areas in central and western
parts of the country, and provide their counterparts with funds,
technology, information and technical personnel.
</P>
<P>
Central government departments will organize training courses
for leading officials and managerial personnel in poor areas.
</P>
<P>
More efforts will be made to promote exchanges and cooperation
with international and non-governmental organizations to win their
support and economic assistance for poverty-elimination.
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the document states that Party committees and
governments at all levels must conscientiously implement policies
formulated by the Party Central Committee and the State Council on
poverty eradication, and work in a down-to-earth manner to
accomplish what will be a great historical task.

<HEADLINE> UAE Sends Food, Medicine to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Ten nationals of the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) today set sail for Iraq to deliver 25 tons of
milk and medicine to help ease the suffering of Iraqi children
under the U.N.-imposed sanctions.
</P>
<P>
It was the first such delivery by the UAE since the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait in 1990, which strained the ties between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The 10 men, aboard a ship named Al Abbar at the country's
northern port of Kamriya, are expected to reach the southern Iraqi
port of Umm Qasr after a 40-hour trip, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
The ship, owned by a local businessman, carried 17 tons of milk
for Children and eight tons of medicine, the value of which is
estimated at about 410,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
General Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Crown Prince of Dubai,
donated the food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
The trip came after a November appeal by UAE President Sheikh
Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan for reconciliation with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Children's Fund said in November that 4,500
children were dying each month in Iraq due to the lack of food and
medicines since the 1990 Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed trade sanctions on Iraq after its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, Iraq said the embargo has deprived it of cash to
buy food and medicines.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Wins Less Overseas Shipbuilding Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 7 (Xinhua) -- South Korea received orders for
142 ships weighing 6.93 million gross tons from overseas last
year, down 2.8 percent from the previous year, the Korea
Shipbuilders Association (KSA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The drop was due to foreign shipping firms' reluctance to build
new vessels for fear of a global slowdown in the shipping
industry, according to the KSA.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, South Korean shipbuilders received orders for 194
vessels weighing 7.13 million gross tons, up 11.9 percent from the
6.37 million gross tons recorded in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Despite the drop in overseas orders, the country's total ship
construction last year amounted to 7.74 million gross tons, up
36.8 percent over the 5.66 million gross tons registered in 1995.
</P>
<P>
South Korea is the second largest shipbuilder in the world
following Japan with an annual shipbuilding capacity of 8.5
million tons.

<HEADLINE> Regulation Helps People Lodge Complaints in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A new regulation to help people
lodge official complaints has been approved by the Standing
Committee of the Zhejiang Provincial People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The regulation, which will come into force on February 1,
mainly consists of stipulations about the rights and
responsibilities of people who make complaints, and the
responsibilities and procedures of government departments in
dealing with complaints from the people.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the implementation of the regulation will help
protect the legitimate rights and interests of people who lodge
complaints, and improve the work of departments concerned.
</P>
<P>
An official says that by means of writing letters and making
calls, ordinary citizens involve themselves in the management of
state and social affairs. Their efforts play an increasingly
important role in the country's democratization process.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that departments concerned received 200,000
complaints in 1996, mostly focused on enterprise reform, urban
construction and public security.
</P>
<P>
The regulation provides that township and neighborhood-level
government departments set up special work units to offer a
broader access to ordinary citizens who wish to make
complaints.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Proposes Compromise on Further Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 7 (Xinhua) -- U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross
is proposing a compromise on further Israeli troop pullbacks in
the West Bank in a bid to clear the last obstacle blocking a
Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
Ross held several meetings Monday with Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem and then with Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in Bethlehem to intensify his efforts to bridge
the remaining gap.
</P>
<P>
The last obstacle blocking the long-delayed Hebron deal is the
Palestinian demand for setting a timetable for Israeli troop
redeployments in the rural areas in the West Bank following the
Hebron pullback.
</P>
<P>
Arafat wanted Israel to promise to carry out further
redeployments according to the Oslo accords, which stipulate that
the redeployments should be completed by next September. But in
the secret Arafat-Netanyahu summit held Sunday morning, Netanyahu
only promised that Israel would complete the pullbacks before
spring 1999.
</P>
<P>
Israeli sources said Ross is seeking a compromise between the
Palestinian and Israeli demands. It remains unclear whether
Ross' proposed date would be the midway point between the two
dates: the summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that Ross would leave here once again
within the next few days if he fails to convince the two sides
to reach a compromise.
</P>
<P>
"I remain hopeful we will see an agreement soon, but I can't
predict when," Ross said after meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
English language daily the Jerusalem Post reported that
U.S. President Bill Clinton linked his invitation to Arafat for a
visit to Washington with the Hebron deal. The U.S. has told Arafat
that failure to conclude a deal could influence negatively on his
relations with the White House.
</P>
<P>
While Clinton has not linked his invitation to Netanyahu to
the conclusion of the Hebron deal, the U.S. president apparently
prefers to see such a deal forged before receiving Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
To allay the concern about each other's future violations of
agreements, the U.S. is considering writing "letters of
assurance" to both sides, as it did on the eve of the 1991
Madrid peace conference, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Archeologists Find 3,500-year-old Wall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
excavated a complete section of wall which was built 3,500 years
ago to protect an ancient city.
</P>
<P>
The wall, in Yanshi in central China's Henan Province, belonged
to the Shang Dynasty (16th-11th century BC).
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said that the 2.3-meter-high wall is surrounded
by a six-meter-deep moat. Within the city are scattered a number
of tombs, pottery kilns and sewers.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have also found tracks of wheels, proving that the
country's history of using carts was 300 years earlier than
previously believed.
</P>
<P>
The city's protective wall was first excavated in 1983 and
since then archeologists have found five city gates and three
palace-like buildings.
</P>
<P>
The city was believed to be built in the early days of the
Shang Dynasty, when Chinese society was still at a stage of
slave-owning.

<HEADLINE> DNA Breakthrough in Rice Structure by Chinese Scientists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
produced the world's first high-definition DNA "fingerprint" of
rice, the country's stable food.
</P>
<P>
They say the breakthrough will have a major impact on the
genetic breeding of new strains of grain crops in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have been able to construct a complete
high-definition graph of rice genes, a so-called DNA fingerprint.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough was made at the National Gene Research Center
under the Chinese Academy of Sciences after three years of effort,
according to a press conference held by the State Science and
Technology Commission, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the
Shanghai Municipal Government. The scientific team was headed by
researcher Hong Guofan.
</P>
<P>
The high definition of the graph, measuring some 120,000
nucleic acid, makes possible the direct measurement of the DNA
structure in order, according to scientists.
</P>
<P>
The graph contains 565 genetic markers, and the distance
between many of the markers are already clear. It will enable
scientists to obtain rice genes faster.
</P>
<P>
The graph contains some 100 universal genetic markers, some of
which are already known to be universal in the genes of some major
crops, including barley, oat, wheat, corn, sorghum and sugarcane.
</P>
<P>
The graph will have great influence on the genetic breeding of
crops, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
It was described as the most influential achievement in recent
years in the basic research in China, according to the press
conference.

<HEADLINE> PLA Supports Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The People's Liberation Army
(PLA), China's armed forces, has taken an active attitude towards
the country's economic construction, by offering more than 100
million labor days in the past five years.
</P>
<P>
According to the PLA General Political Department, PLA officers
and men have taken part in more than 30,000 state key projects and
other public-spirited items, and helped nearly two million poor
families relieve poverty and become better off.
</P>
<P>
China's key projects, including the Three Gorges Dam,
Beijing-Kowloon Railway, A south-to-north Water Diversion and an
optical cable line, have all received full support from the army.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the army has mobilized some 200,000
soldiers to lay 20,000 kilometers of telecommunications cable
lines between Beijing and Lanzhou, Guangzhou, Xi'an, and between
Xi'an and Urumqi. The cables have covered 20 provinces, autonomous
regions and municipalities, and accounted for one-third of the key
projects of the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese soldiers have also taken part in various
poverty-relief projects in the country's underdeveloped regions
and helped set up 30,000 poverty relief centers.
</P>
<P>
By providing economic information and training personnel, the
army has helped two million poor families relieve poverty and
become better off.
</P>
<P>
The army helped set up 45,000 township enterprises and
household-based farms in underdeveloped areas, and set up more
than 20,000 economic communities to boost local economies.
</P>
<P>
Army academies, research institutes and information agencies
have also turned their findings to civil purposes, with the
economic rewards described as satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
Military industries can manufacture over 15,000 kinds of
civil-use products, and 2,500 items of national defence
technologies have been turned over to civil use, generating 10
billion yuan in annual output value.
</P>
<P>
And the production of motorcycles and color television sets by
military companies has respectively accounted for 60 and 30
percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The application of nuclear technology in agriculture has added
at least one billion kilograms of grain annually.
</P>
<P>
The army also participated in nearly 9,000 public-spirited
projects which were directly in the interests of the people.
</P>
<P>
Army units stationed in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
have helped local residents drill over 200 wells and lay more than
10,000 meters of water pipes, helping local farmers and herdsmen
to solve water supply problems.

Chaiyasan said on the occasion that he would do his best to
help the three countries be accepted in line with the declaration
at the Jakarta ASEAN Summit late last year "but it is up to the
three to prepare themselves accordingly".
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also took the opportunity to discuss the
forthcoming ASEAN Foreign Ministers meeting, the ASEAN-European
Union Dialogue and other subjects as "both of us are committed to
work together towards the progress of ASEAN."
</P>
<P>
Chaiyasan also handed over a cheque of 100,000 ringgit (about
40,000 US dollars) as donation from the Thai government for
victims of the recent tropical storm Greg that lashed the west
coast of Sabah, East Malaysia, and caused some 200 deaths.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Thailand pledged to cooperate with the
Malaysian authorities in stemming the influx of Bangladeshi
illegal workers into Malaysia through their common border.
</P>
<P>
Chaiyasan said not all Bangladeshi illegal workers entered
Malaysia through the common border as they were also known to have
come to Malaysia through other entry points.
</P>
<P>
"Whatever it is, we are more than willing to give our
cooperation in curbing this problem once and for all," he added.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said officials from both countries were expected to
meet soon to see how best they could stop the flow of Bangladeshi
illegal workers before submitting proposals to their respective
governments on the actions to be taken.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia is fully aware that the Malaysian-Thai border is
made up of forest and therefore we have to see how best (the entry
of illegal workers) can be stopped as we feel that it is necessary
for the two governments to cooperate," he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said he also discussed with the Thai minister some
unresolved problems pertaining to border demarcation along the
common border, and also about problems in the area of fishing.
</P>
<P>
He said both of them agreed to take steps to resolve the
matters sooner as had been agreed upon by the prime ministers of
the two countries, Mahathir Mohamad and Chavalit Yongchaiyudh.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Make "Gold" From Stones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- For farmers in Linqu County, east
China's Shandong Province, the old saying "Touching a stone and
turning it into gold" is no longer a dream.
</P>
<P>
The county's 8,000 farming families are making money by
quarrying and selling stones and stone products.
</P>
<P>
Located to the north of Yimeng Mountains, the county boasts
more than 2,000 high and low hills and rich stone resources,
including fossilized pre-history beings, and basalt and sapphire
formed during the Tertiary Period.
</P>
<P>
Quarrying and selling stones and stone products became popular
in the county just two years ago, and has attracted hundreds of
thousands of stone fans.
</P>
<P>
Every five days there is a stone market where people can spend
two or three yuan buying a stone product. But occasionally they
would have to pay at least 100,000 yuan for a rare specimen.
</P>
<P>
Local farmers make colorful stone products which feature not
only human beings, animals and birds, rivers and mountains, but
also legendary stories.
</P>
<P>
By last year Linqu County had opened more than 500 stone
stores, and there were 32 villages specializing in the selling of
unique and rare stones.
</P>
<P>
The county government has invested more than 10 million yuan
building a unique stone street, a stone market and a rare stone
museum. The projects produce at least 100 million yuan a year for
the county.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The peace panels of the
Philippine government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF)
today opened their peace talks in Maguindanao province, the
southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Fortunato Abat, chief government peace negotiator,
shook hands and hugged with his MILF counterpart Moner Bajunaid
and other MILF representatives shortly before a simple rite
marking the start of the first technical working group meeting
between the two panels.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which was held in Sultan Kudarat town of the
province, is expected to lay the ground rules for a formal
ceasefire and set the agenda for their formal peace talks which
will start after the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
In his opening statement, Abat expressed optimism that despite
the "enormous task ahead of us, we find strength on the belief
that we are all here because we all want peace."
</P>
<P>
He said he will recommend to President Fidel Ramos the
extension of the government-imposed ceasefire for another 60 days
in respect to the observance of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Bajunaid, on the other hand, cited the significance of holding
the talks in this town "where Sultan Mohammad Dipatuan Kudarat
once ruled and drove away foreign invaders in defense of Islam in
Mindanao."
</P>
<P>
He said the MILF presence in today's historic meeting "comes at
an appropriate time as we begin the year 1997, we venture in
taking the first step of finding a just and political solution to
the conflict" between the government and the MILF.
</P>
<P>
Citing previous attempts of settling the conflict with the
regime of late President Ferdinand Marcos and in 1987 with the
Corazon Aquino administration, Bajunaid hoped that today's efforts
will bring the two sides closer towards a genuine and lasting
peace.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will end tomorrow with both panels issuing a joint
press communique on what had been discussed.

<P>
JINAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- More of China's cotton growing
land is escaping from disease and insects, and there is much less
pesticide pollution.
</P>
<P>
The achievement has been made possible in Wenshang County, east
China's Shandong Province, with assistance from the Asia
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to a local official, 75,000 hectares of cotton land
has become disease free and has suffered no insect pests since a
control project under the Asia Development Bank was launched four
years ago in Wenshang county.
</P>
<P>
"So far, the project has saved 7.5 million US dollars in
addition to creating a better ecological environment," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
Wenshang county is one of four sites where the bank launched
its worldwide cotton disease and insects pest control projects.
</P>
<P>
Differing from the traditional chemicals, the new projects use
more agricultural, biological, physical and machinery means of
control.
</P>
<P>
"I am very satisfied with the achievements at Wenshang, and the
experience should be shared by more places," said Asia Development
Bank official, S. Ramaswamy.
</P>
<P>
According to an official at the provincial government of
Shandong, the techniques used in cotton disease and insect pest
control in Wenshang will soon be spread throughout Shandong
Province.

<HEADLINE> Grain Bases Report Good Harvests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Grain-producing Provinces in
various parts of China have reported good grain harvests in 1996.
</P>
<P>
North China's Hebei Province set an all-time record, gathering
27.7 billion kg of grain last year.
</P>
<P>
A provincial agricultural official attributed the good harvest
to the application of modern agro-science. The province spread 30
kinds of new agro-techniques on nine million hectares of land last
year.
</P>
<P>
Southwest China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region harvested
15.9 billion kg of grain last year, 370 million kg more than the
1995 figure, despite a serious drought.
</P>
<P>
The output of sugar cane, oil-bearing crops, animal by-products
and aquatic products, also registered big increases.
</P>
<P>
The per capita net income of farmers rose to 1,680 yuan last
year, 234 yuan over the previous year's figure.
</P>
<P>
Gansu Province, in northwest China, achieved an all-round
agricultural development in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Its output of grain rose to 8.2 billion kg, 10 percent more
than that in the peak year of 1993. The output value of some
pillar industries in rural areas totalled 13.2 billion yuan,
representing a 6.8 percent rise. Farmers' annual net income surged
by 24.4 percent to 1,100 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning Province, which used to be a grain importer in
northeast China, secured 16.6 billion kg of grain last year. Its
outputs of vegetables, fruit, meat, eggs and milk also set new
records.
</P>
<P>
So far it has not only been self-sufficient in grain supplies,
but has also been able to export grain to other Chinese provinces.
</P>
<P>
The island province of Hainan produced 350,000 tons of meat in
1996, 9.7 percent up from previous year's output, 460,000 tons of
aquatic products, up by 6.4 percent, 1.9 million tons of
vegetables, up by 17 percent, and 450,000 tons of fruit, up by 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
Nationally, the total output of grain reached 480 million tons,
which set another historical record, better than the good harvest
in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Save Babu the Elephant's Trunk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Zhengzhou, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Doctors in China came to the
rescue after Babu the elephant accidentally severed his own trunk.
</P>
<P>
In a complicated 17-hour operation, they successfully stitched
back Babu's trunk, enabling the huge animal to feed itself once
more.
</P>
<P>
Veterinary surgeons in Zhengzhou, capital city of central
China's Henan province, sent an urgent plea to a top limb
transplant surgeon at a Chinese hospital, asking for help.
</P>
<P>
The replantation expert at a Zhengzhou hospital dashed
immediately to the city's zoo after the call, while veterinary
surgeons from Shanghai, Shenzhen and Beijing rushed to the city by
air with special anaesthetics, and to help in the surgery.
</P>
<P>
Now well on the road to recovery, Babu has become an instant
star at Zhengzhou Zoo, as thousands of men, women and children
follow the drama.
</P>
<P>
Many people are visiting the zoo daily to see Babu in a public
show of care and concern for the 14 year old elephant.
</P>
<P>
The drama started three months ago when Babu had his trunk
hanging on a window with iron grating five-meters above ground. He
was leaning on the railing playing with female companion across a
fence.
</P>
<P>
When Babu tried to withdraw his trunk, it became trapped by the
iron window grating. The harder Babu tried, the more his trunk
became squeezed, causing acute pain. The intense pain caused the
three-ton distressed animal to fall, severing a length of his
trunk.
</P>
<P>
When zoo staff realized what had happened they quickly alerted
a medical team.
</P>
<P>
The major problem during the operation was with the level of
anaesthesia. Giving too little anaesthetic would mean the elephant
moving around, while too much would make the patient lay flat on
the ground, with its heart and lungs pressed by its own weight.
</P>
<P>
The 17-hour operation was successfully undertaken in the zoo's
elephant hall with a surgeon and over 20 assistants.
</P>
<P>
Doctors reported that tears ran down Babu's face during the
operation as his female friend tried to comfort and console her
sick companion. She continually stretched her own trunk from her
own adjoining compound towards Babu to try to gently stroke him.
</P>
<P>
But Babu quickly moved away the operation instruments and
bandages near the wound after he regained consciousness.
</P>
<P>
Doctors then had to conduct another replantation operation on
the elephant.
</P>
<P>
Babu, whose trunk was shortened by 40 centimeters, could use it
again to place a cabbage into his mouth less than 100 days after
the operation.
</P>
<P>
The elephant now has a better relationship with his keeper
after being hand-fed with delicious food at least 400 times a day
during the post-operative period.
</P>
<P>
Babu has been a hot topic in the city during the past three
months, with city government officials visiting him. Ordinary
citizens, including people who seldom visited the zoo, and
tourists, have shown concern for his desperate plight.
</P>
<P>
A father, visiting the zoo with his child said, "We are very
sad at the news that the elephant had its trunk severed. It is
just like when a friend suffers an illness. So we have come here
to visit Babu."
</P>
<P>
A two-year-old boy, accompanied by his family, took his money
saving box to the zoo to donate his money to buy delicious food
for the elephant.
</P>
<P>
He mother said, "When the boy learned the news, he was very sad
and asked the family, "Does he feel pain? Can we do something for
him?"
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the zoo believe that Babu will fully recover and
have a normal life with a special training.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Zairean rebels have
accused South African and Angolan mercenaries as well as the
French troops aiding Kinshasa's government troops.
</P>
<P>
The rebels are preparing for meeting a counter-attack by the
government troops, South Africa's local newspaper the Star
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Rebel chief Laurent-Desire Kabila, speaking in the rebel-held
eastern town of Goma, said there are 1,000 French troops as well
as South African and Angolan mercenaries in Kisangani, a city 500
kilometres northwest of Goma.
</P>
<P>
There was no immediate reaction from the South African
government, but the claim was immediately denied by Paris.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman of the French Defense Ministry said there were no
French troops in Zaire, except for five paramilitary officers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, European diplomats based in Kisangani said they had
seen no sign of French or other foreign troops there.
</P>
<P>
Kisangani is a strategic town that would be a major gathering point
for a possible counter-attack by Zaire's government troops.
</P>
<P>
Kabila stressed there were also mercenaries from a South
African company, the Executive Outcome. He did not give numbers.

<HEADLINE> Big Rewards As Beijing Continues Anti-Porn Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's anti-pornography and
anti-piracy fights were fruitful in the past
month, as officials netted 24 suspects.
</P>
<P>
And with people in China's capital being offered rewards of up
to 100,000 yuan for informing on wholesalers and pedlars of
pirated and pornographic VCD's, the successes are set to continue.
</P>
<P>
Special telephone hotlines have been opened in the Chinese
capital to encourage members of the public to spill the beans on
criminals.
</P>
<P>
Beijing authorities last month seized 24 suspects and 1,700
pornographic books, 33,198 pirated books, 3,950 pirated tapes,
3,300 pirated and pornographic CD's, 5,083 pornographic
and illegal video compact discs, as well as 2,900 illegal video
tapes.
</P>
<P>
It brought the total number of seizures to 55,900 illegal
laser discs, compact discs, video tapes and other electronic
publications this winter.
</P>
<P>
And several syndicates, selling and pirating books, video and
audio products, have been smashed, according to the Beijing
Evening News.
</P>
<P>
This is part of a massive nationwide "winter strike hard " on
criminal acts and criminals, following the successful anti-crime
campaign which was launched last year.
</P>
<P>
Beijing authorities have vowed to reward anyone who reports on
illegal trading of VCDs, a new measure this year to combat local
copyright piracy.
</P>
<P>
The rewards ranged from 10,000 yuan (1,025 US dollars) to
100,000 yuan (12,048 US dollars) in line with the number of
illegal VCDs confiscated.

<HEADLINE> Tianjin Witnesses Rapid Growth of Firms With Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-financed enterprises in
north China's port city of Tianjin contributed 40 percent to the
city's total industrial output value in 1996, according to latest
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the Municipal Commission of Foreign Trade
and Economic Cooperation show that the city has more than 3,200
foreign-funded enterprises, whose combined output value amounted
to 50.7 billion yuan in the first three quarters of last year, up
44.2 percent over the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The firms have enjoyed a good economic return, with profits
totaling 4.89 billion yuan in the first nine months of 1996, an
increase of 33.3 percent over the same period in 1995, statistics
show.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of the city's investment environment, the
old industrial base has attracted an overseas investment adding up
to 5.7 billion US dollars over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
According to analysts, the number of international enterprise
groups and consortiums that have investments in Tianjin amounts to
189, with the bulk of their investments in industrial projects.
</P>
<P>
The city's comparatively advanced infrastructure, sufficient
technical personnel, and low salary levels, all contributed to the
rapid growth of the enterprises, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt for Gender Equality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is making
efforts to create an environment of gender equality and
subsequent integration of women in national development.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by Austin Mweemba, Permanent Secretary in
the Administration Division at Cabinet Office, in Kafue, south of
capital Lusaka, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The government's efforts have been highlighted by the creation
of the Gender in Development Division at Cabinet Office, said
Mweemba while officially opening a training workshop for gender
focal point persons in ministries and provinces.
</P>
<P>
Mweemba noted that the government has made headway in
alleviating inherent gender biases and other legislative
obstacles that impinge upon the participation of women in
national issues.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad to say that most gender biases have been removed
from our laws and the government has now shifted its focus to
biases in administrative processes and procedures," Mweemba said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mweemba observed that women in Zambia have still
continued to be disadvantaged in economic and social development
by prohibitive social and legislative laws.
</P>
<P>
He said that discriminatory legislation, coupled with cultural
biases and taboos, have continued to plague women's full
potential for development. Women are also haunted in their
development efforts by such vices as inaccessible credit
facilities and land. A majority of them are devastated by
property grabbing.
</P>
<P>
These vices have frustrated women from realizing their full
potential in educational, professional, political and economic
spheres, Mweemba said.
</P>
<P>
The appointment of gender focal point persons in all
ministries and provinces is expected to provide the government
with a clear avenue through which it will be able to propagate
special gender programs which promote women's rights.

<HEADLINE> Effective Reform Ensures Ample Supply of Foodstuff in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 7 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's food supplies in
1996 were sufficient and prices remained stable as a result of
effective reform measures, including price-liberalization schemes.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest city, has an urban population of
about 10 million. Each year the city consumes over 1.4 million
tons of vegetables, 350,000 tons of pork, 1.1 billion kilograms of
eggs, 120,000 tons of fresh water fish, and over 600,000 tons of
rice.
</P>
<P>
In a move to meet growing demand and prevent the production
initiative of the farmers from dwindling, the municipal government
last year began to introduce bold measures to remove government
controls, and let prices float according to market demand.
</P>
<P>
Another effective measure accountable for the stable market was
the reform of financial subsidies. While in the past, subsidies
were provided in a broad way, now the policy has become more
selective.
</P>
<P>
The subsidies now mainly go to four areas, including the
municipal government macro-economic fund; production support
funding; a development fund for State-owned enterprises; and
funding for the operation of enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe May Not Meet EU Beef Quota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is unlikely to meet its
European Union quota for beef exports, losing hundreds of
millions of U.S. Dollars in export revenue, according to the
Daily Herald today.
</P>
<P>
This is because the Cold Storage Company (CSC) is still
"hard-pressed" for slaughter stock despite offering premiums to
cattle producers.
</P>
<P>
The high prices that top-quality beef fetches in Europe bring
CSC, which has the monopoly for European exports and has the only
EU-inspected cattle abattoirs, about 40 million U.S. Dollars a
year.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year CSC offered premiums to producers of
suitable cattle to attract more into its export abattoirs. But
these have failed to bring in the required amount of cattle.
</P>
<P>
Cattle producers in both the commercial and smallholder
sectors were hammered by the drought in 1992 and subsequent poor
seasons. They have found it hard to rebuild the national herd
since available finance is either very expensive or in very short
supply.

<HEADLINE> More New Biomedicines Produced in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Newly-invented products have
proved a tonic for the pillar industry of biomedicine in Shanghai,
with profits from the medicines making up 79 percent of the
industry's total last year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the output value of the new products accounted for 21
percent of the total output value of the biomedicine industry, up
14 percent from three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The output value of the industry, which was estimated at 12.5
billion yuan (about 1.5 billion US dollars) last year, increased
by 25 percent, compared with the figure of 1995.
</P>
<P>
During the past three years, 152 types of biomedicines have
been invented and 122 are on the market. Among the 122, 16 have
been recognized by the Ministry of Public Health as medicines
developed using the most advanced techniques.
</P>
<P>
The inventions include some gene engineering medicines, such as
streptokinase (SK), used for cardiovascular disease, a growth
hormone for children, interleukin-2 for curbing the growth of
tumors, and the hepatitis-c vaccine.
</P>
<P>
The city has set its goal for the total output value of the
industry by the year 2000 at 30 billion yuan (about 3.6 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
During the last four years of the century, it will develop new
products for health care, pesticide and three other fields,
focusing on the medicine for cardiovascular diseases,
anti-infection, tumor treatment, sterility-improvement and
senility-related diseases.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUOYANG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A line to produce 500 tons of
floating glass a day has been built at a joint-venture company in
Qingdao involving Hong Kong funding.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the production line, valued at 600 million
yuan, began in May 1995 in Qingdao Taiyang Glass Industrial
Co. Ltd., which is a joint effort involving the Luoyang Floating
Glass Company in central China's Henan Province, a company in
northwest Shaanxi Province, and two companies from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The line is expected to manufacture 2.62 million crates of
floating glass a year.
</P>
<P>
In addition to imported equipment and technology, the joint
venture introduced the Luoyang company's key floating
glass-producing techniques, which are among the top in the world,
helping it to lead the country in technology and automation in
glass production.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the production line in Qingdao, the Luoyang
company has so far cooperated with other companies to build two
more such ventures, bringing its total floating glass production
lines to six.
</P>
<P>
The Luoyang company now contributes one-fifth of the country's
total floating glass output.

TOKYO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto restated his determination today to help end the
protracted hostage crisis in Peru in a quick and peaceful manner,
Kyodo News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"While placing complete trust in (Peruvian) President (Alberto)
Fujimori's government, we will continue to do all we can and try
our best to help secure the release of all those held hostage as
early as possible," he said just prior to his departure for five
Southeast Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
"I hope all the hostages will be released at the earliest
possible time to bring this incident to a peaceful conclusion," he
was quoted as telling reporters at his official residence.
</P>
<P>
But Hashimoto added that he wants to seize on his eight-day
visit to five of the seven members of the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) to demonstrate worldwide Japan's
uncompromising stance on terrorism, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The hostage standoff erupted on December 17, when more than a
dozen heavily armed Peruvian rebels stormed the Japanese
ambassador's residence in Lima during a party in honor of Japanese
Emperor Akihito.
</P>
<P>
While most of the captives were set free under international
rescue efforts, there are still 74 hostages remaining in the
rebels' hands, including Japanese ambassador to Peru and Peruvian
foreign minister.

<HEADLINE> Soft Landing Is must to Check Overheated Economic Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China's economy scored a
successful soft landing in 1996, which is a must to beat
overheated economic expansion, an article by two top economists
said in today's "People's Daily".
</P>
<P>
China's economy had a successful soft landing in 1996, thanks
to countermeasures taken to combat overheated economic expansion
in the early years of the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The gap between the economic growth peak and bottom from 1991
to 1996 was 4.5 percentage points, the smallest fluctuation since
the establishment of New China in 1949, said the article.
</P>
<P>
The article was written by Liu Guoguang and Liu Shucheng, two
economists at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The authors noted that the country had a fast development in
its reform, opening-up and modernization drive from 1991 to early
1993. This was quickly followed by an overheated economic
expansion, and chaotic economic order, especially a financial
disorder, coupled with many other problems cropping up in China's
economic life.
</P>
<P>
To change that situation, China, under the leadership by the
Chinese Communist Party Central Committee headed by President
Jiang Zemin, has fully implemented Deng Xiaoping's theory of
building socialism with Chinese characteristics and the Party's
basic lines of taking economic construction as the central task.
</P>
<P>
A series of measures were worked out to tighten macro-economic
control and launch a soft landing in national economic operations.
</P>
<P>
The country carefully implemented soft-landing measures and
achieved success after three years of efforts.
</P>
<P>
The two economists warned that China learned bitter lessons
from its "hard landing," which caused steep ups and downs in the
economy as a result of seeking rapid economic growth only in late
1950s.

In 1958, the country had the highest economic growth rate of 22
percent, but had negative economic growth rates from 1960 to 1962,
with 1961 having the lowest economic growth rate of minus 29.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
China incurred losses totaling 178 billion yuan (one
U.S. dollars now equals to 8.3 Chinese yuan) during the economic
"hard landing" from 1958 to 1962. The country regained its
economic strength in 1964, and its national economic
development was thus delayed by seven years.
</P>
<P>
An abortive "soft landing" was just as harmful as a "hard
landing", said the two economists.
</P>
<P>
China had an unsuccessful soft landing in 1986, despite the
fact that measures were taken to beat an overheated economy from
1982 to 1985, driving inflation skyrocketing, and forcing the
country to practice economic austerity programs from 1989 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
The article added that China should continue to stick to a
comparatively tight money control policy, curb inflation, and
secure a stable and relaxed economic environment, and vigorously
promote two shifts, namely, a shift from a planned economic
structure to a market economic structure and a shift from
extensive operation to intensive operation, with the purpose of
pushing ahead economic construction.

<P>
SUZHOU, January 7 (Xinhua) -- An industrial corporation in east
China's Jiangsu Province has found jobs in the Republic of Korea
for 60 of its laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
The 60 former workers at the Asia Group, a commercial
corporation in Suzhou with a 1996 retail turnover of 510 million
yuan (about 61 million US dollars), were among the staffers who
lost their jobs because the company rationalized its production
methods.
</P>
<P>
After negotiations a ROK corporation has signed one-year
contracts with the 60 laid-off workers, who are all under 40 years
old and capable of doing their new jobs in aquatic product
processing.
</P>
<P>
The ROK company is expected to arrange accommodation for the
workers and pay each of them 20,000-yuan (2,400 US dollars)
after-tax salary in the year.
</P>
<P>
The commercial group's chairman, Gong Guojun, said that it is a
new and bold attempt to make arrangements for laid-off staff.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Celebrate Chinese Lunar New Year with Chimes (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China's capital city of Beijing
will mark the Chinese Lunar New Year with the chimes of an ancient
bell, helped by the wonders of modern sound technology.
</P>
<P>
Many residents in the capital stil bemoan the ban on
firecrackers which ensured a noisy, but dangerous, start to the
traditional Spring Festival celebrations.
</P>
<P>
The fireworks and firecrackers were finally silenced in 1993,
ending a centuries old tradition.
</P>
<P>
Now lovers of noise can pin back their ears with relish, as the
city's Drum Tower in the northeastern part of downtown Beijing,
joins in the fun.
</P>
<P>
For hundreds of years the 63-ton bronze bell, second only in
size to one in Moscow, has rung out throughout Beijing. It was
cast in the 15th century and during the Ming and Qing Dynasties --
spanning 1368 to 1911 -- Beijingers heard the 108 chimes every
morning and evening.
</P>
<P>
The sprawl of Beijing and the building of sound-blocking
skyscrapers have partly numbed the chimes.
</P>
<P>
Now four giant pnuematic loudspeakers have been added to boom
out the sounds of the chimes across a radius of ten kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Another four jumbo speakers will be installed in the south of
the city to relay the tolling of the bell even farther afield.
</P>
<P>
The chime was given a dress rehearsal on New Year's Eve to
provide a countdown for the start of 1997. Thousands of families
braved treacherous road conditions to head to the drum tower for
the midnight chime.
</P>
<P>
Now many people in Beijing plan to mark the traditional
Chinese new year, the country's biggest festival and time of
family reunions, by listening to the 108 chimes, just like ancient
Beijingers had done for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
Xu Chunyu arrived at the Drum Tower by a taxi from her home 20
kilometers away to attend the special New Year's Eve gathering, a
novelty for many young Beijing residents.
</P>
<P>
"I have been told of it by old people, today I heard it
myself," she said, "the pleasant bell ringing brought me a feeling
of luck for the future."
</P>
<P>
Bell-making and bell-ringing at celebrations are traditional
cultures in China, with the oldest bells being made during the
10th century BC.
</P>
<P>
 The bell chimes will never again drift as far as in ancient
times, said Tianjing, a research fellow with the Institute of
Acoustics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

<P>
Zhu Xiangyuan, deputy director of the Beijing Commission of
Science and Technology, and also the co-sponsor of the function,
said the chimes will provide the new year atmosphere which has
been tempered by the ban on fireworks from 1993.
</P>
<P>
To make the chimes audible to as many people as possible, Ma
Dayou, CAS academician and an authoritative scholar in acoustics,
suggested Zhu solve the problem with the help of four large
pneumatic loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
The attempt was backed by the municipal government and is
expected to be an important event during a series of celebrations
for the Chinese New Year.
</P>
<P>
A snowfall decorated the Chinese capital at the end of
1996. But the traffic chaos caused by icy roads did not damp the
enthusiasm among Beijing people to listen to the chimes.
</P>
<P>
Wang and his family, who live in the western suburban
Shijingshan District, made their way to the Drum Tower.
</P>
<P>
"My home is too far away from here," Wang said, "but I really
think that attending this ceremony will bring all the family good
luck in the coming new year."
</P>
<P>
Zhu said the coldness on new year's eve helped to make the
sounds of the chimes reach farther afield.
</P>
<P>
"The efforts have combined ancient culture and modern
technologies. I believe we will have a better effect at Chinese
New Year's Eve."
</P>
<P>
Another four loudspeakers will be added on high ground in the
southern downtown, ensuring more people to hear the 108 chimes.

<P>
COLOMBO, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lanka government has
decided to hold a referendum if the main opposition United
National Party (UNP) does not support its devolution proposals.

foreign grants, he said.
</P>
<P>
The UNP had not opposed these proposals at the Select
Committee.
</P>
<P>

1995 aims to resolve the long-standing ethnic crisis in the
country. It contains proposals for redemarcation of North and East
provinces and for extending more power to Tamils in these
provinces.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Tourism Conference Held in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) Tourism Conference was held here today
with a call to promote the region as a tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN tourism industry companies, including airlines, tour
operators and travel agents, should promote the region as a
tourist destination with a greater sense of responsibility,
Malaysian Minister of Culture, Arts and Tourism Sabbaruddin Chik
said when opening the conference.
</P>
<P>
If they failed to do so, the region would not be able to
capitalize on all its advantages to attract tourists and the
industry would not enjoy a healthy growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
Only a clear understanding of responsible tourism promotion
will ensure the continuity of tourism growth, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian minister said ASEAN's dream to create a region of
healthy intra-regional travel was moving closer to reality because
of the increasing affluence, expanded trade and transport
networks, increased regional links, stable governments, relaxed
travel restrictions, increased holidays and acceptance of group
travel.
</P>
<P>
Some 800 tourism professionals attended the half-day conference
on "New Destination, New Business - The ASEAN Advantage" which
was part of the week-long ongoing ASEAN Tourism Forum here since
January 5.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, ASEAN Tourism Ministers at their informal meeting
here agreed that efforts should be strengthened to further develop
tourism on a regional basis for the benefits of all the member
countries.

<HEADLINE> China Discovers New Proof of Nanjing Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The original version of a book
that recorded brutal crimes committed by Japanese soldiers in
China during the World War II has been found in Hefei, capital of
east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
Historians said that the discovery of the book has provided new
evidence for the infamous Nanjing Massacre, which occurred between
late 1937 and early 1938 following the Japanese occupation of this
east China city.
</P>
<P>
The book, entitled "What War Means -- The Japanese Atrocities
in China," was written by H.J. Timperley, an overseas
correspondent for the British newspaper "Manchester Herald."
Timperley was in China in the late 1930s and witnessed the bloody
massacre in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
The earliest translation of this book, published in China in
1938, was found by a retired worker who was sorting out the
belongings of his late father.
</P>
<P>
In the foreword, Timperley said that he was prompted to write
this book after the Japanese army prevented him from sending his
stories on the massacre back to England.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Chengshan, curator of the museum in memory of Nanjing
Massacre victims, said that his museum has only an incomplete copy
of the book.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that after the fall of Nanjing,
Japanese troops launched a mass killing of disarmed Chinese
soldiers and civilians. The number of victims has been estimated
at 300,000.

<P>
NANCHANG, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Mount Lushan in east China's
Jiangxi Province has been listed as a World Heritage Site by the
United Nation's Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
</P>
<P>
It is the first Chinese cultural resort to be listed as a World
Heritage Site, and there are 16 Chinese tourist attractions
already on the prestige list. These include Mount Huangshan, the
Great Wall, the Forbidden City, Mogao Grottoes in Dunhuang,
Jiuzhaigou and Huanglong.
</P>
<P>
The World Heritage Center believes the combination of nature
and culture, which features the Chinese national flavor and
history, is the reason why the mountain has been chosen.
</P>
<P>
Lushan, located along China's longest Yangtze River, is famous
for its beautiful natural scenery, Buddhist and Taoist temples,
and rich cultural and historic backgrounds, which have lasted for
more than 1,000 years.
</P>
<P>
In its history, some 30 Chinese emperors visited the mountain
or wrote in honor of it. There are over 600 European-style villas
on the mountain which were built in the early years of this
century.
</P>
<P>
Lushan applied for the listing over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
China signed the World Heritage Convention in 1985 and has
submitted a tentative list, including 58 sites, to the heritage
center during the next five to ten years as possible future World
Heritage Sites.

<HEADLINE> Rural Areas in East China Province on Massive Construction Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The burgeoning construction drive
in villages and towns in rural areas of east China's Fujian
Province over the past five years has provided new housing, roads,
telecommunication lines and water and power supplies for hundreds
of thousands of families in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, Fujian has injected 48.2 billion yuan (about 5.8
billion US dollars) into such construction projects. With the
investment, houses were built covering a total floor space of 120
million square meters, enabling 700,000 families to move into new
homes.
</P>
<P>
On the average, a farmer in the province currently has 24
square meters of floor space, and 35 percent of the people in the
rural areas have access to running water.
</P>
<P>
Fujian was actively involved in rural planning, and recently
drafted blueprints for the expansion of 507 towns and 8,169
villages.
</P>
<P>
Various areas have been urged to use land resources
economically and curb encroachment on cultivated land. In Jinshan
Village of Putian County, workers have torn down 212 old houses
and built new apartments on the foundations of the former
homes. Over the past decade, no new land has been taken for the
construction of new houses in the village.
</P>
<P>
Fujian has both mountainous and coastal areas, and has chosen
to focus on the development of ten towns along the
coast. Meanwhile, in the out-of-the-way villages in mountainous
areas which have adverse natural conditions, the province plans to
resettle 100,000 people into villages with better living
conditions.

Children of different communities will be given an opportunity
to learn each other's native languages under the proposed
educational reforms, she said.
</P>
<P>
She noted that the basic problem affecting the country was that
one ethnic group did not know the language spoken by the other.
</P>
<P>
Sinhalese Tamils and Muslims and several other communities had
been living in the country for centuries in harmony participating
in each other's social and cultural functions, but somewhere down
the line many things happened in the political and social spheres
to divide the masses, the president pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"This had led to the terrible consequences that we experienced
today," the president said, adding that the diversity of cultural
traditions of various communities had contributed to the richness
of the country's cultural legacy.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Set up Four More Industrial Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Four new export processing zones
(EPZS) are going to be set up in Bangladesh by the private
entrepreneurs, official sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
proposals for developing the EPZS or industrial parks were
being scrutinized by a cell at the prime minister's office, the
sources said, adding those proposals would be cleared soon in line
with the recently enacted private export processing zones act,
1996.
</P>
<P>
One of the EPZS would be developed in Chittagong, this
country's largest port city, by South Korean entrepreneurs, while
the others would be set up by local businessmen in Comilla and
Mymensingh districts, they added.
</P>
<P>
Korea's leading industrial group Youngone, which already has
huge investments in industries of this country's state-run Dhaka
and Chittagong EPZS, would have the major stake in that venture.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government set up the two industrial parks in
early 80s with a view to attracting foreign investments for
setting up 100 percent export-oriented industries by offering
one-stop services to foreign entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
The industries in EPZS also enjoy facilities like a tax holiday
up to 12 years, duty-free import of raw materials and a ban on
trade union activity.
</P>
<P>
Officials at Bangladesh export processing zones authority said
exports from the country's two EPZS registered significant rise
during the past several years and this was what had prompted the
government to develop two other state-run EPZS in Gazipur and
Khulna districts.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Axes Airline, Military Spending Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh has instructed Thai Airways International (Thai) and
the military to shelve some of their major purchase plans in order
to cut the current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Thai, the national carrier, has been told to lease rather than
buy 21 new aircraft at a cost of 20-30 billion baht (800 million
to 1,200 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Shelved military projects include the navy's plan to spend 17
billion baht (680 million dollar) for two diesel submarines and
the Defense Ministry's plan to buy a satellite at a cost of 27
billion baht (1.08 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said on Monday that he would introduce a
package of thrift to bring about a one-percent cut in the current
account deficit from last year's 8.2 percent (335.7 billion baht,
or 13.43 billion dollars) of gross domestic product (GDP), to 7.2
percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
After being briefed on Monday by senior officials of the
Commerce Ministry, the Bank of Thailand and the Budget Bureau,
about measures to spur the economy and rein in inflation, the
prime minister also asked the Budget Bureau to review other
projects.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Amnuay
Virawan said the economy would stabilize and liquidity would
improve if unproductive spending was slashed.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Asia's Giant Cities Facing Common Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Although culturally diverse, most
of Asia's giant cities are facing the same challenges -- more
slums, heavier traffic, further environmental degradation and a
continuous rise in social problems.
</P>
<P>
Experts warned that with the increasing urban concentration,
many giant cities in Asia are choking themselves to death if
municipal governments failed to take a new approach to development
and planning.
</P>
<P>
The warning sounds somewhat sensational, but the situation in
many Asian cities is really worrisome.
</P>
<P>
While Asia has maintained its position as the fastest growing
region in the world during the past decade, Asians have been
playing catch-up in the global game of urbanization, which has
attributed to the similar problems confronted by giant cities.
</P>
<P>
However, the situation could become even worse for giant cities
with more and more people pouring in. At present, there are only
13 cities in the world with a population of more than 10 million,
and seven of them are in Asia. But the Manila-based Asian
Development Bank predicted that there will be 27 megacities in the
world with 10 million or more people by 2015, and 17 of them will
be in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations' population forecasters said that over the
next 25 years, an extra 1.5 billion people will be added to the
one billion now living in Asia's crowded cities.
</P>
<P>
The immediate problem caused by the increasing urban
concentration is overcrowding. As the rural masses flood into the
cities in search of their fortune, they could hardly find proper
housing and have to live in shanty towns.
</P>
<P>
In metro Manila, a third of the population lives in shanties,
and in Dhaka, housing, water and power shortages are a fact of
life. It is said that more than half of city residents in the
region live in disease-ridden slums.
</P>
<P>
Overcrowding often means heavier traffic. In Bangkok, each day,
more than 760 new cars take to the road and the city's residents
make 18.87 million journeys on the average. As the traffic problem
is so awful in Bangkok, passengers carry portable toilets and
businessmen equip cars with faxes and mobile phones so they can
use them as "wheeled offices".
</P>
<P>
In the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, the traffic
congestion is rapidly approaching Bangkok's level. Recently, the
city has to open a multi-dollar electric rail network aimed at
reducing the inflow of traffic. There are seven million vehicles
on the road in Malaysia -- one vehicle for every three persons on
the average. And it was reported that some 250 people died in road
accidents in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Manila is no better than Bangkok and Kuala
Lumpur. Some 1.1 million motor vehicles are registered in Manila,
and 400,000 non-Manila registered vehicles enter the capital
during the day. During the rush hours, the traveling speed of a
motor vehicle is often limited to 20 kilometers per hour. One
often has to wait for more than half an hour to pass through a
road junction.
</P>
<P>
Overcrowding also means water shortage, severe environmental
degradation and more social problems. The United Nations Center
for Human Settlements predicted that extreme water shortage could
hit Bombay, Calcutta, Karachi, Jakarta, Beijing and Shanghai by
2010.
</P>
<P>
Without a revolution in urban problem-solving, more than 1.5
billion city dwellers in Asia "will face life-and
health-threatening environments by 2025," the U.N. organization
warned.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the water shortage and environmental degradation have
already threatened the life of city dwellers in some Asian cities.
Almost half of all infants in Manila are killed by pneumonia, the
leading killer of both adults and children in the Philippines.
Malnutrition and water-born disease are rife in the city's shanty
towns. Fouled water supply has become the city's number one
environmental problem.
</P>
<P>
A new World Bank study said that if India reduced air pollution
in its largest cities to meet the World Health Organization
standards, 40,000 premature deaths could be prevented every year.
</P>
<P>
Besides, with the increasing urban concentration, urban crimes
are up, and schools and hospitals are becoming more inadequate.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, municipal governments in Asia are well aware of
the challenges, and are looking for solutions to the city
problems. In some Asian cities, authorities are trying to find
ways to slow down the pace of urbanization, improve living
conditions of city residents and speed up the development of
infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
Experts expressed the hope that the municipal governments would
accept the challenges and turn the heavy pressure into concrete
actions to meet the challenges.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Considers Amendment of Tariff Code System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is considering updating
its tariff code system to follow the new international practices,
a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Proposals on amending the country's customs tariff act to push
Thailand to follow the new code system adopted by the World
Customs Organization in 1996 are expected to be presented to the
cabinet for approval, the Bangkok Post said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand currently follows the 1988 version of the tariff code
system and it has to amend descriptions of 500 tariff items if it
wants to comply with the new code system which covers about 5,018
items, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Some Thai customs officials said that if Thailand followed the
new code, it would be easier for them to compare import and export
statistics with those of other countries.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is the only country in the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation group that has not yet adopted the 1996 code,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Thailand now faces some problems on joining the global
information technology agreement, while details of many items of
information products covered under the agreement are in the 1996
code system.

<HEADLINE> NZ Plans to Lower Alcohol Limit for Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government is
proposing tougher drunk-driving laws in a bid to further slash
road toll.
</P>
<P>
The measure is part of the coalition Government policies on
police and transport.
</P>
<P>
The local newspaper The Evening Post quoted Minister of Health
Bill English as saying today the proposed law change was still in
its infancy and more details had to be worked through.
</P>
<P>
Police Commissioner Peter Doone said lowering the legal alcohol
limit was the shock motorists needed.
</P>
<P>
Although NZ's road toll recorded a low of 513 in last year
compared with 581 in 1995, too many motorists are still refusing
to accept anti-drink driving messages.
</P>
<P>
The proposed new laws will lower the legal limit from 80
milli-grams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood to 50
milligrams of alcohol per 100 milliliters of blood.

<HEADLINE> Prodi: Italians Ready to Make Sacrifices for Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Romano Prodi said
today that Italians are prepared to make sacrifices to bring
changes to the country so long as they are fair.
</P>
<P>
"It is useless to ignore the great novelties in the world, the
lengthening of life expectancy, the need to have a working life
completely different from that of the past," Prodi told reporters
here.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the budget deficit in public spending of 1996,
Prodi announced it did not affect the 1997 financial budget bill,
which has been approved by the parliament last December.
</P>
<P>
Asked how to solve the massive public spending, the focus of
public attention, Prodi said expenditure control is the only way,
promising not to impose new taxes.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the sensitive areas of pensions and the health
service will not be affected. Instead, they will be defended.
</P>
<P>
However, social welfare will be modernized and adapted to fit
the labor market, and existing problems will be immediately dealt
with, he added.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll issued today showed that half of the Italians
wish for tax cut, even if it may affect health care, education and
pension.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that the majority of people think the present
taxation is not only excessive and unjustified, but also
unbalanced, with wage-earners paying a greater proportion of their
incomes than the self-employed.
</P>
<P>
But people still show strong support for the government's fight
against tax evasion and a substantial majority oppose a tax
strike, as has been proposed by some businessmen in the north.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia to Spend 200 Million Dollars on Infrastructure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Mongolian government
plans to invest more than 200 million U.S. dollars in 1997 to
upgrade the country's infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
The government will give top priority to fuel energy industry
in 1997 by renovating two power plants in Ulan Bator and coal
mines in Baganuur, said local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the land-locked country will speed up the
development of its communications and transport industries.
</P>
<P>
Except a total of 1,190 kilometers asphalt-covered road, most
roads in Mongolia are covered with dirt. And the capital city of
Ulan Bator is often hit by power outage.
</P>
<P>
The poor overall infrastructure has been recognized as a major
obstacle in the way of the country's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, under a 10-year program, the government would put
aside 1 billion dollars for infrastructure buildup from 1995 to
2005. It spent 160 million dollars for the purpose in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A majority of the financing for infrastructure work would come
from loans and assistance provided by Japan, South Korea, Kuwait,
the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank.

<HEADLINE> Peru's Foreign Reserves, GDP Increase in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Peru witnessed in 1996 an increase
in foreign exchange reserves to 8.54 billion U.S. dollars and a
growth of 2.2 percent in gross domestic product (GDP), showed
official statistics available today.
</P>
<P>
Banco Central de Reserva del Peru, the country's central bank,
said the reserves of hard currencies in last December were 118
million dollars higher than that in November, helping the whole
year's total mount to 1.89 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori said recently that he hoped
Peru's international reserves would reach 10 billion dollars
during the first semester of 1997.
</P>
<P>
As for GDP, figures from Peru's National Institute of
Statistics showed that it increased by 2.2 percent between January
and November in 1996 compared with the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Many sectors of the national economy, such as agriculture and
livestock, mining, manufacturing, electricity and water and
commerce, enjoyed moderate but steady growth during this period.
</P>
<P>
The GDP gain can mainly be attributed to the considerable
expansion in the manufacturing sector, which grew by 8.1 percent
as a result of the 79.4 percent increase in the output of fish
meals and fish oils.
</P>
<P>
The mild increase of Peru's GDP showed that the country
succeeded in cooling down its overheated economy when it saw a
record high of 12.9 percent GDP increase in 1994, followed by a
6.9 percent growth in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country's per capita income remained static at
around 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian government managed to slow down the country's
paces of economic development in the second half of 1995 by
bringing down state investments, boosting exports and introducing
a tough plan of fiscal and monetary austerity.

<HEADLINE> State to Give Stricter Control on Drug Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The central government will
scrutinize medicine quality more thoroughly this year to ensure
public safety, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Results of routine inspections will be published in media
reports, and business producing fake or substandard medicine will
be punished in line with state laws, said Shao Mingli, an official
with the Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
The ministry yesterday announced the lastest
inspection revealed 138 medicines failed to reach national
standards in 13 categories.
</P>
<P>
The inspection also found 48 fake medicines produced with
privated registration numbers from 26 factories, said Shao.
</P>
<P>
Some 96 factories produced substandard medicine. They were
ordered to improve their techniques and facilities immediately.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,100 medicines produced by 556 factories, 83 percent
met with the standards of the health ministry's National Institute
for Pharmaceutical and Biological Products Testing and Approving.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health is urging hospitals and
pharmacies to stop selling the substandard and fake medicine and
asking them to report the products.
</P>
<P>
The state will conduct following-up inspections in the 96
problem factories, Shao said.
</P>
<P>
The State Pharmaceutical Administration revealed corruption
flourishes in the pharmaceutical industry, where kickbacks of up
to 25 percent are not uncommon. As a result, some pharmacies give
more consideration to the kickback than to quality.
</P>
<P>
A State Council circular in April 1996 called for a crack down
on sales commissions and illegal promotions.

BANGKOK, January 7 (Xinhua) -- The Thai baht fell five satang
further on Monday to 25.65 against the US dollar from last Friday,
reaching a four-year low.
</P>
<P>
The Thai central bank declined to intervene despite the
depreciation of the baht, saying it is normal for the baht to
weaken as the US dollar appreciated on the world market.
</P>
<P>
The US dollar reportedly closed at 116.98 yen on Monday in
Tokyo market against 115.70 yen last Friday. Thai newspapers
quoted dealers as saying that the baht would depreciate one satang
if the dollar appreciates by every 0.30 yen.
</P>
<P>
The reaction to whether the depreciation of the baht would boost
Thai exports remained mixed, but dealers and central bank
officials said it would do little to spur Thai exports.

MOSCOW, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Russia's arms sales reached about
3 billion U.S. dollars last year, up 36.3 percent against 2.2
billion dollars of the year of 1995, a senior military official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Zinovy Pak, Russia's defense industry minister, told the
Interfax news agency that his ministry is ready to boost the arms
sales to three times as much in a few years.
</P>
<P>
A program on military technical cooperation with foreign
countries has been worked out and will be discussed in the first
half of the year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Military analysts said Russia has become the world's second
largest arms exporter after the United States. Other major players
in the international arms market include Germany, Britain, and
France.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the former Soviet Union's arms trade
peaked in 1987, reaching over 20 billion dollars, or 30 percent of
the total, followed by the U.S. with 20 percent.

<P>
MANILA, January 7 (Xinhua) -- A total of 523 persons were
killed in 245 natural and man-made disasters that occurred in the
Philippines in 1996, a sharp decline from the death toll of 1,180
people in 1995, according to the country's disaster authorities.
</P>
<P>
In its year-end report, the National Disaster Coordinating
Council said 668 others were injured in the disasters in 1996,
compared to the 3,023 injuries in 343 natural and man-made
disasters in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Of the 122 natural disasters that hit the country last year,

<HEADLINE> France Shows Teeth in Central Africa to Pressure Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- France has showed its teeth in the
Central African capital of Bangui in a reprisal operation against
the country's mutinous soldiers, by killing a dozen rebels and
ousting the latters from some of the strategic positions.
</P>
<P>
The operation, carried out on Sunday after two French soldiers
were murdered last Saturday in a rebel-controlled area of Bangui,
also came less than a month after President Jacques Chirac said at
a Franco-African summit that France would not take any part in the
conflict between the rebels and President Ange-Felix Patasse.
</P>
<P>
Local media said the operation means that the 2,300 French
troops -- reinforced by their fellow units from Chad and Djibouti
-- deployed in the African state have overpassed their original
mandate of maintaining peace and protecting European expatriates.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the French Socialist Party, Lionel Jospin, today
warned the government against engaging French soldiers into "the
military gearing" of Africa, and expressed his regret over the
deaths of both French and Africans in the violence of the past few
days.
</P>
<P>
France today reinforced its troops in Africa by sending two
more companies of the Third Regiment of Parachutists of Marine
Infantry from southern France to Chad, where France has been
keeping a 800-man "Epervier" task force since the 1980s to help
fend off Libyan troops.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French troops handed over to Central African
paramilitary police 36 rebels taken prisoner in Sunday's assault,
which reportedly cost heavier casualties than what Paris claimed.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted French Defense Ministry officials as saying
that from now on, France considers the only solution for the
on-going internal crisis in Central African Republic to be a total
and unconditional surrender of the rebels, whose number is unclear.
</P>
<P>
France is still giving a last chance to the rebels to
voluntarily give up their last stronghold and the French military
leaders have expressed their determination "not to let the
situation worsen" in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Central African Republic is in the grip of the third mutiny
since 1996, in which soldiers of the Yokomas tribe of former
President Andre Kolingba are calling for the payment of their pay
arrears and the resignation of President Patasse, who came to
power in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Although Central Africa has France's second largest military
base in Africa after Djibouti bordering the Red Sea, the country
is also regarded as one of the high risk zones by the French
military, where there exist a tribal tension and non-stop
political intrigues since its independence in 1960.
</P>
<P>
But France does not seem to be ready to give up its traditional
military and political privileges there, as the country is also a
pivoting station for France to carry out numerous military
interventions in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Such interventions include the "Epervier" and "Manta"
operations in Chad in the 1980s and the "Turquoise" operation in
Rwanda in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Bolivia Assures No Hostage Swaps With MRTA Guerrillas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Bolivian Foreign Minister
Antonio Aranibar said today there will be no swaps between the
four Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA) guerrillas held in
Bolivia and the Bolivian ambassador to Peru who is now in the
guerrillas' hands.
</P>
<P>
Aranibar told reporters that Ambassador Jorge Gumucio Granier's
release will not be made in exchange for the release of four MRTA
guerrillas held in Bolivian prisons where they were well treated.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister is in Lima on a mission to negotiate the
release of its ambassador who has health problems. The Bolivian
ambassador is one of the 74 still being held hostage by the rebels
occupying the residence of Japan's ambassador in Lima.
</P>
<P>
The Bolivian foreign minister said that Ambassador Gumucio is
fine but was suffering diabetes and high blood pressure. Bolivia
is holding four Tupac Amaru guerrillas in jails for their
participation in the kidnapping of former Bolivian minister Samuel
Boria Medina, who is also an industrialist.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori this
afternoon, the Bolivian minister reaffirmed his country's
solidarity with Peru in the quest for a peaceful solution to the
current hostage crisis.
</P>
<P>
Aranibar arrived in Lima on Sunday to express his government's
concern over the fate of Jorge Gumucio Granier, the Bolivian
ambassador to Peru and to negotiate his release.
</P>
<P>
The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement commando has not made
any new releases since it released seven hostages on New Year's
Day.
</P>
<P>
There are still 74 hostages inside the residential compound of
the Japanese ambassador including Bolivian Ambassador Jorge
Gumucio and Japanese Ambassador Morihisa Aoki, Peruvian Foreign
Minister Francisco Tudel and Peruvian Agriculture Minister Rodolfo
Munante.
</P>
<P>
The MRTA commando that has been occupying the residence of the
Japanese Ambassador in Lima since December 17 insisted that all
its militants in Peruvian prisons must be set free before the
hostage crisis can be solved.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between Peru and Uruguay deteriorated
after Uruguayan authorities released two members of the MRTA from
prison and the rebel commando allowed Ambassador Tabare Bocalandro
- who was once among the hostages - to leave.
</P>
<P>
The Bolivian government has refused to release the four MRTA
rebels who are serving sentences and has designated Eloy Avila as
acting ambassador to Peru.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Peruvian government is doing all it can to carry
out its official and public activities as usual.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Ecuadoran President Abdala Bucaram will
pay an official visit to Peru between January 13-15.

<HEADLINE> Ordinary People Have Few Complaints in Dalian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, January 7 (Xinhua) -- Unless Dalian's football team
hits a losing streak, residents in the most developed port city in
northeast China's Liaoning Province say they have few complaints.
</P>
<P>
People in coastal Dalian, the city renowned for its enthusiasm
for football, say their daily lives have improved as a result of
the local booming economy, more efficient government operations, a
higher living standard and a stabilized social security system.
</P>
<P>
As part of a nationwide drive to promote ethical and cultural
progress, the municipal government developed a strategy to first
tackle residents' everyday problems, then gradually work up to the
big issues.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, traffic was a headache for two million urban
residents. They were tired of the shortage of buses and bumpy city
roads.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government responded by investing 150 million
yuan (about 18 million US dollars) in road repairs, and added 26
one-way roads, covering a total length of 30 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
An advanced traffic-control system was brought into use in the
city, and public transport companies renovated 2,000 buses at a
cost of over 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
By addressing the bottlenecked public transport, the government
has underscored building more houses and water facilities.
</P>
<P>
Dalian's developers have provided a 1.2 million square meter
residential compound, worth 1.6 billion yuan (190 million US
dollars), for 5,000 families suffering poor housing conditions.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 teacher families and doctoral scholars have
moved into five new buildings and two doctors' buildings in the
past four years.
</P>
<P>
In a move to alleviate water shortages in the city, the
government has accomplished a three-billion-yuan water supply
project, bringing 600,000 tons of clear water every day to
residents.
</P>
<P>
Problems with hospitals, nursery, primary and secondary
schools, which greatly affect the daily lives of ordinary people,
have also been resolved or greatly relieved.
</P>
<P>
In response to a government campaign for ethical and cultural
progress, residents in Dalian also shared the endeavor with their
own initiatives.
</P>
<P>
A recent achievement exhibition in the Xinghai Exhibition
Center received thousands of pieces of advice from the people,
including suggestions for more big sculptures in the city, more
entertainment facilities for senior citizens, and a symbolic
building for Dalian.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 7 (Xinhua) -- China's largest education
charity, the "Hope Project", has decided to increase its financial
subsidy to poor students, today's "China Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that beginning September 1, 1997, each
beneficiary will receive 50 yuan (six US dollars) per semester
instead of the previous 40 yuan (4.80 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to help poor students, mainly living in
poverty-stricken rural areas, buy textbooks.
</P>
<P>
When the project was launched in 1989, the per term aid was 20
yuan (2.40 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Price hike is the the main factor for the China Youth
Development Foundation, the non-governmental sponsor of the
project, to set the new rate, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In the past seven years, the project has prevented 1.2 million
children from quitting school, with donations of 800 million yuan
(96 million US dollars) it received from home and abroad,
according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that about 30 million children aged
between six and 14 have never been to school, or they have quit
school because they could not pay the tuition fees.

dollars worth of coconut products in 1996, a sharp drop from the
recorded 1.1 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
But the coconut export income last year is still the second
highest in the last 15 years, local press reports said today,
citing figures released by the Philippine Coconut Authority.
</P>
<P>
The drop in coconut exports receipts resulted from a huge
decline in the sale of coconut oil last year to 588 million
dollars from 842 million dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Volume of coconut products exported also declined by 39 percent
from 2.3 million metric tons in 1995 to 1.5 million metric tons
this year.
</P>
<P>
Coconut authority administrator Virgilio David expected coconut
exports to reach the level of 1.1 billion dollars in 1997, with
recovering coconut production in the country and growing demand in
overseas markets.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investments Help Economic Growth in Cuba </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Cuban government
official today attributed part of his country's 7.8 percent growth
of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1996 to foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Ferradaz, Cuba's minister of foreign investment and
economic collaboration, said the capital inflow last year "in one
way or another" contributed to the annual economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The GDP gain, he noted, was achieved amid many adverse
conditions, such as the Helms-Burton Act approved on March 12 by
U.S. Congress for tightening the sanction against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign investors took maximum advantage of the
Caribbean island nation's skilled labor force, adequate
infrastructure and favorable policies, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The number of Cuba-foreign businesses operating in the country
increased to 260 in 1996, compared with 240 by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The average economic growth was 3.5 percent throughout Latin
America last year, Ferradaz said.

WASHINGTON, Janaury 6 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic champion "Dream
Team" guard Anfernee Hardaway participated workouts Monday on the
Orlando Magic's arena and should return to the NBA league for
Tuesday's game.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway has missed 23 of 28 games this season for the Magic
and 11 games since December 18 due to tendinitis, reports said.
</P>
<P>
At 11-17, the Magic is a far cry from the squad that reached
the 1995 NBA Final.

Orlando have slid to a 7-16 record without Hardaway, losing
nine of 11 games during his latest absence. He underwent
arthroscopic surgery on his left knee on November 17 to repair
torn cartilage.
</P>
<P>
Hardaway has averaged 20.2 points, 5.8 assists and 5.8 rebounds
a game for Orlando, which waived Kenny Smith to make room for

<HEADLINE> New Flood in Northwest, Snow in South in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Surging water broke through
another levee today and officials warned of more flooding in
Northern California while heavy snow falls in the southern U.S.,
blocking highways and forcing schools to close.
</P>
<P>
There were six levee breaks near Manteca on the San Joaquin
River, with the latest at 3 a.m. local time today. About 400
people had evacuated but some 1,500 remained in a recommended
evacuation area, said the Office of Emergency Services in
California.
</P>
<P>
With constant pressure from runoff pouring out of the Sierra
Nevada, fragile levees are threatened to break out, local
officials warned.
</P>
<P>
Although 23,000 people were allowed to return to homes in Yuba
and Sutter counties, about 160 kilometers northeast of San
Francisco Sunday, many of the 90,000 people fled home Thursday
were still out after a levee break there.
</P>
<P>
A week of snow and rain devastated areas of Washington, Oregon,
Idaho and western Nevada. Up to 40 inches of rain fell on the
region and rising temperatures melted dense snow in the Sierra
Nevada, leading to flooding.
</P>
<P>
At least 29 deaths have been blamed on the flooding and storms
in California, Washington, Idaho and Oregon.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Serbian Parties Urges Peaceful Solution to Internal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Leader of the opposition
Serbian Radical Party Vojislav Seselj said today that Serbs should
settle their disagreements and crucial political issues peacefully
and without foreign powers' interference.
</P>
<P>
The Serb people must handle their internal problems without
foreign interference, Seselj said, referring to the foreign powers
"which have proved their hostility towards the Serbian people by
bombing towns, villages, schools and hospitals throughout the
Bosnian Serb territories during the civil war and by imposing
economic sanctions against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The NATO forces bombed Bosnian Serb military installations in
early September 1995 to retaliate the alleged killing of 37
Sarajevo civilians by shelling the city on August 28. The Serb
authorities claimed scores of people had been killed during NATO's
massive air raid.
</P>
<P>
"In 1997, we must do all in our best to reduce internal
conflicts and tensions so as not to resolve our political disputes
and problems in bloody showdowns in the streets of Serbian towns,
but through a dialogue between national representatives in the
Serbian and Yugoslav parliaments," Seselj said in his Christmas
and New Year message which was released by the Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
The Western countries have warned Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic not to use force against the anti-government protests or
would face international isolation and sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Alsos today, the Nikola Pasic Radical Party called on the
Serbian government to act in the interest of the Serbian people
and "energetically prevent an open aggression by outside
aggressors and inside servants against the republic, the
constitution and freedom of the Serbian people."
</P>
<P>
"The engagement of the Zajedno (Together) coalition, united
with ethnic Albanian separatists and Western principals, continues
working on the destabilization of Serbia and its reduction" to a
region around Belgrade, the party said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The United Radical Party of Serbia also described today as
impermissible the foreign interferences into a sovereign state's
internal affairs, and especially the dictating of conditions for
resolving internal problems.
</P>
<P>
"We demand that state organs and institutions enable normal
work and normal life in all Serbian cities and towns, which the
current events have rendered impossible," Tanjug quoted the
party's statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
After 48 consecutive days of peaceful demonstrations, the
Zajedno coalition organized automobile protest Sunday, during
which many cars drove slowly in downtown Belgrade to block the
traffic.

<HEADLINE> Irish PM Condemns IRA's Rocket Attack in Belfast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Irish Prime Minister John Bruton
issued an "unreserved condemnation" today about a rocket attack on
the High Court in Belfast by the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
Bruton said the IRA had shown a disregard for the wishes of all
people in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Patrick Mayhew warned the IRA they
cannot bomb their way to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The tactic would never get the IRA's "political party" into
talks, he told the BBC. "It simply reinforces their self-imposed
exclusion," he added.
</P>
<P>
President Gerry Adams of Sinn Fien, the IRA's political party,
also said today the IRA rocket attack at the Belfast High Court
was a "regrettable" symptom of problems which must be tackled.

<HEADLINE> UK Employers Warned on Attitude to Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- British employers' attitude
toward training should be changed if Britain's labor market is to
produce the skills required by a global economy, said a study
published today by the Department for Education and Employment.
</P>
<P>
The study said that more flexible working has brought cost and
efficiency gains for employers, and the choice of different life
style for employees.
</P>
<P>
However, the new, flexible labor market holds a bleak future
for the less well qualified, as employers remain reluctant to
spend money on training staff who are likely to switch jobs at an
increasing rate.
</P>
<P>
In order to achieve continuous improvement in work performance,
employees need to acquire progressive skills to improve their
competences outside their current organization, the study added.
</P>
<P>
In fact, "for some 70 percent of those at work, the end of
jobs-for-life has not been accompanied by training in those core
skills required by the new culture of high performance dictated by
globalization," said Amin Rajan, principal author of the report.
</P>
<P>
The study said that rapid changes in technology and working
methods require the education and training systems to be far more
responsive than they currently are in Britain.
</P>
<P>
It concluded that the burden of responsibility for developing
personal competences currently rests with the individual and
public bodies. Employers need to be equal partners in the process.

<HEADLINE> Local Paper Urges US to Pay Dues to UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The New York Times today
urged the U.S. government to pay its outstanding contributions to
the United Nations as Kofi Annan, who is highly respected in
Washington and elsewhere, has taken the office of UN
secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
An editorial of the paper said that withholding the dues was
counterproductive.
</P>
<P>
The editorial noted that some Congressional Republicans are
unwilling to pay the debt until Annan carries out major structural
reforms.
</P>
<P>
"The (Clinton) Administration, while continuing to press
vigorously for reform, must make good on its implicit promise and
persuade Congress to pay up now," the editorial said.
</P>
<P>
Although more needs to be done to reform the UN, Boutros
Boutros-Ghali did more than any other secretary-general. He cut
the New York staff by one-third. He created the office of the
inspector general, which has uncovered and corrected inefficiency.
He installed Joseph Connor, an American who formerly led the
accounting firm of Price Waterhouse, as chief financial officer,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Annan's task is to build on these achievements. "More important
than simply shrinking the UN, however, is making it more effective
in a world where the end of the cold war changed many things," the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Though Annan brings considerable strengths to the task of
reform, his reach is limited, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Reforming the UN requires the cooperation of its members, and
the United States can help now by paying its dues, the editorial
said in conclusion.

<HEADLINE> Moi, Mobutu Reaffirm Territorial Integrity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Kenya and Zaire reiterated
today their commitment to the maintenance of their territorial
integrity and world-recognized boundaries, the Kenya Television
Network (KTN) reported.
</P>
<P>
"These principles are unnegotiable," said a joint communique
issued after today's summit between Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi and his Zairean counterpart Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
They expressed regret for a U.N. resolution on deploying a
multi-national force in the eastern Zaire, said the KTN report.
</P>
<P>
The Moi-Mobutu talks, described as "fruitful" by Kenyan
officials, also focused on the crisis in the Great Lakes region.
</P>
<P>
However, Moi made no remarks when returning from the central
African country.
</P>
<P>
Moi, as well as Ugandan, Tanizanian and other African
leaders, were mandated by the December Nairobi summit to take
necessary steps to end the conflict in the Great Lakes region.

<HEADLINE> US Criticizes Cyprus for Missile Purchase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
today criticized Cyprus for a deal with Russia in which Moscow
will provide advanced anti-aircraft missiles for the defense of
the Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
It said the provision of Russian SA-10 missile systems with 144
kilometer range would destabilize the balance of power in Cyprus
and harm efforts to broker a peace agreement between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
"The United States regrets this step. We believe this will
complicate efforts to achieve a lasting peace in Cyprus... and the
purchase introduces a new and destabilizing element on this
island," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the top American envoy in Cyprus, Kenneth Brill,
lodged a formal protest with President Glafcos Clerides, and
American diplomats also "expressed disappointment" with the
missile sale during meetings with Russian Foreign Ministry
officials in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Burns said the lasting security and peace for the
Mediterranean island could only be achieved at the bargaining
table with all sides committed to finding a solution.
</P>
<P>
"The past has shown that importing weapons has brought only
arms increase from the other sides. This new missile system
threatens to take the arms buildup on Cyprus to a new and
disturbing qualitative level," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Kohl Insist on Scheduled NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl today agreed that the expansion
of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) should proceed on
the timetable outlined by the organization's foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
"They exchanged views on how that will happen in the context of
the very important discussions going on between NATO and the
Russian Federation, related to the NATO-Russia charter," White
House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
In their half-hour conversation, the two leaders also discussed
Kohl's recent visit to Russia, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
During his Russia tour last Saturday, Kohl talked with Russian
President Boris Yeltsin on the NATO expansion. The latter
expressed Russia's concern over planned NATO expansion to include
former Soviet bloc countries.
</P>
<P>
The NATO foreign ministers agreed last month to issue
invitations for the first former Soviet bloc countries to join the
alliance at a July summit in Madrid, Spain, and to admit them by
1999, the organization's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has strongly opposed NATO's eastward expansion plans,
which Russia sees as a threat to its security.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Clinton and Kohl discussed in general Russia's
concerns regarding expansion. "There's certainly a great deal of
concern -- some would say a certain degree of ambivalence -- on
that subject, and the West is well aware of that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Yeltsin are scheduled to meet in March at an
undetermined location in the United States.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Rise on Wall Street Revival </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Major European share markets all
ended higher today, supported by a rebound on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Dow's recent sharp swings and concerns on
interest rates rise kept them from rising further up.
</P>
<P>
British shares in London closed slightly higher, with the FTSE
100 index 17 points up at 4,106.5, but off last week's peaks, as
the market largely ignored another strong performance on Wall
Street.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that many investors seemed prepared to sit it out,
unnerved by fears of higher interest rates on both sides of the
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
Post-holiday torppor dominated the market and trade volumes
were thin as investors feared more Wall Street volatility.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, stocks closed higher in line with strong gains in
the rest of the world's markets, with the DAX-30 index up 22.04
points at 2,881.32.
</P>
<P>
However, weaker bonds gave a limit to the market's upside,
dealers said.
</P>
<P>
Wall Street's surge Friday and hopes of continued French
interest rates cuts gave a boost to the French stock market
despite reservations over the economy and the franc's strength,

NEW YORK, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average flirted with the 6,600 mark today as stocks extended their
rally from last week despite growing uncertainty about several
economic reports due out later this week.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip gauge was up as much as 75 points earlier,
surpassing 6,600 for the first time, before falling back to a gain
of 23.09 to 6,567.18, enough to break the record set on December
27 at 6,560.91.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume totaling 527.10
million shares, much higher than 451.95 million in the previous
session.
</P>
<P>
Broader measures also pulled back with bonds as rising oil
prices aggravated renewed inflation concerns.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 0.36 to 747.67, and
the NYSE's composite index rose 0.22 to 394.28.

<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 5.74 to 1,316.42, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index fell 0.39 to 572.06.

As bond prices fell, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
rose from late Friday's 6.73 percent to 6.77 percent, the high
level since late October.
</P>

Early indications on the holiday shopping season remained
discouraging.

<HEADLINE> 30 PKK Rebels Killed in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security forces killed
30 rebels of the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in the
last 24 hours of military operations in southeastern Turkey, the
state-run TRT radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the security forces staged the military
operations against the PKK militants on the Cudi Mountain in
Sirnak province bordering northern Iraq under the cover of Turkish
fighters and assault helicopters.
</P>
<P>
One soldier of the security forces also died in the
operations, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The report added that the security forces had captured 50
alleged PKK sympathizers during the operations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Turkish government troops have been conducting
the cross-border military operations against the PKK camps in
northern Iraq since December 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The PKK makes use of the bases in northern Iraq over which
Baghdad has lost control in its guerrilla war for autonomy in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkish government troops have crossed into northern Iraq
several times to wipe out the PKK rebels, who intermittently
launch cross-border raids against Turkish targets.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi government has protested against the Turkish
cross-border military operations, accusing Turkey of violating
its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
In the past ten years, the Turkish security forces have killed
13,255, injured 244 and captured 2,000 of the PKK militants,
dealing a heavy blow to the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
In all, over 21,000 people including PKK rebels, civilians and
government troops have been killed in the conflicts since August
1984 when the PKK began fighting in the region.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 6 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela today commended police officers who swiftly
apprehended suspects for the three bomb attacks around Rustenburg
in North-West Province on Sunday, said reports reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement from the presidental office in Pretoria,
Mandela expressed his satisfaction over the progress made in the
investigations, and he is confident the culprits will be
brought to be punished to the full extent of the law.
</P>
<P>
"There is no excuse whatsoever in our democracy for anyone to
seek to pursue political aims by violent means," said Mandela,
adding those responsible will face the full might of South
Africa's democratically elected and legitimate government.
</P>
<P>
The President also expressed his profound sympathies with the
families and communities which had fallen victims to the bomb
attakcs.
</P>
<P>
Three bombs went off in Rustenburg Sunday morning, causing two
injuries and a considerable damage to the three targeted sites,
including a mosque.
</P>
<P>
Early this morning, police arrested a rightwing suspect they
believed could help them with their investigations into the
Christmas Eve bomb attack on a Worcester shopping mall near Cape
Town, leaving four dead and more than 60 injuries.
</P>
<P>
De Wet, 41, arrested for being in possession of a stolen
vehicle, is one of the three rightwing members who escaped from
a prison last March while standing trial for their part in a
Johannesburg bombing spree that killed at least 20 people on the
eve of the April 1994 general elections.
</P>
<P>
Two other suspects were already arrested on Sunday near
Rustenburg for their alleged involvement in the bomb blasts in
the area, added the source.

ADDIS ABABA, January 6 (Xinhua) -- The Somali National
Salvation Council, formed Friday by 26 Somali factions, called
today for extended international humanitarian aid to the East
African country.
</P>
<P>
"Somalia is facing a new humanitarian plight characterised by
new famine, hardship and other sufferings," said the five
co-chairmen of the 11-member executive committee of the council
at their first press conference here.
</P>
<P>
The Chairmen are Mudane Abdulahi Yusuf Ahmed, Mudane Ali Mahdi
Mohammed, Abdelkalid Aden Mohammed, Aden Abdule Noor and Osman
Ali Att.
</P>
<P>
"We need an urgent infusion of humanitarian aid to our people
and our country so that lives could be saved," they said.
</P>
<P>
The chairmen also urged the international community to help
establish a transitional central authority or a provisional
central government in a war-torn Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The council is planning to set up a transitional government,
draft a national transitional chapter, pave a way for inter-clan
reconciliation, and organize a national reconciliation conference
in Bossasso, Somalia within the next six months.
</P>
<P>
The council will also set up a liason bureau in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The council chairmen called on Hussein Aideed, the powerful
warlord who, hoping to become the Somali president, had been
boycotting the council, to take part in such a national build-up.
"The door is still open," they said.
