<HEADLINE> Libyan Leader Urges Africans to Compete With Developed Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi
Wednesday called on Africans to unite under the flag of the
proposed African Union to compete with developed countries.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the closing session of the 36th summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), Gaddafi said that only by
unity with determination can Africans prevent a repeat of the
miserable slavery during the past hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
"Today is a glorious day when African people decide their own
destiny," he told the jubilant audience in the Parliament Palace
of Togo.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the time has come for African states to unite
as a nation to meet the challenges in the economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
"Comparing with the developed countries, African states are too
small to survive," he said. "We should unite into the Union to
compete with the Europeans."
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi pointed out that many conflicts in the African
continent rooted in the colonial rule by the Europeans over the
past hundreds of years, but the bloodshed will come to an end when
the African states unite into a union.
</P>
<P>
"The Europeans also fought each other for hundreds of years,
but now they are all united in the European Union and their
economies are developed," Gaddafi said.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that by forgiving the European enslavement, Africans
can develop cooperative relations with the Europeans, because
Europeans also need Africa which is a large market.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi hailed the establishment of the African Union as a big
historic event as it will be the second continental union after
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
"Union is the tide as it can guarantee the free movement of
people, goods and capitals," he said. "It is especially important
in the time of space and digital technology. Latin America and
Asia will also follow suit."
</P>
<P>
After three-day deliberations, African leaders at the summit
signed the Draft Constitutive Act of the African Union.
</P>
<P>
The Act says that the African Union will be officially
established until the OAU member states ratify the document which
covers the establishment of a series of organs including the
Assembly, the Executive Council and the Pan-African Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The African Union will also establish a series of financial
institutions including the African Central Bank, the African
Monetary Fund and the African Investment Bank.
</P>
<P>
Founded on May 25, 1963, the OAU is designated to promote the
unity and solidarity of the African states, defend the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and independence of members, coordinate and
intensify the cooperation and efforts to achieve a better life for
the people of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Following eradicating all forms of colonialism from Africa, the
organization has been focused on peace and development and
reversion of the growing marginalization of Africa in economic
globalization.

<HEADLINE> OAU Summit Urges U.N. to Lift Sanctions on Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOME, July 12 (Xinhua) - The Organization of African Unity (OAU)
leaders Wednesday called on the U.N. Security Council to totally
lift the nine-year sanctions on Libya as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The leaders, at their annual summit held here in the Togolese
capital on July 10-12, also backed Libya to seek compensation for
the damages caused by the imposition of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
They expressed satisfaction at the beginning of the trial of
the two Libyan suspects in the Netherlands and requested that all
the necessary conditions are provided to ensure that the trial is
fair, neutral and transparent.
</P>
<P>
Britain and the United States pushed for an air and arms
embargo against Libya in 1992 after the country refused to hand
over two suspects accused of blowing up a PanAm airline flight 103
over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, killing 230 people aboard.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Tries to Eradicate Tse-Tse Flies With New Technique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is using a new
technique known as sterile insect technique to eradicate tse-tse
flies, an official of the Ethiopian Science and Technology
Commission said here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new technology refers to a way of multiplying and releasing
sterilized male tse-tse flies in areas infested with the flies to
minimize sexual intercourse among the natural flies, thus stopping
their multiplication gradually.
</P>
<P>
A South Ethiopia Rift Valley Eradication Project has been
launched to help apply the new technique, said Kahsay Wolde, chief
of the planning and program section with the commission.
</P>
<P>
According to Kahsay, anti-tse-tse chemicals have been used in
some areas in southern Ethiopia which is prone to infestation of
the flies, but no desired results were achieved.
</P>
<P>
Tse-tse flies cause many diseases, one of which is known as
rinderpest that is infectious among people, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Pornographic Films Blamed for Violent Crime Increase in Malawi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Malawi Censorship Board has blamed
the influx of excessively violent and explicitly pornographic
films for the increase of youth involvement in violent crime in
the country, a report reaching here on Thursday said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a survey by the board as saying that there
has been a dramatic increase in armed robberies, murder, rape and
defilement by teenagers as a result of an influx of excessively
violent films and pornography.
</P>
<P>
The survey was carried out in Malawi's major urban centers of
Lilongwe, Blantyre, Zomba and Mzuzu.
</P>
<P>
During the six months surveyed, the board found that 109 cases
of sexual abuse against very young children, "some even as young
as two years old", were recorded at police stations and courts,
involving boys of under 20 years.
</P>
<P>
The board noted that there had been a dramatic increase in
commercial sex, involving very young girls, some as young as 10.
</P>
<P>
Violent films, in which those appearing smart and quick with
guns always end up as heroes, make young people adore them so much
that they take after them.
</P>
<P>
"The result is massive increase in school drop-outs due to
early pregnancies and diseases," the board said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian President Vows to Create Better Investment Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President Benjamin
Mkapa has assured foreign investors that his government will
continue with its efforts to create a conducive investment climate
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Talking to visiting Advisory Director Baroness Chalker of the
London-based Unilever Limited Company here on Thursday, Mkapa said
that his government has recognized the importance of foreign
investment to national development.
</P>
<P>
That is why various measures have been taken to improve
institutional and regulatory framework so as to encourage more
foreigners to invest in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will also continue to fight tax evasion
on imports, which has denied Tanzania of a substantial amount of
revenue and paralyzed business development in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government will ensure that existing loopholes in the
trading system that facilitate tax evasion shall be blocked, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania has attracted a growing number of investors and
entrepreneurs who are looking at the country with a light of
economic rebirth since the mid-1980's, as embodied in its far-
reaching macro-economic reform programs.
</P>
<P>
Latest official statistics show that foreign investment flow
into Tanzania during the past five years has amounted to 2.5
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This could reach 3 billion dollars by this year following heavy
investment flows in the mining industry, an official from the
Tanzania Investment Center said recently.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors that are recording heavy volumes of foreign
investment flows include tourism, manufacturing and natural
resources, the official said.

The three-year project will also help Tanzania's education
system to better meet the needs of children both within and
outside the formal school system by focusing on gender equality,
HIV/AIDS prevention and environmental education.
</P>
<P>
Anna arrived here on Wednesday for a three-day visit.

<HEADLINE> WB Offers 500 Million U.S. Dollars to Curb HIV/AIDS in Ethiopia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has allocated
500 million U.S. dollars to help facilitate the HIV/AIDS
intervention programs in Ethiopia, said Vice President Calisto
Modva of the World Bank here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia was nominated as one of the priority countries for the
funds of the World Bank because of its firm readiness to contain
the rampant spread of the pandemic in the country, Modva said
while conferring with Ethiopian President Negaso Jidada, who is
also chairman of Ethiopia's National HIV/AIDS Prevention Council.
</P>
<P>
According to the World Bank official, the establishment of a
nation-wide HIV/AIDS prevention council was a clear testimony of
Ethiopia's unwavering stand to fight the lethal disease.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is working in cooperation with a task force
devised to implement the national HIV/AIDS prevention policy of
the Ethiopian government, Modva said.
</P>
<P>
Negaso applauded the World Bank's decision to assist Ethiopia's
HIV/AIDS prevention endeavors, which he described as timely and
indispensable.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia reportedly has about 350,000 AIDS patients and 2.5
million HIV carriers, ranking the 9th in the African continent.

<HEADLINE> China Further Raises Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China today announced a further
increase in the prices of refined oil products, the fifth price
hike in eight months.
</P>
<P>
A circular issued by the State Development Planning Commission,
which takes immediate effect, said that oil refineries are allowed
to raise the price of gasoline by 200 yuan per ton, and that of
diesel by 180 yuan per ton.
</P>
<P>
The retail prices would be readjusted accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The commission said the price hike is to further attune China's
domestic oil price with the international market and establish a
pricing mechanism that could respond to fluctuations in the
international oil market.
</P>
<P>
The commission urged crude oil producers and refineries to
increase their diesel production to ease the shortage of supply.
</P>
<P>
It warned against any form of illegal hoarding or price hikes
and said that any such activities would result in severe
punishment.

<HEADLINE> Planning Commission on Raise of Refined Oil Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China today announced a further
increase in the prices of refined oil products, the fifth price
hike in eight months.
</P>
<P>
According to a circular by the State Development Planning
Commission with the approval of the State Council, beginning from
July 14, the factory price for gasoline will be raised by 200 yuan
per ton, and that of diesel by 180 yuan per ton.
</P>
<P>
The retail prices would be readjusted accordingly.
</P>
<P>
The five hikes since last November have raised the prices of
gasoline and diesel by 42 percent and 37 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
A commission spokesman said after all the hikes, the prices and
pricing mechanism of China's crude oil and refined oil products is
now finally in tune with the international market.
</P>
<P>
He denied that the price hikes are meant to compensate
refineries' losses, saying they are more the result of market
forces than the government's will.
</P>
<P>
Since April, 1999, the international crude oil price has risen
by 100 percent, and the prices of gasoline and diesel by 62 and 84
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China had become a net oil importer in 1993.
By 1999, the country's crude oil import had exceeded 40 million
tons, accounting for 20 percent of the crude oil processed in
China.
</P>
<P>
Bringing the oil prices in line with international standards is
also a move to prepare for China's accession to the World Trade
Organization, which demands that China open its wholesale and
retail markets for refined oil products, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, internationalized pricing would
force China's refineries to improve their technology and
management.
</P>
<P>
Despite the hikes, the spokesman said China's gasoline price is
still much lower than the level in major industrialized countries
such as the United States, France, the United Kingdom and Japan,
where heavy taxes are imposed on gasoline consumption for
environmental protection or restriction of consumption.
</P>
<P>
He conceded that the consecutive price hikes would have a big
impact on major oil-burning industries and businesses, for which
the government would take different cushioning measures.
</P>
<P>
Such measures, he said, including government allowances for
farming, fishing and forestry sectors, raising railway and
shipping prices, lowering administrative charges on taxies or
raising prices for taxies and buses.
</P>
<P>
Finally, the spokesman warned against any unauthorized or
disguised price hikes and assured that any such activities would
result in severe punishment.

<HEADLINE> Pipeline Fire Rages on in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Firefighters were still working on
Wednesday to put out the oil pipeline fire near Nigeria's
southeast town of Warri, which has left more than 250 people dead.
</P>
<P>
Many more people have suffered serious injuries in the fire
which broke out two days ago at Adeje village, near the town of
Warri in Nigeria's oil-rich Niger delta region.
</P>
<P>
The explosion happened when people were using buckets to
collect petrol flowing from the pipeline after it had been
punctured by thieves on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here from Warri quoted a local senior police
officer as saying that "an exact toll is unlikely to be clear for
some time but we know more than 250 people have died."
</P>
<P>
Doyin Okupe, President Olusegun Obasanjo's spokesman,
reportedly called on Wednesday the disaster an "avoidable tragedy"
and blamed greedy business operators for encouraging dangerous
pipeline vandalism.

<HEADLINE> Doctors Calls to Reduce Mother-to-Child HIV Transmission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF)
, an international humanitarian body of doctors, Wednesday called
for acceleration of programs to reduce mother-to-child
transmission of HIV.
</P>
<P>
"We are carrying out programs to reduce HIV transmission from
mothers to newborns and we know it is working, but we are seeing a
dramatic impact on people's willingness to get tested and their
attitude toward HIV during the existence of these programs," MSF's
South African head Eric Goemaere said at the 13th International
AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Many presentations at the Conference have stressed that such
treatment can be effective in poor countries in Africa, Asia and
Latin America.
</P>
<P>
The question of access to drugs has dominated the meeting of
global AIDS experts, but many delegates also complained that the
political will and funding on national levels have not been
forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
"Why should someone get tested (for HIV) if they have no chance
of accessing treatment?" Goemaere said.
</P>
<P>
He said while some African nations like Cote d'Ivoire, Botswana
and Uganda have shown a determination to implement mother-to-child-
transmission programs and begin expanding anti-retroviral pilot
projects, others remain silent.
</P>
<P>
There is also an urgent need for affordable anti-retroviral
drugs in order to begin the implementation of new treatment
strategies, he said, noting that wealthy nations should make firm
commitments to support national programs which UNAIDS estimated
need an additional 3 billion U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
"The spread of AIDS has been exacerbated by the lack of access
to medicines," Goemaere said, stressing that "95 percent of the 34
million people with HIV/AIDS remain without access to treatment.".

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Help Kenya Combat Famine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said here on Wednesday that the U.S. government had promised to
cover one-third of Kenya's needs in combating famine.
</P>
<P>
Moi made the remarks while addressing the Members of Parliament
representing communities whose livelihood depends on livestock at
his Harambee House Office in downtown Nairobi, the Presidential
Press Service (PPS) said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government has donated 2,500 tons of food including
wheat and rice, valued at approximately 55 million shillings (
about 715,000 U.S. dollars), to Kenya, Moi said, adding that the
greater part of the food has already arrived at the port of
Mombasa while the rest is expected in a few days.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the Italian government had also
committed to the World Food Program approximately 50 million
shillings (about 650,000 dollars) to cover the cost of transport
and distribution.
</P>
<P>
On June 7, Moi appealed to international donors for emergency
food for 3 million Kenyans in 30 districts hit by prolonged
drought, saying that the country needs 150 million dollars to
tackle the crisis, of which food will take 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
Following the appeal by Moi, some 29,000 tons of relief
supplies comprising wheat, sorghum and yellow maize are expected
to arrive in Mombasa this week, the PPS said.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chairman Calls for Establishment of African Peace-keeping Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Zhang Dacheng, Liu Hao
</P>
<P>
LOME, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the 36th Assembly of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) and Togolese President
Gnassingbe Eyadema Thursday called African states to establish an
peace-keeping force in the continent to maintain peace.
</P>
<P>
Eyadema, who was elected OAU chairman early this week, told
Xinhua at his presidential residence that the idea of an African
peace-keeping force, which was first initiated by him at the 1994
summit, has won wide support from African countries during the
just closed summit here.
</P>
<P>
The new OAU chairman stressed that though some African
countries have defense treaty with European countries, but once
there is a turmoil in the African continent, the Europeans are
concerned only with the safety of their soldiers.
</P>
<P>
"Africa must have its own peace-keeping force while the
Europeans can help in logistical support," he said during his
first news conference since the conclusion of the 36th OAU summit.
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming first Sino-African Cooperation Forum to be
held in Beijing this October, Eyadema said he will personally
attend the forum on behalf of the OAU and Togolese government.
</P>
<P>
"I expect to meet my Chinese friends again in the beautiful
city of Beijing," he said.
</P>
<P>
After three-day deliberations, African leaders at the summit
signed on Wednesday a document on establishing an African Union.
</P>
<P>
According to the Draft Constitutive Act of the African Union,
the Union will be officially established until two thirds of the
OAU member states ratify the document.
</P>
<P>
The Union covers a series of political organs including the
assembly, the Executive Council, and the Pan-African Parliament.
</P>
<P>
It will also establish a series of financial institutions
including the African Central Bank, the African Monetary Fund and
the African Investment Bank.
</P>
<P>
Founded on May 25, 1963, the OAU is designated to promote the
unity and solidarity of the African states, defend the sovereignty,
territorial integrity and independence of members, coordinate and
intensify the cooperation and efforts to achieve a better life for
the people of Africa.
</P>
<P>
Following eradicating all forms of colonialism from Africa, the
organization has been focused on peace and development and
reversion of the growing marginalization of Africa in economic
globalization.

<HEADLINE> HIV/AIDS Poses Greatest Ethical Challenge to Society: Researcher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 13 (Xinhua) -- Development of a HIV/AIDS
vaccine and supply of anti-retrovirals to pregnant mothers to
reduce mother-to-child transmission pose as some of the greatest
moral and ethical dilemmas in society, said World Medical Research
Council president William Makgoba on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Makgoba was speaking at the 13th International AIDS Conference
on the ethics of AIDS research in developing countries, where the
spread of the disease has reached alarming proportions with no
possible cure in sight.
</P>
<P>
He said the affordability and sustainabilitty of treatments
within a society that prides itself in human rights and promotes
equity and development has posed great ethical dilemmas.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps no disease has challenged the ethical and moral
principles of a society such as HIV/AIDS," he said.
</P>
<P>
His comments came amid numerous calls at the conference for
greater accessibility to drugs, which are currently unaffordable
to 95 percent of HIV/AIDS sufferers.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, acting South African Constitutional Court judge Edwin
Cameron confirmed that one of the greatest ethical challenges
facing South Africa in particular, is that people, who are
dependent on the public health system, are dying without even the
hope of using medication to prolong their life.
</P>
<P>
Some people are able to afford to "buy life", while millions of
others are dying because they do not have access to drugs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Another moral dilemma for South Africa is the HIV transmission
from mother to babies.
</P>
<P>
Presently, more than 5,000 HIV-positive babies are born in
South Africa every month, and this figure is increasing as there
is no treatment available to infected pregnant mothers who are
looking to the government for help.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision not to provide them with the anti-
retroviral AZT is mainly based on the fact that it is too costly.

ABU DHABI -- Oman's accession to the World Trade Organization
(WTO) could have been speeded up had some key legislations not
taken more time, said a senior official of the world body.
</P>
<P>
There was also lack of expertise on some subjects such as
customs evaluation, the Dubai-based Gulf News daily Friday quoted
Cato Adrian, WTO's counsellor in the accession division, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Oman has met all of the WTO requirements, Adrian said
over the phone from Geneva that a patent law has yet to be enacted
along with some legislations concerning intellectual property.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator, UNICEF Angola Urge Immediate Release of Abducted Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 14(Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Humanitarian Coordinator in Angola and UNICEF(United Nations
Children's Fund) Angola on Friday expressed shock and sadness
over last weekend's attack by a group of about 100 armed bandits
on Children's Town in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The unprovoked crime took place in the evening of July 9 in
Quissala, Huambo Province, Angola, which constituted a gross
violation of Angolan children's rights. It also demonstrated once
again that children are often the prime and most vulnerable
casualties in countries in conflict.
</P>
<P>
During the attack, one sixteen year old boy was killed and
four children between 14 to 16 years of age were injured. These
children are now being treated for their injuries. However, 21
other children between 11 to 18 years of age were abducted by the
bandits and their current welfare and whereabouts are unknown.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Humanitarian Coordinator in Angola and UNICEF Angola
called upon the perpetrators of this crime to ensure the safety
and immediate release of the children who are simply innocent
victims of the precarious security situation that continues to
exist in Angola.
</P>
<P>
This is the second such attack against Children's Town.
Earlier this year in a similar attack, 3 children and 1 guard were
killed and 6 children were injured.
</P>
<P>
 The Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Assistance (
OCHA)in Angola and UNICEF also appealed to both national and
provincial authorities to pay special attention to the protection
of Angola children in such child-oriented environments.
</P>
<P>
 The Children's Town is home to 80 children and youth who
participate in various developmental education, sports and
cultural activities.
</P>
<P>
 UNICEF and OCHA strongly condemned all such violent attacks
against children and on nongovernmental organizations which were
working to improve the already difficult lives faced by many of
Angola's children and youth.

<HEADLINE> Czech Association of Forced Laborers Praises Law on Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Czech Association of Forced
Laborers on Friday praised the German parliament for passing a law
earlier in the day on the compensation of victims of Nazi slave
labor during World War II.
</P>
<P>
"After a year and a half of negotiations with Germany we
finally achieved what we wanted. After 44 years it means not only
financial but also moral compensation," the Czech News Agency
quoted deputy chairman of the association karel Horak as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement reached between Germany and the Czech
Republic, a total of 423 million marks (203 million U.S. dollars)
will be paid to 67,000 victims in the Czech Republic. Those
payments will fall into two categories. Slave laborers detained in
Nazi concentration camps are eligible for 15,000 marks (7,212 U.S.
dollars) per person, while forced laborers can receive a maximum
payment of 5,000 marks (2,404 U.S. dollars) per person.
</P>
<P>
The fund will come from a German compensation foundation named"
Reminder, Responsibility, Future". Horak said the compensation
could begin before the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, between 10 million and 14 million people
were forced to work for Nazi Germany, most of whom were persecuted
to death. In late 1999, the German government and business agreed
to pay 10 billion marks (4.81 billion U.S. dollars) as
compensation to those victims.

<HEADLINE> Chavez Keeps Ahead in Venezuelan Electoral Preferences </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez
preferences rating dropped, but still maintains a wide advantage
over his rivals in the electors preferences for the July 31 voting.
</P>
<P>
Chavez has 48 percent of the voting preferences, compared to
the 50 percent rating he obtained in May, and surpasses his
closest competitor Francisco Arias by 15 points, according to the
poll of the "Mercanalisis" canvassing firm, published Friday by
the press.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan president is not the only one that had a
popularity descent. Also his rivals.
</P>
<P>
Arias went down from 37 to 31 percent in the voters preferences,
having lost six points since May, and Claudio Fermin dropped down
from six to four percent.
</P>
<P>
The undecided voters increased in number from eight to 16
percent, said the poll, made between June 23 and July 2 among 2,
000 persons of the main cities of the country.
</P>
<P>
Mercanalisis attributed the increase in the number of the
undecided to the apathy caused by the cancellation of May 28
elections.
</P>
<P>
Chavez obtained 54 percent of the options, and Arias 35 percent.
Arias, a military man like Chavez, was governor of the oil-rich
Zulia state.
</P>
<P>
The presidency of the republic, the governorships of several
states, mayoralties, deputy chairs in the local congress and
representations in the Andean and Latin American parliaments will
be disputed in the July 30 elections.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Approves Bill Repealing Estate Tax Over 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate approved Friday a
Republican bill that would eliminate estate taxes over the next
decade in defiance of a veto threat by President Bill Clinton who
has called the legislation a tax benefit for the rich.
</P>
<P>
The Senate passed the bill by a vote of 59-39, which would
completely eliminate the estate tax by 2010 at a cost of about 105
billion U.S. dollars in government revenue. The vote was well
short of the two-thirds necessary to override a veto.
</P>
<P>
Republican supporters said the estate tax, which reaches a top
rate of 55 percent, hinders investment and job creation, forces
millions of people to do costly estate planning and particularly
hurts farmers and small businesses.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which passed the House in June, would cut the top 55
percent estate tax rate in 2001 and then gradually phase out all
other rates, with full repeal coming in 2010. The cost was
estimated at 105 billion dollars during the phaseout, ballooning
to 750 billion dollars in the decade after repeal would be in
effect fully.
</P>
<P>
Republicans said the government's revenue loss would be
cushioned somewhat because the bill changes the way assets are
valued, known as basis, so that an heir would owe higher capital-
gains taxes than under current law once an inherited asset is sold.
Capital-gains tax rates, however, are much lower than estate tax
rates.
</P>
<P>
Democrats said the big cost of repeal and the fact that heirs
of only 2 percent of people who die pay estate taxes was evidence
that Republicans wanted mainly to help the rich. In 1997, for
example, only 43,000 estates out of 2.7 million adult deaths were
subject to the estate tax.
</P>
<P>
But the Senate voted 53-46 against a Democratic substitute
costing 64 billion dollars over 10 years that would have sharply
raised estate tax exemptions, now 675,000 dollars per individual,
particularly for the farmers and small businesses that are hurt
the most.
</P>
<P>
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle said Clinton would certainly
veto the bill and that Democrats would be able to sustain it.
</P>
<P>
Both sides used the debate to highlight some of their other tax
cut priorities. In some cases, the votes were intended mainly for
political consumption by senators up for re-election this year.

<HEADLINE> Annan Looks Forward to New Effort Despite Bleak View of Western Sahara Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- While offering a rather
bleak assessment of the current status of talks on the dispute
over Western Sahara, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Friday
expressed the hope for some progress at the forthcoming meetings
of experts and recommended a three-month extension of the U.N.
mission in Western Sahara.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report on Western Sahara to the Security Council,
Annan said that despite the efforts of his personal Envoy, James
Baker III, there had been no progress during the June 28 meeting
in London in resolving any of the multiple problems impending the
implementation of the 1988 settlement plan.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said the meeting, instead of resolving
the problems, had moved things backwards, with parties, Morocco
and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Saguia el-Hamra and
Rio de Oro, restating their known positions without showing any
willingness to bridge the differences.
</P>
<P>
"They both insisted on a 'winner-take-all approach' and did
not appear willing to discuss a solution where each would get some,
but not all, of what each wanted," Annan said in the report.
</P>
<P>
"Nor did they appear disposed to put aside mutual animosity and
begin to negotiate a political solution that would resolve their
dispute over Western Sahara," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that a political solution was far more preferable
than a breakdown of the process which might lead to a return to
hostilities, the Secretary-General suggested that "the Security
Council reflect on the problem of ensuring that the results of the
referendum, were one to be held, are respected by the parties."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Annan expressed the hope that the upcoming
expert-level meeting in Geneva meetings would yield progress on
the questions regarding appeals, prisoners of war and refugees.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the Secretary-General recommended that the
Security Council extend the mandate of the United Nations Mission
for a Referendum in Western Sahara until October 31, 2000.

fate -- they must go back to their country.

"Lebanon's position on the problem of Palestinian refugees,

He also said all refugees that were expelled since 1948 should
be allowed to return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
The president had pointed out before Israel's withdrawal from
south Lebanon on May 24 that the existence of Palestinian refugees
in Lebanon is "a security problem."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon refused to give Israel any security guarantees after its
unilateral pullout because thousands of armed Palestinian refugees
in Lebanon "ask for the right to go back."
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are 350,000 Palestinian refugees
living in 12 camps in Lebanon. Most of them were forced out in 1948
when Israel was established.

<HEADLINE> 2,933 Hectares of Forests Devoured by Flame in Turkey Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 2,933 hectares of forests
were burnt down to ashes in 58 separate fires throughout Turkey on
Thursday, one of the hottest days in the country in decades, said
the Forestry Ministry on Friday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, all the fire spots, mostly kindled by heat, were
brought under control now, Anatolia News Agency quoted ministry
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
A heat wave has been hitting Turkey for days with its climax so
far appearing on Thursday, when the average temperature reached 40
degrees Celsius, the hottest day in the last three decades.
</P>
<P>
In several western and southwestern woods-intensive provinces
such as Yalova, Bandirma, Kocaeli and Izmir, the temperature
reached 45.4 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that in Buldan town in western Aegean province
of Denizli alone, 1,050 hectares of forests were devoured by flame.
</P>
<P>
Forestry Minister Nami Cagan is expected to visit the town later
on Friday, Anatolia said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said a total of 9,601 hectares of forested area
were burnt down in 722 separate spots throughout the country
between January 1 and July 13 of this year, as compared to 1,021
hectares of forested area burnt down in 659 fires in the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has warned people against forest fires during their
tour in summer holidays.

</P>
<P>
"The nature of the encroachments shows that they can be

</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports from the U.N. headquarters in New York said
Lebanon has formally asked the Security Council for another six-
month routine extension of the mandate of the United Nations
Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) as of July 31.

<HEADLINE> Village Deaths Raise Mad Cow Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Friday it had
launched an urgent inquiry into why a handful of people linked to
one small village had all died from "Mad Cow" disease.
</P>
<P>
Junior Health Minister Lord Hunt confirmed there had been four
definite cases and a probable case of new variant of Creutzfeldt-
Jacob Disease (vCJD) in the county, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Health is conducting research at the village
of Queniborough, central England, to determine if people in the
area are more susceptible to the disease.
</P>
<P>
Three deaths have been linked to the village, according to
local health authority officials.
</P>
<P>
Lord Hunt said the cases are unlikely to be a statistical quirk.
</P>
<P>
The human form of BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy),
claimed three lives in Leicestershire, central England, within 12
weeks in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Glen Day, 35, from Queniborough, and Pamela Beyless, 24, from
nearby Glenfield, died in October. Stacey Robinson, 19, formerly
of Queniborugh, died two-months earlier in August.
</P>
<P>
In May this year, a 19-year-old man died at the Leicester Royal
Infirmary from the disease and, at the time, health officials said
it was "highly probable" that a 24-year-old man in the county also
had it.
</P>
<P>
Lord Hunt said the investigation into the cluster includes a
large team of officials from bodies such as the National CJD
Surveillance Unit.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released 10 days ago by the Department of Health
show there have now been 74 victims of vCJD, including four new
cases in June.
</P>
<P>
There have also been two confirmed deaths in France and one in
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
VCJD is both mentally and physically degenerative. It leads to
vacuoles, or holes, in the brain and cannot, as yet, be cured.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms can include depression, blurred vision, slurred speech,
sometimes aggressiveness, followed by loss of control over limbs
and eventually of the entire body.

<HEADLINE> N.Ireland Orangemen Split over Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Portadown Orangemen in Northern
Ireland Friday rejected a call from the Grand Master of the Orange
Order to end street protests as part of their Drumcree march
campaign.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, Grand Master Robert Saulters said the Order
was in danger of losing public support over the protests around
Northern Ireland - which have often dissolved into violence in the
past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
Saulters said it was now time for the Order to reflect on its
position.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the 20 foot high steel barrier which prevented
loyalist protesters on Drumcree hill forcing their way into the
mainly nationalist Garvaghy Road area, has been dismantled.
</P>
<P>
The miles of razor and barbed wire stretched out in the fields
alongside the barrier, were also removed by soldiers early on
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Saulters told BBC that any future protests should be maintained
only on Drumcree hill.
</P>
<P>
Saulters was responding to a further call from Portadown
District Lodge for more street demonstrations in support of their
protest over being barred from marching down the mainly
nationalist Garvaghy Road for the third year running.
</P>
<P>
After a 48-hour break in the violence and disorder for the
traditional July 12, Portadown Orangemen said they were calling
for more "sporadic peaceful protests" on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary said a
strong security force presence would be maintained at Drumcree and
that the measures could be reinstalled at any time if necessary.
</P>
<P>
The past week has seen tourism and industry suffer as many
towns across Northern Ireland were paralyzed by loyalist road
blocks in support of the Drumcree stand-off.
</P>
<P>
And protests degenerated into violence when other elements took
over at night, shooting at and petrol bombing security forces,
hijacking and burning cars and wrecking property.
</P>
<P>
Police and soldiers have begun dismantling the security
fortifications and barbed wire in place at Drumcree and in
Portadown for over a week but an RUC spokesman said a strong
police and military presence would be maintained in the area and
the barriers could be quickly re-erected if necessary.

<HEADLINE> Sustained Growth Brings Tax Cuts to C$ 6 Billion: Scotiabank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Sustained economic growth will
bring Canada's tax cuts to more than 6 billion Canadian dollars (
about 4.1 billion U.S. dollars) this year, one of the country's
leading banks forecast.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Nova Scotia said in a report reaching here Friday
that with the expansion of national revenues, the country could
afford a total of 6.1 billion Canadian dollars, of which 3.3
billion (about 2.2 billion U.S. dollars) will be at the federal
level and 2.8 billion(about 1.9 billion U.S. dollars) at the
provincial level.
</P>
<P>
The report came after the federal government said Thursday that
its revenues were up 11.2 percent as of April this year, compared
with a year ago, with its budget surplus reaching 2.7 billion
Canadian dollars (about 1.8 billion U.S. dollars) in April.
</P>
<P>
The bank expects the country's overall growth rate to be at 4.
5 percent this year and to moderate to a more sustainable 3.2
percent in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Ontario, the most populous and richest province in the country,
is estimated to reach a growth rate of 5.2 percent for this year
and 3.3 percent for next year.
</P>
<P>
Alberta will lead the country in the growth with a rate of 6.2
percent this year and 4 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Economic growth in Quebec will be 3.8 percent this year and 3
percent next, while the Atlantic region is predicted to have a
rate of 3 percent for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The bank report illustrates a rosy picture of Canada's economy
in years to come as one with low interest rates, low inflation and
a sustained booming rate to encourage consumer confidence.

<HEADLINE> Russia Protests French Seizure of Sailing Vessel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Russia lodged a strong protest
Friday with France over its seizure of a Russian sailing vessel a
day earlier.
</P>
<P>
Moscow "has demanded that measures be taken immediately for the
release of this vessel," the Russian Foreign Ministry said in a
report on its protest with the French ambassador to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Russia "views these steps as illegal and causing further
serious damage to Russian- French relations," the Interfax news
agency quoted the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The French side bears all responsibility for the consequences
of these actions."
</P>
<P>
The "Sedov," a training sailboat that arrived in the French
port city of Brest to take part in an international regatta at the
French authorities' invitation, was seized by a local bailiff.
</P>
<P>
The move was believed to be related to a lawsuit brought by the
Swiss company Noga that is pressing for the payment of debts by
the Russian government, Russian media said.
</P>
<P>
The French authorities consider the vessel as part of Russian
state property and therefore liable to seizure under the lawsuit,
Interfax quoted sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry vowed to "continue to persistently
urge the French authorities to take prompt steps to end this
judicial arbitrariness and violation of fundamental principles of
international rights in relation to Russian diplomatic
representations and Russian property in France."
</P>
<P>
"Paris was not deterred by either the exceptionally
humanitarian nature of the vessel's journey or that young students
are aboard."
</P>
<P>
The Russian students were left to celebrate France's national
holiday, July 14, under arrest, the Foreign Ministry noted
ironically, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Airport Staff Testifies at Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A Maltese airport
supervisor on Friday testified at the Lockerbie trial that an
unaccompanied suitcase could have been placed aboard a flight from
the Mediterranean island state to Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
Wilfred Borg, who was the general manager for ground handling
operations at the Luqa airport in Malta, denied that the records
of unidentified luggage produced by the prosecution indicate a
violation of airport safety procedures.
</P>
<P>
Borg was questioned for hours by the prosecutors about safety
check-ups at the Maltese airport. But he said that an airplane's
captain has to make the final call on safety of his craft.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutor Alan Turnbull pointed out a number of discrepancies
in Air Malta's luggage loading logs in 1988 and that access to
loading areas could have breached the airport's safety rules.
</P>
<P>
Defendants, Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fhimah, who worked for the Libyan Arab Airlines in Malta at that
time, were accused of placing a bomb within an unaccompanied
suitcase which was then transferred in Frankfurt onto the New York-
bound Pan Am Flight 103.
</P>
<P>
The mid-air explosion of the airliner over the Scottish town of
Lockerbie killed all 259 people on board and 11 others on the
ground on December 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
Both defendants denied the charges of conspiracy of murder and
breaching of international aircraft safety regulations.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie trial went underway on May 3 after almost 12
years of investigation and preparation and is expected to last up
to a year. If convicted, the two Libyans have to serve their life
sentence in Scotland. If the prosecution could not prove its case
beyond reasonable doubt, the two Libyans would then be set free.
</P>
<P>
The Scottish court on Dutch soil had to adjourn for one day
after a group of Maltese witnesses refused to travel to central
Netherlands to testify on airport security. The court resumed on
Friday.

<HEADLINE> VersaTel Applies for UMTS Auction in Belgium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Dutch telecoms network
VersaTel on Friday announced that it had applied to join the
auction of third-generation mobile phone licenses in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Belgium has planned to open its auction of four Universal
Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) licenses in the coming
September and the licenses will be offered in December.
</P>
<P>
VersaTel is rolling out a fiber optic network of some 2,200
kilometers in the Benelux region that includes Belgium, Luxembourg
and the Netherlands, offering small and medium-sized enterprises
broadband high-speed access to the Internet to facilitate e-
commerce.
</P>
<P>
UMTS offers telecommunications speed 40 times higher than the
that of the existing GSM system.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch firm is at the moment one of the six bidders for five
Dutch UMTS licenses that will allow mobile phone users to download
videos and to access the Internet.
</P>
<P>
It is the only bidder in the Dutch auction without mobile phone
assets.
</P>
<P>
Around 14 European countries are hoping to garner around 100
billion euro (95 billion U.S. dollars) from the auctions of
licenses for the third-generation mobile phone services, also
known as 3G.
</P>
<P>
By Friday, the Dutch auction of 3G mobile phone licenses that
started on July 6 has raised 510 million euro (484.5 million
dollars). Dutch Finance Minister Gerrit Zalm expected to raise 20
billion Dutch guilders from the auction or the equivalent of 9.1
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is the second country in Europe after Britain
to have auctioned licenses for the 3G services. The British
government in April netted 22.5 billion pounds (34 billion dollars)
from the auction awards of five UMTS licenses.

<HEADLINE> Mother May Set Your Body Clock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The reason that jet lag hits
some travelers hard and barely fazes others may lie in our mother'
s genes, the journal Science reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
A French study on circadian clocks, which regulate the body's
daily cycles, found that female zebrafish "set" the clocks of
their young before birth.
</P>
<P>
Scientists who conducted the study at the Ecole Normale
Superieure found that a key component of the circadian clock
starts "ticking" in Zebrafish eggs even before they are fertilized.
The gene's activity keeps the same rhythm as the animal develops.
</P>
<P>
"These findings were quite a surprise. The current belief is
that circadian rhythms need a developed brain, so they don't get
started until later," said Vincent Laudet, co-author of the
Science paper.
</P>
<P>
Variations in certain maternal genes may therefore affect how
easily the body's time-keeping system adjusts to changes in the
day/night cycle, the study showed.
</P>
<P>
Researchers said it was unclear how closely related the study
was to humans.
</P>
<P>
The next step is to find out just how much of the circadian
clock is inherited in assembled form. Laudet and his colleagues
did find another gene, for example, that does not seem to
participate in the circadian cycle until later in development.

MOSCOW, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Fires killed 7,995 people and
wounded 6,893 others across Russia in the first six months of the
year, the Itar-Tass news agency reported Friday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Banks in 4 EU Countries Warned of Cartel Practice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A total of 109 banks in four
European Union countries were warned on Friday that investigation
would be underway for their cartel practices.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive body of the 15-nation
bloc, released a list of these banks which have received
statements of objections in relation to a cartel investigation
into the fixing of charges for exchanging currencies in the euro
zone.
</P>
<P>
Such statements are a step in anti-trust proceedings but do not
pre-judge the final outcome of the investigation, commission
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-six banks in Belgium, seven in Finland, nine in Ireland
and 27 in Portugal have been sorted out by the commission for the
investigation. Banks and other recipients of the statements have
until early October to reply to the commission's objections.
</P>
<P>
The statements present documentary evidence to the fact that
the listed banks and banking associations in these four countries
have fixed the prices for the exchange of euro zone currencies.
</P>
<P>
If confirmed by investigation, the practice will constitute an
infringement of the European Union's Amsterdam treaty. The treaty
prohibits cartels and other concerted practices harmful for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
The commission is also investigating other banks in other euro
zone countries and is expected to release the list of those banks
and banking associations as well.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Gore Still Haunted by Fund-raising Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, at her weekly press briefing
Thursday, confirmed that she has received a recommendation from
Justice Department prosecutor Robert Conrad to name a special
counsel to investigate whether Gore told truth about the fund-
raising activities.
</P>
<P>
Though Reno is yet to decide whether to name a special counsel,
Conrad's recommendation has posed new problems for Gore, who has
struggled to get his presidential campaign on track before the
November election. Gore has trailed Republican rival George W.
Bush in public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation from Conrad, chief of the Justice Department
's campaign finance reform, has not only held ominous implications
for Gore but also put Reno in an awkward situation. Reno has
struggled to bring an end to the fund-raising case, having twice
refused to submit Gore to the scrutiny of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
Last month, in an effort to defuse the controversy, Gore
released a transcript of the April interview with the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in which he denied taking part in an
illegal fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in California.
</P>
<P>
Law enforcement officials said Gore's answers appeared to
provide little evidence of wrongdoing to justify referring the
case to an outside independent counsel, a step that they said Reno
would take only if there was evidence that Gore had deliberately
lied to a conceal a relevant fact.
</P>
<P>
Since the expiration of the independent counsel law, Reno has
named only one special counsel. She appointed former Senator John
Danforth, a Missouri Republican, to investigate allegations of
wrongdoing by the FBI during the agency's 1993 tear gas assault on
the Branch Davidian compound near Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
Gore's release of the 123-page interview transcript has quieted
some of the criticism, but his political rivals will definitely
not let him go without wounding him as the election is drawing
near, analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The decision whether to appoint an independent counsel will
risk prolonging an issue that has dogged Gore's presidential
campaign and threaten to bring renewed comparisons to the scandals
of the Clinton administration, the analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Military Reveals Peacekeeper Thuggery in Haiti </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Canadian military has revealed
cases of thuggery involving some Canadian soldiers sent to Haiti
on peace-keeping mission in 1997.
</P>
<P>
An investigation report made public here Friday said those
soldiers of a United Nations peace-keeping force intimidated and
assaulted local Haitians who infiltrated military camps.
</P>
<P>
In one case, several soldiers in Nine Platoon of the Van Doos
blindfolded, assaulted and threatened Haitian civilians who were
captured while trying to infiltrate their camp.
</P>
<P>
On another occasion, a Haitian intruder was caught and forced
to keel on rocky ground.
</P>
<P>
Two soldiers being charged of assault have testified that they
were under orders from their commanding officer to engage in "
tactical interrogation" and to intimidate infiltrators.
</P>
<P>
The worst case took place in the early 1990s, when a member of
the now disbanded Canadian Air-borne Regiment tortured and beat a
16-year-old child named Shidane Arone, who later died from his
wounds, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The actions led a military police officer to submit a report of
the events directly to National Defense Headquarters in Ottawa. In
response, the Canadian Forces national Investigation Service
deployed an investigation team to Haiti to for the probe of the
Thuggery cases.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Wholesale Prices Surge 0.6 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- U.S. wholesale prices rose 0.6
percent in June, led by the biggest jump in gasoline and other
energy costs in three months and a record increase in residential
natural gas prices, the Labor Department reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The increase of the department's Producer Price Index, which
measures inflation pressures before they reach consumers, came
after prices were flat in May. The advance in June marked the
biggest increase in wholesale prices since a 0.9 percent rise in
March.
</P>
<P>
In June, all energy prices rose 5.1 percent, the biggest
increase since March, and followed a 0.5 percent drop in May.
Gasoline prices rose 11.8 percent, also the largest increase since
March. Residential natural gas costs increased by a record 5.7
percent last month, surpassing the previous record gain set in
January 1997.
</P>
<P>
Rising energy prices eclipsed falling prices for food, which
declined by 0.3 percent, the steepest decrease since October. In
May, food prices fell 0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Excluding the volatile energy and food categories, the "core"
rate of inflation at the wholesale level fell an unexpected 0.1
percent in June, the best showing since January, suggesting that
most other prices were well-behaved. In May, core prices rose 0.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, wholesale prices have been rising at an
annual rate of 4.8 percent, compared with a 3 percent gain for all
of 1999. The pickup in this year's wholesale prices largely
reflects rising energy costs.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates six times over
the last year to slow economic growth and keep inflation under
control.
</P>
<P>
In another report, the Commerce Department said that retail
sales rose by a slightly bigger-than-expected 0.5 percent in June,
but excluding the volatile automobiles category sales rose just 0.
2 percent, weaker than expectations.

<HEADLINE> Germany Oks Deepest Tax Cut in History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bundesrat (upper house) of
Germany on Friday approved a tax reform bill which will amount to
the deepest reduction in the country's modern history.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, which was proposed by the coalition
government of the Social Democrat Party and the Green party and
already passed through the Bundestag (lower house), was approved
by 41 of 69 votes in the Bundesrat, more than the 35 ballots
necessary.
</P>
<P>
The clear majority emerged in the upper house, which is
composed by representatives from the states, after five coalition-
led states were promised financial help from the federal
government and swung to the approval of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Claiming a "great day for Germany", Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said following the voting that the legislation, which is
to enter effect from the beginning of next year, will provide
precondition for continued economic growth and further reduction
in unemployment.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Hans Eichel estimated that the measures in
the legislation will lead to an overall reduction of 60 billion
Deutsche Marks in company and personal taxes from 2001 to 2005.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Starts 2002 World Cup Qualifier against Guatemala </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. men's soccer team will
open its bid for the 2002 World Cup on the road against Guatemala
on Sunday with much pressure as Guatemala put the game in the
heart of its most passionate fan base in the town of Mazatenango.
</P>
<P>
"For Central American countries, these games are big, not only
for their players but also for the whole country," said U.S. head
coach Bruce Arena, "They have great pressure on them so they rise
to the occasion, both on the field and in the stands, and that
makes it more difficult for the visitors."
</P>
<P>
Arena who took the helm of the U.S. national squad after the
1998 World Cup in France, is 5-1-3 this year and 12-5-7 in two
years, warning that the passion of the Guatemalan fans could have
a big impact on the game.
</P>
<P>
"These people live for these games, and it's a cultural
expirence that's second to none," said Arena whose squad will play
six games over the next four months as part of a four-team
semifinal group for teams from the North and Central America and
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
From the region, the top two teams from each of the three
groups will advance to the next year's six-nation final round,
from which three will qualify for the 2002 World Cup. Mexico and
the United States are heavily favored to make it, with the last
bid considered up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
After failing to qualify for the World Cup between 1950 and
1990, the United States has participated in the past three
tournaments, including the 1994 edition as the hosts, and was
aiming for the fourth straight outing despite the last-place
finish in France.

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Olympic Bid Leaders Spurn Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Two Salt Lake Olympic bid
committee leaders rejected a plea-bargain offer from the U.S.
Justice Department on Thursday, leaving federal prosecutors to
plot their next move in the corruption probe and Olympic officials
to hope there's not a drawn-out trial that coincides with the 2002
Games.
</P>
<P>
Tom Welch and Dave Johnson, who led Salt Lake's successful bid,
turned down the government's offer to plead guilty to charges of
tax evasion, reportedly because they felt the charges were too
sweeping.
</P>
<P>
Federal prosecutors can make a new offer, or they can seek
indictments as the Olympics are 19 months away.
</P>
<P>
The Salt Lake scandal, in which the International Olympic
Committee members voting for the 2002 host city received 1.2
million US dollars in trips, gifts and scholarships, is in its
19th month.
</P>
<P>
"I don't want to put pressure on any party, but I hope the
discussions could lead to a resolution that would not involve a
lengthy, painful trial," said Salt Lake Olympic Committee
president Mitt Romnye.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Thailand Eyes Agriculture As Key for Sustainable Development  By Yuan Li </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Southeast Asian financial
crisis made Thailand realize that a strong agricultural sector
could help guarantee social stability and sustain development, a
senior Thai agriculture ministry official told Xinhua in an
interview recently.
</P>
<P>
"The costly economic crisis taught us that if not for the
strong agricultural sector Thailand would have fallen into a
disaster as some of our neighboring countries had experienced,"
said Ampon Kittiampon, assistant permanent secretary of
agriculture and cooperatives ministry.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is Southeast Asia's most successful agricultural
exporter. Besides being the world's leading rice exporter, it's
also the world's largest exporter of canned pineapple and
processed tuna. The country also ranks in the top 10 in frozen
chicken export.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Thailand's total agricultural exports brought in 6.75
billion U.S. dollars, accounting for almost 20 percent of total
exports value.
</P>
<P>
Sufficient grain supply guaranteed food security for Thailand
during the economic crisis beginning in the summer of 1997, and
thus laid a foundation for social stability, Ampon said.
</P>
<P>
"Just imagine what will happen when a country's currency was
devalued by 100 percent and it needs to import food. What will
happen when people are hungry?" he asked.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural sector was also proved to be the one that offered
the most abundant opportunities of employment during the crisis
years, he noted.
</P>
<P>
When the crisis occurred and people were laid off from
factories, they went back to their villages and cultivated their
fields. "Once people have enough food, they will not take to the
street to demonstrate," said the 45-year-old senior official.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Thailand's strong agricultural sector also
contributed a lot to the country's faster-than-expected recovery
from the crisis, Ampon said, citing that stable food prices helped
relieve the pressure of inflation and outstanding export
performance of agricultural sector earned precious foreign
exchange for the country in the hard times.
</P>
<P>
Working in the ministry for more than 20 years, the western-
educated technocrat with a doctorate degree in applied economics
loves agriculture and farmers. He refers to agriculture not only
as a sector producing money but also a sector helping preserving
natural resources and social and cultural traditions.
</P>
<P>
"Agriculture is a mark of civilization for the mankind. It is
beyond economy. It is a part of our society, and a part of our
culture," said Ampon.
</P>
<P>
However, during the booming years, resources were directed away
from agriculture to industry and services.
</P>
<P>
"Bearing in mind a booming picture of industrial development
and foreign investment inflow, we jumped into the industrial
sector and neglected the real need of the majority of our people --
farmers," Ampon said.
</P>
<P>
Though agriculture accounts for only 12 percent of Thailand's
gross domestic products, about 60 percent of Thais depend on
agriculture for at least part of their income.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, the Thai government reviewed its
agricultural policies and came to realize the importance of
agriculture in promoting the living standard of farmers and
sustaining the country's development, Ampon said.
</P>
<P>
The government tries to balance the need for strengthening the
country's agricultural competitiveness in the world market and the
need for safeguarding food security.
</P>
<P>
To do so, Ampon said, the national agricultural policies were
divided into two parts. One part focuses on research and
development, seed improvement and products standardization to
promote exports while the other part focuses on infrastructure
development to ensure the basic needs of the farmers.
</P>
<P>
The government is also paying more attention to training
farmers in agricultural technology transfer, he said.
</P>
<P>
Though already the top 10th exporter of agricultural products
in the world, Thailand still needs to improve the quality of
products to expand its market share, Ampon said. "We have to
strengthen research and development, cooperatives system and help
farmers to gain better access to information and technology."
</P>
<P>
Thailand exported rice worth 73.8 billion baht (1.9 billion U.S.
dollars) in 1999, but only 40 percent of its annual crop is of
export grade.
</P>
<P>
Experts say investment in better seed quality and irrigation
could double yields, and hence export revenues.
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to decentralize its power and
encourage communities and villages to play more active roles in
agricultural production than before, Ampon said, adding that the
farmers will be more involved in the decision-making process.
</P>
<P>
Being a representative of the Thai government in the
negotiations of the Uruguay round and the World Trade Organization
(WTO) since 1988, Ampon pointed out that though the WTO is
important it is more important for a country to be itself, which
means the country's policies should not be influenced by the rules
of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
"I don't care about the WTO rules. Consumer is the king," he
said, adding that the key to expand agricultural exports is to be
more consumer-sensitive and to turn out products which can satisfy
different demands of different consumers.

<HEADLINE> Manila Urges Payatas Residents to Get out of Dumpsite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Health authorities
reiterated Friday their appeal to residents of Payatas, Quezon
City of Metro Manila to evacuate the dumpsite lest they get sick
from the fumes being emitted by the huge pile of garbage.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Alberto Romualdez of the Department of Health said
many people staying in the vicinity of the area, where over a
hundred squatters were buried in an avalanche of garbage on Monday
are in danger of inhaling toxic fumes.
</P>
<P>
"Those near the disaster site are in danger. We've advised
local officials and residents to get out of the area," Romualdez
said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Even rescue and health workers in the area, he said, are
allowed to be exposed only from 30 minutes to one hour at a time.
</P>
<P>
Also, Romualdez said he will send a team to check reports that
seepage from Payatas has contaminated Metro Manila's drinking
water source.
</P>
<P>
As of Friday afternoon, the number of people killed in the
dumpsite has climbed to 144 while 60 people were injured,
according to a report of the National Disaster Coordinating
Council (NDCC).
</P>
<P>
The NDCC said rescuers have found 59 survivors in the dumpsite,
adding that 496 families or 2,280 persons have been evacuated to
safe places.
</P>
<P>
However, the council declined to make an estimation on how many
people might still be buried in the avalanche. Some reports said
nearly 200 people remain missing.
</P>
<P>
There were about 50,000 people residing in Payatas. The open
dumpsite was scheduled to be closed in 1999, but the closure was
held back for lack of an alternative disposal site for Quezon City
's more than 700 tons of daily garbage.
</P>
<P>
Due to a week of continuous monsoon rains, the tons of garbage
must have loosened which resulted in its erosion and eventually
became a landslide, said some experts.

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:

<P>
-- U.S. Congress voted Thursday to increase U.S. funding for
international debt relief and AIDS funding for poor countries.

current health and economic crises.
</P>

The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- A tentative deal has been reached in the U.S. House of
Representatives on a bitterly fought bill to ban most forms of
gambling on the Internet, clearing the way for a floor vote as

Midwest.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Just hours after the Sprint-Worldcom merger was officially
called off Thursday, Sprint's CEO William Esrey said he is not

<HEADLINE> Canada Willing to Recognize DPRK, Says Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Canada is willing to officially
recognize the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) as
early as possible, Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy told
Canadian media Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Answering an telephone interview from Ottawa after a meeting of
foreign ministers from G-8 countries in Miyazaki, Japan, Axworthy
disclosed in Tokyo that a decision could come as early as this
weekend after a briefing from a Canadian diplomat touring the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that there was consensus during the meeting
that it was time to take advantage of the momentum of peace after
the recent summit meeting between the North and South of the
Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
"We're taking it one step at a time, but what I get from
talking to people in the region is that there is a window here to
open up with North Korea (DPRK). And I believe Canada, as it has
done in many areas around the world, can play a constructive role
in this matter," said Axworthy.
</P>
<P>
The minister is expected to receive a briefing from Margaret
Huber, director-general for North Asia and the Pacific at the
Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
</P>
<P>
"Depending on the outcome of that, I'll be in touch with the
prime minister and we can then decide whether to normalize or not,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
Canada has not officially recognized the DPRK since the Korean
War broke out in 1950.

<HEADLINE> Living Buddha Carrying Forward Buddhism in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Amid the sound of Buddhist horns and
the chanting of sutras, a two-year-old Tibetan boy mounted the
Buddhist throne today to perform his duties as the seventh Raichen
living Buddha.
</P>
<P>
Soinam Puncog, the descendant of a herdsman, was tonsured at
the Johkang Monastery on January 16 this year. He is expected to
become a Buddhist abbot in Tibet after years of study.
</P>
<P>
Tibet has trained a great number of these reincarnated "soul
boys" or living Buddhas, who are charged with carrying forward the
1,300-year-old traditions of Tibetan Buddhism from generation to
generation.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978, over 50 living buddhas have been sent to the China
Advanced Institute of Tibetan Buddhism in Beijing, where they work
toward the Gexe Degree in Buddhism. They have returned to various
lamaseries in Tibet after graduation and are playing key roles
there.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 3,270 young lamas are studying at Buddhist
schools in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In Sera Monastery, one of the three key monasteries in Tibet,
hundreds of young lamas attended a debate on Buddhist scriptures
one day this month.
</P>
<P>
Gexi Qamba Yixi, a 70-year-old abbot, said Sera has 900 lamas
coming from all parts of Tibet. They listen to Buddhist lectures
from 10 a.m. to noon each day, discuss the sutras in the afternoon,
and exchange views with the tutors in the evening.
</P>
<P>
What the young lamas do at Sera Monastery nowadays is part of
the experience of all living Buddha in Tibet. They study for years
in hopes of getting the Lharamba Gexe Degree, the highest degree
in Lamaist scholarship. They must resist all sorts of temptation
and practice Buddhism for life.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year-old Bainqen Erdeni Qoigyijabu, the 11th Panchen
Lama, has been a living Buddha since he ascended the holy throne
in accordance with historical conventions and rigid Buddhist
rituals.
</P>
<P>
With the help of tutors, the young Panchen Lama is now able to
recite Buddhist sutras for three days and nights at a stretch. In
addition, he has studied subjects other than Buddhism, and has
gradually become a leader of Buddhist believers in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 352 living Buddhas in Tibet. The two
unchosen candidates for the position of 11th Panchen Lama are
still practicing Buddhism there. One of them, Gawang Nanzui, has
become the reincarnation of the Qiongpo living Buddha.

NANNING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China's first wild monkey festival

<HEADLINE> China's T-Bond Market Weekly Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China's treasury bond market rose
this week as all but one bonds picked up by 0.26 yuan on average.
</P>
<P>
According to Beijing-based financial advisory company Homeway,
the interest rate on repo transactions corrected as the number of
IPOs decreased over last week.
</P>
<P>
Bond 009905 (3.28 percent, due 2007) and bond 009908 (3.30
percent, due 2009) both picked up by about 0.30 yuan to create new
record highs. Bond 010004 turned out to be a focus on the market
by ending the week at 102.19 yuan, 0.15 yuan above the highest
level of 102.04 yuan that it once briefly touched on June 28. It
was the most active performer on the market this week, boasting
the largest turnover and prospects of further rise through next
week.
</P>
<P>
The three old bonds, 009704, 009905 and 009908, fluctuated
within narrow ranges through this week. Homeway analysts say that
the three bonds may stop slipping because of comparatively high
yields. They predict that the other three bonds listed after 1999
are very likely to continue to move upward in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Since less new stocks were issued this week than in last week,
capital supply on the market was somewhat eased. As a result,
China's repo market stayed quiet for the week. The average
interest rate on repo transactions fell to about 3.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> Enterprises Urged to Review Production Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government today urged
domestic enterprises to pay more attention to production safety.
</P>
<P>
Production in Chinese enterprises is rife with problems,
according to results from a recent inspection organized jointly by
the State Economic and Trade Commission (SETC), the Ministry of
Public Security, the Ministry of Supervision and the All-China
Federation of Trade Unions.
</P>
<P>
Three deadly accidents, each claiming more than ten lives, have
occurred in south China's Guangdong Province since October last
year.
</P>
<P>
Other notable examples included the June 22 air crash in
central China's Hubei Province, the June 22 Yangtze River
shipwreck in southwest China's Sichuan Province, the June 30
fireworks explosion in Jiangmen City in south China's Guangdong
Province, and an explosion at the Dianjiang fireworks factory in
Chongqing Municipality.
</P>
<P>
Li Rongrong, vice-minister of the SETC, today blamed these
occurrences on the fact that some local and department leaders and
enterprise executives have been more interested in making money
than guaranteeing safety on the job, and also because their job
responsibilities have never been made clear.
</P>
<P>
He said China attaches great importance to production safety in
State-owned enterprises, but an increasing number of accidents
have been reported in non-government and township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Early statistics show that the number of industrial accidents
and casualties were on the decline from last winter through May of
this year, in a year-on-year comparison.

<HEADLINE> Expert Suggests State Protection for Key Technologies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A delegate to the ongoing third
national conference of China Intellectual Property Society (CIPS)
today suggested that the country should consider state protection
for key technologies invented by Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Xu Ruide, a senior engineer with Shanghai Hualian
Pharmaceutical Company, proposed that a system of state-owned
patents be introduced, which could effectively safeguard the
country's technological edge and even national security.
</P>
<P>
According to Xu, state-owned patented technologies include
those which are funded by the state, transferred from domestic and
overseas individuals, applied by the governmental bodies, and
concerning national secrets.
</P>
<P>
The system of state-owned patents is a supplementary legal
measure for developing countries which have less intellectual
property awareness as well as less economic strength, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
If technological competition among various nations is further
heated, the system could be used by many countries, including
developed ones, the engineer said.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary for China to adjust its patent legal system
for comprehensive protection," Xu said.
</P>
<P>
China in 1985 adopted the patent law, which was revised for the
first time in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is
amending the revised patent law, which will be fully in line with
the international covenants.
</P>
<P>
Ranked fourth in the world for volume of patents, China had
received one million patent applications by the end of January
2000.

<HEADLINE> China Quickens Administrative Reform to Strengthen Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
today that China is speeding up the reform of public
administration, hoping to establish a vigorous administration
system suited to China's socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Song Defu, minister of personnel, made the remark at the two-
day Seminar on Public Administration Reform in Asia, which opened
here this morning.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the reform can improve the country's
competitive edge internationally.
</P>
<P>
He said quickening public administration reform and
establishing a highly efficient and streamlined government is of
great importance to economic development and social progress.
</P>
<P>
Since China's opening-up in 1978, the Chinese government has
witnessed four major organizational reforms. The fourth reform, of
the State Council, which ended in 1998, resulted in a 50 percent
reduction of staff.
</P>
<P>
The experiences over the past 20 years show that China's
administrative reform not only promoted the country's political
reform, liberated and developed social productivity, but also
improved the efficiency of government organizations, according to
a senior Chinese official attending the seminar.
</P>
<P>
Pichardo Pagaza, president of the International Institute of
Administrative Sciences, said that in the current process of
economic globalization, governments worldwide should exchange
experiences more frequently and work harder to seek reform methods
and measures that are most appropriate to their own realities.

<HEADLINE> Manila Hopes More Hostages to Be Released Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Friday that more hostages may be released soon following the
release of another Malaysian national who has been among the
hostages kept by the Abu Sayyaf in Sulu province since April.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference held in the Presidential Palace, Press
Secretary and Presidential Spokesman Ricardo Puno said Abdul Jawah
Salawat, who was released Friday morning, will be turned over to
chief government negotiator Robert Aventajado.
</P>
<P>
Puno said Aventajado, who has flown to Zamboanga City, will in
turn entrust the hostage to the Malaysian ambassador to the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf released another Malaysian hostage Zulkarnain
Hashim on June 23. He was among 21 persons, mostly foreigners,
snatched by the group from a diving resort in Malaysia on April 23.
</P>
<P>
"Nothing is certain but there is every hope that it will be
done," Puno said on the possibility of more hostages being
released, adding that "there is a very good chance that in the
next few days, we could see some developments in that area."
</P>
<P>
Puno said there are continuing discussions with the Abu Sayyaf
regarding the release of the hostages pursuant to President Joseph
Estrada's order to Aventajado to ensure first and foremost the
safe release of all captives.
</P>
<P>
He also made it clear that the government was not aware of any
ransom paid for the Malaysian hostage, adding that the government
will neither sanction nor approve of any ransom payment.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, Philippine President Joseph Estrada told the
visiting foreign ministers of Germany, France and Finland that he
is standing firm on "no-ransom" policy in dealing with the country
's hostage situation.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Estrada briefed the foreign ministers on
the measures the government has taken to solve the problem.
Nationals of the three European countries are among the captives.
</P>
<P>
The president said a military solution to solve the hostage
problem is out of the question, saying that the safety and welfare
of the captives are of paramount concern.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers, on their part, reiterated their full
trust in the Philippine government's handling of the hostage
situation in Jolo.
</P>
<P>
Aside from the 21 Filipino and foreign hostages taken by the
Abu Sayyaf in April, the group also seized 13 Christian
evangelists who traveled to their camp in Patikul, Sulu to pray
for the hostages on July 1.
</P>
<P>
One German journalist and three French journalists who went
there to interview the original hostages were also reportedly
abducted by the group recently.

<TEXT>
<P>
Hou Lei, 30, the bride, first knew Charlie Bean, her 38-year-
old husband, in June last year on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Hou graduated from the English department of the Inner
Mongolian Normal University in 1992. She became paralyzed in a
traffic accident the following year. In 1996 she began teaching
local children. Charlie is a community counselor for youngsters in
Willow Creek, a small town in central-northern California. He got
paraplegia in a car accident when he was eighteen.
</P>
<P>
In 1998 Hou bought a personal computer and logged on the
Internet, getting to know quite a few handicapped people in other
countries. In June last year she sent by chance an e-mail to
charlie, thus began their romance in the cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
"We made frequent exchanges on the Internet in the past year,"
said Hou, adding that they "chatted" for over two hours every
night on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
"Half a year later we decided on our marriage."
</P>
<P>
To help Charlie to make the wedding trip to China, his American
friends sponsored a fund for him. A newspaper in his hometown
called him "ambassador of Willow Creek" and wished his trip to
China will be "a start of cultural exchange between the small
community and new Chinese friends."
</P>
<P>
On the wedding day, Hou, in white Qipao -- a traditional dress
for Chinese women, and Charlie, in traditional Chinese wedding
suit made of purple silk, sang the English song My Heart Will Go
On, the theme song of the movie Titanic, which brought the wedding
to the climax.
</P>
<P>
Hou's family prepared a room for the couple, and renovated the
toilet room so that Charlie can move around in his wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
"Baotou is a beautiful city. I will teach children English here
with Hou Lei," Charlie said at the wedding ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"I will also try my best to learn to speak Chinese," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is stepping
up efforts to strengthen the collection of the public housing
funding and is trying to make the money available to more
individual home buyers.
</P>
<P>
Liang Xiaoqing, deputy director of the Housing
Industrialization Promotion Center under the Ministry of
Construction, said the country will further standardize the
management of the public housing fund, and will take measures to
develop intermediary services and reduce costs of loan-borrowing.

housing loans. So far, the number of employees participating in
the public housing fund system has reached 69 million and some 140.
9 billion yuan has been collected for the fund.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China is seeking overseas
investment to boost the massive housing construction in the next
century, a Ministry of Construction official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Housing construction is expected to keep an annual growth rate
of 15 percent in the 21st century and a large amount of funds will
be needed, said Liang Xiaoqing, deputy director of the ministry's
Housing Industrialization Promotion Center.
</P>
<P>
China will build at least 1.5 billion square meters of housing
in urban areas and 3.5 billion square meters of housing in rural
areas, and renovate 2.9 billion square meters of old houses by the
year 2005, Liang said.
</P>
<P>
This will provide a big market for overseas businesspeople to
invest in China's real estate sector, said the official at the
2000 China Housing and Real Estate Financing Symposium held here
today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has formulated a series of preferential
policies for overseas real estate developers, including exemption
from investment regulatory taxes, easy access to raising of funds,
and the freedom to remit their after-tax profits abroad.
</P>
<P>
She said that with the implementation of the government's new
housing reform policy, construction of ordinary residential
housing has become the focus of investment in the real estate
sector.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that more than 5,000 overseas real estate
developers are operating in the Chinese mainland, accounting for
20 percent of the country's real estate enterprises.

BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government today

resolution adopted by the European Parliament (EP) concerning the
issue of World Bank's loans for the Western China Poverty

Several days ago, the European Parliament (EP) adopted a
resolution concerning the issues of World Bank's loan for the
Western China Poverty Reduction Project and the so-called "future
of Tibet", in which it deliberately called the Chinese territory
Tibet a "country", slandering that China "occupied" Tibet.It also
wantonly distorted and attacked China's policy of ethnic regional
autonomy practiced in Tibet. Toward EP's overbearing and brutal
interference in China's internal affairs we hereby express our
great indignation and firm opposition.

<P>
We must point out that in recent years, the EP, masterminded by
a handful of its members, has time and again introduced or passed
resolutions on such Chinese internal affairs as the issues on
Tibet and Taiwan and repeatedly made distortions about the facts
to lavish attacks on China. Although we have made many stern
presentations, the EP has stubbornly gone its own way instead of
showing any restraints. Such acts of the EP not only greatly hurt
the feeling of the Chinese people but also will produce grave
negative effect on the healthy advancement of the Sino-European
relations. We hold that better understanding and consensus can
only be achieved through dialogues on an equal footing aimed at
clearing off misunderstandings. It is an act of hegemonic
politics to rashly pass some resolutions in unjustifiable
accusation against others without learning the true fact of the
issues concerned, which represents a deliberate confrontation. We
are firmly opposed to it. Therefore, we advise that the EP be able
to proceed from the overall consideration of the Sino-European
relations so that it can abide by the cardinal principles
governing international relations and show due respect to China's
sovereignty and territorial integrity. The EP should adopt an
objective and cautious attitude toward all issues that are within
the sphere of China's internal affairs so that it will not waste
its support for the separatist activities of the Dalai group.

On the issue of holding negotiations with Dalai, China's policy
is consistent and explicit. That is to say that Dalai must truly
renounce his claim of "Tibet independence" and stop his separatist
activities; he must state it clear to the public that Tibet is an
inalienable part of China and Taiwan is one of China's provinces
and that the government of the People's Republic of China is the
sole legitimate government representing all China. Basing on this
policy, the door is always open to contacts between the Central
Government and Dalai. Since it is an internal affair of China,
neither any foreign country nor the EP has any right to interfere
in it.
</P>
<P>
The EP's accusation against China in the World Bank's Western
China Poverty Reduction Project is also utterly unjustifiable.
China's Poverty Reduction Project in Qinghai Province is
engineered virtually to help people of all nationalities living in
the projected area to get rid of poverty, improve their production
and living conditions, and promote economic and social development
there. The immigration program covered by the project is to be
carried out in full accordance with the wishes and choices of the
local people, and there is no question at all of so-called
assimilating Tibetans. In fact, people of all nationalities in
the projected area hope to see a quick execution of the project.
Before having basic understanding of the project, some members of
the EP start to willfully levy their comments and criticisms in a
bid to endorse the Tibetan separatist efforts and try to take the
opportunity to play up "Tibet independence".This is a willful
encroachment upon China's sovereignty and it gravely hurts the
feeling of the various Chinese nationalities including the
Tibetans.

The fact is that since 1979, the concerned department of the
Chinese Central Government has consecutively received 11 groups of
Dalai's personal representatives in various efforts to open
negotiations. In the latter half of 1989, Dalai took a wrong stock
of the situation in China and declared not to have any contacts
with "an unstable Central Government". In 1992, contacts between
the Central Government and Dalai resumed upon his request. In the
second half of 1993, however, Dalai once again called off contacts
with the Central Government. Such on-and-off and self-
contradictory act of Dalai fully revealed his insincerity.
Meanwhile, he spread lies worldwide, saying that the Central
Government declined to negotiate with him in a vain effort to
cheat the international community. This shows that Dalai is an out-
and-out liar who is to blame for the deadlock. How can it be that
the Central Government has shown "no readiness" to take part in a
dialogue?

Since the implementation of democratic reform and the abrogation
of the dark feudal serfdom in 1959, especially since the policy of
ethnic regional autonomy was put into practice in 1956, colossal
changes have taken place in Tibet. The serfs and slaves once bent
under the rule of the Dalai Lama now have become masters of their
own destiny. With the support of the Central Government and other
regions of the country, Tibet has accomplished rapid economic
development and continuous improvement in people's living
standards. Great progress has been made in every aspect including
ethnic culture, education and public health. The freedom of
religious belief and all kinds of fundamental human rights and
freedom have enjoyed full guarantee. During the two hundred years
before 1959, the population in Tibet had long been hovering around
one million, and now it has reached 2.44 million, of which 95
percent are Tibetans. The average life span of Tibetans has risen
from 36 years in 1959 to 65 years at present. In a brief span of
40 years, Tibet has completed such tremendous social and economic
evolution that would require mankind to succeed in centuries. This
has made Tibet one of a few places in the world where the fastest
development and the best improvement in all aspects of social
undertakings and human rights situation are seen. Some EP members,
obsessed with antagonism and prejudice against China, turn a deaf
ear to these solid facts. Reluctant to learn the true facts about
Tibet, they indulge themselves in parroting those lies told by
Dalai, asserting that "China has shown no readiness" to take part
in a dialogue with Dalai. This is a sheer nonsense designed to
fool the public opinion.

In 1949, the Chinese People's Liberation War scored a decisive
victory and the People's Republic of China took birth. Like China'
s provinces of Hunan, Yunnan, Xinjiang and Xikang where peaceful
liberation was achieved from under the rule of the former KMT
government, Tibet also gained its liberation in peace.Before
peaceful liberation, Tibet practiced a feudal serfdom under a
theocracy characterized by the dictatorship of upper-class monks
and nobles with Dalai being the chieftain of the feudal regime.
The darkness and brutality of the feudal serfdom in Tibet out-
measured that of medieval Europe. At that time, 95 percent of the
Tibetans were either serfs or slaves who were deprived of all
human rights and lived a harsh life comparable to that of animals.
After peaceful liberation of Tibet, the broad masses of serfs and
slaves badly wanted to get rid of the shackles of serfdom. However,
some people of the Tibetan ruling clique were opposed to any
reform and attempted to maintain the serfdom system forever so as
to sustain their sanguinary rule. They deliberately intensified
their separatist activities. In March 1959, a minority of serf
owners, in collaboration with foreign anti-China forces, launched
a full-scale armed rebellion, openly upholding the separatist
banner of "Tibet independence".

It is known to all that Tibet was officially incorporated into
China's territory as early as more than seven hundred years ago,
and China's successive central governments have been exercising
sovereignty over Tibet ever since. Tibet area has never been an
independent country. The titles of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen
Erdeni were granted by the Chinese central government respectively
in mid-17th and early 18th century, thus officially establishing
their political and religious status in Tibet and setting forth a
fixed system by which their ordainment and succession must be
approved by the central government. The 14th Dalai Lama now in-
exile succeeded to be ordained after the approval by the then
Chairman of the National Government of China in 1940. Therefore,
Tibet has been part of China all through the ages. No government
of any country in the world has ever recognized Tibet as an
independent country. However, in disregard of this irrefutable
objective fact universally recognized by the international
community, the EP resolution blatantly called the Chinese
territory Tibet a "country" and vilified that China "invaded" and
"occupied" Tibet. By doing so, the EP is obviously trying to
render support to a handful of separatists led by Dalai Lama so as
to gain its aim to split China.

BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China's export this year is very
likely to reach 200 billion U.S. dollars, the target set in China'
s five-year plan from 1996 to 2000, a senior Chinese official said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Wu Yi, an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and a state
councilor, told China's foreign trade and economic cooperation
officials in a televised conference that their job now is to reach
the goal ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
She said China's national economy has shown signs of overall
recovery. Gross domestic product in the first half of the year
grew 8.2 percent and the increase of exports, in particular,
helped contribute to the economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, China exported a total of 114.5 billion U.
S. dollars worth of goods, up 38.3 percent, the highest record in
three-year. Imports from the period reached 102.1 billion U.S.
dollars, up 36.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The state councilor cited analysis from the National Bureau of
Statistics as saying that the exports increase has helped edge the
industrial growth by 2.9 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the contractual volume of overseas investment to
China in the first six months of the year grew 24.6 percent from
the same period last year. She gave no specific figures.

Wu urged officials to remain cool-headed and make practical
analysis of the difficulties and uncertainties which will emerge
in the coming months, and to ensure the development of foreign
trade and overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
"To expand exports in every possible way and to realize the
better utilization of overseas investment both in quality and
quantity are still our main tasks in the foreign trade and
economic cooperation sector," she said.
</P>
<P>
"It is very likely that we will hit the set target of foreign
trade for the Ninth-Five-Year (1996-2000) plan, 400 billion U.S.
dollars of both imports and exports and 200 billion U.S. dollars
of exports. What we should do now is try our best to reach the
goal ahead of schedule," she said.
</P>
<P>
Concerning overseas investment, she said the growth of
contractual overseas investment should continue, while the volume
of actual overseas investment should be kept at about the same
level as last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Wu urged officials to prepare for the country's
membership in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guangsheng, minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, and several other trade officials from Shanghai,
Chongqing Municipality and Zhejiang Province pledged at the
meeting that work to realize the year's goal.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Endorse Truce Extension in Aceh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Ambassador and
Permanent Representative to the United Nations Hasan Wirayuda
would endorse an extension of truce between the Indonesian
government and the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), a report reaching
here said Friday.
</P>
<P>
It said that the truce, or the Joint Understanding on
Humanitarian Pause in Aceh which took effect on June 2, was
scheduled to expire on August 2.
</P>
<P>
"Right from the start, the three-month term has been adopted
only for periodic evaluation with a view to extending it,"
Wirayuda said in Banda Aceh, capital of Aceh province, adding that
the desire to extend the truce in Aceh does not only come from the
Indonesian government but also from the GAM.
</P>
<P>
"I think the desire to extend the humanitarian pause also comes
from GAM. That is why the Indonesian government and GAM will
continue to meet to asses and evaluate the implementation of the
understanding," Antara news agency quoted Wirayuda as saying.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Indonesian government and the GAM signed
a humanitarian pause accord in Geneva, Switzerland, on May 12,
clearing the way for both sides to ease tension and violent
actions in Aceh province which has claimed hundreds of civilians
and security officers over the past 23 years.
</P>
<P>
The GAM is an underground separatist group in Aceh, the country
's predominantly Muslim province, which has been fighting against
the central government for the province's independence.
</P>
<P>
But Wirayuda said that since the enforcement of the
humanitarian pause on June 2, there has been a significant
decrease in the number of conflicts between the government troops
and the GAM.
</P>
<P>
"I think from the quantitative point of view there has been an
obvious decrease. As far as the reports reaching me from both
sides are concerned, there has been an improvement (in the
situation in Aceh). But stopping it altogether will take time," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam-U.S. BTA Brings Both Opportunities, Challenges: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnam-U.S. bilateral trade
agreement (BTA) will bring about both opportunities and challenges
to Vietnam, a senior Vietnamese trade official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of Trade Mai Van Dau said at a press conference
here that the signing of the BTA marks the new development of the
bilateral economic-commercial relations between the two countries
and will contribute to the strengthening of Vietnam-U.S. economic-
commercial ties.
</P>
<P>
It is a success for the Vietnamese party and state's foreign
policy of independence, self-reliance, diversification,
multilateralization and active integration into the regional and
world economy, Dau said.
</P>
<P>
The BTA, covering commodities commerce, services, investment
and intellectual property, will create favorable conditions for
Vietnam to get access to the U.S. market, to absorb U.S.
investment and advanced technology, as well as to join the World
Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
However, the Vietnamese official said, it is a big challenge
that Vietnam has to change a lot of its economic policies in order
to make them conform to WTO rules and to raise competitive ability
of the enterprises and products of the country.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Trade Minister Vu Khoan and U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky signed the Vietnam-U.S.
bilateral trade agreement in Washington on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Five Afghans Ordered Released from Detention in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The High Court here Friday
allowed an application for the release of five Afganistans who
were unlawfully detained for seven months at the Kajang prison
near here.
</P>
<P>
Justice Abdul Hamid Mohamad ordered Nisar Ali, Mohamed Basir
Jafari, Mohamed Younes, Abdul Rahim Hamiri and Habibah Fatah to be
released to the Immigration Department for deportation after
allowing their application for a writ of habeas corpus, according
to Bernama news agency.
</P>
<P>
The report said defense counsel Kamarul Hisham Kamaruddin made
the application through an affidavit dated June 1, 2000 on grounds
that the five were detained unlawfully when they were supposed to
be released on January 2, 2000 and deported.
</P>
<P>
The five were first charged in the Sepang Magistrate's Court
under the Passport Act 1966 with entering the country illegally
and the magistrate sentenced them to three months imprisonment
from the date of arrest, November 2, 1999, after they all pleaded
guilty.
</P>
<P>
But the prosecution made an application on December 31, 1999 to
the same magistrate in chambers, in the absence of defense counsel,
to detain the five as witnesses in another case involving an
Iranian, Rahim Amiri Faramarz, believed to have assisted the five
to enter the country illegally. The five, during their
interrogation by immigration officers, repeatedly made statements
of not recognizing Rahim Amiri when his passport photograph was
shown to them.
</P>
<P>
The defense counsel said "The detention order made by the
prosecution under the Criminal Procedure Code was improper and
illegal because it was made in the absence of a counsel."
</P>
<P>
Deputy public prosecutor Hanafiah Zakaria had no objections to
the application for the release.

</P>
<P>
A minor upward extension had generally persisted, with the
overall sentiment favorable about additional gains as the session
progressed.
</P>
<P>
The recent upward momentum was fueled by the latest batch of
economic figures.
</P>
<P>
China's exports rose 38.3 percent in the first half year to 114.
5 billion US dollars, while imports grew by 36.2 percent to 102.1
billion US dollars. Half year trade surplus was about 12 billion
US dollars. June witnessed remarkably strong growth of exports.
Exports surged by nearly 45 percent to a five-month high of 22.2
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China's economy also grew at a greater-than-expected rate of 8.
2 percent over the first half year. It is believed that the
country has finally shrugged off the effects of the Asian
financial crisis and is back on the right track.
</P>
<P>
Investors are increasing optimistic about consumption and
investment growth driven by exports in the latter half of the year.
However, follow through interest failed to develop towards the end
of the week amid resumed revenue concerns.
</P>
<P>
The B-share index may have some difficulties in penetrating the
highs on technical basis next week as it works off the overdone
posture generated by the recent 4-day winning streak. But it will
strive to make its way on the plus side as the session progress
under the impact of economic growth, according to Homeway.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: China's Amusement Industry Booming (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Each year there are about 350 million people visiting the
amusement parks and places in China and the revenue was about 544
million U.S. dollars in 1999, according to the China Association
of Amusement Parks and Attractions (CAAPA).
</P>
<P>
"China's amusement industry brings along the economic growth,
and the economic growth, in turn, promotes the development of
amusement industry," said Guan Tianchi, vice secretary general of
CAAPA, at the Asian Amusement Expo that closed here Friday.
</P>
<P>
China's amusement industry emerged upon people's demand for
entertainment and recreation activities, with the improvement  of
their living standard after the reform and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning, only some simple and individual amusement
facilities were erected separately at the existing parks, but they
brought quite a bit of fun to visitors, said Guan.
</P>
<P>
"As people's requirements were getting higher, they were not
satisfied with this way of fun any more. The new parks and
entertainment places were planned and constructed in the big
coastal cities, starting from the first special economic zone --
Shenzhen near Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
When these new parks were completed, they were well received
with more and more visitors going there for relaxation and
recreation, and that promoted the development of the amusement
industry and made it stronger and stronger, he noted.
</P>
<P>
As the economy grew up continuously in China, amusement parks
extended from coastal to inland areas, from east to west, and from
big cities to medium and small ones.

<P>
Guan pointed out that the people's customs and ideology should
be considered in the construction of theme parks, adding that the
theme parks built in China should have Chinese traditional
characteristics and cultural connotation.
</P>
<P>
"Because most visitors to these parks are Chinese, the theme
must be suitable to their taste. Even for foreign visitors, they
would like to enjoy the Chinese traditional culture," he said.
</P>
<P>
With the expansion of the amusement industry, the amusement
facilities, mainly imported from foreign countries at the
beginning, started to be made by Chinese manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
"Because the amusement facilities made in China are less
expensive than foreign ones based on lower costs of labor and
materials, Chinese amusement facilities have a wide domestic
market," said Guan.
</P>
<P>
Regulations on quality standards and quality control for the
amusement facilities have also been enacted and helped improve the
level and quality of design and manufacture of the amusement
facilities, he said, adding that Chinese amusement facilities now
start to be exported to foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
In order to develop and manage the amusement industry, the
CAAPA was founded in 1978 and now has over 400 members.
</P>
<P>
CAAPA, which is a member of International Association of
Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA), is taking an active part
in the exchanges of technology and experience with its foreign
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Guan said the Chinese government welcomes foreign investors to
set up enterprises including the amusement facilities
manufacturing companies in China. Some joint-venture for design
and manufacture of the amusement facilities have been set up.
</P>
<P>
"Undoubtedly, using foreign funds and technology to raise our
technical level and employing Chinese staff to reduce the costs
can speed up the amusement industry of China," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Guan said Chinese amusement industry is facing both
opportunities and challenges in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
"With the strong economic growth and the steady improvement of
the people's living standard, we are confident that the amusement
industry should have a bright future in China," he said.

importance to bilateral relations and their frequent exchanges of
visits.
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides share common ideal and belief, persist in
taking the socialist road under the leadership of their ruling

development of Sino-Lao friendly relations no matter in the
revolutionary struggle or peaceful time, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said these are favorable conditions and important basis for
promoting all-round cooperation between the two countries in the
years ahead.

cohesive, and will lead the Lao people to overcome difficulties.

and will as soon as possible sign a document to define the

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are the economic briefs
from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel now appears to have enough natural gas to
provide for all its needs through 2025, the National Infrastructure
Ministry's chief geologist said this week.
</P>
<P>
In an internal document submitted by the ministry to Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Finance Minister Avraham Shochat, Dr.
Yehezkel Druckman recommended that Israel not purchase natural gas
form Egypt, because Israel's reserves of natural gas from offshore
drilling are likely to reach 100 billion cubic meters in the next
three to four years and 150 billion cubic meters within a decade.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE) would take part in
any oil production increase to be adopted by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), said UAE Oil Minister Obeid
Bin Saif Al Nasir on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
All oil producing countries will share in the production hike
once OPEC favours it. However, the decision to raise oil production
quota by the member states should be taken after consultations
among OPEC countries, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
OPEC was keen to stabilize world oil market, he said, expressing
hope that crude oil price per barrel could remain between 22 and 28
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Unemployment in Israel continued its downward slide
in June, reaching 8.8 percent, or 209,460 people, according to the
latest figures released by the Central Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
The numbers confirm the impression that there is now a steady,
if slow, drop in the numbers of the unemployed.
</P>
<P>
In the last four months of 1999, unemployment was at 9.1
percent, up from 9 percent in August 1999 and 8.9 percent in June
and July of last year.
</P>
<P>
RAMALLAH -- The Palestinian Development and Investment Company
(PDICO) planned to invest about 2 billion U.S. dollars in tourism,
real estate, energy, transport and information technology sectors
in the Palestinian self-rule areas in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
PDICO General Manager Farouk Zeitar was quoted by the London-
based Arabic-language Al-Haiyat daily as saying that his firm had
invested a total of 530 million U.S. dollars in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters in Nablus on Tuesday that PDICO's next Five-
Year Plan was designed to heavily fund infrastructure projects to
help boost Palestinian economy.
</P>
<P>
He also mentioned previous activities undertaken by PDICO,
including the establishment of some industrial zones at a cost of
210 million to 212 million dollars in the Palestinian territories
over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
PDICO was considering the establishment of a holding company to
construct more industrial zones. The company will have a capital of
50 million dollars, 30-35 percent of which will be offered for
public subscription, he added.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel stands to gain another 9.3 billion U.S.
dollars from trade with its Arab neighbors in the event a peace
agreement is reached, according to a new study. These "peace
dividends" would be earned by taking advantage of the countries'
geographic proximity.
</P>
<P>
The report, written by Niron Hashai of Tel Aviv University,
assumes that all economic and political trade barriers are removed
between Israel and Jordan, Syria and Egypt. Trade barriers include
lack of formal relations, tariffs, quotas and anything else which
hinders the free flow of goods between borders.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Enforce Hygiene Rules for Lake Victoria Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government is to
enforce hygiene regulations for all beaches in the Lake Victoria
region in southwestern Kenya, Kisumu District Commissioner Andrew
Mondoh has said.
</P>
<P>
Mondoh said the government will ensure all the beaches are
clean and complied with the public health regulations, and the
Fishery Department has planned rapid clean-up of the beaches along
the Lake Victoria, the East African Standard newspapers Friday
quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner made the remarks at the recent celebration to
mark the World Population Day at Kisumu City, saying his
government has set aside 18 million shillings (about 234,000 U.S.
dollars) for the improvement of sanitation along Lake Victoria
beaches.
</P>
<P>
Lake Victoria region is Kenya's key fishing place. Due to
hygiene problems, the European Union (EU) imposed a ban on fish
products from the country in January 1998.
</P>
<P>
According to Kenyan Planning Minister Gideon Ndambuki, Kenya
had lost 3.4 billion shillings (about 44 million dollars) since
the ban was imposed two years ago.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, Kenya exported about 52,000 tons of fish, mostly Nile
perch from Lake Victoria , valued at 862 million shillings, to EU,
mainly to Germany and Italy.

<P>
CHONGQING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- More and more residents in
Chongqing are buying homes, and in the first five months this year
over 90 percent of new housing went to private home owners in this
southwest China municipality.
</P>
<P>
According to local statistics, 927,000 sq m of new housing was
sold in the five months, up about 80 percent from a year earlier,
and 91 percent of new homes were bought by private individuals.
</P>
<P>
"The housing reform that started in the second half of 1998
has boosted home buying in the city," said You Shicheng, deputy
chief of the Chongqing Land and Real Estate Management Bureau.
</P>
<P>
China overhauled its public welfare housing system in 1998,
which ended the distribution of public housing to employees in
urban areas. The government now encourages urban residents to buy
homes while continuing to provide low-rent housing for the needy.
</P>
<P>
As the reform moves forward, more and more residents will
become home owners, You said. To meet the demand, the city's
investment in housing is rising at an annual rate of 30 percent,
he added.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong
Province in south China, reported a 17.3 percent industrial growth
in the first six months of this year, compared with the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the statistics bureau of Guangzhou said that the
city accomplished 147.44 billion yuan (about 17.76 billion U.S.
dollars) in output value from January to June.
</P>
<P>
Industries contributed 57.1 percent to the city's gross
domestic product (GDP) and 96.4 percent of the locally
manufactured goods were marketed, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the city also delivered 36.8 billion
yuan (about 4.43 billion U.S. dollars) worth of commodities for
export.
</P>
<P>
A local official in charge of economic affairs explained that
the city has stepped up efforts to reorganize assets and transform
the operational system in enterprises since the beginning of the
year. State-owned enterprises of the city have also achieved
success in reducing losses and getting rid of financial
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
But large and medium-sized enterprises and overseas-financed
ventures continued to be the key driving force behind Guangzhou's
fast industrial growth, the official said.

He predicted that the city's industrial growth this year would
be above 14.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Traces of South China Tiger Found in Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese zoologists have found
traces of the South China tiger in a dense primitive forest in
Chongqing Municipality, southwest China.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that traces of the tiger have been
discovered in Chongqing in the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year traces of the endangered animal were found in
Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces, east China.
</P>
<P>
According to Deng Heli, who recently headed a team of
zoologists to investigate wild animals in the region, the
scientists confirmed that the 20-sq-cm footprints found in a dense
forest in Daba Mountain, Chengkou County, were left by a hungry
South China tiger.
</P>
<P>
Local farmer Xia Zhiyou said he saw a footprint suspected to be
left by a South China tiger in neighboring Shaanxi Province in
November last year, and found part of a shank bone of a small
animal in the dung nearby.
</P>
<P>
Local villagers also reported to the scientists that they saw a
tiger and two cubs walk around in the forest in the spring of 1998.
The tigers ran away at the sight of the villagers, they said.
</P>
<P>
The South China tiger is listed as one of the ten most
endangered species in the world. It is estimated that there are
only 20 to 30 such tigers in the wild.

<HEADLINE> Russian Defense Chief Opposes Reorganizing Missile Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Russian Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev on Friday blasted the proposed reorganization of the
country's strategic missile force, branding the plan as imbecility
and a crime against Russia.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev, accompanying President Vladimir Putin on a visit to
Nizhny Tagil to attend an arms show in central Russia, threatened
to step down if the plan goes ahead.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to proposals advanced by the General Staff
that the strategic force cease to be a service and become
subordinate to the central defense authority or even to the air
force command.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev said he would not preside over the attempts at
destroying the strategic missile force, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Ground-based missiles make up the strongest defense against a
nuclear attack and cannot be sidelined, he said, adding that the
strategic missile force is the core of the country's recently
adopted military doctrine.
</P>
<P>
If the force is done away with, so should the new doctrine, the
defense chief said.
</P>
<P>
The attempts at this kind of reorganization are "criminal
stupidity and an attack on Russia's national interests to the same
degree," Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
He said the General Staff is suggesting exactly what the
Americans want to build into START-3, he said. "Whose interests is
the General Staff, thought to be the brainpower of the armed
forces, promoting?"
</P>
<P>
"Whoever is not indifferent to the future of Russia, the
security of its people and its position in the world," must join
the debate on reorganization of the strategic missile force, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Nanjing City Enjoying Cool Summer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- While the Chinese capital of
Beijing is heating under the scorching sun, Nanjing, known as one
of China's four "heating ovens", is enjoying a cool summer with
the average maximum temperature reading 30 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
Major cities in north and east China have had their maximum
temperatures shooting up to over 32 degrees Celsius. Beijing's
highest temperature soared up to over 40 degrees Celsius.
</P>
<P>
However, this capital of east China's Jiangsu Province has
become a summer resort with pretty cool weather.
</P>
<P>
There are four "ovens" in the Yangtze River valleys: Nanjing,
Jiujiang, Wuhan and Chongqing cities. Temperatures in the four
cities are usually higher in summer than in other places on the
same latitude, because of radiative effects of the river water.
</P>
<P>
The abnormal atmospheric circulation and expanded urban
greenery have been attributed to the low summer temperature.
Nanjing's per-capita greenery coverage amounts to 7 sq.m., which
represents a high greenery rate among the cities along the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing was struck by a heat wave in 1998, when a 38-40-degree
Celsius temperature lingered for weeks in summer. However, the
city's highest temperature dropped below 35 degrees Celsius in
July last year.

<HEADLINE> Precious Ancient Coins Unearthed in North China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists
recently unearthed precious ancient coins in north China's Hebei
province.
</P>
<P>
Among the discovery, 42 coins were made in the Northern Song
Dynasty (960-1127) and some words were engraved on them, which are
believed to be written by the emperors at that time.
</P>
<P>
To engrave some lucky words on coins is common in ancient China,
but such kinds of coins with emperors' handwritings are rare in
the region, said experts.
</P>
<P>
The coins along with other relics were found in tombs located
about 20 km southeast to Shenzhou city, in the southeastern part
of Hebei province.
</P>
<P>
Archaeologists recently discovered about 11 tombs presumably
built in the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and Song Dynasty (960-1279)
near an express way in the province.

BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are the major
domestic news Xinhua released from July 8 to 14:
</P>
<P>
-- China's industrial enterprises are expected to achieve a net
profit of 300 billion yuan (36.1 billion U.S. dollars) in 2000.
The state-owned and state-controlled companies are expected to
generate 130 billion yuan (15.7 billion U.S. dollars) in profits,
according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
-- More than 10,000 people had been evacuated to safe places by
July 9 morning in southwest China's Chongqing Metropolis after
their houses were threatened by mountain slides caused by days of
torrential rains.
</P>
<P>
Six days of torrential rains starting from June 1 caused eight
major mountain slides and 2,600 minor ones in the county near the
Three Gorges Reservoir area now under construction.
</P>
<P>
-- Twice a day, over 700,000 trained chickens and ducks chow
down on locusts at the foot of Tianshan Mountain in the Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region, northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Locusts have affected 2.6 million hectares of farmland in the
northwest China region. To fight back, the region has brought in
some 100,000 ducks to join the locust-killing bio-troops made up
of chickens, migrating starlings and microspores.
</P>
<P>
The disaster has now been brought under control, said officials
with the Ministry of Agriculture. But it is still too early to be
too optimistic, since combating autumn locusts could be an even
tougher task as many insects could survive the summer's
eradication program, and foreign locusts may invade at any time,
warned the officials.

BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Shenzhen composite index rose
1.83 points or 0.30 percent to close at 615.14 points on Thursday,
a record high for the fourth straight day.
</P>
<P>
The sub-index, however, dropped 4.52 points or 0.09 percent to

</P>
<P>
Turnover was 14.08 billion yuan, 25.1 percent less than
Thursday's 18.82 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen composite index opened high today, but also
plunged to 611.19 points on profit-taking. Nevertheless, market
sentiment remained bullish and investors turned their interest to
the oil-related stocks after learning about price hikes for
gasoline and diesel, according to Homeway, China's leading on-line
financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
Market gainers beat losers by 248 to 222, with another nine

dropping 6.77 percent to close at 14.88 yuan per share.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China's T-bond market witnessed a
broad rise today while the trade remained narrow with a turnover
of 1.37 billion yuan, five million yuan more than yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that 009908, a 3.30 percent bond due 2009, jumped
the most to 101.75 yuan, 0.23 percent higher than yesterday's
close price, driving the yield down 0.04 percentage points to 3.44
percent.
</P>
<P>
With a floating interest rate, which is 2.87 percent this year,
Bond 010004 ended the session up 0.08 percent at 102.19 yuan,
creating a new record. The big gain of the bond in recent days may
have attracted many profit takers, according to Homeway, China's
leading on-line financial and securities advisory company.
</P>
<P>
The turnover of the domestic stock trade contracted when the
composite stock indices on the two domestic stock exchanges
climbed for the sixth consecutive day. This may suggest a round of
corrections in near future for stocks. With lower expected return,
the T-bond trade may turn a bit active in the weakness of the
equity market.
</P>
<P>
The trade volume on three-day, seven-day, 14-day and 28-day
repo transactions decreased by 1.48 billion yuan to 6.03 billion
yuan. Meanwhile, the interest rate on the three-day transaction
dipped by 2.79 percentage points to 1.01 percent.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Reiterates its Stance Over Congo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has reiterated its
stance on maintaining good relations with Uganda and Rwanda and
its continued efforts to find lasting peace in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The independent Guardian newspaper Friday quoted Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye as saying that Tanzania will continue to be
involved in the peace-seeking efforts in the Great Lakes Region
and would like to maintain a neutral stance over countries that
have deployed troops in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye made the remarks Thursday during a parliament debate in
the central town of Dodoma, at which a shadow minister said Uganda
and Rwanda were looting minerals in the DRC on the pretext of
defending their security interests.
</P>
<P>
"This is not Tanzania's position," said the premier referring
to the shadow minister's remarks, warning that such "sensitive
statements" could threaten Tanzania's relationship with its
neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said Tanzania still maintains good and brotherly
relationship with Uganda and Rwanda and is involved in efforts to
find solutions for ending the on-going conflict in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tanzanian Acting Foreign Minister Bakari Mwapachu
said in a budget speech that the country maintains good
relationship with all neighboring countries, noting that there is
good cooperation in various fields such as economic activities,
social area, culture and defense and security.
</P>
<P>
However, he said the wars in the DRC and Burundi have slowed
down the growth of trade relations between Tanzania and the two
countries.

<HEADLINE> World's Fourth Largest Mining Giant to Invest in Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Billiton Group, the fourth largest
mining company in the world, is making feasibility studies on co-
building an ore-dressing plant with an annual output of 250,000
tons of metallic zinc in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
The group has signed an agreement with the Yunnan Lanping
Nonferrous Metals Company Ltd., which is in charge of China's
largest lead-zinc mine at Lanping of Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
The Lanping mine, in northwestern Yunnan, ranks third in the
world in verified reserves of zinc and lead. China has been making
preparations for its development in the past two decades. However,
the lack of funds and up-to-date expertise is a problem.
</P>
<P>
Billiton has been attracted by the mine after it made
extensive investigations. It set up a representative office in
Kunming, the provincial capital, in 1998 and formed a joint
venture with an enterprise of the Department of Geology and
Mineral Resources of the Yunnan Province government in June last
year.
</P>
<P>
Initial investment for the development of the mine is estimated
at 500 million U.S. dollars. Billiton will hold 65 percent of the
stake.
</P>
<P>
Negel Clark, general manager of Billiton in China, said the
feasibility studies are expected to be completed at the end of the
year. It will reduce the risk to the minimum extent.

<HEADLINE> Inner Mongolia to Improve Housing for Herdsmen, Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The government of Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region in north China has decided to build 140 million
square meters of brick-concrete houses in the coming six years for
poor farmers and herdsmen who are living in low, dark wickiups or
tents.
</P>
<P>
At least 2.3 million farmer and herdsman families will benefit
from the government aid-the-poor housing project.
</P>
<P>
The regional government also plans to accelerate the
construction of a number of towns and cities, which is expected to
stimulate the consumption of building materials, metallurgical and
chemical products, and furniture and in the end promote local
economic development.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that an average farmer or herdsman in
Inner Mongolia has only eight square meters of brick-concrete
house, far below the standard of 15 square meters for comfortable
living set by the government.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, the money needed to build these
houses will mainly come from farmers or herdsmen themselves,
supported by bank loans. And the government will help reduce the
cost of housing construction and be responsible for roads, and
water and electricity supply and other infrastructure facilities.

</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's largest municipality, a dozen of science
and technology promotion sites including the city's observatory,
and aerospace equipment plant, have opened to tourists.
</P>
<P>
In Shenyang, capital of Liaoning Province in northeast China, a
center for popularization of space science has received more than
20,000 visitors over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The country's A-bomb and H-bomb research and production center
in Sichuan Province, southwest China, has attracted hundreds of
thousands of tourists since it was partly opened to visitors early
last year.
</P>
<P>
In the southernmost island province of Hainan, the Chinese
Academy of Tropical Agriculture has a botanical garden with 1,200
kinds of tropical plants. Last year alone, more than 350,000
tourists visited the garden.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the growing zeal for tours to science
facilities to the country's prosperous scientific and
technological development in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To meet the market demand, many Chinese travel services have
designed science tour programs. Even the country's top research
body, the Chinese Academy of Science, has established a travel
service specialized in providing expedition tour programs.

<HEADLINE> New Genetics Evidence Proves African Origin of Modern Chinese (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Y-chromosome research is an important method for tracing
the human migration patterns and the findings make clear the
relationships between people groups in Southeast Asia, and East
Asia and the Oceania, says another major Chinese researcher Jiayou
Chu, who is a professor of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences.
</P>
<P>
This latest research result was published in today's issue of
the Proceeding of National Academy of Sciences, a U.S. journal.
</P>
<P>
The finding means that scientists have made headway in the
pursuit of human origin, though the conclusion that modern Chinese
human beings migrated from Africa still remains controversial,
says academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Zhu Chen, who
is also the director of Shanghai's National Human Genome Center.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the U.S.'s scientists brought forward a theory based
on mitochondrial DNA evidence that all human beings originated in
Africa and later migrated to other corners of the globe. In the
intentional academic circles, few arguments were raised about the
theory that all palaeoanthropic mankind originated in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the scientists note that fossils of Peking Man who
lived 500,000 years ago and Yuanmao Man over 1.7 million years ago
were found in China, but both lack any direct hereditary
connection with modern Chinese man.
</P>
<P>
There is a disconnection or "faultage" in fossils of
palaeoanthropic Chinese who lived some 60,000 to 100,000 years ago,
researchers say.
</P>
<P>
Coinciding with the fossil record, Chinese scientists
discovered last year that primitive elements of DNA found in
modern Chinese are identical with those found in Africans.
</P>
<P>
The discovery has provided weighty evidence on the genetic
basis for the theory that modern Chinese were not evolved from the
archaic upright-walking human beings in China but originated in
Africa.

<HEADLINE> New Genetics Evidence Proves African Origin of Modern Chinese (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Modern humans, or Homo sapiens,
might migrate from Africa into China by way of Southeast Asia
between 18,000 years and 60,000 years ago, researchers say.
</P>
<P>
This latest research finding by Chinese scientists and their
international colleagues concluded that modern humans might have
moved from Africa to China replacing Mono erectus (archaic upright-
walking human beings) there to become the ancestors of the country
's modern humans.
</P>
<P>
The conclusion is based on the comparison and analysis of Y-
chromosome DNA using samples of the extant 88 populations living
in East Asia, Southeast Asia and the Oceania, says Li Jin, one of
the Chinese researchers of the study "Chinese Human Genome
Diversity Project."
</P>
<P>
Li Jin is a professor of both the National Human Genome Center
in Shanghai and the Institute of Genetics of Fudan University.
</P>
<P>
Scientists found that the variations of Y-chromosome in north
China are derived from those in south China, a result proved as
that a small number of settlers of African origin moved to
northern China due to the hurdle of the mighty Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
And Polynesians, who live in the islands in the Pacific Ocean,
are found to have different Y-chromosome to Taiwanese, forcing
scientists to reconsider the hypothsis that Polynesians were
descendants of ancestral Taiwanese aborigines.
</P>
<P>
As a whole, nearly all Y-chromosome variations in East Asia and
the Oceania could be found among those in Southeast Asia, adds Li
Jin.
</P>
<P>
So, the findings also indicate that modern humans migrated from
Africa to Southeast Asia nearly 60,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, the migrants were believed to have headed for two
directions: one moved northwards to south China and then spread to
the country's northern areas by crossing the Yangtze River, and
the other went to Indonesia and ultimately reached the Oceania. (

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Egyptian Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading Egyptian newspapers on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Al Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- An Egyptian official flatly denied rumors that the government
intends to sell the General Organization for International Fairs
and Exhibitions. "The rumor is groundless, privatizing such an
organization means turning it into housing units and shopping
malls," said Chairman Mohamed Said Salah.
</P>
<P>
Al Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Cotton exports fetched 816 million Egyptian pounds (235.16
million U.S. dollars) to the Egyptian Treasury last year, up by
about 51.67 percent from 538 million pounds (155 million dollars)in
1998, while wheat imports dropped from 2.538 billion pounds (731.4
million dollars)in 1998 to 1.933 billion pounds (557.06 million
dollars)last year. Wheat self-sufficiency rose from 25 percent in
1982 to 55 percent last year, according to a recent report by the
Central Agency for Mobilization of Cotton.
</P>
<P>
Al Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- EgyptAir on Thursday resumed its regular flights to Libya
after an eight-year hiatus forced by the U.N. sanctions imposed
against Libya since April 1992. The first flight landed earlier in
the day at Tripoli Airport, carrying on board a high-level Egyptian
delegation.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Gazette:
</P>
<P>
-- A 10-day heat wave in Egypt, that scorched the whole nation,
will come to an end Friday, said a senior meteorology official
Thursday. Temperatures will drop soon to 34-35 degrees Celsius in
Cairo and lower Egypt, 28 degrees Celsius in northern coastal areas
and to 38 degrees Celsius in southern Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Oman to Accelerate WTO Accession Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Oman's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) could have been speeded up had some key
legislations not taken more time, said a senior official of the
world body.
</P>
<P>
There was also lack of expertise on some subjects such as
customs evaluation, the Dubai-based Gulf News daily Friday quoted
Cato Adrian, WTO's counsellor in the accession division, as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Oman has met all of the WTO requirements, Adrian said
over the phone from Geneva that a patent law has yet to be enacted
along with some legislations concerning intellectual property.
</P>
<P>
The working group's sixth meeting held in Geneva last week has
approved Oman's WTO membership which is to be formalized by the
137-nation trade body.
</P>
<P>
Oman's accession to the WTO could be considered fast enough when
compared to Saudi Arabia, which is still waiting in the long queue,
although the kingdom applied for membership in mid-1993, while all
the other Arab Gulf states are WTO members.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 32 applicants, including Oman, in the
queue for WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
Adrian also expected China to become a member by the year-end,
while it will take at least 30 months for Yemen, Oman's neighbour
in the south, to join the fold.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Meeting to Include Exhibition on Regional Heritages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 14 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition on cultural
heritages of member states of the Association of Southeast Asian
Nations (ASEAN) will be organized here in conjunction with the
33rd ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) later this month, the Thai
News Agency (TAN) reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Office of the National Culture
Commission Arthorn Chanthawomol was quoted as saying that the
ASEAN Cultural Heritage Exhibition would also be held at the
Shangri-La Hotel here, the venue of the AMM.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministers of 10 ASEAN member states would also sign an
ASEAN Declaration on Cultural heritages at the AMM, held between
July 24 and 29, he said.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will feature five main themes, including pottery,
textile, musical instruments, archeological sites, and ornaments,
with photographs, documents, and samples of cultural objects from
all the ASEAN member countries.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition would be jointly organized by the Office of the
National Culture Commission and its counterparts in the ASEAN
Committee on Culture and Information (ASEAN COCI), and the Public

<HEADLINE> Baht Rates Acceptable: BOT Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The current rates of the Thai baht
are still at an acceptable level and favorable to the country's
exports, the Thai News Agency (TNA) reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Bank of Thailand (BOT) Chutamongkol Sonakul was
quoted as saying on Thursday that the baht fluctuation, between 39
baht and just over 40 baht for a U.S. dollar, during the past few
days was gradual and within the market mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The fall, though being a nine-month low, was rational and
within trading range, when compared to other currencies in the
region which also experienced weakening rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
It would also benefit the country's export sector, and would be
unlikely to cause investment outflow or affect the repayment
ability of the private sector, he projected.
</P>
<P>
The BOT would continue its low interest policy because it is
crucial to the recovering process of the Thai economy, said the
central bank governor.

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf Releases Another Malaysian Hostage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The extremist Abu Sayyaf group
holding some 40 hostages in Sulu province in the southern
Philippines released one Malaysian hostage early Friday morning,
said a report of the local ABS-CBN television.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the development was announced by Sulu
Governor Abdusakur Tan, who identified the Malaysian national as
Abdul Juwan Sulawat, adding that the release was facilitated by
Presidential Advisor on Mindana Affairs Lee Peng Wee.
</P>
<P>
The release came after backdoor negotiations to seek the
release of a German journalist and eight Malaysians held by the
Abu Sayyaf group gained ground last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf abducted 21 Filipino and foreign hostages in a
diving resort in Malaysia on April 23 and taken them to Sulu
province.
</P>
<P>
The rebels released one Malaysian hostage last month in what
officials described as a "goodwill gesture."
</P>
<P>
However, the Abu Sayyaf seized 13 Christian evangelists who
traveled to their camp in Patikul, Sulu, on July 1.
</P>
<P>
One German journalist and three French journalists who went
there to interview the original hostages were also reportedly
abducted by the group recently.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada told the visiting foreign
ministers of Germany, France and Finland Thursday that he is
standing firm on "no-ransom" policy in dealing with the country's
hostage situation.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Estrada briefed the foreign ministers on
the measures the government has taken to solve the problem.
Nationals of the three European countries are among the captives.
</P>
<P>
The president said a military solution to solve the hostage
problem is out of the question, saying that the safety and welfare
of the captives are of paramount concern.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also expressed confidence over the release soon of the
hostages, citing favorable developments in the ongoing
negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf captors.

LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) has granted Malawi and Kenya 344,000 U.S.
dollars to upgrade the quality of fishery products in the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) region, Zambian
newspaper Times reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at improving fishery products in the
COMESA region to meet international standards and furthermore to
facilitate export.
</P>
<P>
COMESA, in collaboration with FAO, assisted selected fish
processing plants in Malawi and Kenya to apply quality assurance
program based on the Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points.
</P>
<P>
The assistance at each fish processing plant included examining
its compliance with regulations stipulated by the European Union (
EU) and other relevant health hygiene regulations for fish and
fishery products on packaging.
</P>
<P>
Once the quality of fish and fishery products improved more
fish would be processed for the export market within and outside
the COMESA region.

<HEADLINE> HIV Vaccine Tested in Uganda Promising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The HIV vaccine being tested in
east African country Uganda has shown the potential to protect
human beings against infection, the New Vision daily reported on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Laboratory results showed that HIV virus had been killed in the
blood taken from vaccinated individuals, Professor Roy Mugerwa,
Ugandan coordinator of the vaccine trial, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said though the vaccine had been tailored to the HIV-1 sub-
type B that is most common in Europe and America, preliminary
results indicate that it would protect against the A and B sub-
types that are most common in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The professor said that 20 percent of the 40 vaccinated
individuals had shown signs of resistance to HIV, adding that the
figure appeared low but could be improved.
</P>
<P>
The results were presented to the International AIDS Conference
Thursday in Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
"What has been shown is that this vaccine is able to produce an
immune response in about 20 percent of the cases, and also shown
potential to protect against HIV regardless of which sub-types of
the virus is circulating in the population," Mugerwa was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Mugerwa said while they continue to monitor the vaccine
recipients for another year, they are looking for funds for the
second phase of trial on a larger number of patients.
</P>
<P>
Forty volunteers are participating in the trial of the HIV
vaccine, a collaboration between three Ugandan institutions and a
U.S. University, which is funded by the U.S. National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian PM Urges International Community to Help Solve Refugee Problems  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye has appealed to the international community to
help the eastern African country solve the worsening refugee
problem.
</P>
<P>
The independent Guardian newspaper Friday quoted him as saying
that the refugees fled from neighboring countries are causing a
lot of problems to Tanzania and the government was spending its
meager resources to strengthen security in several western regions
that shelter refugees.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with visiting Canadian Minister of International
Cooperation Maria Minna in the central town of Dodoma on Thursday,
Sumaye said initially his government thought that the problem
would not take long to be solved, but it now appears that the
solution is far from being found.
</P>
<P>
He told the Canadian minister that although his government is
striving to restore peace in the Great Lakes region, it is
difficult to tell how long Tanzania will go on to accommodate the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said most refugees were going into villages from the camps,
causing problems to the local people as they are forced to share
the little resources available.
</P>
<P>
However, it is difficult to tell who is a refugee and who is
not since Tanzanians living in borders share the same language and
customs as those living in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Tanzanian Minister for Home Affairs Muhammad
Khatib told the parliament that Tanzania is currently sheltering
around 664,000 refugees from Burundi, Rwanda, the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and Somalia.

<HEADLINE> Tea Output Drops in Central Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The prevailing cold and dry
weather has caused a drastic drop in tea output in Central
Province, Kenya, local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Most factories in the province are processing half their
regular share of tea leaves due to a massive frost swept across
some districts last week, the East African Standard newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
G.K.Njoroge, a local tea manager, said local tea factories are
receiving an average of 18,000 kg of green leaf down from 80,000
kg under normal weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
In Nyeri District, an official from the Kenya Tea Board said
production has dropped to the lowest level and there are
possibilities of some tea factories closing down until September
when weather conditions are expected to improve.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Nation newspaper reported that the severe frost also
destroyed maize and coffee crops. Coffee berries in Nyeri has
fallen off prematurely and maize plants had dried up in cold
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
District agriculture and livestock extension officer J.T.
Muchoki said the bad weather had forced them to revise the
expected harvest this season, and "we expected a harvest of 20
bag of maize (90 kg per bag) per hectare which we have later
revised to 10 bags."
</P>
<P>
Provincial Commissioner Peter Kiilu said about 800,000 people
in the province were faced with famine and needed urgent relief
food because of the cold and dry weather.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Troops Admit Chemical Dumping into S.Korean River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Forces Korea (USFK) Friday
admitted that its headquarters at the Yongsan compound in the
central Seoul dumped toxic chemicals into the Han River.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, the USFK confirmed that its Yongsan
compound released 20 gallons (75.7 liters) of formaldehyde last
February.
</P>
<P>
The chemical was put through a series of waste treatment and is
believed to have been diluted to cause no damage to the
environment, said the press release.
</P>
<P>
South Korean Prime Minister Lee Han-dong Friday said his
government will ask the USFK to take steps to prevent recurrence
of chemical waste dumping.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Korean environment groups held a protest
rally in front of the Yongsan military compound, demanding a
formal apology from the USFK commander and the U.S. ambassador.
</P>
<P>
The Green Korea United (GKU) said it will take the matter to
the G-8 conference in Okinawa and will take steps to receive an
apology from the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference Thursday, the GKU accused the USFK of
secretly discharging some 480 bottles of solution mixed with
formalin and methanol into Han River which passes through the
middle of the capital city.
</P>
<P>
The GKU showed as evidence photos, empty bottles and remaining
solution at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Formalin and methanol are poisonous chemicals that can lead to
mental unrest and memory loss if a person is exposed for a few
hours. Long-term exposure can kill fish and other marine living
things.
</P>
<P>
The USFK is said to have used the chemicals in preserving the
corpses of its servicemen who died from various accidents in South
Korea before repatriation.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat held their first bilateral meeting late Wednesday
night without making progress on any of the core issues, Israeli
officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They described the hour-long meeting, which was also attended by
several advisers from each side, as tough going, and said the Camp
David summit, which enters its fourth day Friday, will probably
last at least another week.
</P>
<P>
Among the ideas said to be floated in earnest is one that would
give the Palestinians land in Israel so as to enable Israel to
maintain control of settlements in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel will make a "substantial" contribution to a new
international organization which will be set up to compensate and
rehabilitate Palestinian refugees, and will absorb tens of
thousands of them as part of a "family reunification" program on a
humanitarian basis, Israeli officials at Camp David revealed.
</P>
<P>
According to a program reportedly presented by Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak to the Camp David summit, Israel will also not
object to the Palestinians referring to these moves as a "
realization of the right of return," so long as no further demands
on Israel are made in this context.
</P>
<P>
Barak will stress, officials said, that Israel refuses to
recognize the Palestinians' right of return home, and will not
accept legal or moral responsibility for creating the refugee
problem, beyond expressing sorrow for their suffering.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- After a series of last-minute false alarms and arguing over
fine print, the Israel Medical Association and the Treasury
Thursday night signed an agreement of principles ending the 127-day
doctors strike.
</P>
<P>
During the last two days of negotiations, the two sides agreed
that the overall wage hike for doctors will be 13.2 percent, which
is about NIS 280 million (about 68.5 million U.S. dollars). Other
still-unresolved wage issues will be arbitrated.
</P>
<P>
In return for the arbitration accord, the doctors agreed to
relinquish their right to strike for a period of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- In an emotional ceremony at Israel's presidential residence,
former President Ezer Weizman and his wife Reuma bid farewell to
the staff that served them during his seven years in office
Thursday and set out for their home in Caesarea.
</P>
<P>
"I have left many jobs in my life, and it's difficult to say
goodbye to the people who have been a part of your life, but this
is the last job I will ever have to leave," Weizman told his staff.
He was forced to leave the post early because of financial
irregularities and subsequent police investigation.
</P>
<P>
Likud legislator Reuven Rivlin will serve as interim president
until Knesset Speaker Avraham Burg returns home from the United
States Friday. Burg will serve until a new president, elected by
secret ballot in the parliament July 31, is sworn in on August 1.

<HEADLINE> Opposition's Bid to Force Early Election Illegal: Zimbabwean Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
dismissed calls by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (
MDC) for the President to step down and pave way for early
presidential elections, local media reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It would be unlawful for civic groups and the MDC to try and
force early presidential election, Minister of Information, Posts
and Telecommunications Chen Chimutengwende said in a statement on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Chimutengwende made the statement in response to a story
published on Thursday's issue of the Financial Gazette which said
the MDC and civic groups would embark on unspecified mass action
to force early election.
</P>
<P>
"Presidential election is scheduled for the year 2002. It would
be totally unacceptable and illegal for the civic groups and the
MDC to organize mass action, anarchy and violence in order to
force the presidential election to be held now instead of the year
2002," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Chimutengwende said if the groups went ahead with their plan,
security forces would be called in to "deal ruthlessly" with the
people involved.
</P>
<P>
The minister said previous mass action has led to anarchy and
destruction, adding that any party that wished to change the law
should do so through Parliament.
</P>
<P>
He called for the opposition to be constructive for the socio-
economic development of the country, rather than be used by
outside forces to destroy the country.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean White Farmers Given Ultimatums to Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Some white commercial farmers in
Zimbabwe have been given up to a week to leave their farms or face
massive disruption of farming operations by war veterans in the
country, The Herald newspaper reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ultimatums come just days before the launch of the
government-sponsored resettlement program.
</P>
<P>
President of the Commercial Farmers Union Tim Henwood Thursday
said about 50 farmers had been served with ultimatums to vacate
their farms.
</P>
<P>
Henwood said the situation on the farms was "too dangerous" as
the war veterans had threatened to attack farmers who refused to
comply with the orders to leave the farms.
</P>
<P>
"They have threatened to kill all farmers who do not get off
the land within their specified period. Although I know of 50
affected farmers now, the situation is spreading throughout the
country," He said.
</P>
<P>
The president noted he had been assured by the police that they
would deal with the situation.
</P>
<P>
"We now await to see the action to be taken by the police to
stop the marauding war veterans causing problems on the farms. The
police have promised that they will bring the situation under
control," he said, adding that the disruption of farming
activities would have serious implications on crop production and
the country's food security.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans have occupied about 1,500 white-owned
commercial farms since February to press for the equitable
redistribution of land to the majority of landless Zimbabweans.

<HEADLINE> Drug Trafficking to Be on Rise in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Drug trafficking and abuse have
been increasing in Zambia, making the country both a transit and a
consumer of drugs, Zambian newspaper "the Post" Friday quoted an
anti-drug official as saying .
</P>
<P>
Drug Enforcement Commissioner Raphael Mungole said on Thursday
that trafficking in heroin and its abuse has become common in the
country and addiction levels would soon outstrip rehabilitation
efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to the commissioner, the problem has been compounded
by Zambia's geographical position and the centrality of the Lusaka
International Airport which makes the country easy to access by
dealers.
</P>
<P>
"The mandrax consignments which are smuggled into South Africa
are exchanged with groceries, motor vehicles and other household
goods which are transported to Zambia in big tracks," he said.
</P>
<P>
Drug Enforcement Commission (DEC) statistics reveal that
between January and June this year, drugs worth 34 billion kwacha
(about 11.3 million U.S. dollars) had been seized.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner disclosed that Zambia's drugs mainly come from
India, Pakistan and Brazil.

Australian Prime Minister John Howard told Melbourne radio

<HEADLINE> Chinese legendary Woman Becomes Disney Heroine (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mulan was eulogized throughout the centuries in China as a
personalized woman for her devotion to the country. And some
Disney producers have also added much ode to her, saying that
Mulan represents the trend of women's liberation and displays the
equality between men and women since she did better than man in a
period when women were always at a subordinate position.
</P>
<P>
However, compared with the brilliance of her popularity, the
temple to Mulan in the village seems somewhat desolate and the
traces of just a few visitors can be seen in the ruderal temple
compound.
</P>
<P>
"Very few people know the hometown of Mulan, despite her story
spreads far and wide, said Ma Jizhong, a local publicity official.
</P>
<P>
The local government held a "Mulan Cultural Festival" in the
village last May, which, to the surprise of local people,
attracted more than 100,000 visitors, many of them came from other
provinces, said Ma, adding that local travel agencies are working
out a new tourist route related to Mulan's hometown.
</P>
<P>
"Mulan Temple is indeed an ideal tourism destination in the
locality, I believe Mulan's hometown will soon become a world
attraction," he said.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of the images of Mulan and the Mulan Temple will
be conducive to educating the public in the status and role of
women in modern China. However, to achieve real equality between
men and women needs a long way to go, and the Mulan Temple might
contribute a bit to that.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legendary Women Becomes Disney Heroine (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGQIU,(Henan Province) July 14 (Xinhua) -- This is a middle-
sized normal village encircled by lush growing trees and bushes,
but here rest at peace a legendary women warrior who is also a
heroine of one of Disney's most successful animated features.
</P>
<P>
The village is the hometown of Hua Mulan-- whose real surname
was Wei -- a young girl believed to be born about 1,300 years ago
in what today is called Dazhou Village in eastern Henan province's
Yucheng county. Her tomb can still be found here.
</P>
<P>
According to both historic records and the folk story, the
delicate young woman disguises herself as a young man to serve in
the army to keep her aging father from having to fight in the
battle field. During the 12-year war with the invading northern
tribes, she carefully hides her true identity and was finally
awarded by the emperor for outstanding military exploits.
</P>
<P>
A memorial temple for Mulan, first erected during the Tang
Dynasty (618-907) and rebuilt in 1994, is now the highest and most
significant building in the village, inside which a two-meter tall
woodcarving figure of Mulan always reminds local people and
visitors of her patriotism and courage.
</P>
<P>
The Disney cartoon "Mulan", based on this Chinese folk story,
has been translated into six languages and attracted worldwide
attention, making Mulan one of the most famous world figures like
Cinderella and Aladdin.

SHANGHAI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Mayor Xu Kuangdi met
here today with William Cohen, defense secretary of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that in 1972, the late U.S. President Richard Nixon and
Chinese late Premier Zhou Enlai signed the well-known Sino-U.S.
Shanghai Joint Communique just in the hall where they are meeting.
Xu said one sentence in the Communique is still fresh in people's
mind, which goes that all Chinese people across the Taiwan straits
hold that there is only one China in the world.
</P>
<P>
Xu said that people will always cherish the memory of those who
have helped lay the foundation for the development of Sino-U.S.
relations.
</P>
<P>
Cohen spoke highly of Shanghai's economic achievements, saying
it is making a miracle. Cohen stated that the U.S. supports China'
s accession to the World Trade Organization as soon as possible,
which is also the need of U.S's interests.
</P>
<P>
He is optimistic about U.S. Senate's approval of China's
Permanent Normal Trade Relations status (PNTR). He believed that
China's prosperity and development have been playing an important
role in maintaining peace and stability of the Asian-Pacific
region.

WELLINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealander who stunned
the footballing world by abstaining from the recent FIFA World Cup
hosting vote has announced his immediate retirement as president
of the Oceania Football Confederation (OFC).
</P>
<P>
Charlie Dempsey caused an international furor over his decision
to abstain from the final crucial vote, effectively handing the
2006 World Cup hosting duties to Germany over South Africa. His
actions disappointed Soccer New Zealand and the New Zealand
government.
</P>
<P>
On his return from the FIFA vote in Switzerland to Auckland,
the largest city in New Zealand, Dempsey said he would step down
as OFC president on October 1, but has now told Soccer New Zealand
his retirement will be effective immediately, according to Friday'
s evening program of Television New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
The 79-year-old soccer stalwart handed his daughter and OFC
general secretary, Josephine King, a letter confirming his
retirement. He said his family had been under "tremendous pressure.
"
</P>
<P>
His sudden retirement means the OFC member nations have to vote
in a new head, which could take place as soon as Sunday next week
when it meets in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
Chief Executive Bill MacGowan of Soccer New Zealand said there
have already been names put forward by those interested in the job
and the New Zealand soccer board will be meeting over the next few
days to decide who they will be backing for the position.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Revenue Earnings Fail to Achieve Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Revenue earnings have
failed to achieve the original and revised targets for the fiscal
1999-2000 despite heavy reducing of the fiscal's target, according
to statistics released by the National Board of Revenue (NBR) here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The collection of tax revenue through NBR during the just-
concluded fiscal amounted to 3.01 billion U.S. dollars as against
the original target of 3.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The collection of revenue has also failed to achieve the
revised target of 3.2 billion dollars fixed for the year 1999-2000
just a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
The figure is, however, 38 million dollars, or 1.28 percent
higher than the amount earned during the same period in the
previous fiscal (1998-1999).
</P>
<P>
The falling industrial performance, port congestion, drop in
imports with high import duties, large-scale smuggling of foreign
goods and fixation of very ambitious targets reportedly were the
main reasons for the decline in revenue collection.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Auto Sales Soar 43 Percent in First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's automobile sales soared
43.1 percent year-on-year in the six months to June, driven by low
interest rates and an improving economic environment, local
industry figures showed Friday.
</P>
<P>
Sales for the six months to June soared to 122,339 units, while
sales in June totaled 23,368 units, an increase of 17.4 percent
from the year before, said Toyota Motor Thailand, which prepares
the figures under an agreement between major car makers here.
</P>
<P>
The slower growth in June was due to price hikes, after a surge
in May, when car sales leapt 52.9 percent year-on-year to their
highest point for 31 months, it said..
</P>
<P>
"The adjustment of prices from time to time in the second
quarter by many auto companies resulted in the halting of sales,"
Toyota said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
But it said that with the planned launch of several new models,
and strong sales promotions, a full-year target of 280,000 units
was expected to be reached.
</P>
<P>
A monthly average of 19,794 vehicles were sold in the first
half of this year, with nearly two-thirds of June's sales were
small pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
The three Japanese auto giants, Toyota, Isuzu and Honda,
dominated the Thai market with 62 percent market share in first-
half sales.
</P>
<P>
Car sales have boomed in Thailand as the economic recovery
gathers pace. Interest rates which soared into double digits
during the
financial crisis from mid-1997 now lie between 4 and 6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Car sales are a key indicator of economic health and are
watched by analysts tracking Thailand's emergence from the 1997-
1998 recession.The government has forecast the economy will grow 5
percent this year.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt to Strive for Economic Recovery: Senior Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government will
make tremendous efforts to push forward its economic recovery
program, a senior official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has made significant achievement in realizing its
economic recovery program, as the country recorded an increase in
its GDP (gross domestic product) by 3.21 percent in the first
three months of this year, Coordinating Minister for Economy,
Finance and Industry Kwik Kian Gie said in an exclusive interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"There are significant achievements we have made. Our GDP in
the first three months of this year increased by 3.21 percent,
investment up by 11.68 percent, exports increased by 9.07 percent
while imports rose by 3.97 percent," Kwik said.
</P>
<P>
"Inflation rate for January-May 2000 stood at 2.35 percent
while tourism (industry) increased by 4.05 percent during January-
April this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
But, Kwik added that the government will still have to get
around to some homework such as foreign debt restructuring and
combating rampant corruption.
</P>
<P>
"And I think this is a key factor to make our currency of
rupiah regain strength. We also should reduce our foreign
borrowings step by step," Kwik said.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has dropped sharply recently amid the rising
struggle among rival political parties in the country. It hit a 16-
month lowest level Wednesday with 9,500 rupiah to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The government set the exchange rate of rupiah within the
current fiscal year at the level of 7,000 per dollar.
</P>
<P>
Some economic observers held that Indonesia is the only country
which has not been able to escape from the economic crisis as its
economic condition is still unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
They said apart from the political and security constraints,
other three main constraints are the very weak fundamental system
of national banks, the burdening bank recapitalization funds and
the very slow corporate debt restructuring.
</P>
<P>
"So, we should accelerate banking restructuring program and
privatization of state-owned companies," Kwik stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said the collapse of the country's banking system has caused
the stagnant flow of fund for programs of the government and
private sectors and the suspension of monetary activities as well.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken 118 actions in connection with our economic
recovery program outlined in the letter of intent (LoI) signed by
the government and the International Monetary Fund. And now we are
in the process to continue our next programs with the Fund," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Indonesia's economic ties with China, the minister
said that Indonesia considered China as a major economic power in
the region.
</P>
<P>
"Well, I can say that China will be able to appear as an
economic major power in the region. China is also a potential
market for Indonesia," Kwik said, hoping that ties between the two
countries will be better and better in the future.

BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China's first pop music odeum made
its debut in the Chinese capital of Beijing recently.
</P>
<P>
Pop music soirees will be held at the odeum every Friday
evening. New songs as well as new singers will be introduced to
the audience while classic pop songs will be reviewed.

<P>
Before the odeum's construction, China had not a single odeum
that was dedicated to pop music shows, despite of the fact that
pop music has won a multitude of fans nationwide.

<P>
Pop singers usually performed in discos and karaoke clubs, with
some top-rated ones occasionally singing at TV shows.

<HEADLINE> Wang Daohan Meets Visitors from Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Wang Daohan, the mainland's top
negotiator with Taiwan, has called for the resumption of talks
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits on the condition that
the Taiwan side stops advocating "two states" theory and sticks to
the "one China" principle.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with a delegation from Taiwan's New Party here
Thursday, Wang, chairman of the Beijing-based Association for
Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), said that the
mainland has been sincere in resuming the talks between ARATS and
Taiwan's Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF).
</P>
<P>
If the SEF recognizes and accepts the consensus on the "one
China" principle reached between the ARATS and SEF in 1992, and if
the Taiwan side clearly commits itself to not advocating the "two
states" theory, the cross-Straits contacts and talks can be
resumed right away, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
However, some people in Taiwan distorted the consensus by
coming up with different interpretations of "one China," which has
actually placed barriers on the resumption of talks between the
two organizations.
</P>
<P>
Adherence to the "one China" principle is a responsibility and
obligation to both sides of the Taiwan Straits. It is the common
aspiration of the people on the mainland and Taiwan that the two
organizations, proceeding from the consensus, resume their talks,
Wang said.
</P>
<P>
Wang held a historic meeting with his Taiwanese counterpart Koo
Chen-fu, chairman of the SEF, in 1993, which led to a series of
technical negotiations. Talks were broken off in 1995 after the U.
S. visit by then Taiwan leader Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with the delegation, Wang also expressed his
welcome to the group, while voicing his hope that the New Party
will play a bigger role in promoting cross-Straits exchanges and
cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Remittance of S.Lankan Migrant Workers Reaches 300 Mln U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan migrant workers have
remitted a record 24 billion rupees (300 million U.S. dollars) in
foreign exchange from January to March this year, the official
Daily News reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Labor Minister John Seneviratne as saying that
a record 90 billion rupees (1.125 billion dollars) is expected
from migrant workers during the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
He said that this clearly indicated that the country's future
earnings in the foreign employment field will improve
significantly.
</P>
<P>
The migrant workers are important for this cash-starved Indian
Ocean island. Sri Lankan working abroad have topped the list of
foreign exchange earners in recent years, sending home 923 million
dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to the Sri Lanka Bureau of Foreign Employment (SLBFE),
the total number of Sri Lankan workers abroad is estimated to be
around 788,000, of whom 65 percent are females mostly in the
Middle East countries as housemaids.
</P>
<P>
More recently Singapore, South Korea and Japan have also opened
their doors to Sri Lankan workers.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing the important role these migrant workers play in
the country's economy, the government has launched on several
welfare schemes for them and their families.
</P>
<P>
The SLBFE has negotiated special facilities for them such as
housing, bank loans, counseling and education facilities.

<HEADLINE> Majority of Finns Opposed to Military Alliance: Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A large majority of the Finnish
people are against military alliance with foreign countries or
military blocs, a poll published Thursday shows.
</P>
<P>
The poll, conducted between May and June by a Finnish defense
publicity organization, shows that 71 percent of the 1,000 pollees
aged from 15 to 74 support the country's current military non-
alliance policy, while 20 percent of them are opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
The rate of non-alliance supporters has remained stable since
the beginning of last year when it rose to 70 percent from 60
percent in the fall of 1998, the organization said.
</P>
<P>
The survey is the seventh conducted annually by the group since
1996. Besides the group, other institutions have also conducted
similar surveys in recent years to monitor public opinion in this
Nordic country.
</P>
<P>
The results of the studies serve as references for the Finnish
government to formulate its security policy. As the European Union
is pushing common defense in Europe, relations between NATO and
non-NATO member states in the EU have become a major part of the
foreign and security policies of Finland.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic, Germany Reach Accord on Nazi Labor Payment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, July 13 (Xinhua) -- A long-awaited agreement on
compensating 67,000 Czech Nazi-era slave and forced laborers has
been reached between the Czech Republic and Germany, local media
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, a total of 423 million marks (282 million U.S.
dollars) will be paid to surviving slave and forced laborers in
the Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
Up to 15,000 marks (10,000 dollars) would be paid to a slave
laborer in Nazi concentration camps, while a forced laborer is
entitled to a maximum payment of 5,000 marks (3,333 dollars). The
fund will come from a compensation foundation set up by the German
business and government.
</P>
<P>
The Czech Republic, Poland, Russia and Ukraine, all of which
have surviving forced laborers, will sign an official declaration
on the compensation to forced laborers with Germany in Berlin next
Monday, it is reported.
</P>
<P>
During World War II, between 10 million and 14 million people
of these countries were forced to work for Nazi Germany, most of
whom were persecuted to death. At present, about 1.25 million
people are believed to be eligible for compensation in Central and
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
In late 1999, the German government and business agreed to pay
10 billion marks (6.67 billion dollars) as compensation to those
victims.

<HEADLINE> More Farmland Needed in China(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua) -- China, a rising giant with 1.3
billion mouths to feed, is now facing a severe task to protect its
decreasing arable land.
</P>
<P>
"The task ahead is tough. If we remain inactive in the face of
decreasing arable land, our food supply will be at risk," said
Wang Tao, an official with the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China has 666 counties whose cultivated land per
capita has fallen below the limit set by the United Nations, which
is 0.25 hectare per person.
</P>
<P>
In central Hubei Province, a major grain and rice producer, the
cultivated land per capita stands at 0.08 hectare, even below the
country's average of 0.11 hectare.
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to develop the land that is suitable for farming,
but has not been tilled before," said Han Yong, head of the
province's land management bureau.
</P>
<P>
"However, the problem is not as easy to solve as expected," he
said. The first problem that needs to be dealt with is where the
money for the reclamation of new land comes from, Han said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Land Management Law, if an individual or a
local government has occupied farmland for non-farming purposes,
they should pay a sum of money to the local land bureau for
developing new land.
</P>
<P>
But many land users failed to do so, leading to a serious
shortage of funds, according to Zhang Wanli, a land expert with
the Ministry of Land and Resource (MLR).

<P>
Moreover, China's current afforestation efforts also put
pressure on those provinces without sufficient arable land for
their population, said Su Weixin, another expert with MLR.
</P>
<P>
"The government's campaign to give some farmland back to nature
cannot be blamed when we consider the deterioration of environment,
but as far as the size of China's population and the subsequent
desperate need for farmland is concerned, it is a disaster," Su
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, China returned 400,000 hectares of arable land to
forest, an increase of 230,000 compared with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Local governments nationwide are now seeking ways out of the
conundrum. In Qianjiang city in Hubei province for example, the
local government has helped move farmers from the countryside to
the town.
</P>
<P>
The relocation method is effective, but requires a lot of money,
expert said. They suggested that local government avoid building
on arable land and those who abuse the land laws be severely
punished.
</P>
<P>
It was also important to make good use of the existing farmland
and to increase yields and improve crop quality, they added.

<HEADLINE> Six Killed in Fresh Clash in Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- At least six people were killed
and 12 others injured in fresh clash in Ambon, capital of
Indonesia's Maluku province, on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims seemed to have been hit by bullets from
security forces as well as from rioters, according to reports
reaching here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The latest clashes erupted after a gunfight occurred between
speedboats off Teluk Ambon Baguala on Thursday morning. News of
the gunfight spread quickly and provoked armed aggressors to take
to the streets.
</P>
<P>
Rioters destroyed at least four houses with bombs and grenades
in the ensuing violence.
</P>
<P>
Security forces appeared unable to prevent the destruction, and
explosions and gunfire were still heard in the city as of late
Thursday evening, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Maluku Governor Saleh Latuconsina refused to comment on this
latest outbreak of violence, but warned that provocateurs were
trying to spread more terror outside the city.
</P>
<P>
"I'm very concerned about this violence and it is up to the
security forces to handle it," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sporadic clashes have continued despite the state of emergency
imposed last month in the Maluku and North Maluku provinces, where
18-month fighting between Muslims and Christians has claimed more
than 3,000 lives.

<HEADLINE> Australia Threatens Fiji with Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard told Melbourne radio
station 3AW that "Mr. Chaudhry was illegally removed in a criminal
act and I think the behavior of the great Council of Chiefs in
bowing to (George) Speight's demands has been to betray the
democratic institutions of that country."
</P>
<P>
On the question of possible sanctions against Fiji, Howard
indicated that Australia was likely to take a stand, possibly on
an economic level and certainly on a personal one.
</P>
<P>
However, he added that "Severe sanctions hurt the people you
are trying to help," and "We are going to try and find the balance
in discussions over the next few days."
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian Broadcasting Company, Australian
Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said Friday before flying home
from Washington that Australia could impose sanctions against Fiji
as early as this weekend and any sanctions would depend on the
make-up of the new government in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
He would meet Prime Minister John Howard this weekend to
discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
"We absolutely would not accept George Speight in the
government or people who have been involved in hostage taking,
people who have been in the parliamentary compound, we've made
that very clear all along," he told the Radio.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian Associated Press reported that Fiji
coup leader George Speight stood up to confront the pressure
saying that there would be continued unrest if the nation was
returned to a constitutional, commonwealth style democracy.
</P>
<P>
He urged Australia and New Zealand to butt out of Fiji's
business and leave it to the native Fijians to direct the country'
s future.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt by anybody to return Fiji to the status quo before
May 19 will be met with the same resistance we showed to the army
of this country," he told the Australian TV Channel Nine.
</P>
<P>
Heading an armed group, Speight took hostage on May 19 ethnic
Indian prime minister Mahendra Chaudhry and about 40 ministers as
well as parliament members of the country. Speight fanned up a
nation-wide unrest to force the military authorities to make a
compromise on Sunday and then the Great Council of Chiefs decided
Thursday to appoint former president Josefa Iloilo new president
of the country as Speight demands.
</P>
<P>
All hostages including Chaudhry were released Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Estrada Insists on No-ransom Police in Hostage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph Estrada
has told three visiting European foreign ministers that he is
standing firm on "no-ransom" policy in dealing with the country's
hostage situation which involves more than 21 foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper of Manila Bulletin said Friday that the president
made this clear when he met the foreign ministers of Germany,
France and Finland Thursday night in the Presidential Palace.
</P>
<P>
Estrada briefed the foreign ministers on the measures the
government has taken to solve the problem. Nationals of all three
European countries are among the captives.
</P>
<P>
The president said he has not set a deadline for the abductors
to release the hostages.
</P>
<P>
He said a military solution to solve the hostage problem is out
of the question, saying that the safety and welfare of the
captives are of paramount concern.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also expressed confidence over the release soon of the
hostages, citing favorable developments in the ongoing
negotiations with the Abu Sayyaf captors.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf abducted 21 Filipino and foreign hostages in a
diving resort in Malaysia on April 23 and taken them to Sulu
province in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The rebels released one Malaysian hostage last month in what
officials described as a "goodwill gesture."
</P>
<P>
However, the Abu Sayyaf subsequently seized 13 Christian
evangelists who traveled to their camp in Patikul, Sulu on July 1
and three French journalists who went there last Sunday to
interview the original hostages.

<HEADLINE> CITIC Industrial Bank Offers New Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 14 (Xinhua)-- The CITIC Industrial Bank, one of
China's rising commercial banks, announced Thursday the debut of
its on-line banking services and credit card, which marked an
upgrade of its traditional businesses.
</P>
<P>
The newly-issued CITIC credit card is believed to be a real one
that fits in with international practice, today's China Daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
Holders of the card can spend before they deposit the money
into their account. They are allowed to withdraw as much as 50,000
yuan (6.025 U.S. dollars) at one time and repay the money in 45
days without paying interest.
</P>
<P>
Although a new commercial bank operating in tune with
international standards and free from the burden of large amounts
of non-performing loans as in State-owned commercial banks, CITIC
said it was "old" in terms of financial product.
</P>
<P>
"All CITIC bank's financial products were traditional and could
not meet the demand of the rapidly developing new economy," said
Wang Jun, CITIC Group board director in an earlier conference.
</P>
<P>
Realizing the impetus brought by Internet on the traditional
banking services, CITIC is actively upgrading its products,
according to Dou Jianzhong, president of the bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank is the first to adopt the certificates of the newly
founded China Financial Certificate Authorization Center (CFCA) to
guarantee the safety of on-line banking, said CFCA General Manager
Liu Dalong.
</P>
<P>
The CFCA was founded by the central bank and 12 major
commercial banks last month, which grants CA certificates to e-
commerce users on the basis of careful credit record inspection.
</P>
<P>
The on-line banking business of Chinese banks have stepped into
actual operational stage, and "Chinese and foreign banks are quite
on the same level in the development of on-line banking," said
Chen Jing, an official with the central bank's payment technology
department.

<HEADLINE> Sacramento to Host U.S. Olympic Trials for Athletics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 13 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Olympic trials for the
athletics will be kicked off on Friday in Sacramento, with the 100-
meter finals scheduled for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Maurice Greene, the world record holder and two-time world
champion in the 100 meters, is heavily favored to win the event in
the trials and the Sydney Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
However, he was admittedly nervous as his opponents feature
other sprinters including Michael Johnson, the Olympic double
champion in the 200m and 400m, and any failure to come home with a
gold medal would be devastating for the confident Greene.
</P>
<P>
"My career would be void ... it would be nothing if I don't get
an Olympic gold medal," said Greene, "It's the biggest meet of my
life. Nothing compares to this, not even the world championships.
"
</P>
<P>
"I'm getting very edgy, very anxious, trying to stay as calm as
possible," said the current top sprinter in the world.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago when Greene was 21, he failed to get through the
quarterfinals of the trials, finishing seventh in his heat, and
sat in the stands and cried uncontrollably during the Atlanta
Games.
</P>
<P>
"I told myself I would never let this happen again without me,"
said Greene, "I'm the world champion and the world-record holder,
but I need to get the gold medal to feel complete."
</P>
<P>
"I want to be the best sprinter ever, and if I don't get the
gold, I can't say I'm the best."
</P>
<P>
While Greene is the favorite for Olympic gold in the 100,
Johnson has that distinction in the 200m as he was the Olympic
champion and world record holder in the discipline.
</P>
<P>
However, the relationship between the two is frosty as Greene
has been bragging about how he is going to beat Johnson while
Johnson has called Greene "immature" and "disrespectful".
</P>
<P>
The two have met twice in the 200 wherein each won once, with
Johnson winning in 1997 and Greene in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Olympic trials will run to July 23, as many an athletes are
seeking their glory moments in the coming Olympic Games, including
world heptathlon record holder Jackie Joyner-Kersee who is hoping
for her fifth consecutive Olympic outing in the long jump.

<HEADLINE> Pastrana Thanks U.S. Contribution to Plan Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres Pastrana
thanked Friday the United States' 1.3 billion dollar contribution
to the "Plan Colombia," aimed at development and the war against
drugs in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
"The international community has accepted, for the first time,
its share in the responsibility for the solution of the drug
trafficking problem," said Pastrana in a communique.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton signed Thursday the law that grants 1.3
billion dollars in special assistance to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), the biggest
guerrilla group in the country, said that Pastrana's Plan Colombia
is a threat for the country and for the peace process because it
is a counter-insurgent offensive disguised as a war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
The FARC said that the U.S. contribution contains a military
link between Washington and the Pastrana project.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. assistance includes the delivery to Colombia of 19 "
Blackhawk" and 42 "Huey" helicopters, as well as the training of a
second Colombian army battalion specialized in the fight against
drugs.
</P>
<P>
The United States' contribution had been requested at the end
of last year by the Pastrana government for the so-called "Plan
Colombia," a project against drugs and for the alternate
development and peace.
</P>
<P>
The program has a cost of 7.5 billion dollars, of which 4
billion dollars will be contributed by Colombia and 3.5 billion
dollars has been pledged by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Colombia obtained last week at a meeting of European donors a
total of 871 million dollars in assistance and credits pledges,
besides the U.S. assistance.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Army Troops Seize Over One Tone of Cocaine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A cargo of 1,259 kilos of cocaine
was seized by army troops in the department of Boyaca in the
center of the country during an operation in which a drug
trafficker died and five more were captured.
</P>
<P>
Military authorities briefed reporters Friday of the seizure of
10,000 dollars in cash, emeralds, diamonds and gold jewelry, which
according to General Fabio Bedoya, the commander of the army unit
that made the confiscation, has a value of more than 300 billion
pesos ( some 236,000 dollars).
</P>
<P>
General Bedoya said that the drug and the valuables were
transported in two pickup trucks, a dump truck and a public
service autobus.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified man died during the combat between the troops
and the drug traffickers, and five more were detained.
</P>
<P>
The army officer said that the destination of the cargo has not
been determined yet, but that it can be supposed that it was
Bogota, the capital of the country, according to the direction the
motorcade was following. The value of the drug was estimated by
Bedoya at 30 million or 40 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Jury Awards $145 billion to Smokers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. jury in Miami ordered
the tobacco industry Friday to pay 145 billion dollars in punitive
damages to sick Florida smokers.
</P>
<P>
The six jurors, after a two-year trial of the case and hearing
157 witnesses, began deliberating the punitive damages question
Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
They deliberated less than five hours before making the record-
shattering verdict that the cigarette companies had claimed would
amount to a "death warrant."
</P>
<P>
This is the first class-action lawsuit against the tobacco
industry by smokers in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The smokers requested the tobacco companies to pay 196 billion
dollars as punishment for making a product that kills 430,000
Americans a year and for misleading the public.
</P>
<P>
Top executives from all five defendants, who made unusual
appearances at the court, argued that they didn't deserve to be
punished because they have changed their ways and are already
committed to paying billions of dollars to settle the lawsuits
brought by the states.
</P>
<P>
Philip Morris Inc.'s attorney, Dan Webb, called the trial
outcome "an unfair procedure, unheard-of in American history."
</P>
<P>
Any verdict in the case will be appealed and could take at
least two years to move through Florida's courts.
</P>
<P>
The defendants are Philip Morris Inc., Brown &AMP; Williamson, R.J.
Reynolds Tobacco Co., Lorillard Tobacco Co., Liggett Group Inc.
and the industry's Council for Tobacco Research and Tobacco
Institute.
</P>
<P>
The ruling was the largest jury damage award ever. The previous
record for punitive damages in a product-liability case was 4.8
billion dollars against General Motors last year in a California
car fire. A judge slashed the award to 1.09 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Volcano Copahue Spews Ashes Column </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Volcano Copahue is spewing a
column of ashes and water steam to a height of some 500 meters,
and the situation in the Chilean side is relatively calm despite
the explosions heard every 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
There is concern among the authorities of the Bio Bio province
for the Pehueche ethnic group community formed by three or four
families who live some 20 kilometers away from the Cophue because
the ashes are raining over their houses.
</P>
<P>
Northwestern winds carry the steam and the ashes over the
mountain range communities in the trans-Andean sector, so this
problem is being evaluated by the Argentine authorities, who plan
to move the inhabitants of the region in case the eruptions
activity increases.
</P>
<P>
Assessments made by Chilean experts determined that the Copahue
eruption will drop in intensity in the next hours. This volcano is
located in the limits between Chile and Argentina and its height
over sea level is 2,965 meters, and has seven craters.

<HEADLINE> WFP Appeals for Relief Food to Kenyans Under Famine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) has
sent another appeal to international community for more emergency
relief food supplies to save million of Kenyans reeling under
ravaging famine currently sweeping across Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The appeal made by WFP Country director for Kenya Arthur
Holdbrook here Friday. The People daily Saturday quoted him as
saying the famine situation was grave and only emergency
intervention from the donors could save the situation as the
famine effects would last for at least the next six months.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that from this month's relief food supplies
projected target of 186,000 tons, only 55,000 tons and 3.1 million
U.S. dollars pledges from the United States and Britain
respectively have been received.
</P>
<P>
This painted a gloomy picture for an estimated 23 million
people in dire need of relief food in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
Arthur Holdbrook said the famine situation in the country is
compounded by lack of any of pledges from the international
community to cater for the month of August.
</P>
<P>
He called on both local and international donors to immediately
send in famine relief supplies in order to avert the catastrophe
that could befall the starving Kenyans if they don not get food in
time.
</P>
<P>
On July 5, WFP made an appeal of 88 million dollars from donors
for relief food to 3.3 million Kenyans under the famine.

</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Ethiopia Jiang Zhengyun and Ethiopian

<HEADLINE> Kenya Lifts Duty on Egyptian Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 15 (Xinhua) -- Kenya moved to diffuse a tariff
dispute with Egypt Friday after it agreed to remove suspended duty
on Egyptian rice, newspapers here reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Minister for Tourism, Trade and Industry Nicholas Biwott
Friday told the press that his government was committed to
adhering to COMESA (Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa)
tariff reductions and launching a free trade area by the end of
October this year.
</P>
<P>
He said the misunderstanding that led to the past allegations
by Egyptian Ambassador to Kenya Rifaat El-Ansary were due to
misinterpretation of Kenyan Gazette notice issued in November 1999,
which had imposed suspended duty on rice, wheat and wheat products.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the Egyptian ambassador said that his
country would impose a 35 percent duty on Kenyan tea due to Kenya'
s suspended duty on Egyptian rice at the port of Mombasa.
</P>
<P>
El-Ansary said here Friday that a big consignment of tea from
Kenya currently detained at Port Said would be released within the
COMESA protocol into Egyptian market.
</P>
<P>
El-Ansary said his country would only lift the 33 percent
tariff on Kenyan tea if the country (Kenya) takes a similar stand
on Cairo products.
</P>
<P>
Biwott reiterated that there was no trade war between the two
countries as it has been alleged, adding that Kenya and egypt
enjoy good bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He, however, regretted the "small" misunderstanding which was
brought about by a break down in communication, adding that the
matter has already been explained to the Egyptian Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Kenya, being COMESA member states, needed to adhere
to the regional tariffs as they are both beneficiaries of the
trade block, the ambassador said.

<HEADLINE> FARC Welcomes U.S. Contribution to "Plan Colombia" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- The Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia (FARC) welcomed resources for 1.3 billion dollars
contributed by the United States to the "Plan Colombia" aimed at
economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
This was stated Friday by Raul Reyes, a FARC spokesman in the
peace negotiations with the government of President Andres
Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome everything that comes for the development of the
country, said Reyes. "We do not oppose investment for social
development. The dollars that will arrive must solve such problems
as unemployment, lack of education and housing, and serve the
development of agriculture and livestock."
</P>
<P>
The rebel leader repeated the FARC opposition to the use of
part of the resources to give the armed forces helicopters and
planes to reinforce the war against drug trafficking "because it
should not be possible to be here talking for peace and at the
same time preparing for more war."
</P>
<P>
This was the first time that the FARC, Colombia's largest rebel
group, expressed acceptance to the U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
Before this announcement, the FARC had said that Pastrana's
Plan Colombia is a threat for the country and for the peace
process because it is a counter-insurgent offensive disguised as a
war against drugs.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. assistance includes the delivery to Colombia of 19 "
Blackhawk" and 42 "Huey" helicopters, as well as the training of a
second Colombian army battalion specialized in the fight against
drugs.
</P>
<P>
The United States' contribution had been requested at the end
of last year by the Pastrana government for the so-called "Plan
Colombia," a project against drugs and for the alternate
development and peace.
</P>
<P>
The program has a cost of 7.5 billion dollars, of which 4
billion dollars will be contributed by Colombia and 3.5 billion
dollars has been pledged by the international community.
</P>
<P>
Colombia obtained last week at a meeting of European donors a
total of 871 million dollars in assistance and credits pledges
besides the U.S. assistance.

<HEADLINE> Chile Not To Raise Tariffs for Entering Mercosur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Finance Minister Nicolas
Eyzaguirre said Friday that his country does not need to raise its
customs tariffs for its admission as a Southern Common Market (
Mercosur) full member.
</P>
<P>
The minister said at the State of Sao Paulo Industries
Federation (FIESP) installations that the next step is to agree on
a calendar for the tariffs of the other countries of the bloc to
be reduced to Chile's level, now 9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Eyzaguirre said that Chile will have, when it becomes a full
member of Mercosur, a term in which it will continue with an
autonomy regarding customs tariffs and freedom to negotiate trade
agreements with other countries or blocs, while the other Mercosur
countries are in the process of adjusting their tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Since Brazil assumed the Mercosur presidency during the second
semester of this year, it has corresponded to President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso to consult with Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay
about the calendar of equalization of tariffs.
</P>
<P>
"If Cardoso has a favorable answer, we can present an advanced
report in Florianopolis by the end of the year," said the Chilean
minister, referring to the Mercosur summit scheduled for December.

<HEADLINE> Argentina Not To Renounce Sovereignty Over Malvinas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President Fernando
de la Rua said Friday that Argentina will not decline its claim of
sovereignty over the Malvinas Islands.
</P>
<P>
De la Rua explained that this does not mean hostility or will
affect the relations of his country with the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The Argentine president made this statement one day after the
Foreign Ministry presented a protest to the United Kingdom for "
violation of the Argentine air space."
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry filed the protest Thursday night after
British aircraft overflew a fleet of Argentine fishing boats that
were operating within its exclusive economic zone and outside the
limits of the Outer Conservation Zone.
</P>
<P>
The British government rejected the Argentine protest, arguing
that "the British aircraft overfly that caused the Argentine
Foreign Ministry protest did not happen over Argentine waters,"
according to a communique issued Friday by the British embassy in
Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
British ambassador in Argentina William Marsden insisted when
he made these statements to the press in the French embassy in
this city that his country is not willing to negotiate the
sovereignty of the archipelago with the Argentine government.
</P>
<P>
However, Marsden considered that the incident in the Southern
Atlantic waters does not mean "a step backward" in the agreement
signed one year ago, and underscored that the relations between
both governments are "close and warm."
</P>
<P>
The two governments signed on July 14, 1999, an agreement that
reestablished the flights between the islands and the continent
and the access of Argentine citizens to the archipelago, which had
been suspended after the 1982 war.

<HEADLINE> E-business Infrastructure Being Deployed in Over 80 Developing Countries Under ITU Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Less than a year after the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) signed a partnership
agreement with Geneva-based World Trade Center and WISeKey,
deployment of e-business infrastructure has started in more than
80 developing countries, the ITU said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ITU Electronic Commerce for Developing Countries (EC-DC)
aims at enabling developing countries to use existing
infrastructures and services to join the digital economy through
non exclusive partnerships with the industry.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased with the level of response received both
from beneficiary countries and from industry partners who
contribute to making this ambitious project a reality", said ITU
Secretary-General Yoshio Utsumi. "The EC-DC project is an ITU
initiative that demonstrates the value of e-commerce in providing
entrepreuneurship and empowerement to developing nations in a
digital world."
</P>
<P>
The project is implementing secure e-business solutions and
services in developing countries, providing an easy start-up
solution to entrepreneurs. In a digital economy, these solutions
and services are required to enable the exchange of mission-
critical business transactions to be conducted in real time and
across multiple market sites with other buyers and suppliers for
financial transactions,procurement, asset management and other
trading resources.
</P>
<P>
Under the EC-DC project, participating countries can benefit
from first-class security, trust and services for e-business
transactions under affordable conditions by pooling and sharing
available resources.
</P>
<P>
Using the World Trade Center network's global infrastructure of
328 centers in more than 100 countries and WISeKey certification
services, countries lacking secure trusted infrastructures,
digital certification and electronic payment facilities can
leapfrog the obstacle by using those of other project participants.
</P>
<P>
For many developing countries, this represents the only cost-
effective way to access e-commerce. In addition to the potential
economic benefits, the project is creating an environment to
stimulate investments and development of the IT infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
According to WISeKey project management plans, it will take a
further three months to have the infrastructure in place with the
appropriate training and installation support, before revenues can
commence to be generated and automatically credited the EC-DC
Trust Fund. This will require further expenditure of approximately
1.5 million U.S. dollars, that will bring the total investment of
WISeKey to approximately four million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Jury Says U.S. Government Not Responsible for Waco Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 14 (Xinhua) -- A U.S. federal jury Friday
found that the government is not responsible for the death of 80
members of the Branch Davidian Sect in the 1993 siege of their
compound in Waco, Texas.
</P>
<P>
The five-member jury's verdict is only an advisory one, and U.S.
District Judge Walter Smithand will possibly make a final ruling
some time next month.
</P>
<P>
Jurors began deliberating Friday in Waco in the latest round of
a seven-year battle between Branch Davidians and the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
The plaintiffs charged that the government should be blamed for
the raid that started the 51-day armed standoff at the Davidian
compound and the final day of the siege, when the building went up
in flames after an FBI tank and tear gas assault.
</P>
<P>
The government argued that the federal agents were ambushed by
heavily armed Davidians in the raid and that suicidal members of
the group set the fires themselves on the final day.
</P>
<P>
"This was one of the most terrible and horrible events in our
history and they want to come into court and ask you to award them
a judgment," U.S. Attorney Michael Bradford, who defended for the
government, said in closing arguments.
</P>
<P>
But plaintiffs' lawyers called the deaths of the cult members "
the greatest domestic law enforcement tragedy in the history of
the United States."
</P>
<P>
The siege has sparked years of Congressional inquiries and
criminal trials. The U.S. Justice Department has appointed an
independent counsel to investigate how federal agents conducted
the operation.

<HEADLINE> Chilean President, Mexican President-Elect Support L. American Front Creation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Chilean President Ricardo Lagos
concurred with Mexican president-elect Vicene Fox in the idea of
creating a Latin American strategic front.
</P>
<P>
Lagos expressed his interest in the promotion of that alliance
in statements made during his visit to Brazil, the "La Tercera"
and "La Nacion" newspapers reported Friday
</P>
<P>
Fox described Chile, Brazil, and Argentina as "the ABC of South
America."
</P>
<P>
The winner of the July 2 Mexican presidential elections will
take office on December 1 as the first president who emerged from
the opposition of that country and whose voters ended 71 years of
the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) presidential hegemony.
</P>
<P>
Both newspaper underscored that Fox seeks a close relationship
with the Lagos government.
</P>
<P>
The first rapprochement of Fox with Chile dates back to 1997
during a forum in Santiago attended by the future Mexican
president when he was Guanajuato state governor.
</P>
<P>
Chilean Defense Vice Minister Gabriel Gaspar said that Fox has
a great interest in the Chilean experience, where ample coalitions
have been the dominant trend of the last three Chilean
administrations.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks End Higher In Third Straight Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks rose in the
third straight session Friday after new data showed more signs of
the slowdown in the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 24.04 at 10,812.75.
The blue chip index rose 331.28 points in the six consecutive
sessions.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mostly higher. The technology
heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 71.32 at 4,246.18 and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 14.14 at 1,509.98.
</P>
<P>
Stocks rose after three economic reports showed that the U.S.
economy was slowing and inflation remains under control in
response to six hikes in interest rates in the past year by the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department reported the Producer Price Index rose a
bigger-than-expected 0.6 percent in June because of the sharp rise
in energy costs. But the core rate of inflation at the wholesale
level, which excludes energy and food costs, fell an unexpected 0.
1 percent in the same month.
</P>
<P>
In another report, retail sales rose by a slightly bigger-than-
expected 0.5 percent, but sales rose just 0.2 percent, weaker than
expectations, when the volatile automobile category was excluded.
</P>
<P>
In a third report, industrial production at factories, mines
and utilities rose a 0.2 percent in June, the slowest pace since
last September.
</P>
<P>
The three reports raised hope that the Federal Reserve would
not raise rates again this year.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 4.09 at 664.80 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 2.95 at 942.38. But the Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 0.13 at 542.63.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,593 up, 1,298 down and 487
unchanged.

NYSE volume declined to 947.15 shares from 1.02 billion in the
previous session.

<HEADLINE> Former Kazakh Premier Released From Rome Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Kazakh Premier Akezhan
Kazhegeldin, arrested at Rome's main airport earlier this week on
the basis of an international warrant, was released Friday, the
Italian Justice Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry issued a statement saying that a Rome appeals
court Friday morning ordered the "immediate release" of
Kazhegeldin, a leading member of the Kazakh opposition who served
as premier in 1994-97.
</P>
<P>
It said that the court had "taken into consideration" Justice
Minister Piero Fassino's request that "the preventive detention be
lifted."
</P>
<P>
Kazhegeldin, 48, was arrested last Wednesday evening after
flying into Fiumicino airport from London and taken to Rome's
Regina Coeli prison on the River Tiber.
</P>
<P>
He is wanted in his home country on various corruption charges,
including money laundering and tax evasion, and is also accused of
"international terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Kazhegeldin and opposition parties insist that he is innocent
and that the charges against him are politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
The Italian Justice Ministry had apparently been investigating
the possibility of complying with a request from Kazakh
authorities for his extradition although no extradition treaty
exists between Italy and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Kazhegeldin had lived abroad, in self-imposed exile, for the
past two years.
</P>
<P>
He was briefly arrested by the Russian authorities last year
after flying into Moscow.

<HEADLINE> Argentina, No.1 L. American Weapons Buyer: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 14 (Xinhua) -- Argentina spent in weapons
last year more than any other Latin American country, as reported
by the U.S. specialized magazine "Arms Trade News" in its most
recent edition.
</P>
<P>
The magazine reported that Argentina spent 223 million U.S.
dollars in the purchase of weapons in 1999, surpassing Brazil by
just 2 million dollars, while Chile was third with 177 million
dollars and Venezuela with 142 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report justified the Argentine expenditure in weapons,
explaining that it does not enforce a mandatory military service,
but a voluntary one, and for that reason it needs more equipment
for the professional military tasks.
</P>
<P>
Argentina bought last year 36 A4-AR fighter bomber planes,
modernized by the Lockheed Company in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that Latin America spent over 5 billion
dollars in ordnance during the last five years (1995-1999).
