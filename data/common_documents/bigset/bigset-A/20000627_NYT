EDITORIAL: EBBING CONFIDENCE IN TOKYO 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, June 27:
</P>
<P>
   Japanese voters handed a well-deserved rebuke Sunday to the
Liberal Democrats, the party that has held power in Tokyo for all
but 18 months since 1955. The chief opposition party, the
reform-minded Democratic Party, gained an impressive 32 seats,
almost as many as the Liberal Democrats lost. But the opposition
forces remain weak and divided, and the present ruling coalition
will retain a slim majority.
</P>
<P>
   The long-run message for the Liberal Democrats, however, is
bleak. Young urban Japanese have grown disenchanted with the
party's factional maneuvering, secretive ways and inability to
extricate the country from a decade-long economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, who is party leader, has further
diminished the Liberal Democrats' appeal through his stumbling
performance. His two months in office have been marred by a series
of verbal blunders, including some disturbing invocations of
Japan's militarist past. During the campaign he invited undecided
voters to ``stay in bed'' on Election Day, a distressing posture
for a leader who should be expanding democratic participation. Mori
is expected to stay in office through next month's G-8 economic
summit meeting in Osaka. But he will probably be replaced as prime
minister before elections for Parliament's upper house next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democrats' problems run deeper than one individual,
of course. Established during the Cold War as a bulwark against
Communism and Socialism, the party has had little competition from
other parties. With all meaningful politics occurring inside party
ranks, the Liberal Democrats developed strong internal factions,
glued together by campaign cash and patronage. Factional leaders
secretively manage all important decisions, including the choice of
prime ministers, with no public accountability. The selection of
Mori, after the sudden disability of his predecessor, was handled
particularly clumsily.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberal Democrats' main strategy against recession has been
public works spending, with projects awarded disproportionately to
rural districts where the party is strong. This has alienated urban
voters and has created huge deficits without triggering sustained
growth. A healthy recovery is unlikely without broad reforms,
including the kind of aggressive deregulation the Liberal Democrats
traditionally resist.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Democrats do not have a fully convincing economic
program either. They strongly favor needed deregulation, but they
also campaigned for public spending cuts and tax increases. With
Japan's economy barely stirring, such deflationary policies would
be a serious mistake.
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, it is the policy choices of the Liberal
Democrats that count. Sunday's stinging reverse should spur the
party to adopt a more transparent leadership process and to embrace
the necessity for economic reform. &QL;

CONGRESS REJECTS FUNDING CURB ON SMITH &AMP; WESSON DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN A. HOLMES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the second time in less than a week, the House
of Representatives turned back an effort to scuttle an agreement
between the Clinton administration and Smith &AMP; Wesson on gun
marketing and safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 201-196, the House defeated a measure by Rep. John
Hostettler, R-Ind., that would have prevented the Justice
Department from spending any money to implement or enforce the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson and the administration remain at odds on just
what the agreement requires.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was virtually a mirror image of the tally last
Wednesday when the House defeated an earlier amendment, also
sponsored by Hostettler, that would have barred the Department of
Housing and Urban Development from spending any money to carry out
the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not gun control,'' said Rep. Carolyn B. McCarthy, a
Long Island Democrat who spoke out against the amendment and in
support of the agreement. ``This is gun safety where a manufacturer
comes before us and says it will do what it can to make our
communities safer.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's action is the latest twist in the effort by the Clinton
administration to break the solid wall of opposition to gun control
by the nation's gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   In March the administration announced that it had reached an
agreement with Smith &AMP; Wesson, the country's oldest and largest
maker of firearms and a unit of Tomkins PLC of Britain. In return
for Smith &AMP; Wesson's entering into the agreement, the
administration and several cities agreed to drop their lawsuits
seeking to recover the expenses to government they contend result
from gun violence. Smith &AMP; Wesson was one of several gun
manufacturers being targeted by the lawsuits, which are still
pending, and the only one that agreed to the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the accord commits the company to placing a
second serial number that would be hidden on all new guns to make
it harder for criminals to erase a gun's identification.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Smith &AMP; Wesson agreed to provide all new guns with
trigger locks and to promise to use 2 percent of its revenues to
develop so-called smart-gun technology that would allow a weapon to
be fired only by its owner.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more contentious parts of the agreement was the
requirement that all Smith &AMP; Wesson-certified dealers make buyers
wait 14 days before buying a second handgun, and the promise,
administration officials say, by Smith &AMP; Wesson not to sell any
firearms at gun shows where background checks of buyers are not
conducted.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks after the agreement, however, the administration
and Smith &AMP; Wesson diverged in their interpretation of this
critical provision.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials contend that the agreement barred the
company from selling firearms at shows where sellers _ whether they
are employed by Smith &AMP; Wesson or not _ do not conduct checks into
buyers' background.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson officials contend that the provision applies only
to gun shows where Smith &AMP; Wesson employees do not conduct
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   Should Hostettler's amendment have passed, and should Smith &AMP;
Wesson and the administration fail to resolve the differing
interpretations, the Justice Department would have been prevented
by lack of funding from going into court to force the Springfield,
Mass., company to comply with the administration's interpretation
of the accord.

 (The Science Times)  
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The human genome is in hand. The set of instructions embodied in
the ancient chemical deoxyribonucleic acid, at least 3.5 billion
years in the making, has been made fully visible for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   The manual with the specifications for the human species comes
in 24 tapes of DNA, one for every chromosome _ an X and Y sex
chromosome and 22 others _ each carrying one long, punctuation-free
sentence in evolution's four-letter programming code. On first
inspection, these ancient texts are as incomprehensible as a
message from another planet.
</P>
<P>
   The genome, as any message from another world, will surely
change this one when its full meaning is understood.
</P>
<P>
   Although exploration of the genome has begun, it will be decades
before every detail is thoroughly known.
</P>
<P>
   The first practical impacts will be in health. The genome is
widely expected to revolutionize the practice of medicine. Its
sequence is already being mined for the levers of the body's own
communications system, including the signals that direct cells to
repair damaged tissue and fight off invaders. The use of these
signals as drugs may develop into a new mode of therapy, one that
Dr. William Haseltine, president of Human Genome Sciences, has
termed ``regenerative medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Another predicted advance, though not so immediate, is that of
personalized medicine _ treatment and preventive programs that are
tailored to the individual based on a genomic analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But the genome's writ reaches beyond medicine and will in time
redefine knowledge of ourselves, our history, our innate capacities
and our relationship to the rest of creation. The conditions of
human existence, the reach of human abilities, the purpose of life
_ at least in a biological sense _ have boundaries that are
engraved in the genome's gnomic text.
</P>
<P>
   In defining the human species, the genome assumes distinctive
flourishes in the major ethnic groups that developed as humans
spread throughout the world, and specifies the genetic endowment of
individuals. All individuals, save identical twins, are unique
because their genomes are one of a kind. These underlying
differences, for good and for ill, can now be spelled out for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   For the many who are fascinated by their origins and family
history, the human genome will provide answers. Already a company
called Oxford Ancestors (www.oxfordancestors.com) offers to tell
people which of 30 founding human lineages they belong to, based on
analysis of their DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Less beneficial may be the power of genetic differences, even
entirely inconsequential ones, to divide or be cited as the
justification for division and discord. ``Most geneticists wax
euphoric that so many of our genes are in common, that the genome
map will show us to be a happy band of brothers and sisters,'' says
Dr. Arthur L. Caplan, an ethicist at the University of
Pennsylvania. ``I doubt it.''
</P>
<P>
   Caplan fears people ``will use this information to bolster
racial and ethnic prejudices and other exclusivity groupings they
believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   The genome, once interpreted, is knowledge that will provide the
means to change the human genetic inheritance, usurping control of
human biological destiny from the blind forces of natural selection
and random change that have shaped it up till now.
</P>
<P>
   In principle, it may be possible to correct disease-causing
genes, even design a genome optimized for health and longevity.
Whether to try and improve the human genetic allotment, at the risk
of changing human nature as well, will not be a straightforward
choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that knowledge about different alleles will
create the temptation to optimize one's offspring in terms of their
genetic endowment,'' said Dr. Robert Weinberg of the Whitehead
Institute in Cambridge, Mass., referring to the different forms the
same gene may take in different people.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery of the genes that may underlie intelligence, for
example, would open ``a whole Pandora's box of possibilities, where
someone like myself is no more qualified than someone with a
minimal understanding of genetics to make ethical and moral
choices,'' Weinberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to be a societywide debate,'' he said, ``not one
involving just geneticists or bioethicists.''
</P>
<P>
   ANNOTATING THE GENOME
</P>
<P>
   Biologists face years of preparatory work in understanding the
various levels of the genome's operation.
</P>
<P>
   Possession of the genome will transform biology from a cottage
industry, where one gene and protein were studied at a time, to a
far different scale of operation in which all of a cell's genes, or
all its proteins, are examined in parallel.
</P>
<P>
   To generate and analyze the genomic information, a slew of new
disciplines is emerging.
</P>
<P>
   There is bioinformatics, or computational genomics, the art of
writing computer programs to ``annotate'' the genome, which
includes finding and analyzing all its genes. There is proteomics,
a set of methods for examining all of cell's many different
proteins en masse, instead of one by one. There is
pharmacogenomics, the matching of drugs to individuals on the basis
of genetics.
</P>
<P>
   With the human genome sequence now in hand, the first task is
annotation, a word borrowed from computer programmers' practice of
writing explanations alongside the major routines in a piece of
software. The genome is biological programming, but evolution has
neglected to provide even the punctuation to show where genes stop
and start, let alone any helpful notes as to what each gene is
meant to do.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of punctuation makes the genes very hard to identify.
Each gene is broken into several separate parts, known as exons,
and the exons are strung out along the ribbon of DNA so sparsely
that they account for only 97 percent of the genome's three billion
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Human cells have no trouble spotting the genes and regularly
make copies of active genes. Biologists have learned how to capture
these copies and analyze fragments of them. By comparing the
sequence of DNA letters in each part of the genome with a library
of these fragments, annotators can pick out many of the exons.
</P>
<P>
   Once a gene has been identified, annotators can often guess what
it does by comparing its sequence of DNA letters with that of genes
whose function is already known. The genomes of many bacteria and
two animals (the roundworm and the fruit fly) have already been
sequenced and annotated, and the roles of many of their genes have
been identified. Because of the unity of evolution, the sequence of
every human gene is recognizably similar to the equivalent gene in
other organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Even more useful for interpreting the human genome will be that
of the mouse, whose genome is now being deciphered by a public
consortium of academic centers and the Celera Genomics Group of
Rockville, Md., the two groups that completed the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The best way of finding the human genes may be simply to lay the
human and mouse genomes side by side and look for places where the
sequence of DNA letters is similar. Biologists expect that the DNA
sequence in the genes will have stayed much the same in the 100
million years since the two species shared a common ancestor but
that the rest of the DNA will be different.
</P>
<P>
   In the organisms whose genomes have been decoded so far, about a
third of the genes are novel, with no matches in the databases. The
mouse will help assign roles to novel human genes too because its
counterpart genes can be deleted to create strains of `knock-out'
mice. Knock-out mice often reveal by their defects the natural
functions of the gene they lack.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PROTEINS AND CELLS
</P>
<P>
   The role of most genes is to make specific proteins, which are
the working parts of human cells. Depending on the nature of its
string of subunits, which are specified by its gene, a protein can
serve a structural purpose, like a collagen fiber, or catalyze some
chemical reaction important to the cell's metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   Although many proteins of interest have been studied in great
detail, the annotated genome will provide for the first time a
comprehensive parts list of all the proteins the body makes.
</P>
<P>
   Defects in these working proteins, caused by mutations in their
parent genes, are responsible for much of the burden of human
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the role of every human protein _ proteomics _
will be one of the goals of the post-genome era. The sequence of a
protein, meaning the composition of its subunits, can be predicted
from the sequence of DNA letters in its parent gene, but many
proteins are further processed by the cell in ways that cannot yet
be predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Another initiative made possible by the genome is the complete
understanding of the human cell. Thousands of genes may be active
in a cell at any time, and the cast of players changes when the
cell performs different roles, like responding to a hormone or
slipping into cancerous activity.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently it has been out of the question to study so many
genes simultaneously. But new instruments known as gene expression
chips allow researchers to track which of a cell's genes are
active.
</P>
<P>
   Gene expression chips are made in different ways but all require
prior knowledge of the genes' DNA sequence, now available from the
genome.
</P>
<P>
   The chips may also help elucidate the difference between the 220
known cell types of the human body.
</P>
<P>
   Although every cell possesses its own full copy of the genome,
each type is thought to use only its own special subset of the
genes, the rest being permanently switched off.
</P>
<P>
   The body is a kind of repressive socialist state where every
cell is equal but each must respond precisely to collective
authority or receive orders to self-destruct. The genome is the
authority's archive, containing the plans for each type of cell,
the master program for generating a 10-trillion-celled organism
from a single egg, and the life cycle instructions that guide it
from birth to adolescence and maturity.
</P>
<P>
   TRACKING HUMAN VARIATIONS
</P>
<P>
   In parallel with finding all the genes in the genome, biologists
will also try to track the major variants in DNA sequence found in
the human population. Any two individuals differ on average in one
nucleotide, or DNA unit, in every thousand.
</P>
<P>
   These one unit changes are known as single nucleotide
polymorphisms, or SNPs, and are a principal source of human genetic
variation.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of SNPs, or ``snips,'' should help track down the
variant genes that contribute to disease. Many common diseases,
like diabetes and heart disease, are thought to be caused by
several variant genes acting together. Because each variant makes
only a small contribution to the disease, these genes have hitherto
been particularly hard to identify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly feel this is going to revolutionize medicine because
we are going to understand not only what causes disease but what
prevents disease,'' said Dr. Stephen T. Warren, a medical
geneticist at Emory University in Atlanta and editor of The
American Journal of Human Genetics. ``We will understand the
mechanism of disease sufficiently to do rational therapy. We will
be able to predict who is at higher risk for particular disease and
provide advice to individuals as to how best to maintain their
health.''
</P>
<P>
   ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS
</P>
<P>
   The ability to diagnose vulnerability to disease on a genomewide
basis will multiply the quandaries already raised by the present
level of genetic testing. Probably almost everyone possesses many
gene variants associated with adverse health effects. This
information could be used to the individual's detriment, if not
kept confidential, and could be psychologically devastating if
diagnosis runs ahead of treatment and the physician has no therapy
to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric S. Lander of the Whitehead Institute has contemplated a
``snip chip'' that would diagnose all the major SNPs, or gene
variants, found in the population. Such information would hold
considerable potential for forecasting an individual's medical
fate.
</P>
<P>
   These snip chips are unlikely to be developed soon and their
predictive powers should not be feared, said Dr. James Watson,
president of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think young people are the ones who are afraid to see the
future,'' Watson said. ``Old people see the future and would like
to reverse it.''
</P>
<P>
   Single nucleotide polymorphisms and other genetic elements are
useful in a quite different dimension, that of tracking the
movements of the earliest human populations within Africa and as
they spread throughout the rest of the world. By selecting SNP's
that arose in the course of this expansion, population geneticists
can track genetic differences that are specific to particular
continents and major ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these SNPs lie in regions of the genome that do not code
for genes and have no effect on the body.
</P>
<P>
   Population geneticists know that all people are extremely
similar to one another in genetic terms and believe that the
similarities overwhelm the very minor differences that they are
studying.
</P>
<P>
   But others fear the differences may not be used so benignly.
Caplan, the University of Pennsylvania ethicist, believes
geneticists underestimate both the appetite for this genetic
information and its potential for misuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize how important that drive is to understand
ourselves,'' he said. ``In most parts of the world we define
ourselves by blood and kin, and those are just surrogates for
genes.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the genetic kits have been developed to determine who
is of American Indian ancestry, say, ``It would not surprise me to
see eligibility for casino gambling profits requiring a genetic
test,'' Caplan said. ``We could find people asking who is the
`real' Jew or black person or Serbian.''
</P>
<P>
   He also foresees SNPs being used in conjunction with brain scans
to uncover genetic markers for personality traits like antisocial
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big surprises for the man in the street will be how
much of our behavior is hard-wired,'' Caplan said. ``And the people
involved in the mapping are medical people who don't spend much
time thinking about the historical and social implications. So
there will be lots of bombshells, some of them sadly revisiting
some of the bigotry that has cycled around genetics for many
years.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW TEMPTATION
</P>
<P>
   Like all powerful knowledge, the genome can be put to good and
bad ends depending on how carefully the knowledge is used. The more
harmful genetic variants are discovered, the more compelling the
logic may seem of fixing the bugs in the genomic programming
directly instead of treating the symptoms in each generation, a
procedure called germ-line gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is hardly pressing: Gene therapy applied to treat
ordinary body cells has so far been a failure. But in time the
technique will doubtless work, and the knowledge may be developed
to reprogram the human genome, perhaps to strip it of many known
disease-causing and life-shortening SNPs.
</P>
<P>
   Control of the genome would then fall to some extent under human
direction, bringing vast benefits for health and longevity, but
raising a dire risk of changing human nature in unintended and
unwarranted ways.
</P>
<P>
   The genome, the long-sought manual of evolution's biological
programming, comes with no warning labels as to careful reading and
cautious use. Maybe neither is necessary.

 &HT;    BATTLE OF THE HUNKS: GIBSON VS. CLOONEY(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week, Mel Gibson goes toe to toe with George Clooney in the
blockbuster fight of the summer - Gibson in (beginitalic)The
Patriot (enditalic)vs. Clooney in (beginitalic)The Perfect
Storm(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   It's a box-office title bout that almost never came off.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it nearly was Mel vs. Mel.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, (beginitalic)Storm(enditalic)'s producers wanted
Gibson to play the fishing boat captain whose small craft is
trapped in a horrific storm. But the studio balked at his asking
price, a reported $25 million. Besides, he was busy making his
Revolutionary War epic, (beginitalic)The Patriot(enditalic), also
known as (beginitalic)Braveheart With Muskets(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   So, Warner Bros. hired Clooney, reportedly paying him about half
what Gibson wanted.
</P>
<P>
   With both movies opening this week ((beginitalic)Patriot
(enditalic)on Wednesday and (beginitalic)Perfect Storm
(enditalic)on Friday), it sets the stage for a pivotal battle
between Hollywood hunks.
</P>
<P>
   You have Gibson, the established star with an unbelievable track
record at the box office, against Clooney, an up-and-comer who has
experienced critical success ((beginitalic)Three Kings(enditalic))
but has yet to approach Gibson's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, can (beginitalic)The Perfect Storm
(enditalic)put Clooney in Gibson's league, or will the concept and
special effects swallow him whole, much like they did in
(beginitalic)Batman &AMP; Robin(enditalic)?
</P>
<P>
   The jury's still out, but this role should move Clooney up the
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson and Clooney aren't that different, at least in terms of
appeal. Both are handsome diablos, dominating those ubiquitous
``sexiest man'' lists. Although self-deprecating in person, they
play their parts broadly, almost winking at the camera with a Cary
Grant-type charm that makes audiences smile.
</P>
<P>
   They've paid their dues. Gibson, who at 44 is five years older,
first popped up in (beginitalic)Mad Max (enditalic)(1979), a
stylish film about cops and crooks in a brutal, futuristic
Australia. It led to two sequels, but Gibson didn't really make his
presence felt until (beginitalic)Lethal Weapon (enditalic)(1987),
teaming with Danny Glover as a sometimes-suicidal,
always-wisecracking maverick detective.
</P>
<P>
   The (beginitalic)Lethal Weapon (enditalic)series was enormously
successful at the box office, as even the wretched fourth
installment cracked the $100 million mark. In recent years, Gibson
has cranked out a succession of other hits, most notably

CALLED `THE NEW FDR,' BUSH MAKES APPEALS TO IMMIGRANTS AND BLACKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs 15th graf starting: The Bush campaign, etc., for
corrections)  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George W. Bush continued Monday to present
himself as a ``different kind of Republican,'' describing an
immigrant-friendly approach to the bureaucratic Immigration and
Naturalization Service, and making a broad appeal to black voters
in an address Monday night in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush lauded racial harmony in the dinner speech before the
Congress of Racial Equality at a midtown hotel. He said he wanted
to fund mentoring programs for children whose parents are in prison
and rally ``the vast armies of compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those on the dais were Wayne LaPierre, executive director
of the National Rifle Association; Bob Grant, the conservative
radio talk-show host; Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, and descendants of
Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemmings, Jefferson's slave, and his
first wife, Martha.
</P>
<P>
   In introducing Bush, Roy Innis, chairman of CORE, said: ``He
loves people, he relates to people, he is the new FDR.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen P. Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, said Bush was dedicating
himself this week to making a broad appeal across party lines to
groups that traditionally lean Democratic. Tuesday he plans to
discuss welfare-to-work programs in Michigan, and Wednesday he
plans to speak in Ohio about removing barriers to those with
disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   On immigration, the Texas governor said he would propose
legislation to split the INS into two separate agencies, one to
deal with law enforcement and the other to provide services to
immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   For years, officials across the political spectrum have
supported restructuring the unwieldy immigration service, and two
bills are moving through the Republican-controlled Congress to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who was addressing the League of United Latin American
Citizens at a conference Monday in Washington, spoke in brief
generalities, saying that as president he would ``reform the INS''
and that he wanted a ``more humane'' approach to immigration.
</P>
<P>
   But his aides said later that while he would propose his
legislation, he favored the approach being advanced by Sens.
Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., and Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass.. Their
bill is viewed by pro-immigration groups as more helpful to
immigrants than the bill in the House proposed by Republican Reps.
Lamar Smith of Texas and Harold Rogers of Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   The chief difference between the bills is that Abraham's, in
splitting the agency in two, would put one person in charge to
supervise both the law enforcement and service functions to make
sure that they would be taking consistent legal and policy
approaches. It also sets deadlines for processing visas, rather
than letting them drag on.
</P>
<P>
   Pro-immigrant groups worry that if the agency is split into two
separate entities with two separate top executives, the law
enforcement branch would consume most of the money and that the
services for immigrants would get short shrift. The enforcement
side gets the lion's share of the agency's money now, but backers
of the Abraham bill hope that would change.
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, Bush's spokesman, said that the governor was not
endorsing any particular legislation but added, ``There are no
differences between the governor's bill and Abraham's bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush's language was vague and his view seems to differ
little from that of the Clinton administration and Vice President
Al Gore, the point was to distinguish himself from the immigration
Republican politics of yore.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outreach, it's the governor following through on his
promise that the Republican Party has to be the party of inclusion,
for single moms, for new citizens coming to America,'' Fleischer
said. ``It's different from a lot of the sights and sounds that
people have been hearing from the Republican Party in recent
years.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign has been working to change the reputation the
party gained in 1994 when some prominent Republicans, including
Pete Wilson, then the governor of California, backed Prop. 187 in
California to deny medical and education services to children of
illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did not comment directly on Prop. 187 at the time, saying
he did not want to tell another state what to do, but said he would
educate all children. And in speaking to the Latino group Monday,
he reiterated his opposition to ``English Only'' programs, saying
he favored ``English Plus,'' which teaches children English but
encourages them to learn other languages.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would grant tourist visas to immigrants who were
waiting for their visas if their spouse or child had already
received permanent legal residency status. Now, such family members
are ineligible to visit, on the theory that they would try to stay
in the United States illegally if their spouse or parent had legal
status.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Sharry, executive director of the National Immigration
Forum, said in a telephone interview that Bush's advocacy of
splitting the immigration service in two was ``not exactly a
profile in courage,'' since almost everyone supports it.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was more interesting that Bush had not mentioned
other issues of importance to Latino voters and especially
immigrants, like the H-1B visa bill, which would raise the number
of visas granted to high-tech workers from abroad. Bush supports
increasing the number of visas, but Republicans _ and Democrats,
particularly those from organized labor _ are divided over whether
this is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't speak to the tough issues, though he's trying to
present himself as a new kind of Republican,'' Sharry said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who is also courting the Hispanic vote, is to address the
Latino group on Friday. Douglas Hattaway, a Gore spokesman, said
the vice president wanted to streamline the immigration agency.
``Bush would start from square one and we don't think that's
necessary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Commenting more broadly on Bush's approach, Hattaway said:
``Bush is clearly trying to make himself out to be a different kind
of Republican by appearing friendly to immigrants. But under his
leadership in Texas, Hispanics are not doing as well as other
residents.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Hispanics in Texas were disproportionately poor, in part
because Texas has a minimum wage of $3.35 an hour, compared with
the federal minimum of $5.15 an hour.

IT'S TIME TO MAKE THE RUN

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The Anaheim Angels packed their equipment and
loaded their bags Monday afternoon and headed for Seattle after a
10-6 home loss Sunday to the Minnesota Twins. Noticeably absen
luggage was any sign of momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels begin a critical 10-game stretch tonight against the
Mariners and Oakland Athletics, whom they trail by 5 and 5 games,
respectively, in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have won their last six and 12 of 15, and the
Athletics have won nine of their last 10. The Angels, meanwhile,
lost two of their last three to the lowly Twins. If those trends
don't get reversed, the Angels might find themselves with a
double-digit deficit by the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say there's a sense of urgency as much as this is
where you want to be,'' first baseman Mo Vaughn said. ``When you're
going head to head, it's time to make your move.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is to be in position at the All-Star break.
Then you get hot and make your run in the second half. If we're
(behind) five or six games at the break, we're right there.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Angels are to get there, they'll have to do a better job
pitching and hitting than they did over the weekend when they split
four games with the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrod Washburn, coming off three straight brilliant outings,
was the third consecutive starter to get shelled against a team
that is 13th in the league in batting average and runs. The
left-hander, who had allowed a total of three earned runs in his
last three starts, was raked for eight runs and eight hits in just
3 innings, his shortest outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I got knocked back down to earth a little bit,''
Washburn said. ``(The Twins) are making adjustments, but I know I
didn't do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn's performance is symptomatic of a staff whose biggest
winner, with six victories, is reliever Shigetoshi Hasegawa. The
young guys, like Washburn and Brian Cooper, are inconsistent, and
the veterans, like Tim Belcher, Ken Hill and Kent Bottenfield, have
been too frail.
</P>
<P>
   The four big bats in the middle of the lineup _ Vaughn, Tim
Salmon, Garret Anderson and Troy Glaus, who missed the last two
games with back spasms _ batted a combined .159 in the seven-game
homestand.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Angels do hit _ with the exception of Darin Erstad
_ it's rarely been in the clutch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play 21 straight days heading into the All-Star break and
20 in a row after,'' Scioscia said. ``There's not as much of an
opportunity to get them off their feet as much as I'd like.''
</P>
<P>
   Scioscia, whose team hasn't won more than three in a row all
season, insisted his team is playing good baseball and thinks a
winning stretch is looming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, I'd like to be in first place,'' Scioscia said.
``But where we are is a position we can strike from. . . . The
challenge is to play consistent baseball. I think it's a matter of
time, whether it's right now or a month from now.''

KINGS SPEAK WITH LINDROS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ Los Angeles Kings general manager Dave
Taylor spoke Monday to Eric Lindros about playing in Los Angeles,
but the Philadelphia Flyers center remains uncertain whether he is
ready to resume his career after suffering four concussions in the
past year.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings have joined the New York Rangers and Toronto Maple
Leafs in pursuit of Lindros, the former Flyers captain and one of
the game's brightest stars whose time in Philadelphia appears over
amid charges that the club mishandled the treatment of his head
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers want to trade his rights before Saturday, the day
Lindros can become an unrestricted free agent. Any club wanting to
sign him would have to give Lindros $8.5 million, which is what he
earned last season.
</P>
<P>
   That has limited the bidding to teams from the league's biggest
markets. The Kings claimed this past season they would lose money
even after moving into the Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said last month he has been given the green light to
spend money to upgrade the club.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros grew up in Toronto, which is the richest club in Canada.
The Rangers have the NHL's largest payroll.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest issue, however, is health. Lindros suffered his
latest concussion in late May during Game 7 of the Eastern
Conference finals against New Jersey. Taylor called his
conversation with Lindros ``a general discussion'' and refused to
discuss specifics about the center's condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spoke,'' Taylor said, ``but I think it would be
inappropriate to say anything further about Eric or our dealing
with the Flyers.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason is simple. No one, not even Lindros, knows whether he
is going to play again. Lindros, who missed 27 games last season,
has discussed taking off a season. He has talked about playing in
Europe, where the game is less physical.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's message to Taylor was no different than the one Lindros
gave Sunday to new Rangers general manager Glen Sather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Glen I don't know if I can play yet,'' Lindros told the
Philadelphia Inquirer. ``Right now, so much is up in the air. I
myself have to make a decision on whether I will play again and
whether it is worth playing again.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros has had six concussions in his career. Three years ago,
his brother Brett retired early from the New York Islanders because
of the effects of several concussions.
</P>
<P>
   He has reported some improvement but also says he still is
having headaches related to the concussions.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros' rift with the Flyers escalated late in the regular
season when he believed the club withheld the severity of his head
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia general manager Bobby Clarke has said Lindros is
ready to resume playing. But the final decision will be based in
part on the findings of Chicago-based neurologist James Kelly, who
has been treating Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the Flyers' leverage with other clubs is that
Kelly has not released his findings on Lindros' fitness to play and
is out of the country.

 &HT;    BATTLE OF THE HUNKS: GIBSON VS. CLOONEY(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By BILL MULLER(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This week, Mel Gibson goes toe to toe with George Clooney in the
blockbuster fight of the summer - Gibson in (beginitalic)The
Patriot (enditalic)vs. Clooney in (beginitalic)The Perfect
Storm(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   It's a box-office title bout that almost never came off.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it nearly was Mel vs. Mel.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, (beginitalic)Storm(enditalic)'s producers wanted
Gibson to play the fishing boat captain whose small craft is
trapped in a horrific storm. But the studio balked at his asking
price, a reported $25 million. Besides, he was busy making his
Revolutionary War epic, (beginitalic)The Patriot(enditalic), also
known as (beginitalic)Braveheart With Muskets(enditalic).
</P>
<P>
   So, Warner Bros. hired Clooney, reportedly paying him about half
what Gibson wanted.
</P>
<P>
   With both movies opening this week ((beginitalic)Patriot
(enditalic)on Wednesday and (beginitalic)Perfect Storm
(enditalic)on Friday), it sets the stage for a pivotal battle
between Hollywood hunks.
</P>
<P>
   You have Gibson, the established star with an unbelievable track
record at the box office, against Clooney, an up-and-comer who has
experienced critical success ((beginitalic)Three Kings(enditalic))
but has yet to approach Gibson's numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, can (beginitalic)The Perfect Storm
(enditalic)put Clooney in Gibson's league, or will the concept and
special effects swallow him whole, much like they did in
(beginitalic)Batman &AMP; Robin(enditalic)?
</P>
<P>
   The jury's still out, but this role should move Clooney up the
ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson and Clooney aren't that different, at least in terms of
appeal. Both are handsome diablos, dominating those ubiquitous
``sexiest man'' lists. Although self-deprecating in person, they
play their parts broadly, almost winking at the camera with a Cary
Grant-type charm that makes audiences smile.
</P>
<P>
   They've paid their dues. Gibson, who at 44 is five years older,
first popped up in (beginitalic)Mad Max (enditalic)(1979), a
stylish film about cops and crooks in a brutal, futuristic
Australia. It led to two sequels, but Gibson didn't really make his
presence felt until (beginitalic)Lethal Weapon (enditalic)(1987),
teaming with Danny Glover as a sometimes-suicidal,
always-wisecracking maverick detective.
</P>
<P>
   The (beginitalic)Lethal Weapon (enditalic)series was enormously
successful at the box office, as even the wretched fourth
installment cracked the $100 million mark. In recent years, Gibson
has cranked out a succession of other hits, most notably
(beginitalic)Ransom (enditalic)and
(beginitalic)Braveheart(enditalic), the Scottish war epic that he
also directed.
</P>
<P>
   Clooney was raised in a show-biz family (his father is a host on
the American Movie Classics cable channel, and his aunt is jazz
singer Rosemary Clooney), but he was humbled early on.
</P>
<P>
   He did 13 failed television pilots and starred in an awful
B-movie, (beginitalic)Return of the Killer Tomatoes!(enditalic) He
finally struck pay dirt as Dr. Doug Ross on (beginitalic)ER,
(enditalic)the television series about a Chicago hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Springboarding off that success, Clooney has chosen his film
roles carefully, making the horror flick (beginitalic)From Dusk
Till Dawn (enditalic)(with Quentin Tarantino), the romantic comedy
(beginitalic)One Fine Day (enditalic)as well as (beginitalic)Batman
&AMP; Robin, The Peacemaker, Out of Sight (enditalic)and, last year,
(beginitalic)Three Kings(enditalic).

FORGET THE GENOME. IS TIME SPENT ON HOLD LOST FOREVER? 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Technology keeps bringing us new hopes and fears, a
perfect example being the announcement on Monday that scientists
had decoded the human genome. Now we have all these giant questions
to ponder, like whether the deciphering of the genetic code will be
used to find a cure for cancer or be hijacked by some mad scientist
out to create an entire race of Martha Stewarts.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, such worries are someone else's department. Fact
is, until recently we thought that ``genome'' was a misspelled
reference to Rumpelstiltskin and his kind.
</P>
<P>
   This space is better equipped to discuss the social and ethical
implications of truly meaningful technological change. Like the new
telephone that the bosses installed a while back.
</P>
<P>
   What a telephone! It can do just about everything except hum the
``Marseillaise.'' It even has a little panel on top that identifies
the incoming number when the phone rings, a device that can come in
handy when you're trying to duck people like the bookie wanting to
know when you plan to come up with the vig.
</P>
<P>
   But for months, the panel's flashing of one number after another
has presented a social dilemma. What is the correct response when
you know off the bat who is calling? Do you pick up the phone all
knowing and jolly: ``Hey, Jim, wussup?'' Or do you offer a
no-frills hello and let the other person go through the familiar
motions of identifying himself?
</P>
<P>
   This is a profound issue of daily consequence that technological
advances have wrought. Forget the genome.
</P>
<P>
   Perplexed, we turned to our etiquette guru, Letitia Baldrige.
She recommended the more traditional approach. ``Be very
nondescript,'' Baldrige counseled. ``Less is more. The less
information we give out, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the thinking, too, of Virginia Russell, marketing
director at Gibbs Training and Consulting, an offshoot of the
venerable Katharine Gibbs School. . Russell, who developed a course
on telephone skills for businesses, recalled how a law firm had
complained to her that its employees were too informal in answering
the phone when they recognized the caller. The old ways work best,
she advised.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an invasion of someone's space'' to use an overly
familiar manner, she said.
</P>
<P>
   That settled that. But the discussion turned to phone manners in
general, a hot topic these days, judging from the anger generated
by so many cell phone users, especially the leather-lunged ones who
believe that the entire bus has to hear the shopping list for
dinner. What do you call those people, cell phoners or cell
phonies?
</P>
<P>
   The latest wrinkle is something called ear buds. You may have
seen them on the street. They are tiny earpieces and microphones
worn by people who can now talk and walk without the dreadful
burden, poor dears, of having to hold actual cell phones. The
problem for the rest of us is that it is hard to tell at first if
these people are harmless (if irritating) cell phonies or possibly
dangerous crazies talking to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Lily Tomlin had a one-woman show on Broadway in which
she expressed the wish that all the people muttering to themselves
on New York streets would pair off so that it would look as if they
were having real conversations. The ear bud tribe might want to
give that idea some thought.
</P>
<P>
   Proper phone behavior, Russell finds, is a big concern for her
corporate clients. All too many employees, she said, are clueless
when it comes to politeness. It hasn't dawned on them that
screaming at a customer or a client is not good business.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe more maddening are the mechanical devices that are now
universal _ automated answering systems, voice mail and the like. A
lot of companies, she said, have no idea how much they drive people
crazy with these gizmos, a point easily appreciated by anyone who
has bounced haplessly from voice mailbox to voice mailbox, an
electronic Flying Dutchman never making contact with a live human.

<P>
   Let's not even dwell on the vast stretches spent on hold, day in
and day out. Why couldn't the genome researchers apply their
talents to a truly cosmic issue, like how to recover precious
minutes and hours of lost life?
</P>
<P>
   At least it has dawned on some companies that they need to make
nice. Their act still needs work, though.
</P>
<P>
   One airline, trying to show how cool it is, urges you on a taped
message to think of being on hold as ``quality personal time.'' You
can, the voice says, ``reflect on what you've done with your
life.''
</P>
<P>
   What is there to do after advice like that except sigh and hang
up?

METS BATTER MARLINS, 10-5 
</HEADLINE>
   By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For most of the first two months of the season, New
York Mets rallies died once they got past Todd Zeile, the No. 6
hitter. When the order turned over to the No. 2 hitter, Derek Bell,
the Mets were able to start something again.
</P>
<P>
   Things changed, though, when the light-hitting No. 8 hitter Rey
Ordonez was injured on May 29 and Jay Payton secured the No. 7 spot
with a torrid start to June.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main reasons the Mets are playing better, General
Manager Steve Phillips said, is that they ``have a chance to score
every inning.''
</P>
<P>
   With five home runs on Monday night from hitters in the Nos. 7,
8, 9 and 1 spots, the Mets overwhelmed the Florida Marlins, 10-5.
</P>
<P>
   Benny Agbayani had two homers, and Payton, Melvin Mora and
pinch-hitter Mark Johnson also cleared the fences. Johnson was
batting for the Mets' starting pitcher, Al Leiter, who improved his
record to 9-1.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first five-homer game for the Mets since Sept. 15,
1997, when Bernard Gilkey, Butch Huskey and Brian McRae combined
for five home runs against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had taken a 4-3 lead by the time Johnson, who was
called up from Class AAA Norfolk on Monday, crushed a fastball from
Joe Strong over the fence, just to the left of dead center.
</P>
<P>
   The homer gave the Mets a 6-3 lead, and they blew the game open
with four runs in the seventh, when Payton, Agbayani and Mora
homered.
</P>
<P>
   With their fifth straight victory, the Mets (42-31) moved within
three games of first-place Atlanta in the National League East. The
Braves will visit Shea Stadium for four games this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   In the Mets' third inning on Monday night, facing the
right-hander Reid Cornelius, Payton led off with a single to right,
giving him a career-high seven-game hitting streak.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani, batting eighth, then crushed a breaking ball into the
left-field bullpen to give the Mets a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   After an out, Mora, the leadoff hitter, reached on an infield
single and went to second on a groundout.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo walked, and Mike Piazza singled Mora home to put
the Mets ahead by 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza drove in a run for the 10th game in a row, matching his
own club record.
</P>
<P>
   The lead did not last long. The Marlins scored their first run
on a homer by Mike Lowell to lead off the second, and they got
another bases-empty homer in the fourth, by Derrek Lee, to pull
within 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   In the fifth, Luis Castillo ripped a leadoff single, then
attempted his 33rd stolen base.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza received Leiter's pitch, a high fastball, and fired to
second, the ball meeting Alfonzo's glove just before Castillo slid
in. He was out, and he must have regretted it, for Dave Berg
followed with a triple and Cliff Floyd with a single.
</P>
<P>
   That tied the score, 3-3, but this time Cornelius could not
stand the prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   After a one-out single by Bell in the fifth, he walked Alfonzo
and Piazza to face Robin Ventura with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura is at his best in that situation, and while he did not
hit a grand slam, he drove in a run, grounding to second to score
Bell and put the Mets ahead, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   In 132 career at-bats with the bases loaded, Ventura has 14
grand slams and 157 runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius retired Zeile on a groundout to end the inning, but
Payton led off with a single in the sixth and one batter later,
Cornelius, a former Met, was removed from the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets thought so highly of Cornelius in 1995 that they traded
their opening day first baseman, David Segui, to Montreal to get
him. Cornelius went 3-7 in 10 starts in his only season with the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Cornelius, 30, has played for five organizations (including two
stints with Florida) and has been released three times since the
Mets dealt him to Cleveland in a deal for pitcher Mark Clark in
March 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He resurfaced in the majors last year, pitching in five games
for the Marlins, and has pitched well in their rotation the last
month.
</P>
<P>
   He can probably count Agbayani out of his fan club. Agbayani
came to bat with two outs and no runners on in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   It was his first at-bat after the homer, and Cornelius's first
pitch drilled Agbayani in the thigh.
</P>
<P>
   Agbayani stared at Cornelius for several seconds, raised his bat
as if he were going to slam it, then tossed it aside and trotted to
first.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter did not have the chance to retaliate against Cornelius;
he had been the Marlins' last hitter the previous inning and did
not come to bat again.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs in the seventh, Turk Wendell hit Marlins shortstop
Dave Berg with a first-pitch fastball to the same area where
Agbayani was hit.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter pitched six innings, allowing three runs on seven hits
and three walks.

 KRON EMBARKS ON ROAD TO INDEPENDENCE  &HT;     By DAN FOST 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After more than 50 years of local ownership, San
Francisco's KRON (Channel 4) officially changed hands Monday in the
most valuable deal in television station history.
</P>
<P>
   Young Broadcasting of New York bought KRON and a 51 percent
interest in its cable affiliate, BayTV, from Chronicle Publishing
Co. in a deal valued at $737 million _ including $650 million in
cash and roughly $87 million in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of privately held Chronicle Publishing, which also
owns The Chronicle, will receive almost 3.9 million shares of Young
stock. Young stock closed Monday at $22.38, up $3.13, but down from
its 52-week high of $65.25, reached in September.
</P>
<P>
   The station is in for major changes, as it will lose its NBC
network affiliation in January 2002, causing some employees to
consider other jobs.
</P>
<P>
   NBC, thwarted in its bid to buy the station, demanded that Young
reverse the traditional model of having the network pay the local
affiliate to carry its content. Young balked, but KNTV (Channel 11)
in San Jose, Calif., agreed to pay the network $36 million a year
for the next 10 years to become the Bay Area's NBC affiliate.
</P>
<P>
   Although the change won't take place for another year and a
half, it has already roiled the station. ``This is not a red letter
day in the history of KRON,'' said reporter Anthony Moor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to leave,'' Moor said. ``Without a network
affiliation, it's like you're working for the minor leagues. ...
It's not what I signed up for.''
</P>
<P>
   But Moor, like most of the other on-air talent, is under
contract and can't switch stations without permission. He said at
least two other reporters had job opportunities arise, only to have
them squashed by contractual obligations.
</P>
<P>
   KRON and BayTV employ 350 full- and part-time workers.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Young, chairman of Young Broadcasting, was at the
station's Van Ness Avenue offices in San Francisco on Monday,
meeting with executives and staff members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a whole lot of change in the offing
here,'' Young said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   While Young said he wants to keep things running the same as
now, with a commitment to local news, others in the industry said
he would face significant hurdles in running an independent
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is, can he come up with the right mix of news and
syndicated programming to make a go as an independent,'' said Harry
Jessell, editor of the trade publication Broadcasting and Cable.
``That's a tall chore.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Hulnick, vice president of news and operations for KNTV,
said his station's deal to become the Bay Area's NBC affiliate
``makes life 18 months from now a lot easier for me. I'm very
curious to see how KRON is going to fill its prime time.''
</P>
<P>
   Hulnick said he's already received resumes from some KRON
staffers.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Young also said Wall Street was not optimistic about
KRON's prospects as an independent, which explains the dramatic
drop in Young Broadcasting's stock price. But he said bankers
supported his company's plans, which required the company to take
on millions in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Young said it would hire Paul ``Dino'' Dinovitz as
vice president and general manager of KRON and BayTV, replacing Amy
McCombs. Dinovitz, who runs two Hearst-Argyle stations in
Sacramento, Calif., will start at KRON on January 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got purgatory coming up for the next six months''
waiting to see what changes Dinovitz will implement, said reporter
Moor.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for Young's optimism is that the company
already owns the nation's largest independent station, KCAL in Los
Angeles. And part of the reason for the staff fears at KRON is that
Young had to make drastic budget cuts when it bought that station
from Walt Disney Co. in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   But Vincent Young said KCAL employed 150 more people than any
other station in Los Angeles, and needed ``tens of millions of
dollars in expense cuts. ... Here, we'll do things differently. We
might spend a little less here or there, but there's nothing
dramatic being proposed.''

WADDELL &AMP; REED IS RENAMING FUND FAMILIES AND CREATING FOUR FUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK DAVIS  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo _ Waddell &AMP; Reed Financial Inc. said Monday that
it plans to rename its two mutual fund families, create four funds
and sell some of its funds through sources other than its sales
force for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Overland Park, Kan.-based company currently sells its United
Funds and Waddell &AMP; Reed Funds through about 2,600 Waddell &AMP; Reed
financial advisers. The advisers are the only source for buying
those funds.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next month, the United Funds will become Waddell &AMP; Reed
Advisors Funds. Also, the current Waddell &AMP; Reed Funds will take an
abbreviated name as the W&AMP;R Funds.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Butch, the company's chief marketing officer, said the
longtime United Fund name amounted to a ``historical misalignment''
with the company that manages the funds, namely Waddell &AMP; Reed
Financial.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly doesn't maximize the Waddell &AMP; Reed brand and
isn't consistent with what you find in the industry,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said changing the name takes advantage of recognition that
Waddell &AMP; Reed Financial is getting as a publicly traded company.
Shares of the fund company first traded in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The company's United Funds account for about 90 percent of its
mutual fund business.
</P>
<P>
   The W&AMP;R Funds will expand by adding four funds under the new
name. Each mirrors one of the existing United Funds in how it
invests and helps fill out the W&AMP;R group's offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The new W&AMP;R Funds:
</P>
<P>
   - The W&AMP;R Large Cap Growth Fund managed by Daniel P. Becker, who
will continue to manage the United Vanguard Fund.
</P>
<P>
   - The W&AMP;R Mid Cap Growth Fund managed by Zachary H. Shafran, who
will continue to manage the United New Concepts Fund.
</P>
<P>
   - The W&AMP;R Tax Managed Equity Fund, which the company announced
in April, managed by Cynthia Prince-Fox, who will continue to
manage the United Continental Income Fund.
</P>
<P>
   - The W&AMP;R Money Market Fund managed by Mira Stevovich, who will
continue to manage the United Cash Management Fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Waddell &AMP; Reed Growth Fund will change its name to the W&AMP;R
Small Cap Growth Fund as part of the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell &AMP; Reed Financial said it will begin to sell the W&AMP;R
Funds through outside sales channels beginning in the fourth
quarter this year.
</P>
<P>
   The funds will be offered through 401(k) retirement plans,
through wrap accounts in which a broker offers investors a package
of funds, and through fee-based advisers who will be able to offer
access to W&AMP;R Funds through fund supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Butch said the new channels won't compete with the 2,600 Waddell
&AMP; Reed advisers who currently offer the funds directly to
investors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be selling funds directly to the public
through mutual fund supermarkets,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Waddell &AMP; Reed will have to reach sales agreements with 401(k)
plan administrators and consultants, brokerage firms and fund
supermarkets to make the W&AMP;R Funds available through those
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to get out in the market and create those selling
agreements,'' Butch said.
</P>
<P>
   The funds soon to be called W&AMP;R Funds, currently available only
as class C shares, will be offered as class A and B shares as well,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   The A shares charge a sales load, or commission, at the time
investors put money into the fund. The B shares carry a fee at the
time the investor sells, though the amount declines over time, and
they convert to A shares with no exit fee after eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The funds' C shares charge a ``level load'' throughout the time
the investor owns them.
</P>
<P>
   The current United Funds also offer A, B and C shares.
</P>
<P>
   Butch said offering the same share classes in the W&AMP;R Funds will
allow investors to more easily switch among the groups' funds using
the same share classes.
</P>
<P>
   The existing Waddell &AMP; Reed Funds had originally been sold only
as B shares. But those shares didn't convert to A shares after a
few years and were discontinued last year. Investors' B shares were
converted to the C shares.

 WEBVAN GROUP, HOMEGROCER TO COMBINE IN BILLION-DOLLAR STOCK DEAL  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Webvan Group of Foster City, Calif., agreed to
join forces with HomeGrocer.com of Kirkland, Wash., Monday in a
merger of the No. 2 and No. 3 players in the Internet grocery
business.
</P>
<P>
   The all-stock deal, which involves 138 million Webvan shares,
was valued at $1 billion at market close Monday. Webvan will
exchange 1.076 shares for each share of HomeGrocer. Webvan's stock
fell 16 percent to $7.31 yesterday, while HomeGrocer's declined 15
percent to close at $6.88.
</P>
<P>
   For Webvan, the deal both eliminates a tough competitor and
gives it an immediate presence in six new markets. The combination
also will save a projected $20 million to $30 million annually in
redundant overhead costs.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was announced as Webvan and HomeGrocer were on the
verge of butting heads on multiple fronts.
</P>
<P>
   HomeGrocer was about to launch in the Atlanta area, the only
market outside of the Bay Area where Webvan operates. Webvan was
planning its foray into HomeGrocer's home territory of Seattle and
both were gearing up for entry into Chicago, home of rival Peapod.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the frailty of the capital markets and how important it
is to conserve cash, it seemed to us that this is the time to put
the companies together,'' Webvan chief executive George Shaheen
told The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   This way, Webvan can ``more efficiently spend our marketing
dollars on the real competitors'' _ conventional supermarkets, said
Shaheen, who will remain president and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's announcement had the collateral effect of linking
Webvan, one of the Web's top ``fulfillment,'' or delivery,
companies, with Amazon.com, one of its leading e-commerce sites.
Amazon, which owns a 22 percent stake in HomeGrocer, will own about
6 percent of Webvan when the acquisition becomes final later this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan has ``not had discussions with Amazon at this time, but
we're looking forward to the opportunity'' to explore partnerships,
said Shaheen. Webvan has been gradually expanding its product
offerings to include items such as best-selling books and pet
supplies.
</P>
<P>
   While Monday's deal has obvious advantages for Webvan, the jury
is still out on whether any Internet supermarket can be viable,
said Heather Dougherty, an analyst with Jupiter Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery ``is a very low-margin business, both online and
offline,'' Dougherty said. Companies like Webvan and HomeGrocer,
which take orders over the Web, fill them at distribution centers
and deliver them to doorsteps via their own fleet of trucks, have
tremendous infrastructure costs, she added.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear whether the HomeGrocer purchase will speed
Webvan toward profitability, Shaheen said. The company still
intends to try to raise $200 million to $300 million from the
capital markets in the second quarter of 2001 to continue
expanding.
</P>
<P>
   But that may be a tall order unless Webvan gains more currency
on Wall Street. Shares have fallen from their $15 public offering
price amid a general downturn among consumer-oriented dot-com
shares.
</P>
<P>
   At least Webvan doesn't have to worry about the HomeGrocer deal
falling through because of Webvan's stock price. HomeGrocer did not
insist on a ``collar'' that would allow it to pull out if Webvan
stock fell below a minimum threshold.
</P>
<P>
   A HomeGrocer spokeswoman said a collar was not considered
necessary because ``this is a transaction based on a good strategic
fit, we wanted to get this done and we're confident in (its)
long-term value.''
</P>
<P>
   With Monday's deal, Webvan will operate in 13 markets by the end
of this year. It will open just two new distribution centers in
2001. Its goal remains to operate 25 such facilities by the end of
2002, but that will depend on whether additional funding can be
secured, Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan will study HomeGrocer's fulfillment system and try to
reduce its delivery window to 30 minutes from the current 90,
Shaheen said. Webvan promises home delivery within a 30-minute time
frame.
</P>
<P>
   In the long term, Webvan hopes to replace HomeGrocer's smaller,
less automated distribution centers with more technologically
advanced facilities like Webvan's, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, which will use the Webvan name, will post
estimated revenues this year of $320 million, rising to $1.1
billion in 2001 as the company enters markets, said Peter Swan, an
analyst with Pacific Growth Equities.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Peapod Inc., which is the largest Internet grocer
but which is also growing much more slowly than its competitors, is
expected to ring up only $123 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly (Peapod is) now facing a much more formidable
competitor,'' said Shawn Milne, an analyst with E-Offering Corp. On
the other hand, Peapod has a well-capitalized ally in Royal Ahold
NV, a multinational supermarket conglomerate that recently rescued
Peapod from insolvency with a $73 million investment.
</P>
<P>
   Milne attributed the decline in Webvan's share price Monday to
the inherent uncertainties surrounding acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, Peapod registered sales of $24.9 million
on a loss of $12.7 million. That compares with sales for HomeGrocer
of $21.2 million on a loss of $43.5 million and Webvan's $16.3
million in revenue on a loss of $57.8 million in the quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan founder Louis Borders will remain chairman of the
company, and Jim Barksdale, a HomeGrocer board member and
co-founder of Netscape Communications, will join the Webvan board.

 GENETIC CODE, A `WONDROUS MAP' PRESENTED AT WHITE HOUSE  &HT;     By TOM ABATE AND CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Two scientific teams announced Monday that they
have finished the first complete reading of the human genetic code,
an accomplishment that promises to speed up advances in drugs and
diagnostic tests even as it raises new ethical questions.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony at the White House _ attended by J. Craig Venter,
president of Maryland-based Celera Genomics, and Francis Collins,
director of the National Human Genome Research Institute _ caps
years of trying to unravel the genome, the microscopic clump of DNA
that directs the actions of every living cell.
</P>
<P>
   As the doors to the ornate East Room of the White House slid
open, President Clinton strode in flanked by Collins and Venter to
recall how, two centuries earlier, Thomas Jefferson had stood in
the same room to view ``a magnificent map'' of North American
produced by the Lewis and Clark expedition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today the world is joining us here in the East Room to behold
a map of even greater significance,'' Clinton said. ``Without a
doubt, this is the most important, most wondrous map ever produced
by humankind.''
</P>
<P>
   The genome map, however, is also possibly the most inscrutable
map ever produced. It is made up of more than 3.1 billion bits of
chemical information represented by four letters _ A, T, G and C _
repeated time and time again in a long and bewildering sequence.
</P>
<P>
   According to Collins, if the genetic code were printed out on
standard paper, the stack would stand as tall as the Washington
Monument. And if a person started reading the code aloud, one
letter per second, it would take 100 years to finish, Venter added.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I suspect you would have fallen asleep before then,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In his White House presentation, held in tandem with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair's London ceremony to underscore the
international nature of the effort, Clinton said doctors would use
the knowledge to ``cure diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
diabetes and cancer by attacking their genetic roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Enormous Work Remaining
</P>
<P>
   But scientists said much work remains in filling in the gaps in
this first draft of the sequence.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, neither team offered a firm estimate of the number
of genes in human DNA. Before Monday's announcement, many
scientists had believed there were about 100,000 genes. But Collins
said Monday the public scientists had only identified 38,000 genes
for certain. Even though the final figure will undoubtedly be
higher, this preliminary finding contradicts what many scientists
thought just a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Finding genes is difficult because they make up only 5 percent
of human DNA, and scientists do not understand how to isolate these
coding regions. Nor do they know the function of the remaining 95
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But finding genes will be a snap next to the far more complex
task of figuring out how thousands of genes, operating
simultaneously in millions of cells, somehow orchestrate their
activities to produce the everyday symphony that is life.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know less than 1 percent of what we need to know to say how
your body works,'' Venter said.
</P>
<P>
   50 Years of Discoveries
</P>
<P>
   MIT geneticist Eric Lander, who heads the publicly funded genome
sequencing center at Boston's Whitehead Institute, said Monday's
announcement was the culmination of a half-century of advances.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is halftime for genetics,'' Lander said. ``It all started
around the turn of the century. Now the really interesting second
half of the game will begin.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Collins and Venter were all smiles and congratulations
yesterday, the two have clashed in the past over their different
goals and strategies for attaining the prize.
</P>
<P>
   Collins heads a government-funded program begun 10 years ago. It
has since grown to include 16 labs in the United States and five
other nations. Each night, this international team of public
scientists has freely published its gene discoveries on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Venter, a scientific maverick who had chafed at the slow pace of
the public project, used private backing to create Celera in 1998
with an eye toward finishing the genome sequence first and making a
profit by charging drug and biotech firms for access to its private
gene database.
</P>
<P>
   During his White House remarks, Clinton, mindful of how Wall
Street misinterpreted his March statement on the genome project,
stressed that ``biotechnology companies are absolutely essential''
in the process of turning raw genetic knowledge into
``life-enhancing'' drugs and diagnostic tests.
</P>
<P>
   Ethical Issues Raised
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also touched on the ethical and social dilemmas
presented by the new genetic knowledge, starting with the
possibility that insurers or employers could abuse genetic
profiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must guarantee that genetic information cannot be used to
stigmatize or discriminate against any individual or group,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In their joint press conference, Collins and Venter both
emphasized the need to protect genetic privacy. A recent Time/CNN
poll found that 75 percent of those surveyed didn't want insurers
to have their genetic profile, while 84 percent wanted to keep such
information from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists should take the lead, Venter said, in demanding tough
genetic privacy laws if they hope to avert the sort of ``debacle''
caused by a lack of trust in the technology used to create
genetically modified foods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to do the right thing so people won't be afraid to
take genetic tests that could be of enormous use to them,'' Collins
added.
</P>
<P>
   Though their joint appearance marked an important thaw in their
relations, Collins and Venter have not yet worked out all their
differences. Both men said they hoped to simultaneously publish
their findings in a scientific journal and to collaborate on
analyzing the data, but haven't yet settled all the details.
</P>
<P>
   Awe and Unity
</P>
<P>
   The two were united Monday in awe of the enormity of their
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, a deeply religious man, said the genome offers us ``the
first glimpse of our own instruction book, previously known only to
God.''
</P>
<P>
   Venter, a combat medic during Vietnam, said he saw some men
survive horrible injuries while others died from minor wounds, an
experience that ``inspired my interest in learning how the
trillions of cells in our bodies interact to create and sustain
life.''

 BAY AREA FIRMS LAVISH EXECUTIVES WITH ENORMOUS STOCK PACKAGES  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; The guy who coined the phrase ``What goes up
must come down'' obviously didn't know much about executive
compensation.
</P>
<P>
   As they do every year, Bay Area corporate executives once again
enjoyed enormous pay increases during 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The 286 high-ranking executives from 55 large companies included
in The Chronicle's 16th annual compensation survey received an
average of $6.9 million last year in salary, bonuses, long-term
incentive pay and additional stock-option grants.
</P>
<P>
   That was a steep 40-plus percent increase from the average of
$4.8 million that the previous year's survey revealed executives
were paid.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of last year's pay bonanza _ 81 percent, to be precise
_ came from option grants. The executives received options with an
estimated present value of $1.6 billion _ $5.6 million worth per
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Executives in the previous year's survey received $1.05 billion
worth of option grants, and the year before, the total was $733
million, or well under half the 1999 total.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as 1994, option grants accounted for less than
one-third of Bay Area executive pay, while salary and bonuses were
dominant.
</P>
<P>
   Today, thanks to the bull market of the '90s, options have
become the be-all of executive pay packages, with cash compensation
a pleasant but trivial afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Sure Moneymaker
</P>
<P>
   ``Stock-option grants have gotten totally out of control,''
complains Graef ``Bud'' Crystal, an acerbic executive-compensation
expert and Bloomberg News columnist. ``There are no restraints on
the size of these grants.''
</P>
<P>
   For most executives, stock options are a sure moneymaker.
</P>
<P>
   The options typically give the executive the right to buy the
company's stock at the current price, and the executive usually can
wait as long as 10 years before exercising them, selling at the
prevailing price.
</P>
<P>
   It is the rare company whose stock doesn't rise, on balance,
during a 10-year period.
</P>
<P>
   The largest option grant last year _ $114.5 million worth _ went
to Thomas M. Siebel, chairman and chief executive officer of Siebel
Systems, the San Mateo, Calif., computer software producer.
</P>
<P>
   That huge grant allowed Siebel to rank first as well in total
compensation, with $117.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Siebel's compensation last year boiled down to $13,423 per hour
_ 24 hours a day, seven days a week. (It seems appropriate to
reckon on a 24/7 basis, because companies assure us that their CEOs
are never off duty.)
</P>
<P>
   Siebel Systems officials did not respond to requests for
comment, but certainly the company performed admirably last year.
Its net income nearly tripled, and its stock price increased more
than fivefold.
</P>
<P>
   The company's proxy statement offers a rationale of sorts for
Tom Siebel's huge pay package.
</P>
<P>
   It says the company's compensation committee ``reviewed the
stock option positions provided to chief executive officers of
comparable software companies in connection with their employment
services.''
</P>
<P>
   Siebel's option package was ``intended to continue to maintain
the overall competitiveness of Mr. Siebel's compensation package
and strengthen the alignment of Mr. Siebel's interests with those
of the stockholders during a crucial phase of the Company's
development.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Crystal retorts: ``They just give this guy the moon in
terms of options. You need a degree in astronomy to handle numbers
that large.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rest of the Pay Iceberg
</P>
<P>
   Actually, last year's option grants _ as large as they were _
represent only the tip of the iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the rousing performance of the stock market _
particularly in high-tech issues _ the executives in The Chronicle
survey had accumulated $18.9 billion in profits from unexercised
options by the end of 1999. That works out to an average of $66
million per executive _ a tidy sum for a rainy day.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy Koogle, chairman and chief executive of Yahoo,
single-handedly accounted for about 12 percent of the option hoard,
with nearly $2.3 billion in untapped option profits.
</P>
<P>
   Also boasting more than $1 billion in unexercised option profits
were Siebel and Koogle's colleague Farzad Nazem, senior vice
president of Yahoo, each with about $1.2 billion worth.
</P>
<P>
   All told, 40 executives had at least $100 million worth of
unexercised option profits waiting for them at the end of last
year, compared with just 16 executives in the previous year's
survey.
</P>
<P>
   Ranking second to Siebel in total compensation last year was
Carleton S. Fiorina, president and chief executive of
Hewlett-Packard, the giant Palo Alto, Calif., computer
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Carly Fiorina, as she is commonly known, joined HP in July, and
was paid a total of $93.8 million for her half-year's service.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this came in the form of a $65.6 million
restricted-stock grant _ in essence a gift, not keyed to managerial
performance _ while the bulk of the rest came from stock-option
grants estimated to be worth $24.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Restricted stock generally is used to ensure that prized
executives won't walk away from their companies. If they do so
before a specified period has elapsed, they lose the shares.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett-Packard's proxy statement explains that the company had
to pay Fiorina a huge amount up front to lure her away from Lucent
Technologies, where she had served as a division head. In leaving
Lucent, she forfeited stock options roughly equal in value to the
restricted stock she got from HP.
</P>
<P>
   Some executive-compensation experts consider that deal
outrageous. They argue that Fiorina had no previous experience as a
chief executive or even chief operating officer, and that HP _ one
of the world's largest companies _ might have used the $65 million
in restricted stock to lure an established, world-class CEO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why chase a candidate that is totally unproven and not
necessarily qualified for the job?'' says Matt Ward, head of
WestWard Pay Strategies in San Francisco. ``Her package is
mind-bogglingly stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   HP replies that it considered 300 candidates for the job,
including many people who served as CEOs elsewhere, and that
Fiorina was the best qualified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at a lot of experienced CEOs who did not have the
core capabilities and competencies Carly had demonstrated,'' says
Debra Dunn, vice president for strategy and corporate operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were many things about her track record at Lucent _ her
ability to lead and inspire people to make major change, her
ability to handle a breadth of products, to understand technology
but be focused on the customer _ that fit quite perfectly with what
we wanted in an HP CEO.''
</P>
<P>
   Pay for Attendance
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding Fiorina's huge grant, restricted stock seems to
be going out of fashion in the Bay Area. Only 31 of the 286
executives in the survey received restricted stock last year _ down
from 46 in the previous year's survey. The median grant was
$440,000 _ down from $861,000.
</P>
<P>
   If restricted stock fades away, that will be just peachy with
many executive-compensation consultants.
</P>
<P>
   They ridicule restricted stock as ``pay for attendance'' _ as
distinguished from pay for performance. An executive merely needs
to come to work and stay alive for a specified period of time to
collect restricted shares.
</P>
<P>
   Marty Katz, an executive-compensation specialist with William
Mercer in San Francisco, notes that restricted stock ``tends to get
criticized as a giveaway, whereas with a stock option, you can
always argue that the executive's reward is precisely correlated
with the shareholders' reward.''
</P>
<P>
   Katz adds that companies also are shunning restricted stock
because it hurts the bottom line. He explains that under current
accounting regulations, restricted-stock grants have to be charged
against earnings, while stock options do not.

 GOOGLE IS YAHOO'S NEW SEARCH ENGINE  &HT;     By VERNE KOPYTOFF 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Internet portal Yahoo said Monday that it is
changing its search engine, replacing Inktomi with Google, a
fledging Web search service in Mountain View, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a major victory for Google, which has gained respect
for the quality of its search results. The terms of the agreement
were not disclosed, but Sergey Brin, Google's president, said it is
his company's biggest contract since being founded two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Jeff Mallet, Yahoo's president, said his company
choose Google because ``they share our strong consumer focus.'' A
Yahoo spokeswoman said major contributing factors to the decision
included Google's ability to list search results by relevance and
requests by Yahoo users for the service.
</P>
<P>
   Google already offers its search engine to nearly 80 Web sites,
including Netscape and WashingtonPost.com. The company says it has
the Internet's most powerful search engine, drawing on content from
1 billion Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Sullivan, editor of SearchEngineWatch.com, an Internet
news Web site, said Yahoo's deal with Google is probably based more
on money than quality. Because both Google and Inktomi offer good
search results, he said, the deciding factor for Yahoo may be that
Google was cheaper. ``It's like musical chairs when you deal with
these major portals,'' Sullivan said, adding that Yahoo has changed
search engines three times since it was founded in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara, Calif.'s Yahoo, the third-most-popular Web
property, will begin using Google's search services in about a
month. Those search results will supplement Yahoo's own
human-edited directory of Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   In a consolation, Yahoo said yesterday that it will use
Inktomi's search engine in a new effort called Corporate Yahoo.
Yahoo is trying to sell customized versions of its service to other
companies for internal use.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi, based in Foster City, Calif., offers its search engine
to nearly 125 Web sites including America Online and Microsoft.
Dick Pierce, Inktomi's chief operating officer, said that losing
Yahoo as a client is bothersome, but that the portal accounts for
only 2 percent of Inktomi's revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Inktomi stock fell sharply yesterday following the announcement.
Shares declined $25.31, nearly 18 percent, to $115.06. Yahoo's
stock dropped $6 to $119.31.

 MONEYBAG: WHEN CHOOSING STOCK, WATCH THE PE RATIO  &HT;     By ARTHUR M. LOUIS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I am interested in Qualcomm, the telecommunications company.
Its share price has been all over the place, from as low as $6 or
so to more than $170 last year. Recently, it has been in the $60s.
At what price would it be worth buying?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: You have asked the $64,000 question _ not just about Qualcomm,
but about any stock.
</P>
<P>
   I prefer not to recommend the purchase or sale of specific
stocks, but let's discuss this in a general way, and maybe you can
arrive at your own answer.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent price of $68.25, Qualcomm was selling at more than
70 times its earnings per share for the latest 12 months, and at
more than 60 times its estimated per-share earnings for the fiscal
year that will end in September. At its peak last year, it was
selling for around 200 times earnings.
</P>
<P>
   As a rule, price-earnings ratios greater than 30 are considered
high. A company has to show promise of extraordinary earnings
growth to justify that kind of evaluation. To justify a PE of 60,
70 or (gasp) 200, a company's growth prospects must be nothing
short of explosive.
</P>
<P>
   Securities analysts surveyed by First Call predict that Qualcomm
will earn about $1.08 per share in the current fiscal year _ up a
rousing 80 percent from last year. But they expect the growth to
slow to somewhat more than 30 percent in fiscal 2001, with the
consensus earnings estimate pegged at $1.42 per share.
</P>
<P>
   Even 30 percent is strong growth _ but you have to ask yourself
how long Qualcomm can keep it up. At its current price, it still is
selling at nearly 50 times next year's expected earnings. Heaven
help the shareholders if the company reports an unexpectedly weak
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   That, in a nutshell, is the rational, fundamental approach to
stock evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   But it sometimes pays to be irrational. At the height of the
tech-stock mania late last year, you could have bought Qualcomm at
$100 per share and sold it for more than $170 in the space of a few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the fundamentals, $100 was an outrageously high price
to pay. But at the time, tech-stock speculators were willing to pay
almost any price for almost any company with a seemingly bright
future.
</P>
<P>
   That's not the case right now _ but it could happen again, and
probably will. Just don't ask me when.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Investing With $50
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: My sister would like to make some kind of investment, but she
can afford to put in only $50 per month. Is there any investment
vehicle that will accommodate her?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Amy Arnott, a spokeswoman for Morningstar Inc., says that
several mutual-fund groups will let you buy shares in selected
funds for as little as $50 per month, under what are known as
automatic investment plans.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Among the groups she cites are Columbia, (800) 547-1707;
Evergreen, (800) 343-2898; State Farm, (309) 766-2029; Strong,
(800) 368-1030; T. Rowe Price, (800) 638-5660; and USAA, (800)
382-8722.
</P>
<P>
   There may be others, so check with any particular funds that
interest you.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Estimated Payments
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Q: I plan to sell some stock at a large capital gain later this
year. This means I will have to make estimated tax payments in
September or January or both, because the tax my employer withholds
from my salary will be far below my expected tax liability for
2000. I didn't make estimated tax payments in April or June. How do
I figure the size of the payments that are coming due?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: The law regarding estimated tax payments _ like much tax law _
is annoyingly complicated.
</P>
<P>
   You can find a thorough explanation of the procedures to follow
in Internal Revenue Service Publication 505, which you can download
from the IRS Web site at  &LR; www.irs.gov &LR; . You also can order it by
telephone at (800) 829-3676.
</P>
<P>
   Taxpayers generally don't have to make estimated tax payments
unless their withholding and credits for the current year are going
to be less than the smaller of the following benchmarks: 90 percent
of the current year's tax liability, or 100 percent of the previous
year's tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   If you do have to pay estimated tax, notes Internal Revenue
Service spokesman Jesse Weller, the total of your withholding,
credits and estimated tax payments does not have to exceed the
smaller of those benchmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration, Weller says, is that estimated tax
payments are required only if you are going to owe at least $1,000
more than the amount of your withholding and credits.
</P>
<P>
   (The calculation becomes more complicated if you are in a high
income bracket. Again, consult Publication 505.)
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume that you are indeed required to make estimated tax
payments this year.
</P>
<P>
   The next due date is September 15 _ the third payment date of
the current tax year. At that point, Weller says, you should make
certain that you have paid at least three-fourths of your estimated
tax. Figure your tax on Form 1040-ES, which also can be downloaded
or obtained by telephoning the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The final payment deadline is January 16, and by then you should
have paid the full amount of your estimated tax.
</P>
<P>
   Failure to pay the correct amounts on time could subject you to
interest penalties.

TIFFANY STASI, CHILD LINKED ACCUSED SERIAL KILLER, MAY BE ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON, c. 2000, The Kansas City Star  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   C. 2000, The Kansas City Star -- Tiffany Lynn Stasi, who
disappeared 15 years ago as a 4-month-old baby after her mother
crossed paths with accused serial killer John E. Robinson Sr., is
believed to be alive, The Kansas City Star has learned.
</P>
<P>
   Police are investigating whether Tiffany is living under another
name in a tidy suburban neighborhood in a Midwestern state. Sources
knowledgeable of the investigation say she could have been raised
by a couple known to Robinson without ever being legally adopted.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas City Star contacted the household and was told ``no
comment'' by a woman who came to the door Monday. A lawyer retained
by the family would only say they are ``cooperating fully with all
law enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   The case presents legal and ethical issues because the teen-age
girl, who recently finished her freshman year in public high
school, is still a minor.
</P>
<P>
   Similar discoveries in other parts of the nation have set off
tangled custody disputes between the families who raised such
children and their relatives by birth.
</P>
<P>
   The case also could be complicated by the possibility that her
biological mother was a victim of foul play and that any adoption
appears to have been off the books, according to Missouri records.
</P>
<P>
   Born at Truman Medical Center, Tiffany is the daughter of Lisa
Stasi, a young woman who was told she could begin a new life under
an ``Outreach'' program for young single mothers set up by Robinson
in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson, whose program turned out to be a fraud, was charged
this month with five counts of capital murder after the discovery
of barrels containing the remains of women. Those victims appear to
have died in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But at least three other women, including Lisa Stasi,
disappeared in the mid-1980s after becoming involved with Robinson.
He faces no charges involving those women.
</P>
<P>
   The current prosecution has sparked fresh interest in the older
missing persons cases and brought new questions about the fate of
Tiffany. Authorities and family members are highly reluctant to
discuss it, but sources close to the investigation confirmed that
family members have been questioned about the possibility that
Robinson turned Tiffany over to a childless couple he knew.
</P>
<P>
   That couple, one source said, was ``surprised and terrified'' by
the developments following Robinson's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Stasi, Tiffany's father, said Monday he has had no
indication that investigators may have news of his daughter. Kathy
Klinginsmith, Lisa Stasi's sister-in-law who lives in Lenexa, also
said Monday police had not been in touch with her regarding
Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Stasi was 19 and in a troubled marriage in 1985 when she
met Robinson while staying at the Hope House shelter for battered
women, according to investigators' reports filed at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Staffers at social agencies recall that Robinson had frequented
hospitals and agencies looking for young women for his Kansas City
Outreach Program, sponsored by his Equi-II umbrella consulting
company. Background checks by vigilant social workers found that he
had falsified aspects of his program.
</P>
<P>
   A man that police believe was Robinson pledged to train her in
Texas as a silkscreen printer, land her an $800-a-month stipend,
set her up with baby-sitting and give her an apartment. She was
told, investigative reports say, jobs opportunities awaited her
later in Chicago, Denver or Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 8, 1985, she and her baby were at an Overland Park
Rodeway Inn, where a ``John Osborne'' had checked her in. Her room
was paid for with a credit card issued to Equi-II. She checked out
two days later, and her family has not heard from her since.
</P>
<P>
   Klinginsmith reported her missing soon after. Klinginsmith's
husband told police he visited the offices of Equi-II, an Overland
Park, Kan., management consulting business owned by Robinson, on
Jan. 12, 1985. He said a man pushed him out of the office after he
had identified himself as Stasi's relative.
</P>
<P>
   Later, a man calling himself ``Father Martin'' with City Union
Mission telephoned the brother-in-law to say Stasi and the infant
were fine. The man left a telephone number, but it led to a private
home. No priests worked at City Union Mission.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after the brother-in-law's visit, an attorney
representing Robinson told police that Stasi had ``made
arrangements for her self-keeping on her own.'' Robinson, he said,
had not seen the mother or daughter for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators' reports at the time indicate Robinson produced
typewritten farewell notes signed by Stasi and told police she had
left for Denver with a man named Bill.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Robinson's parole officer in Missouri wondered
whether Robinson could be involved in a black market for healthy
babies. Court documents indicate that despite the disappearance of
Stasi and her daughter, the FBI had no evidence of such a ring.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Haymes, the parole officer, was aware that Paula Godfrey,
a high school graduate from Olathe who apparently worked for the
Stanley, Kan., businessman, had dropped out of sight in the summer
of 1984. Later, police would learn that Catherine Clampitt also
supposedly was working for Robinson's Equi-II before she was
reported missing in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Stasi is critical of Overland Park police for not
investigating the disappearance of the two 15 years ago. He also is
angry with Truman Medical Center, where Tiffany was born, because
he believes Robinson made contact with Lisa there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've really just been taking it from day to day,'' he said.
``Nobody's called.''
</P>
<P>
   Stasi said investigators told him they have routinely asked for
blood samples from the relatives of the dead and missing women tied
to the Robinson case. Those blood samples can form the basis of DNA
tests to confirm identities.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Stasi's attorney, Seth Shumaker, said early this month that
he told his client not to give authorities a blood sample until
he's told they believe they have found Lisa or Tiffany Stasi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any reason for putting my client through a blood
test if you don't have anybody,'' Shumaker said. ``As soon as you
come up with a person or a body that you believe to be Tiffany,
then it becomes appropriate.''

CONCEPT OF SUPPRESSING TORNADOES DEBATED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Midwestern sky grows dark, radio and television carries news
of a tornado watch, and a menacing cloud that might contain a
twister begins to form.
</P>
<P>
   Into the air heads a fleet of airplanes, spreading particles in
a process called cloud seeding. They alter the way the storm acts,
defusing what might have developed into a tornado catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like poppycock. Or at best a dream.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, but then again....
</P>
<P>
   Out on the Kansas plains, home to a 25-year-old program to study
ways to suppress hail and instigate rain, meteorologists last year
said they may have quelled a tornado near Dodge City.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Curt Smith, manager of the Western Kansas Weather
Modification Program, said weather experts ought to study tornado
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a good chance you can disrupt the natural
forces that cause tornadoes,'' he said in a telephone interview
from his office in Lakin, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   It can't be done now, at least not in any big way, and perhaps
tornadoes will never be stopped entirely, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But someday, Smith said, defusing tornadoes may be reality.
</P>
<P>
   Others agree. It's not unusual for the National Severe Storms
Laboratory in Norman, Okla., to hear of tornado-stopping ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Some of them parallel the kind of cloud seeding Smith and his
pilots do. Others involve setting off explosions in the air.
</P>
<P>
   A few of the ideas fall into the absurd.
</P>
<P>
   Recognized tornado experts doubt all of them and dismiss any
claims that a tornado might have been quelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Theoretically there may be ways to modify tornadoes,'' said
Jeff Kimpel, director of the storm laboratory. ``However, there's
no evidence to date of any known mechanism that will produce the
desired result.''
</P>
<P>
   Another longtime student of the weather, Edwin Kessler, was more
emphatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's garbage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no documentation, said Kessler, a former director of
the severe storms laboratory, that tornadoes can be affected as the
cloud seeders suggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden of proof is on them, and they can't prove
anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kessler said he sees no practical reason to study tornado
suppression. ``I wouldn't spend five minutes on it myself,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   No major studies of tornado prevention are known to be under
way.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the task would seem to be as huge as the sky itself.
</P>
<P>
   Tornadoes afflict Kansas, Missouri and many parts of the Great
Plains, and can occur almost anyplace.
</P>
<P>
   The violent storms consist of rotating air columns that stretch
from a thunderstorm to the ground. They're capable of winds up to
250 miles an hour. On average, about 800 occur each year.
</P>
<P>
   Human intervention looks microscopic, compared to the natural
forces at work in a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Cloud seeding, like the Western Kansas Weather Modification
Program does to suppress hail, is done with one-engine or
two-engine airplanes. It involves flying to a selected area of a
thunderstorm. There, from containers on the planes, a substance
containing silver iodide is vaporized.
</P>
<P>
   If the airplanes get to the right part of a tornado-producing
thunderstorm and seed at the right time, they could change the
thunderstorm enough to kill a tornado or make it less damaging, say
advocates of cloud seeding.
</P>
<P>
   Last year they drew some support from an important advocate _
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While touring tornado devastation in Oklahoma, Clinton told a
crowd he wants ``to see what we can do not only to provide even
better warning, but perhaps to dilute the strength of some of these
very powerful tornadoes before they hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelvin Droegemeier, professor of meteorology at the University
of Oklahoma, said the statement provoked thought and conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It died down fairly quickly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At Oklahoma, he said, no tornado prevention research is being
done. Droegemeier, who works with computer models of thunderstorms,
described stopping tornadoes as ``a very, very futuristic kind of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``The kind of remark President Clinton made is easy to
make in conversation. To actually control the weather in some
measured way...we're not anywhere close to that.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is fraught with controversy. How much money would be
spent? What parts of the country would be protected?
</P>
<P>
   One particularly troubling question: If tornadoes can be
suppressed, can they also be made worse?
</P>
<P>
   Just think of the possibilities, though.
</P>
<P>
   From 1950 to 1995, federal government statistics show, Kansas
averaged 11 strong to violent tornadoes a year. Missouri averaged
eight. There were 29 a year in Texas, the most anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Last year in Oklahoma, a spate of tornadoes injured 800 persons
and caused insured losses of around $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Suppressing just one or two tornadoes a year could produce
enormous savings.
</P>
<P>
   But in the weather industry, consensus doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is substantial division of opinion,'' said Larry Ruthi,
meteorologist in charge at the Dodge City office of the National
Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthi, who's familiar with the Western Kansas Weather
Modification Program, doesn't dismiss the idea of someday
preventing tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be an interesting concept to explore,'' he
said. ``I would like to see an open mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the manager of the weather modification program, said his
cloud seeding pilots last June encountered a small twister while
working in a developing thunderstorm near Dodge City.
</P>
<P>
   The seeding, he said, may have weakened the thunderstorm enough
to also weaken the twister. Ultimately, the twister touched ground
briefly but did no damage.
</P>
<P>
   It is not uncommon for twisters to form in thunderstorms and
then fizzle out before reaching the earth or before doing any
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Smith questioned why universities or the federal government
don't undertake tornado suppression studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say it doesn't work,'' he said. ``Well, how do you
know?''

NETWORTH: INVESTMENT-SAVVY PARENTS GET A BREAK WITH
COLLEGE  SAVINGS PLANS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Starting Saturday, parents or grandparents who
want to save for a child's college expenses through the state's
ScholarShare program will have three new investment options, but
that still may not be enough for some people.
</P>
<P>
   The program, also known as a 529 plan, lets anyone contribute as
little as $25 or as much as six figures to a tax-deferred account
on behalf of a child. The money grows free of state and federal
taxes until it is withdrawn, when earnings are taxed at the child's
ordinary income tax rate, usually 15 percent. The money can be used
to pay for tuition and certain living expenses at virtually any
college or graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   The folks who run the 9-month-old ScholarShare program say some
parents were clamoring for a more aggressive investment option than
the only one now available, an age-based fund.
</P>
<P>
   That fund becomes progressively more conservative as a child
gets closer to college. For a child entering college in 17 or 18
years, the fund would be invested 80 percent in stocks and 20
percent in bonds. By the time the child enters college, the asset
mix would have shifted to 15 percent stocks, 35 percent bonds and
50 percent money market funds.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a bad strategy, but it's not surprising that some
parents might want even more growth potential.
</P>
<P>
   The equity portion of the age-based fund is not exactly a
shoot-out-the-lights portfolio. It's pegged to the Russell 3000
index, which includes all but the smallest U.S. stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The new choices are:
</P>
<P>
   -- A 100 percent Equity Option: This fund will invest in 80
percent U.S. stocks and 20 percent foreign stocks. The U.S. portion
will be ``benchmarked'' to the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, but it
won't be a slave to the S&AMP;P like a pure index fund would.
</P>
<P>
   -- A 100 percent Social Choice Equity Option: This fund will be
very similar to the 100 percent Equity Option, except it won't
invest in companies that produce tobacco, alcohol, weapons, nuclear
power or pollution.
</P>
<P>
   -- A Guaranteed Option: This fixed-income investment is similar
to a savings bond. It promises that investors will get back at
least their principal plus 3 percent a year. The program expects to
pay an additional amount that will change each quarter. The total
return for the quarter starting Friday is expected to be 6.65
percent.
</P>
<P>
   While four funds are better than one, these four are not exactly
a smorgasbord of investment options. It's more like a choice of
beef, pork, chicken and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The guaranteed option is more conservative than the age-based
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The two new equity options are spicier than the age-based funds
because they'll remain fully invested in the stock market. But
they're not what you'd call aggressive growth funds, and the
performance of the two new funds will be very similar.
</P>
<P>
   The ScholarShare program probably won't be able to add more than
one more fund because the Internal Revenue Service has indicated it
will let 529 plans offer up to five options, says Christopher Lynch
of TIAA-CREF, the giant pension fund for college teachers that
manages the ScholarShare funds.
</P>
<P>
   The new funds were selected by TIAA-CREF and the ScholarShare
board, chaired by California Treasurer Phil Angelides.
</P>
<P>
   Angelides, whose staff oversees ScholarShare, has also been
pushing the state's big pension funds to use social criteria in
their investments.
</P>
<P>
   California parents were not exactly pounding the table for a
social fund. But Susan Baltake, executive director of ScholarShare,
says California will be the only state to offer a social option in
a 529 plan, and she hopes that will attract out-of-state investors.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-one states offer 529 plans, and parents can invest in
out-of-state plans, although they may miss out on some tax
advantages offered to in-state residents.
</P>
<P>
   (You can compare 529 plans and learn more about them, at
 &LR; www.savingforcollege.com &LR; , run by Joseph Hurley, an independent
expert on college savings.)
</P>
<P>
   California does not offer an extra incentive _ such as a state
tax deduction or credit _ for ScholarShare contributions, although
Angelides is pushing for one in AB2095. That measure would give
families earning less than $150,000 a tax credit of up to $500 for
ScholarShare contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The state hopes passage of that bill, plus the new options, will
jump start the program, which has attracted a modest $57 million.
New York's 529 plan has more than $300 million, but it also is a
year older than California's and offers a break on state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   New York's plan, however, offers only one investment option, an
age-based fund. And that will remain the best option for many
California investors.
</P>
<P>
   Once you put money into a fund in a 529 plan, it stays in that
fund until you withdraw money from the account. You can add new
money to a new fund, but you can't switch money from one fund to
another, like you can in a 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   Most parents probably won't want all their money locked in
stocks because if the market is having a bad year when junior is
ready for college, they'd be forced to take withdrawals at
depressed prices.
</P>
<P>
   That's why most experts advise parents to gradually start moving
money from stocks to bonds or money market funds as their child
gets closer to college.
</P>
<P>
   You could accomplish this by carefully allocating some money to
ScholarShare's all-stock fund and some to the guaranteed option, or
you could do the same thing with less hassle by choosing the
age-based fund.
</P>
<P>
   You can get more details by going to  &LR; www.scholarshare.com &LR;  or
calling toll free 877-728-4338.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the salient facts.
</P>
<P>
   -- Contributions. Any adult can contribute to an account in one
or more states on behalf of a child.
</P>
<P>
   In California's plan, the maximum lifetime contribution for each
child _ from all sources combined, including money in other states'
529 plans ranges from $110,033 for kids born this year, to $158,146
for teens born before 1984.
</P>
<P>
   If your kid's a genius, consider this: Gov. Gray Davis is
sponsoring a plan to reward $1,000 scholarships to children who
rank in the top 10 percent of their school in STAR testing. If that
plan passes, the money will be put in a ScholarShare account and
count toward the lifetime maximum.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum contribution is $25, or $15 through payroll
deduction. You can also set up automatic investments from your
checking account.
</P>
<P>
   -- Fees. The only fee is 0.8 percent per year, or 80 cents per
$100 in account value.
</P>
<P>
   -- Withdrawals. If your child decides to skip college and get a
high-paying programming job, you can transfer the account to
another family member _ even a parent _ who can use it for his or
her ``qualified'' college expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Qualified expenses include tuition, room and board (including
off-campus housing costs up to $2,500 per year), books, and certain
supplies and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   -- Penalties. If you can't find anyone who can use the money for
college, you can withdraw it and pay taxes at your own rate plus a
10 percent penalty on the earnings.
</P>
<P>
   -- Advantages. Unlike most other college savings schemes, there
is no income limitation, so even the wealthiest parents can
participate. And the maximum contribution is far higher than with
other plans.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the most you can put in an Education individual
retirement account is $500 per year per child, and the accounts are
off-limits to couples making $150,000 or $160,000 and singles
earning $95,000 to $110,000.
</P>
<P>
   A grandparent or other wealthy patron can put up to $50,000 in a
child's account without triggering the federal gift tax, although
that will use up the donor's $10,000 annual gift-tax exclusion for
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases, money in a ScholarShare account is considered the
parent's. That helps if you're applying for financial aid, because
parents are generally expected to contribute no more than 5.6
percent of their assets to college costs, while students are
expected to fork over 35 percent. But beware: Some private schools
consider 529 accounts as student assets, and other schools could
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   -- Drawbacks. You cannot contribute to an Education IRA in the
same year you contribute to ScholarShare.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tax considerations. Most families are better off putting
money in ScholarShare than in a taxable account in the parent's
name. But some may be better off putting college money in a taxable
account in the child's name rather than ScholarShare.
</P>
<P>
   Here's why: Each year, a child can earn up to $700 in investment
income tax-free. The second $700 is taxed at the child's rate,
generally 15 percent. Everything over $1,400 is taxed at the
parent's rate if the child is under 14, or at the child's rate
starting in the year the child turns 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a 529 plan, you lose the $700 annual deduction,'' says Joe
Hurley, who also wrote the book, ``The Best Way to Save for
College.''
</P>
<P>
   You also lose the benefit of the lower tax rate on long-term
capital gains, because ScholarShare earnings are taxed as ordinary
income. The long-term capital gains rate for kids is only 10
percent, falling to 8 percent next year for assets held at least
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Which is best depends on the child's age and the parent's income
and tax rate.
</P>
<P>
   -- Control issues. In ScholarShare, the parent retains control
of the account. If you put the money in the child's name, the child
gains control at age 18 (or 21 if you specify) and could blow the
college money on a Mexican vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Thoroughly confused? You should be. You almost need a college
degree _ preferably a master's in accounting _ to choose a college
savings plan. And there's no right answer for everyone. The only
thing you can say for sure: Saving anything, anywhere, anyhow, is
better than saving nothing.

 CREDIT CARD ISSUER TO SETTLE DECEPTIVE-MARKETING CHARGES  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a case that breaks new ground in consumer
protection law, credit card giant Providian Financial Corp. is
expected to settle, as early as Tuesday, charges that it
systematically used deceptive sales tactics, sources familiar with
the matter said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with the San Francisco district attorney's office
and federal bank regulators is worth more than $300 million and
will be one of the largest payouts in a consumer financial fraud
case.
</P>
<P>
   The case sets a new standard for what lenders may legally say
and do when pitching products to consumers, sources said. It carves
out a tougher stance and an expanded role for bank regulators in
curbing abusive credit practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, the (regulatory) agencies have not used the
hammer,'' said Ed Mierzwinski of U.S. Public Interest Research
Group in Washington, D.C. ``It's a welcome departure.''
</P>
<P>
   In their yearlong probes of Providian, the district attorney's
office and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency zeroed in
on direct mail and telephone marketing tactics that allegedly
resulted in thousands of sales to customers who didn't know what
they were buying.
</P>
<P>
   Investigating such complaints isn't unusual for the San
Francisco district attorney's office, which enforces California
laws for business practices.
</P>
<P>
   But the involvement of bank regulators in a case that focuses on
consumer deception ``could be a precedent,'' said James Rockett, an
attorney with the San Francisco law firm McCutchen, Doyle, Brown &AMP;
Enersen. ``That has never in the past been a focus of regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   One major area covered in the settlement is a Providian program
that guaranteed big, though undisclosed, savings to customers who
transferred balances from other card issuers, but actually lowered
interest rates by three-tenths of a percentage point or less.
</P>
<P>
   Another area involves sales of fee-based products, such as
credit protection, in which customers who thought they were only
requesting information were charged for purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement requires the nation's sixth-largest bank credit
card issuer to halt such practices, pay a penalty and reimburse
victimized customers.
</P>
<P>
   The company is not admitting wrongdoing. But the combined weight
of local prosecutors and a key regulatory agency apparently forced
it to settle.
</P>
<P>
   After the district attorney's office began its investigation
last year, Providian carried out a cleanup of its sales methods.
The settlement forces the company to make further changes to ensure
customers understand what they are buying.
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators began signaling a harder line more than a
year ago when they declared that the way lenders treat consumers is
a ``safety and soundness'' issue, traditionally their top concern.
</P>
<P>
   According to this reasoning, consumer abuse can harm a lender's
reputation and expose it to lawsuits, thereby threatening its
financial health.
</P>
<P>
   Providian insiders have complained that the company is a victim
of changing regulatory standards. They have said practices
previously considered lawful are no longer permitted.
</P>
<P>
   There is little sympathy for Providian in the banking and credit
card industries, where most rivals view the company as a predator.
</P>
<P>
   But the aggressive stance of regulators alarms lenders,
especially those like Providian, which target customers with
troubled credit records.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's now no mistaking that it's open season on subprime
lenders,'' said Kenneth Posner, an analyst with the brokerage firm
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter.

LODUCA MYSTIFIED ABOUT DEMOTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In his mind, catcher Paul LoDuca did everything he
could to prove he should remain with the Los Angeles Dodgers when
catcher Todd Hundley returned from injury. LoDuca even told manager
Davey Johnson he'd play outfield, first or third base.
</P>
<P>
   But after hitting .346 in nine games, and throwing out a
team-high 28.5 percent of those trying to steal against him, LoDuca
was sent Monday to Triple-A Albuquerque to make room for Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said LoDuca was a victim of
the dreaded numbers game, which meant little to LoDuca.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of dumbfounded right now, so I don't know what to
say,'' said LoDuca, who had two homers and five RBI. ``It's hard in
spring training, doing well there and getting sent down, but it's
even harder now with what I've done since I've been here. I just
don't know what I need to do to stay here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm not wanted here, I want somebody to tell me that,
straight-up. If I'm still in the plans, I want to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   When LoDuca was sent to the minors during spring training, he
asked general manager Kevin Malone to trade him. Anaheim wanted to
trade for LoDuca, but the Dodgers didn't want to part with him
because he's an insurance policy, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's acquisition of Jim Leyritz rendered LoDuca
expendable at the major-league level once Hundley returned. Further
frustrating LoDuca is the situation at Albuquerque, where Angel
Pena is the No. 1 catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up a Dodger and I want to be a Dodger, but if I'm not
in their plans . . .,'' LoDuca said. ``I've been a good person to
this organization and I hope they respect me, and I think that
should be enough to let me go where somebody wants me and I can
help out that organization. It's a really tough situation right
now. I don't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   LoDuca said he would take most of the 72 hours afforded to him
to report to the Dukes if the Dodgers don't trade him.
</P>
<P>
   __ Suspension roster talk: The club wants depth at the starting
pitcher spot to compensate for possible suspensions, so rookie
right-hander Eric Gagne is expected to be recalled to start today
for the Dodgers, who bumped Darren Dreifort to Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wanted Gagne back on the roster to give it depth for the
upcoming suspensions. The addition of Gagne means the Dodgers will
have, in theory, six starters to better handle the likely
suspensions stemming from last month's fight at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Though Paul Beeston, chief operating officer for the
commissioner's office, is yet to announce his decisions on the
appeals of the 16 players, three coaches and one on-field
assistant, Dodgers officials are bracing for the news to come
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Gagne, the Dodgers are expected to send reserve
outfielder Shawn Gilbert to the minors.
</P>
<P>
   __ Gywnn on DL: San Diego announced before the game that right
fielder Tony Gwynn will undergo arthroscopic surgery on his left
knee today, but it's uncertain whether it will end his season. That
won't be known until doctors can determine the degree of the
cartilage damage.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Center fielder Devon White hit left-handed off
a tee before the game, and team officials said the session went
well. The Dodgers will see how his left shoulder is today, and if
all is well White might hit right-handed off a tee. . . .
Right-hander Terry Adams had his sore right shoulder examined by
team physician Dr. Frank Jobe before the game. Adams was diagnosed
with tightness in the arm, but he said he didn't think it was
serious. . . . Jeff Shaw, removed from the closer's role recently,
said he didn't plan on going on the disabled list because he didn't
believe he was injured. . . . Lakers guard Kobe Bryant will throw
out the first pitch before tonight's game.

UNVEILING OF THE MAP OF HUMAN DNA RAISES HOPES, QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW SCHOFIELD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the biggest scientific breakthrough of a generation _ and the
likely basis for the next century of medical research _ two rival
groups of scientists Monday announced a nearly completed map of
human DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The map, considered a ``rough draft'' of the human genome, is
the first step on a path that many scientists think could lead to
everything from designer babies to the reduction of human disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the biggest thing to happen in genetics since DNA was
discovered, and even that was simply setting the table for this
announcement,'' said Kelley Thomas, a University of Missouri-Kansas
City geneticist. ``It's not landing on the moon so much as Sputnik,
a shock to the system. I hope it will provide the same sort of kick
in the pants for this country....''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement was made jointly at the White House by Francis
Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute,
and J. Craig Venter, president of Celera Genomics Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Both had been racing to be the first to sequence human DNA, and
experts see their cooperation as a way for both to eliminate the
enormous risk of finishing second.
</P>
<P>
   Human deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, is considered the blueprint
for what makes humans human. Human DNA consists of 6 billion
pieces, and is found in 3 billion base pairs that form a double
helix, or spiral staircase pattern. It controls everything that
goes into making an individual, from eye color to height to
likelihood of contracting cancer. Even so, the DNA of people as
seemingly different as Michael Jordan and Bill Clinton is thought
to be 99.9 percent similar.
</P>
<P>
   And so human genome sequencing is an effort to determine in what
order those 3 billion pairs arrange themselves to make us who we
are.
</P>
<P>
   A National Institutes of Health press release Monday said the
work covered 97 percent of the human DNA chain; the Celera work
covered 99 percent. That's why scientists call it a ``rough
draft.'' They won't consider the work finished until they've
rechecked the results at least four _ and possibly eight _ times.
 &LR; brk:A first edition
</P>
<P>
   Those in the field have known this day was coming for years.
That it came so soon is a testament to rapid advancements in
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Human Genome Project can trace its roots to a late 1980s
California microbiology conference, where geneticists decided the
time had come to pursue the Holy Grail of their field.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, 16 research centers around the world _ including
some in China, England, France, Germany, Japan and the United
States _ signed on to take part in the sequencing effort. Among
those, there are five institutions including Washington University
in St. Louis, and they have accounted for about 80 percent of the
sequencing work.
</P>
<P>
   With the technology and techniques available in the early '80s,
the sequence would have taken 100 years to complete. By the early
'90s, 2010 was thought to be a more likely date. Three years ago,
the target was set on 2005.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, Venter announced he would head a new company and,
using a different method of sequencing, beat the Human Genome
Project to its goal. The race was on.
</P>
<P>
   John McPherson, co-director of the Genome Sequencing Center at
Washington University, said Monday that its researchers completed
the last 60 percent of the sequence in the past six months. He
attributed the increased speed to lowered standards, that is, much
of the data was original and yet to be re-checked.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got here is a rough draft of The Book of Life,'' he
said. ``We can read the book now, and generally understand what
it's all about.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we know there are typos that need to be corrected, and
there are probably some paragraphs that still need to be written,
and others that need to be re-arranged.''
</P>
<P>
   The final version of the completed DNA sequence is expected
sometime before 2003.
</P>
<P>
   McPherson said the reason the book was released before all the
mistakes were edited was simple: public demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each night, we put what we've completed on the Web site, and
scientists were clamoring for more,'' he said. ``We had been moving
along fairly steadily, with a high degree of accuracy. But as more
information got out there, the scientists wanted more.''
</P>
<P>
   And scientists, he said, had been thankful for the information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not exact, but it's close enough that they can see the
storyline and advance their own research,'' McPherson said. ``And
nobody wanted to wait another three years for a first glimpse.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Crawford, a professor of genetics and anthropology at
the University of Kansas, said breakthroughs of this magnitude
don't come along often.
</P>
<P>
   ``We discovered the nature of DNA, then we walked on the moon,
and now this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything we do from here on out will be built upon this
information. ...Really, it doesn't get much bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   What would be built, he added, would come from the subspecialty
of genome diversity. If all men and all women are 99.9 percent
similar, then it is the 0.1 percent that accounts for all the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Fully understanding that 0.1 percent means everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disease, appearance, behavior _ we'll understand it all, and
it will forever change biology, physiology, medicine,'' he said.
``Once a good sequence is done, we can get down to the world of
human variation.''  &LR; brk:Questions abound
</P>
<P>
   The breakthrough announced Monday is big. Kansas Citian M.C.
Sullivan won't deny that. And the advance arrived earlier than
expected.
</P>
<P>
   And that concerns Sullivan, the CEO of the Midwest Bioethics
Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many reasons to be excited here,'' she said.
``It's an exponential increase in our knowledge about ourselves at
a cellular level.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've had years to prepare ourselves, and we've not yet
built any safeguards into our society.''
</P>
<P>
   First, she said, history had shown that there would be those _
the Hitlers and Stalins of the world _ who would seek to abuse
genetic advances.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, and more urgent perhaps, greed is a powerful
motivator. For instance, soon scientists may be able to identify
which genetic sequences mean a person is prone to cancer or heart
disease. If that produces advice on living well and possible
treatments, it's a boon for humanity.
</P>
<P>
   But if it means that insurance companies use the information to
determine who receives coverage and who is denied _ or even which
babies are born _ it could be bad news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once this information is out there, anyone with access to a
drop of your blood will have access to volumes of extraordinarily
private information about you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knows when the raw information of a DNA sequence will be
turned into widespread and commercial applications. Recently,
Sullivan said, she heard that two of the world's most prominent
geneticists were discussing the possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first said certainly within 10 years we'd see work being
done,'' she said. ``The second laughed and said nothing would
happen in any of our lifetimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's safe to say that now that the sequencing is
virtually done, a lot of people will push this forward, and at a
faster rate than we now believe possible. I just hope we're ready
when it happens.''

WHEAT HARVEST PROGRESSES RAPIDLY IN KANSAS DESPITE WET WEATHER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Kansas hard red winter wheat harvest continues to progress
rapidly despite rain that delayed cutting in some areas, the Kansas
Department of Agriculture said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   According to the department's latest weekly report, the Kansas
harvest is 80 percent complete, compared with 45 percent a week ago
and 6 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the crop has ripened, compared with the 59
percent that is normal for this time of year, said Eldon Thiessen,
deputy state statistician for the department.
</P>
<P>
   The harvest has progressed rapidly throughout most of the Kansas
wheat areas, with the exception of the eastern third of the state,
Thiessen said. Wet weather has hampered the harvest in that area,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas traditionally is the nation's leading producer of hard
red winter wheat. Other major producers are Texas and Oklahoma.
Hard red winter wheat is used for bread and similar goods and is a
chief U.S. export.
</P>
<P>
   The Kansas Department of Agriculture is projecting a hard red
winter wheat crop this year of 386.4 million bushels, or 42 bushels
an acre. That compares with last year's crop of 432.4 million
bushels, or slightly more than 47 bushels an acre.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 9.8 million acres were planted with wheat, compared
with 10 million a year ago. The department expects wheat to
actually be harvested from 9.2 million acres, the same as a year
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, export sales of hard red winter wheat for the
1999-2000 marketing year have reached 10.6 million metric tons, the
highest level in seven years, according to the Kansas Wheat
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   For the third consecutive year, the Middle East is the top
buying region for hard red winter wheat, with Egypt the biggest
buyer.

marketing job, he went to the Kirdonn Group, a Kansas City
recruiting agency specializing in that field.
</P>
<P>
   There, Doherty sat in front of a computer terminal with a tiny
video camera mounted on top. He answered four questions on camera
and filmed a two-minute promotional video for himself. Then he
pushed a button to make it part of his resume package.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kirdonn's client companies, freightPro.com, saw Doherty's
video and, within days, pulled him in for interviews and hired him.
He's been on the job now about a month.
</P>
<P>
   Some job hunters may rail at depersonalization of the hiring
process and grouse that people have been replaced by machines, but
higher-tech hiring tools are gaining fans.
</P>
<P>
   Both Triplett and Doherty _ and the people who hired them _ gave
thumbs up to their experiences and declared the processes ``better
than the old way.''
</P>
<P>
   Along with narrowing the applicant field and speeding up the
hiring steps, these computerized candidate-screening systems inject
a uniformity into the hiring process.
</P>
<P>
   The hiring systems put candidates on level ground for
consideration, and they can help keep hiring managers from
wandering onto illegal turf with inappropriate interview questions.
</P>
<P>
   The market is getting more crowded for such hiring tools, but
here's a look at two candidate-screening providers and how their
systems are being used.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, store manager Carol Farris says she might not even
have seen Brad Triplett's application in a timely way. Walk-in
applications at the Hollywood Video store, unfortunately, sometimes
were stashed in check-out counter drawers by part-time workers busy
with customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love this system,'' Farris said of the Decision Point
Systems terminal on the video store counter. ``At first I was
afraid people would look at it and walk away, but they don't. They
stand there and fill it out, and I get a record of every
application right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Within a day, she gets a job candidate's profile faxed back to
her store, scoring the applicant on customer service skills that
the company seeks. Within hours, she knows whether the applicant is
someone she wants to invite in for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The video chain began using the system, which it dubs CAST,
nationally last year. Kristin Horak, vice president of special
projects at Hollywood Video's headquarters in Oregon, said turnover
had been reduced by 40 percent in stores that were early users of
the CAST screening system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are hiring people that are more suited to the jobs and stay
longer,'' Horak said. ``People who did not get hired through the
CAST system are leaving at twice the rate of those hired through
CAST.''
</P>
<P>
   The company uses the applicant screening tool in all of its
stores, warehouses and even, beginning in July, corporate
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent trade show at Bartle Hall, Adam Mertz, product
marketing manager for Decision Point Systems, showed how questions
on the application terminals _ and even the application ``kiosks''
themselves _ can be customized.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Video, Blockbuster Video and Target stores are among
client companies that have had Decision Point Systems create online
application forms and screening questions that fit their needs,
Mertz said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our clients' companies tell us that eight out of 10 paper
application forms that are picked up at their locations don't ever
come back to them,'' Mertz said. ``With the kiosks, they report
getting more applications filled out and returned. Then, the big
benefit is that the screening helps knock out unqualified or
unsatisfactory candidates right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Mertz admitted that no computerized system could promise to pick
the best candidate, but the customized questionnaires can help
employers find applicants who best fit their needs.
</P>
<P>
   Decision Point Systems processed about a million applications
last year for its client companies, which are concentrated in
retail, hospitality and financial services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large employers of front-line workers are finding the greatest
benefit in helping them work through the applicant pool,'' Mertz
said. ``We tie them into background check programs and whatever
else our client companies want. We also can return the testing
profiles within 10 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mertz said client companies typically pay about $200 a month per
terminal, a fee that's cost-effective because of the time it saves
the human resource office or hiring managers from wading through
applications and trying to narrow the applicant field.
</P>
<P>
   At Hollywood Video, according to Kansas City area district
manager Craig Heinitz, another time- and cost-saving benefit has
been the ability to easily transfer information about applicants at
one store to another store that may need immediate hires.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, it's been such a time saver,'' Heinitz said. ``Our
managers love it, and from what I can tell, so do the applicants
because it just speeds everything up.''
</P>
<P>
   A ground-level suite of offices in Overland Park, Kan.,
headquarters for SoftVu, where founder Tim Donnelly and his small
but growing staff are rolling out the video recruiting product used
by job hunter David Doherty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been involved in hiring, and I've seen the need for a
better way to showcase talent and abilities,'' Donnelly said. ``I
think we've got something that is better, faster, cheaper all the
way around.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Kirdonn agency, early SoftVu clients include
the Spencer Reed Group, Rockhurst University and Benedictine
College.
</P>
<P>
   For $1,500 to $2,000 a month, recruiters, job counseling offices
and hirers have access to what Donnelly alternately calls an
``Internet video streaming product'' and a ``video resume portal.''
</P>
<P>
   Clients can get the hardware and software necessary to videotape
applicant presentations, as the Kirdonn Group has done, or they can
send candidates to SoftVu for videotaping and then view the
candidates' presentations online.
</P>
<P>
   Job applicants have the choice of letting their paper resumes
speak for themselves or sitting in front of the blue fabric
backdrop to record a video to add to their application.
</P>
<P>
   If they do record a video, they respond to questions on the
computer screen, questions that can be generic job interview
questions or tailored for the client company.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Panus, president of the Kirdonn Group, said his agency
generally placed 25 to 30 sales and marketing candidates a month in
the Kansas City area. Since March, when the agency began using the
SoftVu video system, Panus said, the time frame for ``previewing''
candidates has sped up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the videos go online on our Web site, our client
companies can use their passwords to preview the candidates we're
sending them,'' Panus said. ``And the hiring managers can do this
any time of day, from work or home or wherever. It really helps
them narrow the field and decide whom they want to bring in for
interviews.''
</P>
<P>
   For his agency, which also has offices in St. Louis, and for his
client companies that also might have scattered operations, Panus
added, it's cost-effective to do a video screening of job
candidates. Instead of flying several candidates in for interviews,
the screening may help reduce the field and thus reduce hiring
costs.
</P>
<P>
   At freightPro.com, the company that hired Doherty, president Jim
Bramlett said his inaugural experience sold him on the video
screening process.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes us a lot less time and effort to nail down the
candidates,'' Bramlett said.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bramlett has interviewed about a half-dozen persons
screened through SoftVu. Some told him they didn't think they had
enough time when they recorded their videos to practice and polish
their presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But, hey, if it's almost live that makes it easier for me to
evaluate how they react to situations,'' Bramlett said. ``If
they're succinct and composed, it narrows the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they stumble and don't have a good appearance, especially
for an outside sales position, it's easier for us to say, `Well,
maybe this isn't the right person.' It's a great way to help us
evaluate eloquence.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike photographs, such performance videos are not considered
to be a violation of equal employment opportunity laws because they
showcase talents or abilities that might be considered necessary
attributes for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Doherty, who said he used a couple of takes before releasing his
best shot, said his comfort in front of the camera might be tied to
having a personality suited to sales and marketing positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't mind it,'' Doherty said. ``I figured it was an
opportunity to get my enthusiasm and other emotional aspects across
_ things you just can't articulate in a resume. I thought it was a
great way to get my foot in the door.''

 DAVIS TO SIGN BILL PROTECTING RIGHTS OF GAY JURORS  &HT;     By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Gays and lesbians cannot be denied jury service
because of their sexual orientation under a bill to be signed
Tuesday by Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also forbids lawyers from excusing potential jurors
over a belief their sexual orientation makes them biased.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wonderful the governor is going to affirm his support
that all people should participate equally in the jury selection
process,'' said the bill's author, Assemblywoman Carole Migden,
D-San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is the first of several in the Legislature expanding
the rights of gays and lesbians that has reached Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest bill, pending in the Assembly, increases the rights
of domestic partners to include inheriting property and making
medical decisions for an incapacitated partner.
</P>
<P>
   Davis has said he does not intend to sign any domestic partner
legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
   Migden's bill gives the Democratic governor a chance to sign a
modest measure benefiting gays and lesbians, giving him some
political cover if he vetoes future domestic partner bills.
</P>
<P>
   Migden's bill places in law previous federal and state court
decisions that say a person cannot be prevented from service on a
jury because of sexual orientation or dismissed by lawyers because
of a perceived bias based on that orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The law already contains a long list of factors that cannot be
used to exempt persons from jury service _ job, race, color,
religion, sex or nationality, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The new law mirrors a decision this year by the Fourth District
Court of Appeals in Orange County which said gays and lesbians
should be added to that group of people.
</P>
<P>
   The court said that gays and lesbians have a common perspective
and therefore represent a class of citizens that cannot be excluded
from jury service.
</P>
<P>
   But, the court said, sexual orientation should not be part of
questioning potential jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one should be `outed' in order to take part in the civic
enterprise which is jury duty,'' the court wrote. ``The whole point
is that no one can be excluded because of sexual orientation. That
being the case, no one should be allowed to inquire about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Migden's bill, which would take effect January 1, also places
other court decisions in law that prevent lawyers from using
challenges to kick off potential jurors because of concern they are
biased because of their sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bill does not sharply expand the rights of gays and
lesbians, it was not without opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gays, lesbians and bisexuals are a politically charged,
activist minority fighting to advance a sexual lifestyle that has
never been accepted in American history,'' wrote the Committee on
Moral Concerns in opposition to the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bill's findings identify them as a group that might have a
chip on its shoulder,'' the group continued. ``That is exactly the
type of social segment that should be excluded from certain
trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the groups supporting the bill are the state Attorney
General`s Office, the Judicial Council and the American Civil
Liberties Union.

 SOLAR-POWERED HOT SEAT AHEAD?  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The presidential race is heating up to the point
where experts now rate it as ``tepid,'' and random potshots are
giving way to issues of real substance.
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore announced a sweeping energy strategy, with tax
incentives to energy savers.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, not to be outdone, announced that he would offer
tax credits to Texas death-row inmates who sign up to use the
state's new solar-powered electric chair.
</P>
<P>
   IN COSMIC news, scientists last week discovered evidence of
water on Mars, raising the possibility that life could exist there.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Martian life forms came out of the closet and admitted
that they do exist. Then the Martians held a press conference to
announce that they are buying Earth and consolidating operations of
the two planets, a merger designed to cut costs, boost sales and
beef up defense against evil invaders from other solar systems.
</P>
<P>
   In related news, the Philip Morris /Nabisco merger will result
in the first adult cereal, Shredded Nic-a-Wheat.
</P>
<P>
   NO ITEM here goes uncorrected.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I noted that North Beach Playground assistant rec
director Dan Harrington first suggested naming the playground after
Joe DiMaggio a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the idea first surfaced in '77. The playground is home field
of the softball dynasty Les Lapins Sauvages. Team member Chris
Sullivan, now retired from the SFPD but then ace investigator for
the sex crimes detail, suggested naming the field after Joe. A
campaign was launched and the supervisors voted the name change in
1980.
</P>
<P>
   Question: The Great DiMaggio had 19 years to register his
objection to the naming, so why did he wait until he was dead to
complain?
</P>
<P>
   JOE BACKLASH: DiMaggio's pal /attorney Morris Engelberg will be
happy to learn that Jim Brandt, owner of the Gold Coast, is
dismantling the restaurant's Joe DiMaggio photo gallery.
</P>
<P>
   The photos will be hung in the men's room, which will be
officially named the ``Morris Engelberg (off-color slang name for
rest room).''
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Gavin Newsom says he'll be on hand July 13 to
dedicate the room.
</P>
<P>
   And Ultan O'Broin suggests that the burger joint under the
Doggie Diner head on Sloat be re-named the Joe DeDoggio Diner.
</P>
<P>
   THE STORY about the CEO of Catholic Charities putting cosmetic
surgery and lavish restaurant tabs on his expense account, on top
of his $172,000 salary, brought back fond memories for Ed Moose.
</P>
<P>
   In '61, Ed became PR director (read: fund-raiser) for Catholic
Charities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pay,'' Ed says, ``was a princely $6,000 per annum (note
Ed's fluent Latin), and neither dinner nor dermabrasion was a perk.
Where did I go wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   For starters, Ed, you had a lousy agent.
</P>
<P>
   And anyone knows it would be silly for a Moose to get a
face-lift.
</P>
<P>
   SPEED BUMPS: The property owner of the Westport Business Park in
Redwood Shores has installed a bunch of speed bumps because a bunch
of people were speeding.
</P>
<P>
   Workers are objecting. One said, ``It's a cop's job to enforce
the laws of the state, not a speed bump's job!''
</P>
<P>
   That's a good point, pal, because cops don't have enough to do

 SUPREME COURT REJECTS CALIFORNIA'S PRIMARY LAW  &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Supreme Court struck down California's system
of ``blanket primaries'' Monday, ruling that political parties have
the right to exclude nonparty voters from the process of choosing
their candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-to-2 decision invalidates state election rules _ in place
since 1998 _ that permitted voters, regardless of party
affiliation, to vote for candidates of any party.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, said forcing
the parties to honor the votes of nonmembers amounted to a ``stark
repudiation of freedom of political association,'' and that
 &LR; violated a party's ability to control its own nominating process
and define its identity.
</P>
<P>
   As a legal matter, the ruling restores the state's closed
primary system, in which only registered Republicans can vote in
the Republican primary, and only registered Democrats can vote in
Democratic primaries. The decision also affects election laws in
Washington and Alaska, which are similar to California's.
</P>
<P>
   As a political matter, it is a setback for moderates hoping to
boost voter turnout and reward centrist candidates who appeal to
members of both parties. The state's primary rules had been
championed by officeholders from Gov. Gray Davis, a Democrat, to
Rep. Tom Campbell, R-Calif., to Secretary of State Bill Jones, and
Arizona Senator John McCain, all Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the blanket primary said they would try to find a
legally acceptable alternative in time for the 2002 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do everything within my power to find a
constitutionally permissible way to ensure California voters
continue to have as many choices as possible in our primary
elections,'' Davis said in response to the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell and Jones made similar pledges, each contending that
the new rules were responsible for huge increases in voter turnout
during the past two elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to let people participate as freely as they did in
2000,'' said Campbell, who is running for U.S. Senate. ``Some
change is needed.''
</P>
<P>
   The case pit the right of a state to determine its own election
laws against the right of political parties to select their
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Under California law, primary votes from party members were
given the same weight as those of nonparty members, setting up the
possibility that a Republican candidate might win the primary even
while losing a majority of Republican votes.
</P>
<P>
   Two Southern California assembly candidates assert that is
exactly what happened to them in March, and now they are expected
to go to court to overturn their election losses.
</P>
<P>
   In his majority opinion, Scalia disparaged a system that
``forces political parties to associate with (and) to have their
nominees, and hence the positions, determined by those who at best,
have refused to affiliate with the party, and at worst, have
expressly affiliated with a rival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Representative democracy ... is unimaginable without the
ability of citizens to band together in promoting among the
electorate candidates who espouse their political views,'' Scalia
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The justices said they were not deciding the constitutionality
of the more common open primary system used in another 20 states.
In most of those systems, voters choose on election day in which
party's primary they will participate.
</P>
<P>
   Parties have not objected to such rules and in many cases have
voluntarily opened up their primaries to nonparty voters, they may
stay with them in November.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party Chairman Art Torres said Monday he would
consider voluntarily opening California's Democratic primaries to
independents and voters who decline to state their preference.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice John Paul Stevens wrote in dissent that he believed
Monday's high court ruling endangered those primary systems, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is surely a danger that open primaries will fare no
better against a First Amendment challenge than blanket primaries
have,'' Stevens wrote in an opinion joined by Justice Ruth Bader
Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   In siding with the U.S. Court of Appeals in San Francisco, which
had voted to uphold the law earlier this year, Stevens acknowledged
the party's right to association, but said that states have special
rights to determine the nature of elections.
</P>
<P>
   Both general and primary elections ``are quintessential forms of
state action,'' Stevens wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a state acts not to limit democratic participation, but
to expand '' the ability of individuals to participate in the
democratic process, it is acting not as a foe of the First
Amendment but as a friend and ally.
</P>
<P>
   In pledging not to give up the fight in California, Campbell
said he thinks that by concentrating on the effect the state's
primary had on political parties, the overall ruling may provide a
road map for a possible replacement.
</P>
<P>
   Louisiana now uses a nonpartisan version of the blanket primary,
where the top two vote-getters, regardless of party affiliation,
move into the runoff election. Since that system doesn't affect the
parties, it would be legal in California, Campbell suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Allowing voters to register on election day, instead of cutting
off registration weeks earlier, also could boost voter turnout,
Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   The blanket primary law was challenged by the Democratic,
Republican, Libertarian and Peace and Freedom parties, each of whom
applauded the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision ... (will) help preserve the two-party system
which, for all its faults, is preferable to any of the known
alternatives.'' said Jim Nicholson, chairman of the Republican
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether the ruling will affect the two Southern
California legislative races whose outcomes were directly affected
by the blanket primary rules. In both cases, the winning Republican
candidates failed to win a majority of Republican votes, winning on
the strength of nonparty voters.
</P>
<P>
   The losing candidates are expected to take their claim to court,
but it is unclear whether the cases can be heard in time for
November's election.
</P>

 MIRANDA WARNINGS UPHELD BY SUPREME COURT  &HT;     By HARRIET CHIANG 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court upheld a legal and cultural icon of America's
justice system Monday by reaffirming the landmark Miranda warnings
that require police to advise suspects of their right to remain
silent.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-to-2 decision gives new momentum to a right, established
in 1966, that has become a cornerstone of criminal defense. The
ruling should also end the tactic, practiced by some police
officers, of ignoring the warnings during interrogations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Miranda decision, once a suspect has been advised of
his or her right to remain silent and has requested a lawyer,
police can no longer continue questioning.
</P>
<P>
   In another victory for defendants, the high court left intact a
federal appeals court ruling allowing two Southern California
inmates, then suspects in separate cases, to sue police officers
for continuing to question them after the two invoked their Miranda
rights.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's ruling, written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist,
the court said the Miranda warnings are a constitutional right that
only the court and not Congress can overturn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miranda has become embedded in routine police practice to the
point where the warnings have become part of our national
culture,'' Rehnquist wrote. The court will overturn a prior
decision only under ``special circumstances,'' he said. ``We do not
think there is such justification for overruling Miranda.''
</P>
<P>
   In upholding Miranda, the high court reversed a decision last
year by a federal appeals court in Virginia that appeared to doom
the warnings. The appeals court, in a ruling that caught many legal
experts by surprise, held that police who fail to give Miranda
warnings can still use statements under an obscure 1968 law passed
by Congress. The law, which had been long ignored, sought to
replace Miranda with a general ``totality of circumstances'' test
to determine if a suspect made the statements voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Both defense lawyers and prosecutors in California say the high
court's actions may stop some police officers from deliberately
ignoring a suspect's Miranda rights, a practice taught to them at
state-approved courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two cases together send a strong message to law
enforcement that Miranda is a constitutional rule and it has to be
obeyed,'' said Charles Weisselberg, a criminal law professor at the
University of California at Berkeley and one of the lawyers for the
two Southern California inmates who filed civil rights suits
against the police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for the state attorney general's
office, said the lawyers in the office were still reviewing the
court's decision. ``It does appear the court has attempted to
clarify the confusion associated with Miranda rights around the
country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Hutchins, a deputy district attorney in Alameda County who
teaches courses on search and seizure as well as Miranda warnings,
insisted that Monday's rulings are not setbacks for law
enforcement. Without the Miranda warnings, ``it would be a mess,''
he said. ``Officers wouldn't have any way to determine what they
should do and what they shouldn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Miranda warnings have become a familiar part of police
procedures, based on the Fifth Amendment provision that no criminal
defendant ``shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness
against himself.''
</P>
<P>
   In its 1966 ruling, the high court established the Miranda
rights as an added protection against police brutality and coerced
confessions.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any television crime show will  &LR; includes in the script
``You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used
against you.''
</P>
<P>
   But over the years, the Supreme Court has allowed several
exceptions to the rule. Police can, without first giving the
Miranda warnings, use a suspect's statements to challenge his or
her credibility. The rule can also be bypassed in emergencies when
law officers are trying to find a kidnap victim or a discarded
weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The high court also has ruled that in requesting a lawyer, a
suspect be clear and unequivocal.
</P>
<P>
   In the case decided Monday, Charles Dickerson of Maryland was
indicted on bank robbery charges but claimed that he had not
received his Miranda warnings when he was brought in for
questioning at an FBI office.
</P>
<P>
   A federal trial judge ruled in his favor, suppressing the
statements he made. But the federal appeals court reversed that
decision, based on Congress' 1968 law to replace Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   In his opinion, Rehnquist said exceptions made by the high court
were merely ``refinements'' made to a general constitutional rule.
Miranda, he stated clearly, is still the rule of the land.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, joined by Justice Clarence Thomas,
dissented, calling the Miranda decision a ``milestone of judicial
overreaching.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Southern California inmates case, two convicted killers
separately brought civil rights suits against police officers who
continued to question them after each had requested legal
representation.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, the defendant's statements were used against him
during cross-examination. In the second, the prosecutor relied on
the defendant's statements during sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   The federal appeals court in San Francisco ruled in November
that the police officers who deliberately ignored the defendants'
Miranda rights were not immune from lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   William Hadden, a lawyer who filed a brief on behalf of several
law enforcement groups, said ``it seems unfair that they would be
held personally liable,'' since they are trained to find ways to
circumvent the Miranda rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be the perfect kind of case where a government
agency should pick up the cost for any damages assessed.''

INSURANCE OFFICIAL SAYS QUACKENBUSH ORDERED SETTLEMENT TO PAY FOR 
 TV ADS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
SACRAMENTO _ In perhaps the most damaging testimony yet for
Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush, a senior Insurance
Department official told an investigating committee Monday he was
ordered to settle a case because Quackenbush needed money for
television commercials.
<P>
   The testimony, from senior department official Robert Hagadorn,
directly contradicts Quackenbush's previous assertion that he had
no knowledge of the controversial foundations used to settle claims
with insurance companies or that the money was spent on television
commercials in which he appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hagadorn's testimony was very damaging to the commissioner's
claims that he was uninvolved,'' said Northridge Assemblyman Tom
McClintock, the senior-ranking Republican on the Assembly Insurance
Committee. ``It's imperative the commissioner categorically refute
the evidence presented to the committee ... or its going to lead to
action by the state Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush has denied any wrongdoing. He is scheduled to appear
before the committee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's hearing was part of the Assembly committee's continuing
investigation into the actions of the Department of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   In a day of high drama, the committee ordered the arrest of one
witness who failed to appear, while three other key witnesses
exercised their Fifth Amendment privilege against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators are investigating allegations that Quackenbush
coerced insurance companies into paying $12 million to two
nonprofit foundations he created. The payments allegedly allowed
the insurers to avoid paying as much as $3.7 billion in fines for
improperly handling policyholders' claims after the 1994 Northridge
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the payments to the foundations were used to promote
the Republican commissioner's own political agenda and that none of
the money went to earthquake victims.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office also is conducting a civil and
criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Hagadorn, head of the department's compliance bureau, said he
was involved in reaching a settlement with a title insurance
company when the department's chief counsel, Brian Soublet, told
him Quackenbush ``needed $4 million for a media buy.''
</P>
<P>
   At around the same time, Hagedorn said, the deputy commissioner
for finance, Norris Clark, told him that his settlement ought to be
at least $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Hagedorn said he found the suggestion to be both reasonable and
suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   While he said he thought there should be a payment by the
company, he was suspicious about the amount because ``it was the
same number.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark is scheduled to testify on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Three witnesses took the Fifth Amendment Monday, including a
current Department of Insurance employee.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Lowder, a top aide to Quackenbush _ whose previous
testimony has been called into question _ refused to answer the
committee's questions.
</P>
<P>
   Also taking the Fifth was Courtney Sakai, an associate of Joe
Shumate, Quackenbush's political consultant. Sakai had been
expected to testify about why political questions were included in
a poll that was supposed to deal with earthquake issues.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, George Grays, the top aide to Quackenbush who
resigned when the growing scandal came to light, also took the
Fifth Amendment. Many witnesses have testified that Grays was
running the foundations out of his office, and at least one witness
testified that Grays may have forged his signature on checks.
</P>
<P>
   The committee issued an arrest warrant for B.T. Thompson of the
Skillz Athletic Foundation, which received $217,000 from one of the
foundations and ran a sports camp attended by Quackenbush's
children. Thompson failed to appear under subpoena, and the
committee ordered the sergeant-at-arms to arrest him and compel him
to testify.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, the whistleblower who first leaked key information
about Quackenbush said she was told to shred some documents.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Ossias, a San Francisco lawyer in the Department of
Insurance, said Lowder, the department's top enforcement officer,
told her and other department attorneys to destroy drafts of
documents containing potential penalties derived from department
audits of State Farm's handling of earthquake-related claims.
</P>
<P>
   She testified that the settlements derived from those claims
were far less than what should have been obtained and that some
contained unusual terms, including a finding that State Farm acted
in good faith in handling its claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was appalled,'' Ossias told the committee. ``I had been
involved in three of the examinations. ... I felt these exams
showed violations that were egregious and warranted hefty fines.''
</P>
<P>
   As first reported by The Chronicle, Ossias was granted immunity
for her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Ossias also testified that she developed a number that she
considered to be a starting point for negotiations with the
insurance companies. This directly contradicts testimony of several
top Quackenbush aides, who said there were never any number
recommended by department lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was shocked by the $2.83 billion amount that was
presented as a fine for State Farm during meetings in March 1999.
During those meetings _ which were referred to in the department as
a ``Turkey Shoot'' _ members of the legal department were told to
put empty boxes in the room to intimidate insurance companies.

A SHORT NIGHT FOR HERSHISER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The quandary was about Carlos Perez for the first
month of the season. The Los Angeles Dodgers had him, but they
didn't know what to do with him. The dilemma remains, but the
subject has now changed from Perez to Orel Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   They have tried everything and so far nothing has worked.
</P>
<P>
   Just when it looks like it won't get worse, the one-time prized
possession of the Dodgers shows this isn't 12 years ago. Or even
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was unmercifully knocked around in an eight-run second
inning as the San Diego Padres extended the Dodgers' losing streak
to a season-high five games with a 9-5 win Monday in the opener of
a four-game series at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Bret Boone had five RBI in the decisive second
inning, including a three-run homer. Brian Meadows (6-5) allowed
three runs in 7 innings for his second win since May 14.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, who have dropped to fourth place in the National
League, got solo homers from Todd Hollandsworth and Alex Cora. It
was the first of Cora's career. They got a two-run double from
Shawn Gilbert in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   For Hershiser, it might be his lowest point of the season. He
allowed eight runs on six hits in 1 innings, hitting his 11th
batter in 24 innings of work.
</P>
<P>
   It might outdo his seven earned runs and four hit batters in 1
innings against Houston on April 19, or his five earned runs in
one-third of an inning in a May 9 relief appearance at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing to consider in this latest debacle is that
Hershiser (1-5) was pitching on one day's rest. He threw 26 pitches
in 1 innings before rain interrupted his start Saturday in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   This outing, atop what's been a messy season, again raises
questions about Hershiser's future and his role with the Dodgers.
When they signed him to a one-year, free-agent deal in the
offseason that guarantees him $2.5 million, a veteran pitcher with
a 13.14 ERA wasn't what they had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible Hershiser's spot in the rotation could go to
Perez, who didn't have the same problems pitching on the same days
as Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   Just like in St. Louis, Perez pitched very well in place of
Hershiser. He allowed two hits in 4 innings scoreless, and
pressureless, innings. Perez allowed one run in 4 innings in relief
of Hershiser against the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   However, a decision on what to do with Hershiser could be put
off.
</P>
<P>
   One thing to consider is how much pitching two days after his
last start affected him. After rain stopped his last start,
pitching coach Claude Osteen and catcher Paul LoDuca said
Hershiser's stuff was wonderful and his command was strong.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers must also consider the suspension factor. Paul
Beeston, chief operating officer for the office of the
commissioner, is expected to rule this week on appeals of the 16
players suspended from last month's Wrigley Field melee.
</P>
<P>
   In Frank Robinson's May 24 ruling, starters Darren Dreifort,
Eric Gagne and Chan Ho Park were suspended three games each and
Perez was suspended five games. The Dodgers are hopeful those
suspensions are either wiped out or reduced, but contingency plans
are being made in case they hold up.
</P>
<P>
   Gagne is scheduled to be recalled from Triple-A Albuquerque to
start today against the Padres, but part of the thinking is to get
Gagne back on the roster and bump the pitching staff to 12. That
would also give the Dodgers six starters to mix and match over five
spots in the rotation, which could cover gaps created by the
pending suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't start out poorly for Hershiser. He got Ryan Klesko to
hit into a double play to end the first inning, but there was
nothing to help him in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Nevin led off with a walk and Boone homered to put the
Padres ahead 2-1. Carlos Hernandez singled to left, Ruben Rivera
walked and Kevin Nicholson drove in a run with an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   After a double steal and a strikeout of Meadows, Eric Owens'
infield single scored a run and Ed Sprague hit a sacrifice fly to
give the Padres a 5-1 lead. Klesko was hit with a pitch and Nevin
singled before Boone delivered a three-run double.

HIGH COURT VOTES NO ON OPEN PRIMARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICK ORLOV 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The U.S. Supreme Court handed political parties a
major victory Monday, throwing out California's blanket primary
system that let Democrats and Republicans vote for any candidate,
regardless of party affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 7-2 ruling, the court said the state law, as well as
similar ones in Alaska, Washington and Louisiana, violate the First
Amendment provision for freedom of association because they prevent
political parties from determining their own candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the state law, overwhelmingly approved by voters
in 1996, vowed to submit a new measure to voters in 2002. The
blanket primary was designed to attract more voters and produce
more moderate nominees.
</P>
<P>
   Party leaders, however, said they will try to come up with an
alternative before 2002 that would give independent voters a say in
elections. One avenue, which the court upheld, is the practice of
allowing voters to register for a specific party ballot on the day
of the election.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we don't want is Democrats deciding Republican
candidates, and I'm sure the Democrats feel the same way about
us,'' said Mike Schroeder, former state chairman of the Republican
Party, who filed the initial lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This wasn't an open primary as much as it was giving people a
chance to channel-surf for candidates. And the parties that were
really hurt were the minor parties that saw their members no longer
having any say in nominating their candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Bill Jones, a Republican who supported the
blanket primary system, said he is not sure same-day registration
would be feasible in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not New Hampshire,'' Jones said, referring to a state
where a same-day registration is allowed. ``We have a lot more
voters out here, and I'm not sure it's practical.''
</P>
<P>
   The California system listed all candidates and allowed voters
to jump from one party to the next for any given office.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, writing for the majority, said the
California system was ``forcing political parties to associate with
those who do not share their beliefs, and it has done this at the
crucial juncture at which party members traditionally find their
collective voice and select their spokesman.''
</P>
<P>
   He said ``the burden (the California law) places on the rights
of political association is both severe and unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   His opinion was backed by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and
Justices Sandra Day O'Connor, Anthony M. Kennedy, David H. Souter,
Clarence Thomas and Stephen Breyer. Dissenting were Justices John
Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was pursued by the Democratic, Republican,
Libertarian and Peace and Freedom parties, whose leaders had
appealed after the state law was upheld by lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder and state Democratic Party Chairman Art Torres said
they would favor some method allowing independent voters to take
part in partisan primaries by declaring on primary election day in
which party they want to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said it is too late to get an initiative petition
circulated and qualified for the November ballot, but that he was
looking at whether a legislator would consider authoring a measure.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Tobey of Californians to Protect the Open Primary said he
will seek to qualify a measure for the November 2002 election.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've done it before, and we'll do it again,'' Tobey said,
citing polls showing 72 percent of Californians support the blanket
primary.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gray Davis expressed disappointment with the court
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the first governor of California to be nominated in an open
primary, I believe this process is good for voters and good for
democracy,'' Davis said. ``In light of the court's decision, I will
do everything within my power to find a constitutionally
permissible way to ensure California voters continue to have as
many choices as possible in our primary elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling will not affect this year's primary election results
or those in past years, said George Waters, a Sacramento attorney
whose firm serves as general counsel to the state Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Former independent state Sen. Lucy Killea, one of the original
sponsors of the measure, said she was disappointed in the court
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea was to try to reduce the influence of political
parties,'' said Killea, who said she left the Democratic Party
because of her disgust with partisanship in Sacramento. ``It's a
shame that now the parties will be able to again be so strong.''

PROPOSAL TO BAN JUNIOR ROTC RIFLES TRIGGERS DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HARRISON SHEPPARD 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Junior ROTC cadets in Los Angeles Unified could
find themselves training to be soldiers without one crucial element
_ mock guns and air rifles for drills and competition _ if a
proposed school board resolution passes.
</P>
<P>
   School board member Valerie Fields wants to ban the use of the
rifles by students in the Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps,
saying they are inconsistent with the board's zero- tolerance
policy on weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sending out mixed messages to kids,'' Fields said.
``You come to school with a mock gun, a toy gun and you're
expelled. And yet we allow the ROTC kids to come in with disarmed
weapons and we glorify them.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that she respects the district's JROTC program and the
values it teaches, but just thinks ``they don't need to be that
militaristic.''
</P>
<P>
   Her resolution calls for the program's officials to come up with
an appropriate substitute for the use of rifles and report back to
the board. But JROTC cadets said getting rid of the mock rifles
would mean the end of their drill teams and competitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole competition is based on rifles,'' said Juan Marquez,
15, a cadet master sergeant in the Army JROTC program at Monroe
High School in suburban Sepulveda. ``If we don't have the rifles,
we don't have a competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students said performing drills with the mock rifles,
while only a small part of the program, is one of the more fun and
challenging elements, and also helps to recruit younger students.
</P>
<P>
   Egly Sanabria, 17, a North Hills senior and cadet lieutenant
colonel, said training with air rifles has taught him discipline
and concentration, two skills that are also useful in the school
environment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're shooting you have to concentrate in everything you
do,'' said Sanabria, who plans to join the Army Reserve after
graduation. ``The slightest distraction and you won't shoot in the
middle (of the target). It also helps to make the stress go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields' resolution to ban the use of mock guns by JROTC was
supposed to come up for board discussion today. Instead it will be
assigned to the School Safety and Campus Environment Committee,
which will take it up July 20, to give people more time to comment
on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, JROTC students on the drill teams and color guard use
mock rifles either a Springfield 1903 rifle that has been
``demilitarized,'' or stripped of its firing mechanism and its
barrel blocked, or fake rifles made of plastic. The demilitarized
weapons cannot be converted back into working guns, according to
JROTC officials.
</P>
<P>
   Students on the rifle team use air rifles, which fire small
pellets, for marksmanship training and competition.
</P>
<P>
   The students who use the rifles are a small percentage of the
overall JROTC program. At Monroe High School, out of almost 300
JROTC cadets, only five are on the air rifle team and 15 are on the
drill team.
</P>
<P>
   Districtwide, there are about 4,500 cadets.
</P>
<P>
   JROTC administrators said the use of weapons, even symbolic
ones, to guard the flag when it is presented during ceremonies has
been a long and important tradition in the military. Without the
use of rifles, serving on the color guard just won't be the same,
they argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you present the colors, it's a tradition that goes back
to the days of the Roman Empire,'' said Army Lt. Col Ted McDonald,
assistant director of the district's JROTC program. ``You protect
your banner, your flag. Back then they used swords and spears. In
modern times we use a sidearm.''
</P>
<P>
   If the mock rifles are not allowed, he said, they would consider
other options to guard the flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always been guarded. How we would guard it, I don't know.
Maybe we'd have to go to sabers.''
</P>
<P>
   But McDonald also said that ultimately the use of rifles is not
the most important element of the JROTC program and he would
cooperate with whatever decision the board makes.
</P>
<P>
   But not all board members agree with Fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zero tolerance is all about having weapons on campus that are
meant to do harm to other kids or teachers or anyone who happens to
be on the school site. That's not what ROTC weapons are about,''
said board member Caprice Young, who added she hasn't decided yet
how she'll vote on the resolution. ``They're used for drills,
They're used for honorary kinds of protocols. They're not used to
hurt people.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that the use of mock guns also symbolizes for students
that sometimes democracy has to be defended by the use of force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to fight for this democracy, and we have to struggle
every day in a global community that doesn't necessarily support
democracy. Sometimes it's important to, symbolically through our
rituals, through our flag salutes, show we are willing to continue
to fight for democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Member Julie Korenstein, who heads the safety committee and
helped craft the zero-tolerance policy, said she can see both
sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little disconcerting that it's OK to have guns for some
things yet not have guns for anything else,'' Korenstein said. ``At
the same time, I suspect if we're having ROTC on our campuses,
which is a form of premilitary training, there may be reason to
allow it. I'm still making my mind up.''

DRUG FIRMS EYE GENOME MAPPING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ While the mapping of the human genome is
essentially complete, the work is really just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   For two area companies, the work that begins now is where the
opportunities lie.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people initially thought that the mapping was
completed, that was the end game. The fact is, it's kind of the
beginning game,'' said James Chamberlain, president and chief
executive officer of Biosource International, based in Camarillo in
neighboring Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the sequence of the genetic makeup of all humans has
been uncovered, it is up to scientists to take those genes and make
sense of what they say.
</P>
<P>
   That's where a company such as Biosource stands to benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Biosource's products include strands of DNA as well as test kits
and proteins, all of which are used at every stage of biotechnology
research.
</P>
<P>
   Major universities, biotech companies and pharmaceutical
manufacturers all use Biosource's products in their research, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It opens up many more areas of research,'' Chamberlain said.
``It just fits right into our products. This should help us out a
lot even though we're not making the drugs ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   One company that is making the drugs is Thousand Oaks-based
biotechnology giant Amgen, also in Ventura County whose
billion-dollar drugs Epogen and Neupogen both are the result of
similar genetic research.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen has been engaged in genomic sequencing, but with the
ultimate goal of taking the information it discovers and creating
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   One of Amgen's current drug candidates, OPG, is the result of
such research, said Amgen spokesman David Kaye.
</P>
<P>
   Amgen scientists isolated a gene, then engineered mice that had
an overexpressed version of the gene and others that had an
underexpressed version.
</P>
<P>
   Those mice with the overexpressed gene had excessively dense
bones, while the other mice had brittle, weak bones. The
researchers then found the protein whose manufacture that gene
regulates and are testing it as a possible drug for osteoporosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to remember that genes are not drugs,'' Kaye
said. ``There is a lot of work to be done. It's a really important
first step.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its own genomics program, Amgen subscribes to
Celera's library of genetic information. The company already has
begun research based on the information Celera has decoded, Kaye
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a drug discovery company,'' Kaye said. ``What we hope to
do is develop important therapeutics that can make use of the human
genome.''

BAN ON AMMO SALES IN L.A. BACKED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALEXA HAUSSLER 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Acknowledging that Los Angeles would be plunging
into a national legal debate, a City Council committee is
supporting banning the sale of ammunition in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a problem in our society and a problem in our city,
and I think this is a remedy in trying to solve that problem,''
said Councilman Mike Hernandez, who proposed the measure to the
council's Public Safety Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The committee _ with two of its three members present _ approved
the proposal Monday and sent it to the full council for
consideration, despite threats by gun-control opponents to
challenge the measure immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laws which do not have a rational basis are unconstitutional,
and I think you'll find that this law does have no rational
basis,'' said Randall Herrst, a gun advocate with the Center for
the Study of Crime. ``You are reducing the ability of people to
defend themselves much more than you are the ability of criminals
to commit crimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is the largest U.S. city with such a prohibition, said
supporters and critics of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Council members said the city's approval of a ban would give Los
Angeles grounds to add its voice to a case now before a federal
appeals court. The U.S. 9th Circuit Court is considering whether
state law pre-empts a Los Angeles County ban on ammunition sales on
county property.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Supervisors passed the ban in August, driving a
major gun show out of the county fairgrounds at Pomona. Arguments
in the case are scheduled to be heard Aug. 10 in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll give us a reason to engage in the current debate,'' said
Councilman Nick Pacheco, a committee member.
</P>
<P>
   In case the ban on ammunition sales is shot down in court, the
committee called for a contingency _ a proposal by Councilman Mike
Feuer to require yearly background checks for purchasers of
ammunition in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Roberta Schiller, executive director of Women Against Gun
Violence, urged the committee to approve the Feuer proposal, saying
other California cities likely would follow suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we need is to create a web of cities that can support
this middle-of-the road type of ammunition regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Police Commission supported both measures late
last year. After the committee's approval Monday, the ban is
expected to be taken up by the City Council in about three weeks,
although no date has been set.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Michel, a Los Angeles attorney representing the National
Rifle Association, said his client would file a lawsuit if either
of the Los Angeles ordinances is adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither one of these ordinances is going to prevent one crime
from occurring because ammunition is available through the mail,''
he said. ``Anybody who wants ammunition will now just simply not
buy it through a dealer in L.A.''

FED RATE BOOST UNLIKELY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Former Federal Reserve Board Governor Robert
Heller said Monday that he believes the Fed is likely to leave
short-term interest rates unchanged when they meet today and
Wednesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Heller said the Federal Open Market Committee, the group within
the Federal Reserve that controls monetary policy, is likely to
leave rates alone so that they can analyze the effect of past rate
increases on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of sectors are beginning to turn soft,'' he said. ``You
are seeing a slowdown in auto sales, housing starts and sales of
existing homes, along with other interest-rate-sensitive sectors of
the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates 1.75
percentage points over the past year in an effort slow inflation at
a time of record economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   When they last met in mid-May, the central bank's top
policy-makers raised overnight interest rates by a half-point to
6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to wait and see if a course correction has taken
place,'' added Heller. ``You don't want to overdo it.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this week's meeting, the outlook for Fed policy is
uncertain. Fed policy-makers meet again Aug. 22. At that time, if
new data suggest a rebound in growth, they could raise rates by a
quarter of a percentage point, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no clue what they are going to do in August,'' said
Heller.
</P>
<P>
   He said the everyday consumer has to understand that when ``you
walk into that room, there will be people that say we should be
raising rates. Then there are others who will say keep rates at
their current levels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a consensus-building process and at the end, Fed
officials will take a vote,'' he said. Heller served as member of
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve from 1986 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The Board of Governors, a separate body from the FOMC, is the
Fed's equivalent of a corporate board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   Heller said at the end of this week's meeting, the FOMC should
have left interest rates unchanged, which will mean a slight
reprieve for consumers as far as their mortgages and other
interest-rate-sensitive loans are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   However, consumer confidence is still near an all-time high. The
economy will slow down, and Fed officials hope that their series of
rate increases will help sustain a growth rate close to 3 percent,
said Heller.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be in a growing economy and a well-growing economy,
but not as we saw last year,'' said Heller, who is now an executive
vice president with Fair, Isaac and Co., a San Rafael-based
financial services firm.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Heller warned that an unexpected increase of
a quarter of a percentage point this week could send the stock
markets lower.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have a negative reaction on the markets, because they
didn't have time to digest a 25-basis-point increase, when a rate
increase wasn't expected,'' he said.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Rising interest rates did not faze California home
buyers during May as both sales and prices hit record levels, a
trade group said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The median price statewide rose 11.8 percent on an annual basis
to $246,420, said the Los Angeles-based California Association of
Realtors. Prices have been at record levels for months, reflecting
huge appreciation gains in the Northern California market.
</P>
<P>
   Sales rose 7.2 percent last month, which would amount to 580,540
units if the market maintained May's level throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles county prices were weaker but sales stronger. The
median price rose 3 percent to $208,710, still well below the
record of $229,260 reached in May 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Sales increased 17.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter where you go in L.A. County, if you have good houses
with access to good schools. ... It's still a red-hot market,''
said Jack Kyser, chief economist for the Los Angeles County
Economic Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   In Ventura County, the median price jumped 10.7 percent to
$288,780 and sales increased 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Sales remained robust in defiance or rising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, 30-year fixed mortgage interest rates averaged 8.52
percent, up from 7.15 percent a year ago, according to the Federal
Home Loan Mortgage Corp. Adjustable rates averaged 7.07 percent, up
from 5.72 percent in May 1999.

SHORT NIGHT FOR HERSHISER
</HEADLINE>
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There was no illusion that this stop in Los
Angeles would be even close to the same as the first time around
for Orel Hershiser. No one thought a Cy Young was in store, but a
handful or more of wins and maybe a golden moment or two were
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it has turned into a situation nobody wanted to think
about, or really cares to witness.
</P>
<P>
   Even when it looks like it won't get worse, or can't fall
further, the one-time prized possession of the Dodgers shows he is
very different these days.
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser was unmercifully knocked around in an eight-run second
inning as the San Diego Padres extended the Los Angeles Dodgers'
losing streak to a season-high five games with a 9-5 win Monday in
the opener of a four-game series at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego's Bret Boone had five RBI in the decisive second
inning, including a two-run homer, and Brian Meadows (6-5) allowed
three runs in 7 innings for his second win since May 14, but this
was about Hershiser.
</P>
<P>
   And about his future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some sad days, but today really tugged at your
heartstrings to see Orel struggle like that,'' Dodgers manager
Davey Johnson said. ``I know he's frustrated about it. It's been
hard on him, but it's been just as tough on me because I think the
world of him and he's such a great pitcher and had such a good
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really tough seeing Orel struggle. It was not fun. He
doesn't have all his weapons working for him, he's struggling with
command. I've never seen him struggle. He's always been something
special. To see him struggle, that's tough.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson wouldn't address Hershiser's standing in the rotation
after the game. No doubt, it's something that will be discussed in
some high-power meetings during the next few days at Chavez Ravine.
</P>
<P>
   The choices are aplenty and only one is good for Hershiser. He
could stay in the rotation, but with Carlos Perez pitching
excellent relief for the second straight time (he threw 4 shutout
innings), the left-hander is likely to find his way back into the
rotation.
</P>
<P>
   There's a possible move to the bullpen, a release or a trade.
Hershiser tried the bullpen and that didn't work, and even tried a
minor-league stint to get his control back.
</P>
<P>
   But at 41, there's also the suggestion Hershiser could retire
and move into the Dodgers front office.
</P>

   ``He still feels he can pitch, and if he feels that way I feel
that way, too,'' Johnson said. ``It's a little lack of work. . . .
I don't have the answer. I wish I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, Hershiser said retirement wasn't an option, and
following one of the worst outings of his career, he said that
remains his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a puzzle and I want to figure this puzzle out,'' said
Hershiser, 1-5 with a 13.14 ERA. ``I wouldn't (retire), and even if
I was I wouldn't even think about talking about it right now. After
a tough outing, it's not the time to think about that. I need to
work on it, and here, all in a sudden if there's not an
opportunity, then I need to think about other things.''
</P>
<P>
   He allowed eight runs on six hits in 1 innings, hitting his 11th
batter in 24 innings of work. It might out-yuck his seven earned
runs and four hit batters in 1 innings against Houston on April 19,
or his five earned runs in one-third of an inning in a May 9 relief
appearance at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a confidence problem, I have an execution
problem,'' said Hershiser, who threw 26 pitches in a Saturday start
in St. Louis. ``When you can only throw the ball somewhere between
83 and 87 miles per hour, pretty straight and not with much
movement, at least for a strike, big-league hitters are going to
catch onto that pretty quick. It can get ugly pretty quick, and it
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone gave the Padres a 2-1 lead with a two-run homer in the
second. He also capped the inning with a three-run double to give
the Padres an 8-1 lead and knock Hershiser out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had an awesome career,'' Boone said of Hershiser. ``He
can't have the stuff he had 10, 12 years ago.''

STUDENT MAJORITY CANNOT COERCE MINORITY TO PRAY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   On June 19, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that public school
districts cannot authorize students to lead prayers at school
football games (Santa Fe Independent School District vs. Doe). It
is a sweeping decision that follows the core meaning of the
Establishment Clause _ a government entity cannot support or
endorse a religion and coerce those who do not believe in that
religion to participate in its worship.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling follows the rationale of the high court's 1992
decision (Lee vs. Weisman) which found graduation prayers a
violation of the U.S. Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   A peek at the underbelly of this case shows what can happen when
a school district puts its seal of approval on a particular
religion.
</P>
<P>
   The use of the pseudonym ``Doe'' in the title of the case was
used to protect the Catholic and Mormon students who brought this
case to the courts.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Fe Independent School District is a political
subdivision of Texas, governed by an elected, seven-person Board of
Trustees. The trustees apparently take the word ``Independent'' in
the name of their district too seriously. They openly allowed
prayer at graduation, despite the Supreme Court's 1992 ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The federal district court that first heard this case noted that
one of the student plaintiffs, Jane Doe II was ridiculed by her
seventh-grade history teacher when he found out she is a Mormon.
The teacher, according to court documents, ``launched into a
diatribe about the non-Christian, cult-like nature of Mormonism and
its general evils.'' Jane Doe II's classmates picked up the
religious prejudice of the teacher and called her faith ``evil''
and ``kind of like the KKK.''
</P>
<P>
   The school district even tried to find out the names of the
students who had filed the lawsuit _ presumably to harass them into
dropping the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The district court had to warn the school administration,
teachers and other school employees to cease trying ``to ferret out
the identities of the plaintiffs'' or ``face the harshest possible
contempt sanctions from this court, and may additionally face
criminal liability.''
</P>
<P>
   The court explained it ``wants these proceedings addressed on
their merits, and not on the basis of intimidation or harassment of
the participants on either side.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a warning is extremely rare and speaks volumes about
religious arrogance and intolerance in circumstances where a
religious majority thinks it has a right to harass, belittle and
treat religious minorities as if they do not matter. This is
precisely the underlying reason for the Establishment Clause _ to
keep religious liberty free of the tyranny of the majority.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the liberties guaranteed by the Bill of Rights
cannot be overturned by the vote of a majority.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Santa Fe school district enacted a policy entitled
``Prayer at Football Games'' that allowed high school students to
vote to choose whether to ``deliver a prayer at varsity football
games.'' And then vote to determine who would deliver those
prayers. Apparently, the school district thought if students
conducted the prayers, the policy and district would be insulated
from a constitutional challenge.
</P>
<P>
   A later policy omits the word ``prayer'' and substitutes
``messages'' and ``invocations'' _ another transparent attempt to
get around the meaning of the Establishment Clause.
</P>
<P>
   The school district argued there was no government coercion of
students to participate in religious observances because the
invocations at football games was a product of student elections.
And further, there was no coercion because students didn't have to
attend their school football games.
</P>
<P>
   The district also argued the invocations were merely to
solemnize the football games. Whatever happened to singing the
``Star Spangled Banner''? one might legitimately ask.
</P>
<P>
   And most ridiculously, the district argued that these
``messages'' are private student speech, not public speech. Prayer
intoned over a loud speaker system at a school function cannot be,
by any stretch of the imagination, classified as private speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution, as interpreted by the high court, has never
prohibited public school students from voluntarily engaging in
private prayer during school hours. But prayer boomed out at a
football game is anything but private.
</P>
<P>
   None of the federal courts _ from district court to appellate
court to the Supreme Court _ were fooled by such obvious ploys.
</P>
<P>
   Justice John Paul Stevens wrote the opinion for the 6-3
majority. Chief Justice William Rehnquist wrote a dissent which was
joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens noted that the football game policy was voted on by the
district trustees. In other words, the district gave the students
permission to deliver prayers at games. He also noted the prayers
were delivered at a school function on school property using school
sound equipment _ all under school control. People who attended
these varsity football games would understandably think the prayers
given at the games were sponsored or endorsed by the school
district.
</P>
<P>
   High school football games in many small towns in Texas are
events which bring out the entire community. It isn't fair to
students in the religious minority to be subjected to the religious
majority's prayers in order to attend their own school's football
games and see their friends play.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens wrote: ``School sponsorship of a religious message is
impermissible because it sends the ancillary message to members of
the audience who are nonadherents `that they are outsiders, not
full members of the political community, and an accompanying
message to adherents that they are insiders, favored members of the
political community.'''
</P>
<P>
   In a sweeping conclusion, the decision states: ``Through its
election scheme, the district has established a governmental
electoral mechanism that turns the school into a forum for
religious debate. It further empowers the student body majority
with the authority to subject students of minority views to
constitutionally improper messages. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Such a system encourages divisiveness along religious lines
and threatens the imposition of coercion upon those students not
desiring to participate in a religious exercise. Simply by
establishing this school-related procedure, which entrusts the
inherently nongovernmental subject of religion to a majoritarian
vote, a constitutional violation has occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   That essentially means the court will strike down any school
district policy that authorizes public school students to vote to
deliver prayers at a school function.
</P>
<P>
   Six members of the court understand the meaning of the
Establishment Clause.
</P>
<P>
   There is no hope for Rehnquist, Scalia and Thomas on this issue.
They simply ignore constitutional history. Their vote would allow
government policies that fracture communities along religious
lines, which inevitably leads to intolerance and religious
persecution.

 UNDATED: ... in April.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the logic of Terra Lycos stems from the international growth
of the Internet, so does some of the controversy surrounding
Villalonga.
</P>
<P>
   The medium is gaining ground globally; by 2003, International
Data Corp. predicts, only 200 million of the Internet's 600 million
users will be in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The trend had been on Villalonga's mind since the former
management consultant was appointed to head Telefonica by his
boyhood friend, Spanish Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar.
Telefonica's previous managers had bought up state-owned phone
companies in Argentina, Brazil, Peru and Mexico, and Villalonga
moved to spin off these companies as separate stocks, part of a
reorganziation to promote online businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet these actions prompted resistance from foreign investors in
some of the telephone companies. The investors complained that
Telefonica wasn't assigning them enough equity. ``It was a terrible
rip-off,'' says Mark Mobius, president of Templeton Emerging
Markets Funds.
</P>
<P>
   Mobius threatened to sue, and to settle the matter earlier this
year, Villalonga and Telefonica agreed to acquire some of their
minority shares from the miffed investors.
</P>
<P>
   The phone companies also served as a platform for Terra
Networks's expansion. In March, Terra said it had 389 million page
views a month in Brazil, for instance, and 116 million in Mexico. A
rival, StarMedia Network Inc., said it had about 140 million page
views a month in Brazil earlier this year, and about 266 million a
month in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Exact comparisons aren't available because the companies report
and audit their measurements differently. Yahoo Inc., doesn't break
out traffic figures for its Latin sites.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of hard numbers seems to make the competition bitter.
Fernando Espuelas, chief executive of StarMedia, in New York, says
Terra has little to show for its investments. ``They had to catch
up to us, and they didn't achieve it,'' Espuelas says. Nor does he
fear Terra Lycos, Espuelas said. ``We'll be gaining an unfocused
competitor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonsense, say Davis and Linares, who argue StarMedia is an
insignificant player next to AOL and Yahoo. ``I have plenty of
local competitors in Germany, Korea and Singapore. But as we map
out a strategy, we don't think about how we'll defeat them,'' Davis
said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Now, along with the foreign competitors, Villalonga must defeat
his challengers in Ma-drid.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's National Securities Market Commission is looking into
whether Villalonga acted improperly when he bought options on a
quarter-million shares in Telefonica in 1998, then sold them two
weeks later, around the time Telefonica began talks with WorldCom
Inc. about a potential alliance. The commission previously had
investigated the matter, and declined to act. Telefonica and
Villalonga deny wrongdoing and say they will cooperate with the
probe.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation follows a series of articles about the options
in El Mundo, a newspaper that supports Spain's center-right
government and once was a Villalonga ally. Observers say the paper
soured on him when Telefonica began talks with Prisa Group,
publisher of rival newspaper El Pais. Also, El Mundo reported on
Friday that Villalonga used a false identity for some stock
transactions. Telefonica called that charge ``absolutely false.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics also cite the divorced Villalonga's appearances with a
girlfriend in Miami, where Villalonga spends much of his time, and
the multimillion-dollar stock options Villalonga offered himself
and other Telefonica managers. News of these options cooled
relations between Villalonga and Prime Minister Aznar.
</P>
<P>
   Yet defenders point out Villalonga has survived plenty of
setbacks in the past. Short of leaving his company entirely,
Dresdner analyst Simon Edelsten in London imagines Villalonga could
just hand over the Telefonica reins and take on a bigger role at
Terra Lycos, helping Davis arrange deals.
</P>
<P>
   Davis calls that scenario ``unlikely'' and predicts Villalonga
will stay in his current job. But he's not central to the deal in
any case, Davis said. ``Our deal is with Bertelsmann and Terra,''
Davis said.

FILTER CONCEPT GUIDES START-UPS INTO PRIME TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Can you trademark due diligence?
</P>
<P>
   One Boston law firm thinks so, and it's telling clients as much
in its bid to provide one-stop service for high-tech start-ups on
the road to venture funding.
</P>
<P>
   G+H Solutions, the new-technology services arm of Gadsby Hannah,
has trademarked its ``Due Diligence Filters,'' a detailed approach
to getting a business plan in shape for prime time.
</P>
<P>
   William Zucker, a partner at Gadsby Hannah and head of G+H, says
the filter concept evolved as the firm sought to help scores of
young companies sort through the intricacies of financial
forecasts, corporate structure, intellectual property and stock
allocations, among myriad other issues. The problem, he says, is
that some clients would pick and choose services (usually to save
money) but end up needing far more help than they thought.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bit like skipping the full $25 car wash in mid-winter _
undercarriage scrubbed, mats vacuumed, and exterior waxed _ and
skimping for the $5.99 quick wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The `I've already done that' routine doesn't cut it when you
go to the funding stage,'' Zucker says. Now the tech group is
turning away the a la carte clients, because the firm thinks it
leaves clients believing they're ready for the next step when
they're not.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of one client, an online derivatives exchange,
Zucker says the owners weren't willing to buy all the services of
the filter. In particular, they didn't want to review their
ownership guidelines and what size stake they were willing to give
up in exchange for venture funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were pennywise and pound foolish,'' Zucker says. ``Fifty
percent of nothing is nothing _ even if you have a great concept.''
</P>
<P>
   And that wasn't the only trouble, he says. The company had only
a prototype of its product, not a working model. It had holes in
its management team and even in its technology crew.
</P>
<P>
   The firm didn't get the financing round it went on to seek,
Zucker says. And it hasn't yet.
</P>
<P>
   Another client, Lisa McGonagle, founder of ModernParent.com, a
Boston-based Web information and purchasing service, bought into
the filters without a big pitch. She says she needed all the
services the firm was offering, from revamping the financials to
replacing corporate partners that weren't working out. The lawyers
introduced her to United Asset Management Corp. financial chief
Julie Coyle, who's now on her board.
</P>
<P>
   McGonagle's done the friends-and-family money round. Now, she
says, ``We're talking to a big company for a first round.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds great. But one thing to remember about VCs is they don't
think anybody else is smarter than they are. They trust people they
know, and they trust track records. That's about it. No stamp of
approval from some trademarked filter is going to get them excited.
</P>
<P>
   Says Andy McLane, a veteran of the business and a managing
director at Boston's TA Associates, ``I think the idea is wacky.''
He explains, ``It's the guys doing the investing that are doing the
due diligence.''
</P>
<P>
   Precisely. That's why G+H isn't trying to sell this model to the
venture capitalists, per se. Rather, it wants to convince start-up
clients that they need to book on for a full ride.
</P>
<P>
   What's it cost? That's where the firm hedges. Suffice it to say
you're talking thousands of dollars. How many thousands depends on
how much work the entrepreneur needs done. The question is whether
you can get enough out of the lawyers to make your idea more
valuable to the big investors.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, lots of lawyers will take some warrants in lieu of
cash. See how that figures into the filter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For Bob Davis, it's a case of bringing the new economy to the
Old World.
</P>
<P>
   That's the gulf that Davis, the chief executive of Lycos Inc.,
must bridge as he seeks to complete the trans-Atlantic sale of his
Internet portal in Waltham, Mass. to the Spanish telecommunications
giant Telefonica SA.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would combine Lycos with Telefonica's Internet unit to
create a global media player known as Terra Lycos. But even as
Telefonica's controversial chairman, Juan Villalonga, was embracing
Davis at a New York press conference last month, dissent was
brewing in Spain's business and political circles.
</P>
<P>
   Now the deal's prospects have been shaken by this Byzantine
establishment, where Villalonga has alienated many with his
aggressive management and high pay scales. Last week, his foes
helped convince Spanish regulators to reopen an insider-trading
investigation into Villalonga, raising concerns he could be ousted.
The renewed probe drove down share prices in Telefonica, its Terra
Networks unit, and Lycos on fears the merger itself could be at
risk, though Terra shares have recovered since.
</P>
<P>
   The news from Spain may be an unwelcome dose of deja vu for
Davis, who a year ago failed to complete another complex merger
between Lycos and USA Networks.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Davis says he's got a better arrangement. He
would become chief executive of Terra Lycos, which would have $3.2
billion in cash to fund promotions and acquisitions. The company
also would have access to Telefonica's big telephone and
mobile-phone networks in Europe and Latin America. And it would
boast an alliance with German publisher Bertelsmann AG, whose
properties range from book publisher Random House to Germany's
Stern magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Davis insists the Terra Lycos deal is still on track. He calls
the Spanish government inquiry into the financial dealings of his
partner meritless and insignificant. ``This is just hardball
Spanish politics,'' Davis said. Villalonga has no plans to step
aside, but even if he were to leave the merger would go forward,
Davis said. Villalonga himself wasn't available for comment, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis's goal is to make it to September or so, when Lycos
submits the merger to a vote of its shareholders. The largest Lycos
holder is CMGI Inc. of Andover, Mass.; its chairman, David
Wetherell, has spoken favorably of the Terra deal but has not said
if he'll vote for it. Late last week, CMGI executives declined to
comment on the Villalonga inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga's challenge, meanwhile, is to fend off government
investigators and keep his Spanish supporters in line, including
the two banks that control 9 percent of his company. His fate may
be discussed at a board meeting set for Wednesday, said a company
executive.
</P>
<P>
   But if Villalonga and Davis can hang on, analysts say, they
would create a peer of the other online media giants being created
through mergers, such as AOL Time Warner and the combination
announced last week of France's Vivendi and movie studio-owner
Seagram.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed, team Terra Lycos says it must integrate assets
quickly _ heightening the risk from political disruption. Abel
Linares, the managing director of Terra Networks who is slated to
become Terra Lycos' chief operating officer, he's got a simpler
merger to manage than do his online rivals, with less overlap
between business divisions.
</P>
<P>
   By linking Bertelsmann's content with its portal sites
throughout North and South America, Europe and Asia, Terra Lycos
will have to undertake relatively little reorganization, he said.
That's crucial while the loyalties of so many Internet users are up
for grabs. Lycos and Terra, both nimble companies, may be able to
capitalize.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have very good content,'' Linares said of his rivals.
``But the battle will be them with their content or us with our
speed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The origins of Terra Lycos date to last winter, when bankers
from Lazard Freres, representing Telefonica's Internet unit, called
on Davis to suggest a combination.
</P>
<P>
   With about 30 million unique visitors a month, Lycos was
trailing America Online, Yahoo Inc. and Microsoft's MSN, all of
which had far deeper pockets. Many worried Lycos investors expected
some agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga saw in Lycos an entry into the US Internet market,
still the world's largest. A merger would fit his ambitions for
Telefonica, a sleepy former state-owned monopoly he was named to
head in 1996. After privatizing it the next year, Villalonga has
been on an acquisitions tear that has sent the company's share
price soaring.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Davis wasn't ready to give away the company he'd built
from scratch. A Dorchester native and former computer salesman for
Wang Laboratories, Davis was brought in by investors in 1995 to
commercialize a search technology that had been developed at
Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many online companies, Lycos has a solid business model
based around advertising sales and e-commerce. For the nine months
ended April 30, excluding merger costs, Lycos had net income of
$8.2 million on revenue of $203 million.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for hesitation was the legacy of the failed USA
Networks deal, scrapped a year ago for lack of support from
shareholders. A central critic was Wetherell, who initially
supported the deal but then renounced it and quit the Lycos board
as the Lycos share price sank.
</P>
<P>
   Burned once, Davis picked up and continued Lycos's original
strategy of using many different brand names, from the Tripod
Website service to Wirednews.com, all with the goal of growing
faster than the Internet as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   So at first, Davis turned the bankers down. He was looking for
what he calls a ``transforming event'' for Lycos. By that he meant
a deal that would both broaden Lycos's audience and give it more
content to distribute in new ways.
</P>
<P>
   Villalonga and Telefonica returned in March with a more
appealing offer: the company would underwrite a stock offering to
raise $2 billion in cash, which Terra Lycos could use for
acquisitions. By April, Bertelsmann also was interested in joining
the arrangement. Bertelsmann had a partnership with America Online,
but it needed a new strategy after AOL announced plans to buy a
competing publisher, Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Bertelsmann's agreements with AOL prevented it from buying an
Internet service like Lycos outright. But Bertelsmann would agree
to pay Terra Lycos $1 billion over five years to advertise and
distribute its own brands.
</P>
<P>
   On May 16, in New York, the companies announced the creation of
Terra Lycos, in a deal then worth $12.5 billion. Davis would direct
the operation from his current office in a Waltham office park,
where Lycos now has about 600 employees and plans to add several
hundred more by 2001. At 43, Davis said he's too old to learn
Spanish, but that he'll have plenty of fluent deputies.
</P>
<P>
   The company will have about 3,500 employees in all, spread
across 37 countries, including a major operation in Miami and a new
headquarters in Barcelona.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts hope both the executives pull it off. ``I think
Telefonica would be crazy to abandon the deal with Lycos, even if
Villalonga left, because it's a fantastic trade,'' said Albert
Richards, a Solomon Smith Barney analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's complicated, but it seems to be where the world is
headed, and it creates a well-funded company,'' said Chase H&AMP;Q
analyst Paul Noglows, who upped his rating on Lycos late last week
even after the renewed probe was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Noglows said he doubts the investigation will sink the deal, and
expects Lycos shareholders will support the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Terra shares rose $2.625 in Nasdaq trading Friday to close at
$40, making the merger worth about $9.5 billion at the end of last
week. Lycos shares fell 19 cents to close at $54.125. Lycos was
trading at $38 before sale rumors began to drive it up in April.

SYSTEMS INTEGRATORS BLAMED FOR ONLINE RETAILERS' WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHANIE STOUGHTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Virgin Atlantic's Web site greets customers with error messages,
a seven-step buying process and distracting graphics that blink and
shimmy across the screen. Wal-Mart, the world's most powerful
retailer, takes its online shoppers on a confusing tour through
unmarked aisles and a slow check-out process.
</P>
<P>
   These companies are far from alone in their online woes. In the
last two years, consumers and investors have rebuked companies
sharply for lumbering online with poorly conceived e-commerce
sites. But a new report says the designers and builders of Web
sites _ the Internet services and consulting firms that have
sprouted around the country _ share much of the blame.
</P>
<P>
   ``These help providers have been working in a market flush with
demand,'' said Christine Overby, an analyst with Forrester
Research. ``There's little incentive for them to improve their
service offerings.''
</P>
<P>
   Dot-coms and established companies alike have come to rely
heavily on Web consulting and services firms to help them succeed
in the booming Internet marketplace. Last year, the industry racked
up $11 billion in revenues, and demand for big technology
consultants is so intense that many would-be customers cannot
afford to hire them.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts believe that the lackluster performance of the Web
services industry has contributed to the ailments of e-commerce
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that it's hurting the new economy,'' said Phil
Terry, chief executive of Creative Good, a New York firm that helps
companies create e-commerce strategies. ``It's making it hard for
the few sites that are performing well to make their case to
investors, as well as the customer who goes to a bad Web site, gets
turned off and stops using the channel.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the year's biggest dot-com flops was Boo.com, a British
Internet apparel store that collapsed last month after burning
through much of its $135 million in start-up funding. Critics say
that Organic Inc. of San Francisco played a role in Boo.com's
downfall by creating a site that emphasized flashy features over
basic merchandising principles.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Organic chief executive Jonathan Nelson said he
was baffled by Forrester's report, which had his company tied for
the lowest position among 40 leading Web services firms. He could
not be reached to discuss Organic's involvement with Boo.com.
</P>
<P>
   For its report, Forrester surveyed 150 companies that help
design and build Web sites, whittling down the number to the top 40
firms. But even the best performers, it wrote, were inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
   Forrester noted that iXL Enterprises Inc. of Atlanta had done
significant work on Virgin Atlantic Airways's Web site, which now
suffers ``serious ills.''
</P>
<P>
   An iXL spokesman declined to comment, but Bill Danylko, the
airline's interactive marketing manager, said his company was happy
with the technology firm's work. He acknowledged, however, that the
site did not always function properly, frequently displaying errors
messages when online customers tried to navigate the Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   At the headquarters of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. in Bentonville,
Ark., executives are none too pleased with their Web site, which
Cambridge Technology Partners Inc. helped overhaul last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are not giving our online customers the level of
service that they deserve,'' said Melissa Berryhill, a Wal-Mart
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Berryhill said she was unable to comment on the company's
relationship with Cambridge Technology. Industry sources say,
however, that Wal-Mart has dropped Cambridge Technology and is
working now with a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   In Forrester's report, few Web services firms escaped criticism.
Even Sapient Corp., a hot technology consultant in Cambridge,
Mass., had at least one displeased customer. The client, a heavy
equipment manufacturer, complained that Sapient built a Web site
that could not handle future growth.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sapient received the highest grade from Forrester, which
praised its work on easy-to-peruse sites operated by United
Airlines, ETrade, and iWon.com.
</P>
<P>
   There were other bright spots as well. L.L. Bean's successful
site got a helping hand from Digitas Inc., a Boston firm. Another
local company, Zefer Corp., received kudos for building several
efficient e-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good experience working with Zefer,'' said Mie-Yun
Lee, founder of Buyerzone.com, a Cambridge online marketplace for
small and midsize businesses. ``I wish they could have gotten up to
speed on our company faster _ but that's a challenge of any
consulting firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Web-site builders often face a daunting task in
integrating the various software systems needed to operate an
e-commerce site. And like many of their dot-com clients, they are
straining to retain bright technology workers in a fiercely
competitive job market. Cambridge Technology, for example, has
churned 1,000 employees in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Privately, Web services firms say it's not their fault if
customers ignore their suggestions and insist on building clunky
sites. In other cases, clients want to race to cyberspace, despite
warnings that their sites will not be as effective.
</P>
<P>
   A Sapient spokesman, for instance, said the client that griped
about its work in Forrester's report was told that it had two
options. It could wait for a site that would accommodate its
growth, or it could push ahead with a site that met its immediate
needs. The client picked the second option.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Forrester said we made bad choices, it wasn't our
choice,'' she said. ``It was the customer's choice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Wal-Mart's case, the retailer's size, time pressures, and the
number of players involved made the project more of a challenge,
said Peter Ward, Cambridge's director of e-business strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you need to understand is that there were a lot of chefs
in the kitchen,'' Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem is that those chefs don't always agree on
what's best for their customers, says consultant Phil Terry.

<P>
   Navy submarines, those stealthy models of undersea technology,
finally have plumbed the Internet. The first e-mail originating
from a submerged sub, the USS Dolphin, was transmitted to shore
over Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   It was tapped out and sent from a depth of 400 feet below the
surface of the Pacific Ocean, off California, using an advanced
acoustic modem developed by Benthos Inc. of North Falmouth, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an enabling technology,'' said John L. Coughlin, the
Benthos president and chief executive, who regards the May 26
e-mail as an historic breakthrough with military and commercial
potential. ``For the first time, we can get data out of the water
in real time.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's Benthos ATM 885 Telesonar Acoustic Modem is
roughly the size and shape of a tennis ball can. It is based on
commercial technology similar to that employed for cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   Using specialized software, it encodes data bits from a PC
inside the sub and turns them into acoustical pulses that are sent
out through the ocean. The pulses are received by another modem
mounted on a buoy floating on the surface; from there, they are
transmitted into the Internet as e-mail, first via radio and then
through a cell phone link.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, the Benthos modem can receive acoustical pulses
originating from bases on the shore and convert them back into data
bits that can be downloaded into a PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some tones will not propagate through certain types of
water,'' Couglin said. ``And that's really where our technology
comes in. The acoustic modem will actually interrogate the water to
see what's the best way to send the data. It is looking at the
water to determine the best coding and the best speed for
transmission.''
</P>
<P>
   The weather and the conditions of the sea are factors. It is
easier to shoot an e-mail from deep below the ocean to the surface,
for example, than to send it horizontally across the surface in
choppy water.
</P>
<P>
   Submarines already can communicate externally, of course, though
their need to avoid detection poses restrictions. One way they
transmit classified data is by emitting extremely low-frequency
radio waves that can be received only by a secure antennae in the
western United States.
</P>
<P>
   Navy engineers also have modified submarine sonar systems to
send encoded messages on an experimental basis. Subs are able to
talk to one another through UQC underwater telecommunications
systems, limited by range. And they can send data to shore through
conventional radio, but that requires them to stick an antennae
above the surface.
</P>
<P>
   While the Navy sent the e-mail as part of a series of tests
using the Benthos modem, the real purpose of last month's
experiments was to gauge the potential for linking undersea sensors
into a network that can sit on the bottom of the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in the technology for . . . developing
underwater networking,'' said Joseph A. Rice, principal
investigator for acoustic communications at the Navy's Space and
Naval Warfare Systems Command center in San Diego. ``We'd like to
be able to build and buy underwater sensors that would enable us to
do surveillance of the underwater environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Benthos got into the acoustic communications program last year
when it acquired Datasonics in nearby Cataumet, a leader in
acoustic modems. It will join the Navy in August in another
experiment called Seaweb 2000, in which 32 modems will be set up in
an ocean network over several square miles near Buzzards Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The research that produced the Benthos modem was underwritten in
part by $1.6 million from SPAWAR, the Office of Naval Research and
the Navy's Small Business Innovative Research program, which
encourages contractors to commercialize technology.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy would use the modem and a network of underwater sensors
for military purposes, mainly tracking other countries' submarine
movements. But the technology could have civilian applications in
oil and gas drilling, oceanography and meteorological studies.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate future for undersea e-mailing is murky, however.
Rice said bandwidth constraints make it difficult to transmit
anything other than text, at least for now. And security
considerations would preclude widespread use, if not all use, of
e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time a submarine broadcasts anything, it's at an elevated
risk of exposing its position,'' Coughlin said. ``I don't think
you'll see submariners sending e-mail to their friends and families
any time soon.''

TECHNOLOGY LEADERS RELISHING ROLES IN POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; PALO ALTO, CALIF. _ What's the new, new thing in Silicon
Valley? Politics.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the political pulse of the Valley amounted to
little more than its voting activity _ that is, if harried
high-tech executives could spare the time to make it to the polling
booths.
</P>
<P>
   That's all changing, and technology poobahs are beginning to
relish their new roles as Washington kingmakers and policy pushers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot more fun than you would ever guess it to be,'' John
Kernan, chief executive of Lightspan Inc., said of his involvement
in politics in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The political awakening of Silicon Valley can be traced back to
1997, when technology companies raised $35 million to fight a state
ballot proposal that would have allowed shareholders to sue
individual executives when their companies' stock prices start
falling. The measure was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Stoked by their victory, industry chiefs, including Kernan,
decided to continue their political activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized we had to be forceful advocates of issues that
have an impact on us,'' said Eric Benhamou, chairman and chief
executive of 3COM Corp. in San Jose. ``That meant we had to get
organized.''
</P>
<P>
   Benhamou, Kernan and a dozen other technology executives formed
TechNet, a bipartisan lobbying group. They stocked its board of
directors with cyber-luminaries, including John Doerr, a well-known
Silicon Valley venture capitalist; Jim Barksdale, former head of
Netscape Communications Corp.; John Chambers, chief executive of
Cisco Systems Inc.; and, the heads of E-Trade Inc., Genentech Inc.,
and Sun Microsystems Inc.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of its growing maturity, TechNet earlier this year
hired Jeffrey A. Modisett, former attorney general of Indiana, to
be its Democratic general counsel. Aside from hosting fund-raisers,
TechNet offers ``Politics 101'' training courses for neophytes.
They learn everything from how to track issues and organize visits
to Capitol Hill to identifying key lawmakers for specific issues.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Silicon Valley is a critical stop on the campaign trail.
And local techies are stepping right up, playing host at
$1,000-a-plate fund-raisers and private meet-and-greet soirees.
Last week, both presidential candidates made pilgrimages to Silicon
Valley. George W. Bush was hosted at Chambers's home, while Vice
President Al Gore was feted at the home of Joel Hyatt, who teaches
entrepreneurship at Stanford University and is founder of Hyatt
Legal Services.
</P>
<P>
   Even local pols from other states are stopping by. Over the
weekend, Massachusetts Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift made the
rounds in San Jose to promote her policies on Internet privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trip was an opportunity for me to speak with the best
minds on the issue of privacy,'' Swift said. ``We also want to make
sure that Governor Celucci and I remain on the cutting edge of that
(high-tech) industry so we can keep pace with public policy
initiatives that affect the new economy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just the money that brings candidates here. It's also
the desire to be associated with the movers and shakers of the
vaunted new economy.
</P>
<P>
   What candidates find here, however, is not politics as usual.
The Valley is ``aggressively bipartisan,'' in the words of Lezlee
Westine, vice president and Republican general counsel of TechNet.
Chambers, for example, supports both Bush, a Republican, and US
Senator Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look at the issues, not at the party line,'' said Benhamou.
He said he supports Gore because ``I am convinced he has a deep
understanding of the issues, and he is in broad agreement with the
issues we advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime technology executive Mitchell Kertzman, a well-known
political gadfly in Massachusetts until he moved to Silicon Valley
several years ago, believes the Valley's bipartisan bent is due to
the fact that both Republicans and Democrats have done a good job
tailoring their rhetoric to appeal to the cyber-elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both parties are saying the same things,'' said Kertzman, now
chief executive of Liberate Technologies Inc. in San Carlos, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   While politics is not an essential part of the business scene
yet, Kertzman says, that's is changing. ``Politics is a
relationship business as well as a money business, and you need to
be engaged long-term,'' he said.

A NEW DAY FOR BIOINFORMATICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the release of the first draft of the human genome map _
the deciphering of 3 billion molecules that are the blueprint of
human life _ information technology takes center stage.
</P>
<P>
   A fast-growing field known as bioinformatics uses computing to
analyze the vast amount of biological, genomic and related research
to make sense of things too complex for the human brain to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   But bioinformatics is also a bottleneck for many drug and
biotech companies that can't find enough talented software
engineers who combine sophisticated analysis tools with an
understanding of genomics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We resolve the bioinformatics issue (by hiring) two people:
one who understands computer science and the biologist or
researcher,'' said Kenneth Fasman, vice president and global head
of informatics of AstraZeneca LLC in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   AstraZeneca, like other large pharmaceutical companies, uses
private genomic databases, software analysis tools, molecular
modeling, and visualization software to ``see'' complex data sets.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 bicoastal companies market bioinformatics to
pharmaceutical and biotech companies. There are tools providers
such as DoubleTwist Inc., Spotfire Inc., Molecular Simulations,
Paradigm Genetics, Genomic Solutions, and Rosetta Inpharmatics,
along with database providers such as Incyte Pharmaceuticals,
Myriad Genetics, and Celera Genomics.
</P>
<P>
   Within five years, bioinformatics tools and services could
generate more than $2 billion in revenues, Oscar Gruss &AMP; Son, a New
York investment firm, estimates.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Helping drug researchers visually analyze data has enabled
Spotfire of Cambridge, Mass. to sign up the top 25 pharmaceutical
companies and nearly 100 biotech companies as customers.
</P>
<P>
   Now it plans to go the next step. In partnership with Proteome
Inc. of Beverly, Mass., Spotfire will enable researchers to compare
their findings with the publicly available scientific literature.
</P>
<P>
   Proteome functions as a curator of biotech and genomic
information, sending its staff to university and corporate research
laboratories to obtain scientific papers. They look for
experimental results that reveal new properties and functions of
proteins, and organize those findings to provide annotated
searchable gene and protein databases.
</P>
<P>
   Proteome sells its databases for more than $200,000 per year
apiece to corporate clients including Millennium Pharmaceuticals
Inc. of Cambridge, Mass.; Merck &AMP; Co., SmithKline Beecham; and
Pfizer Inc., said James I. Garrels, Proteome's president.
</P>
<P>
   Spotfire and Proteome will offer their new capabilities to
existing customers and smaller biotech companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I talk to prospective buyers of our software, 80 to 90

 c.2000 New York Times Special Features  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although there will be many lessons to be learned from Mexico's
presidential election on July 2, we may have a notion of some of
them already.
</P>
<P>
   The most important is to recognize the consequences of last
year's failure of the two opposition parties to join forces. Their
reasons then were:
</P>
<P>
   1) An alliance wouldn't be possible.
</P>
<P>
   2) An alliance wouldn't guarantee victory.
</P>
<P>
   3) There were too many political differences dividing the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The first was unalterably true. But with the campaign's
evolution, the other two have since been disproved.
</P>
<P>
   Firstly, had there been one candidate representing an allied
opposition _ presumably Vicente Fox (PAN) since, according to
polls, he outgunned the PRD's Cuauhtemoc Cardenas by a ratio of
2-to-1 _ chances for a victory would have been enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly so in a campaign where, right now, the two
frontrunners (Fox and the PRI's Francisco Labastida) are running
neck and neck. Had there been an opposition alliance where Cardenas
conceded to Fox as candidate, nobody today could deny that it would
have given Fox an overwhelming advantage and ultimately, victory.
</P>
<P>
   All the polls show the split vote is a committed one. But the
polls also show that the second choice for president among the
majority of those votes is Fox.
</P>
<P>
   This was also confirmed in a secret PRD internal survey
conducted between March and June, in which voters overwhelmingly
confirmed Fox, over Labastida, as their second choice. Over the
four-month period, the percentages for Fox increased concurrently
with the progress of the campaign, which would have eventually
given Fox a 5-point lead, and a sure win.
</P>
<P>
   The third reason _ political incompatibility _ has also been
disproved by evolving campaign events. Up till now _ and there is
no reason to expect any change in the last days before the election
_ the divergences between the two opponents have been personal: Fox
is a liar, Cardenas an anachronism; Fox is intolerant, Cardenas is
an egoist.
</P>
<P>
   Or historical: The Cristera War (a 1920s uprising against
government imposed anticlerical laws) vs. the Mexican Revolution;
for or against reforms implemented by former President Carlos
Salinas. But there has been nothing of substance or about
platforms, such as privatizing Pemex, legalizing abortion,
rescinding NAFTA, or re-establishing state ownership of Telmex, the
banking and steel industries, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Since none of these topics were debated, the difference between
the two candidates is moot, and so they failed to prove any
political incompatibility.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this political stumbling, emerges another, pivotal fact
that was highlighted by Cardenas' brief and belated skirmishes over
a second round of voting. If Mexico had a constitutional electoral
second balloting (as exists in most countries with presidents,
including the United States, through the primaries of the two big
parties) Fox would have a very strong possibility of defeating
Labastida in the final election.
</P>
<P>
   But why isn't there a second round vote? The PRI and the
government, supposedly, didn't want it; the PAN accepted the
decision without real conviction and only to please Fox, and the
PRD didn't say anything.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, another version of truth behind these
suppositions.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, in November 1998, Giovanni Sartori, the eminent
political expert and professor emeritus at Columbia University, had
a two-hour discussion with President Ernesto Zedillo on the virtues
of second round balloting, particularly for a country like Mexico.
It would give the country stability, legitimacy and a soundness, he
apparently said, which would neutralize in the long run any
disadvantage it could have for the ruling party in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   An impressed Zedillo suggested he present his ideas to the
opposing parties and their probable candidates. But after doing so,
Sartori disclosed that the followers of Cardenas were absolutely
opposed to second balloting.
</P>
<P>
   As to why Zedillo didn't promote it, even if Cardenas was
opposed, the answer is simple: With the full approval of the two
opposition parties, Zedillo might have been able to push through a
constitutional amendment, imposing it on a reluctant PRI wary of
the probable defeat it would mean _ a party which was, and still
is, totally opposed to such second round balloting. Asking Zedillo
to act against his party's interests and without the total support
of the opposition was too much.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the true story, the ostensible reasons for Cardenas'
rejection of a second round are now known.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, Cardenas' estimates were wrong: in 1998 he
thought he would be the forerunner in the 2000 presidential
campaign. So a second balloting might mean taking away his victory
of the first round. In the second place, he thought (once again
mistakenly) that if there were a second round, PAN and PRI would
unite in a conservative alliance and defeat him in the second
ballot. He clearly never thought of a third possibility: that he
might not be a candidate in the second round and might have to
throw his votes to one of the other two candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But another possible motive for his opposition to the measure
might have been based on an even worse possibility: What to do if
he had, in the end, to decide on the lesser of two evils, between
PRI and PAN, between Fox and Labastida?
</P>
<P>
   This third possibility was so awful that it could not be
considered. Or even better: avoid creating the conditions that put
him in such a position. At least this way the decision would be
taken in pectore, implemented in private, far from the startled
looks or autonomous voters.
</P>
<P>
   And, as a matter of fact, Cardenas actually made his decision in
the solitude of his introversion and with full fidelity to his
obsessions and roots. This happened probably in the first days of
March, and surely no later than the first week of April, when he
received the results of the secret polls, which showed that the
proportion of votes for Fox and Cardenas was still the same
(2-to-1).
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a man of few decisions in his life, but all
of them transcendental, faced the terrible choice that history and
reality presented: He was not going to be president of Mexico. He
couldn't win this time, and there was no possibility of a new
attempt in 2006, when he would be 70. Nevertheless, he still had in
his hand the power to decide who would be Mexico's next president:
Labastida or Fox.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt in my mind that Cardenas, faced with the
Hamletian drama he was living, suffered horribly, argued with
himself, agonized and doubted, but finally opted for the road of
his phantoms. Over and above the animosity between himself and Fox,
and of the greater certitude offered by a deal _ tacit or explicit,
suggested or signed _ with Labastida, Cardenas chose the system and
the PRI. To do otherwise would mean, to him, betraying his father,
President Lazaro Cardenas, and his legacy _ the most noble and
glorious of Mexico's 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Lazaro Cardenas would never have understood how his son
could anoint a ``reactionary,'' a ``counterrevolutionary'' for
president.
</P>
<P>
   So, understandably, it's not easy to blame Cardenas for his
decision. It is, without doubt, the most loyal to his true past, to
his life and to his refusal to betray an everlasting and crushing
icon of Mexican politics.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, by refusing to negotiate with Fox, he may have
led his party to imminent collective suicide. The PRD may still
have some chips to deal right now, but come July 3 they will have
lost their value.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than any historical mistake, it is a betrayal engendered
by historical blindness.

 &HT;    Midyear's a good time for tax-lowering steps
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Making promises to reform the tax laws is often
harmless. Politicians do it all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Grouching about the iniquities of income tax is usually OK.
People do it on talk radio all the time.
</P>
<P>
   But cutting your tax bill requires more than just talk, and it
is something you have to do for yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Midyear is a good time to start. Some actions you should
initiate quickly. Others you can put off if you're willing to face
frantic scrambles at year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some suggestions for a midsummer tax checkup:
</P>
<P>
   Check your withholding. If you get a big refund each year,
you're having too much withheld from each paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to make sure you're not lending your money to the
government,'' said Doug Liptak, a certified public accountant with
Frazier &AMP; Deeter. ``You won't get any interest, and you could have
used the money yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   At the other extreme, you may not be withholding enough to cover
your tax bill. If your underpayments are too large, you could be
hit with penalties.
</P>
<P>
   To get back to limits, ask your employer for the paperwork
required to complete a new W-4 form. You will also get a worksheet
to help figure it out.
</P>
<P>
   If your income changes substantially _ typically from
self-employment income, stock options or bonuses _ you may need to
consider making estimated tax payments throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   Deduction bunching. This means packing as many deductible items
as you can into a single year.
</P>
<P>
   Certain itemized deductions have to exceed an established
threshold before you can claim them. For example, you can claim a
deduction only on medical expenses that exceed 7.5 percent of your
adjusted gross income. Looking ahead, you may find that you will
benefit from getting elective medical work done this year. That's
not something you want to leave until the holiday period.
</P>
<P>
   If possible, says tax analyst Mildred Carter of CCH Inc., ``You
should plan your deductions so you can claim them in the years when
you have the highest tax rate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Planning Association, which represents certified
financial planners, warns that jiggering like this may make you
vulnerable to the alternative minimum tax.
</P>
<P>
   That's complex enough that you may want to take it up with an
expert. You won't be alone. More than half of individual taxpayers
hire a professional to do their taxes. Another alternative is to
check the resources below for detailed information.
</P>
<P>
   Retirement savings accounts. Individual retirement accounts and
401(k) plans can help cut your tax bill.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brennan, a manager in KPMG's tax practice in Atlanta, points
out two reasons for maxing out a 401(k): You get to deduct your
contribution from your taxable income now, and you get to defer
taxes on the earnings your investments make.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not contributing the maximum, you should consider
doing it,'' Brennan said. The maximum is 15 percent of your salary
but not more than $10,500 for the year.
</P>
<P>
   If you've topped out and still have more disposable income, he
suggests contributing to a traditional or Roth IRA.
</P>
<P>
   Review your investments. If you have sold winners and have
capital gains, you may want to offset that income by selling losers
that you have been meaning to sell anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Liptak suggests another precaution: checking how much of a tax
liability your mutual funds are likely to dump on you when they
make capital gains distributions at year-end. If it's big, you may
want to consider selling the shares before the distribution and
switching the money to more tax-efficient investments.
</P>
<P>
   Marriage plans. Two-income families have to worry about the
marriage penalty and may want to tie the knot after December.
</P>
<P>
   If only one spouse will work, it may be beneficial to marry
before the year is out.
</P>
<P>
   Charitable giving. If you plan to donate appreciated stocks,
Brennan thinks it may be a good idea to do it now.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may be better off, since stock prices are so erratic,'' he
said. ``You would do that if you think the value of the asset might
decrease.''
</P>
<P>
   You could also consider making non-cash charitable donations
before the holiday rush begins, Liptak suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Record keeping. Don't wait until next spring to organize your
tax records. If you've had trouble finding receipts for deductible
expenses, for example, the time to set up an organized storage plan
is now.

 &HT;    Sit back and relish the memories
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Chairs have always been a significant part of
my life _ mainly, I guess, because I'm lazy and much prefer sitting
down to standing up. Somehow, my history seems defined by a
progression of chairs _ rather like reading the rings of an ancient
tree.
</P>
<P>
   The first chair in my life was a cane-seated rocker that came
with the suite (what the matching stuff was called back then) of
walnut furniture in my parents' room. There was a bed with a curved
footboard and a bed lamp on the headboard, a night table, a vanity
with a long mirror in the middle and two shorter ones on the sides
that swung back and forth so Mother could see all of her hair, a
caned bench, a chiffonier with Daddy's suits hanging in it and his
socks in the top drawer, a dresser with a mirror, one straight
chair, and the rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Mother didn't sing or tell stories, but she did rock. I remember
the rhythmic creaks, and because she was short, the tap of her toes
on the wood each time the chair rocked forward and her feet met the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Daddy had an old Morris chair and footstool on one side of the
fireplace, right next to the GE radio with the green ``eye'' on the
front that showed when it was properly tuned. In 1941, that was
where he explained war to me _ as well as he could. He'd fought in
the first ``big one'' and was too old for this one.
</P>
<P>
   Every evening we shared his chair and listened to Gabriel
Heater's commentary on the news of the world brought to us by Kreml
hair tonic. It's where I first heard of men named MacArthur and
Nimitz, and strange places called Tulagi and
</P>
<P>
   Tarawa. And it's where I was told that Billy Kelly, the boy
across the street whose folks had been so proud of him when he
played ball for Ohio State, wouldn't be coming home any more to
play catch with us little kids.
</P>
<P>
   The ``hall chair'' was a green, plush-covered relic, retired
from an old Pullman car. My father bought it at auction and it took
three men to carry it to the upstairs hall.
</P>
<P>
   On school mornings, I'd pick up the clean dress mother had laid
on the chair arm for me, and put my brown teddy bear, raggedy from
too much love, in its place, ready for the next bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   It was the chair where my father waited for mother to finish my
bath, and for me to holler, ``Okay, Daddy. Come dry me!'' I
remember how he'd wrap me up and lift me onto his lap, reminding me
as he dried carefully between each toe that
</P>
<P>
   if I didn't always do that, they'd rust.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Putsy the cat slept in the green chair. Once he got
sick on it. So did I, once. Then when I was 12, we moved and left
the green chair in the hall.
</P>
<P>
   When my son was born, I bought a bentwood rocker. He and I
giggled and rocked and sang until he no longer fit my lap. It's in
his old bedroom now _ maybe waiting to go live at his house when
it's needed.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 12, a flowered armchair and ottoman moved into his
room. There's a blue stain on one side of the seat cushion where a
ballpoint leaked when he sat on it. The old chair is so badly worn
now that the welting is hanging out. The upholsterer is coming for
it next week and I'm hoping none of the memories go with the old
cover.
</P>
<P>
   Chairs, I think, are like good friends, and over the years we
learn to cherish the comfort both give us. Occasionally, I even
wonder if maybe there's such a thing as a lifetime allotment for
chairs...and how many I still have to go.

 &HT;    'Monday Night' QBs get _ what? Brains over brain damage?
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABC has made a horrible choice.
</P>
<P>
   That's what analysts said when the network introduced former
``Saturday Night Live'' regular Dennis Miller as the next Howard
Cosell.
</P>
<P>
   I must agree. Dennis Miller _ bright, articulate, funny and
apparently football-savvy _ is someone I'd watch.
</P>
<P>
   And that should disqualify him.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts know what demographic ``Monday Night Football''
most needs, and it's not me.
</P>
<P>
   It's the World Wrestling Federation crowd, the New World Order
crowd, the ``Monday Night Nitro'' crowd.
</P>
<P>
   The Rush Limbaugh crowd?
</P>
<P>
   This _ the Limbaugh-WWF connection _ is not one I'd have made
until the other day. Then I heard an ``entertainment analyst'' say
it: The pro wrestling crowd is what ``MNF'' might have had in mind
in auditioning Limbaugh, the toad king of the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   The wrestling crowd accounts for much of the exodus from
one-time sky-high ``Monday Night Football'' ratings, said the
analyst. And, he suggested in advance of ABC's decision, Limbaugh
might be the vehicle to get those viewers back.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, I did not make this Rush-wrestling connection.
Granted, I associate Limbaugh with a certain raw-meat crowd. But it
dines selectively _ on the reputations of liberals and
Clintonistas, rather than ``any and all comers.'' (For instance,
when Republicans have sex scandals, soft-money scams or cushy
dealings with the Chinese, Rush napkins-up and excuses himself from
the table.)
</P>
<P>
   If what ``Monday Night Football'' needs back is the pro
wrestling crowd, it seems that the analyst in question may have
taken one too many pile drivers, noggin-wise. Rush Limbaugh? Dare I
say it? He's too urbane.
</P>
<P>
   If its aim was to pander to the wrestling crowd, seemingly all
ABC would have to do is get Stone-Cold Steve Austin, or a goon
named Goldberg, or silver-haired Dusty Rhodes. Any number of pro
wrestling stars would be willing to wax salivary at its microphone.
</P>
<P>
   One really wonders, when analysts say that programmers need to
start thinking like a pro wrestling crowd, if thought is what they
have in mind. Pro-wrestling is not about thought. It is more on a
glandular level. One would say that sports, particularly football,
is all about glands anyway. May be.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, what analysts say now applies to sports commentary
(``any and all comers'') increasingly applies to such a thing as
governing. Obviously, that is what a plurality of Minnesota voters
decreed last general election when they made a pro wrestler
governor.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks after his election, reactions to Jesse ``The Body''
Ventura alternated between ``what a terrible mistake'' and ``at
last, a truly candid, brutally honest politician.''
</P>
<P>
   To be brutally honest, the pendulum has swung back to position
A: ``terrible mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   But, you see, when the object is pandering to a crowd rather
than delivering thoughtful policies in a complex world, who better
than a pro wrestler to deliver?
</P>
<P>
   Back to ABC, which in its quest for someone nontraditional and
provocative has made a mistake. It's not that Dennis Miller isn't
great. He is. I will watch and listen with interest.
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem for ABC. I'm not the target audience it
wants. Listen to the masses it misses. The best man for the job was
one with some blood on his lapel.

   DISPATCHES FROM DREAMSVILLE: ``Eating out'' once meant an old
table under an apple tree
</P>
<P>
   (''Dispatches from Dreamsville'' is an occasional series in
which readers share with Cox Newspapers senior writer Joe Murray
their memories of growing up in small-town America. Back then, or
at least the way we remember it, life was like a dream.)
</P>
<P>
   By Dora Matthai
</P>
<P>
   Special to Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   It seems that everyone is eating out these days, either at
fast-food places, buffets, carry-outs or fancy restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-five years ago, when I was a little girl growing up on a
108-acre farm outside Hillsboro, Ohio, life was nothing like it is
today.
</P>
<P>
   My parents, two sisters, a brother and I lived in a small
three-room house with no electricity, running water, bathrooms or
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Dad promised to build a new house after he finished the barn.
But the money was never available, and he wouldn't buy anything
``on time,'' as credit was referred to in those days. Dad felt it
was a disgrace to owe money.
</P>
<P>
   But we did get to ``eat out'' occasionally, though our idea of
eating out was lunch on an old table under the apple tree in our
front yard.
</P>
<P>
   Our mom would spend the entire morning preparing lunch (we
called it dinner) while the rest of us worked in the fields.
</P>
<P>
   When we'd come in at noon, all hot and tired, she'd have fried
chicken, roasting ears, fresh green beans, cole slaw, mashed
potatoes and gravy, hot homemade bread, and lemonade or iced tea _
plus hot berry cobbler and homemade ice cream (hand-cranked) for
dessert. That was gourmet dining at its best.
</P>
<P>
   We would eat so much we'd try to sneak a little nap under a
shade tree somewhere, but dad would find us and then it was back to
the field we'd go.
</P>
<P>
   We also looked forward to occasional family trips into town in
our Model-A Ford to sell eggs, cash the milk check, buy the few
grocery items that we couldn't raise, and to visit our
grandparents, always bringing meat and fresh vegetables from the
farm.
</P>
<P>
   Since we didn't want to burden them by arriving at lunchtime, on
those special days we also ``ate out.''
</P>
<P>
   Mom would purchase a pound of old-fashioned red bologna and a
loaf of store-bought bread, rare treats for farm folks. Then dad
would drive us out to a big shade tree on the outskirts of town for
a picnic.
</P>
<P>
   That was our idea of fast food.
</P>
<P>
   All these years later, my sister and I can still taste those
wonderful red bologna sandwiches every time we pass the same old
shade tree on the way to the cemetery where mom and dad are buried.

AT BALLET COMPETITION, YOUTH AND ENERGY BUT NO GOLD MEDALS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three bronze medals and three silver medals were
awarded to young dancers on Sunday night at Alice Tully Hall at a
ceremony concluding the Sixth New York International Ballet
Competition. The competition attracted 48 dancers from 18
countries, and the gala was the culmination of a three-week period
during which all participants learned and were judged on an
identical repertory. They also had opportunities to show works
chosen on their own.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of dancers, teachers and choreographers awarded bronze
medals in the women's division to Hye Min Hwang (South Korea) and
Emi Hariyama (Japan). A men's bronze medal went to Rene Salazar
(Brazil). Sarah Lamb of the Boston Ballet received a women's silver
medal; Ilya Kozadayev and Mikhail Ilyin (both of Russia) won men's
silver medals.
</P>
<P>
   This year there were no gold medals for dancers. But an honorary
gold medal for lifetime achievement went to Arthur Mitchell, the
artistic director of Dance Theater of Harlem. The presentation was
made by Frederic Franklin, the former star of the Ballet Russe de
Monte Carlo, who for several decades has been an adviser to many
companies, including Mitchell's. Upon receiving the award,
Mitchell, quoting Martha Graham, said that ``dancers are angels of
God.''
</P>
<P>
   The competition was founded in 1984 by Igor Youskevitch, who
died in 1994, and Ilona Copen, who continues as executive director;
Eleanor D'Antuono serves as artistic director. To promote high
standards, its directors and judges have always been chary about
awarding gold medals. The competition has been held every three or
four years and, of the past five events, two were without
gold-medal presentations.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is open to dancers between the ages of 17 and
24. All must learn three assigned pieces of choreography, but those
works are not announced until the dancers arrive in New York.
</P>
<P>
   This year's selections were Balanchine's ``Tchaikovsky Pas de
Deux,'' coached by Deborah Wingert; the grand pas de deux from
Petipa's ``Sleeping Beauty,'' coached by Winthrop Corey, and the
``Giggling Rapids'' sequence from Alvin Ailey's ``River,'' coached
by Mucuy Bolles. Lupe Serrano, Stephen Pier and Luis Fuente taught
the dancers during the three-week period. Liliane Montevecchi, who
has been a star of Roland Petit's Ballets de Paris and of such
Broadway shows as ``Grand Hotel'' and ``Nine,'' served as master of
ceremonies. The awards ceremony was followed by a performance by
this year's winners, other finalists and some winners and finalists
from previous competitions. The dancers were eager and attractive,
yet several performances had rough edges. And some of the works
presented that were not part of the competition syllabus were
choreographically undistinguished.
</P>
<P>
   But Hariyama offered a delicate variation from ``The Sleeping
Beauty.'' Hwang was secure in a solo from ``Le Corsaire,'' although
her dancing could benefit from a greater sense of flow. Salazar and
Priscilla Yokoi, another Brazilian dancer, were gleeful in
``Giggling Rapids.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb brought dignity and radiance to the ``Sleeping Beauty'' pas
de deux, for which her partner was Zack Grubbs, also of the Boston
Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Partnering Mirai Noda of Japan, Ilyin looked at home in the
``Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux.'' Kozadayev leaped lightly througn a
solo from Petipa's ``Rest of the Cavalry.''
</P>
<P>
   Other finalists who danced were Marnie Shapiro, Emily Grizzell
and Joel Prouty (United States), Rosa Antuna (Brazil), Kenny Wang
(Taiwan), Neli Beliakaite (Lithuania), Cong Ma (China), Diana
Stetsura (Belarus), Eivar Sair (Venezuela) and Altanhuyag Dugarai
(Mongolia).
</P>
<P>
   Dancers from previous competitions who participated included
Christina Theryoung, Venti Petrov, David Kierce and four dancers
now with American Ballet Theater: Anna Liceica, Gillian Murphy,
Gennadi Saveliev and Carlos Molina.
</P>
<P>
   The performance by Liceica and Molina of the Black Swan adagio
from ``Swan Lake'' was especially notable for its elegance and
sense of drama.
</P>
<P>
   Competition judges were Cynthia Gregory, chairwoman, and Karen
Kain, Carla Fracci, Jean-Christophe Maillot, Julio Bocca, Boris
Eifman, Zhao Ruheng and Rudi van Dantzig.

   COXNET WHEELS 0627 -- The 2001 Acura 3.2CL Type S coupe is an
Acura that's going to astonish folks who aren't familiar with what
parent company Honda has been doing of late with its engines, which
benefit from trickledown technology from Formula One Grand Prix
racing. The Type S is classified as a near-luxury car, but there's
nothing ``near'' about its sportiness. (DeVault, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) Art includes a 4-column color photo of the
2001 Acura 3.2CL Type S coupe.

   WEB-PUBLIC-PRIVATE _ First comes love. Then comes marriage. Then
comes a newborn shown off live on the World Wide Web before its
powdered bottom ever graces a baby carriage. That's the basic
premise behind a Baby Huey-ish new company that's already signed up
more than 75 hospitals nationwide and which could be coming to the
metro Atlanta area by the end of this summer. The company lets new
parents conduct live-action ``netcasts'' right from the hospital,
meaning relatives scattered around the country and co-workers stuck
back at the office don't have to miss witnessing Junior's first
gurgles and coos. And why would they want to, having perhaps
already spent months tracking the pregnancy via the parents-to-be's
personal web page _ and, even before that, keeping up with their
wedding plans on yet another web page. Remember when experts warned
us about the possible isolating effects of the Internet? Check your
e-mail again. If anything, it now affords us the chance to learn
more about other people's personal moments than ever before _
whether we want to or not. (Vejnoska, Atlanta

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By JAMES BROOKE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Every summer, after the steel bonds of winter fall away,
Montrealers leap forth for an outdoor season of street festivals,
cafe-hopping, bicycling along canals or simply strolling streets
imbued with the history of a city founded in 1642.
 &HT;    This bubble of Latin culture, the world's second-largest
French-speaking city, after Paris, has drawn Americans since the
days of Benjamin Franklin.
 &HT;    Promoting itself this summer as ``Paris without jet lag,''
Montreal can now throw in ``without the long ride from the
airport.'' All commercial air traffic now goes to Dorval
International Airport, a 15-minute cab ride from downtown, as
opposed to the 40-mile ride from Mirabel, the old airport.
 &HT;    Then there is the money: restaurant checks may look steep, but
subtract a third, because $1 American buys almost $1.50 Canadian.
 &HT;    As Americans reserve Montreal hotel rooms at the fastest clip
since the Expo 67 World's Fair, they will discover an attitude
change here. Montreal is on the economic rebound as investors
finally accept the ``French fact.''
 &HT;    With a huge concentration of college students, Montreal is
churning out a French-speaking middle class. With the French
language more dominant in Montreal than it has been since the
1760s, separatism is on the back burner and Quebecers are
increasingly self-confident and outward looking.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Fireworks set to music is the theme of the Benson &AMP; Hedges
International Fireworks Competition on 10 nights, which began on
June 18 and ends on July 30, over the old World's Fair grounds on
Ile Ste.-Helene. Among the competitors are Japan, Germany, Italy
and the United States. From 10 p.m. Seats range from $21 to $28 and
can be ordered from (800) 361-4595. Information: (514) 872-6222.
 &HT;    The Montreal Jazz Festival will include 400 concerts, 300 of
them free, largely in and around Place des Arts downtown, from June
29 to July 9. It is dedicated to Louis Armstrong and is expected to
draw 2,000 musicians and an audience of 1.5 million.
 &HT;    Among the performers expected are the trumpet player Arturo
Sandoval, the bassist Dave Holland and the vocalist Ranee Lee.
Information: (888) 515-0515. Schedules and ticket sales at
www.montrealjazzfest.com.
 &HT;    The last weekend of the jazz festival, July 7 to 9, is also the
weekend for Carifiesta, Montreal's Caribbean carnival. Like almost
everything else here, the festival has a French touch, drawing on
the traditions of Guadeloupe, Haiti and Martinique, with blasting
bands to lure 150,000 people into the streets. A parade will be
followed by a free party at the Champ-de-Mars, behind city hall.
Information: (514) 735-2232.
 &HT;    The Afro beat picks up July 13 with Nuits d'Afrique for 10 days,
some 30 concerts and nearly 300 musicians from Africa, the
Caribbean and Black America. Information: (514) 499-9239. The
schedule includes Miriam Makeba on opening night at the Spectrum
nightclub (tickets $35) and Tiken Jah Fakoly, reggae singer from
the Ivory Coast, in one of the free nightly concerts at Place
Emilie-Gamelin.
 &HT;    What's so funny about Montreal? Find out at the Just for Laughs
festival, July 13 to 23. Many of the 1,500 performances in French
and English by stand-up comics and troupes from around the world
will be free on outdoor stages along Rue St.-Denis. Among the
headliners are Tim Allen, Eric Idle and William Shatner. For
information, call (514) 845-3155, or visit www.hahaha.com.
 &HT;    July finishes with the Lesbian and Gay Pride celebration on the
31st. It draws from all over North America, with attendance
expected to hit half a million for the Pride Parade on the last
day, Aug. 6. An outdoor big-band concert is planned for
Emilie-Gamelin Park at 8 p.m. on Aug. 1, and a street fair will
take place at Ste.-Catherine East between Berri and Papineau on
Aug. 5. Information: (514) 285-4011.
 &HT;    Through Oct. 15, the Museum of Fine Arts, 1380 Sherbrooke West,
(514) 285-2000, will display 81 paintings, including Cezannes,
Renoirs and Picassos, on loan from the Musee de l'Orangerie in
Paris through Oct. 15. Open daily 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission $10.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The delights of a Montreal summer require footwork: strolling
centuries-old blocks and streets, inspecting architectural details,
reading historic plaques, window shopping on streets lined with
antiques shops, or sipping an allonge coffee at a sidewalk cafe.
 &HT;    The best neighborhoods for walks are Vieux-Port, the Old Port
section where the city began life 358 years ago; the Rue St.-Denis
restaurant, cafe and shopping streets; and Rue Ste.-Catherine, the
shopping and entertainment district.
 &HT;    For $13.50, the Montreal Museum Pass allows holders to visit 21
museums over two days. A good place to start is just off the docks
in the old port section.
 &HT;    The new Pointe-a-Calliere Montreal Museum of Archaeology and
History, Place Royale at Rue de la Commune, offers visitors a good
background on the city's development, starting with a fast-paced,
Monty Python-style bilingual multimedia show on Montreal's history.
The tower provides a bird's-eye view of Old Montreal and the St.
Lawrence River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday to Friday, 11 a.m.
to 5 p.m. weekends; (514) 872-9150. Admission $5.75, $2 ages 6 to
12.
 &HT;    If you need a break from the heat (yes, it can happen even in
Montreal), slip into the cool and soothing, robin's-egg-blue
interior of Notre-Dame Basilica, about three blocks up the hill
from the history museum, at 110 Rue Notre-Dame West. This graceful
Gothic Revival church was believed to be the largest religious
edifice in North America when it opened in 1829.
 &HT;    The architect, a New Yorker named James O'Donnell, was so taken
with its soaring, gold-leaf interior and stained-glass windows
depicting the history of Montreal that he converted to Catholicism
in order to be buried there. Admission is $1.35.
 &HT;    Four blocks away, at the corner of Rue St.-Laurent and the
river, Cirque du Soleil, the cultural ambassadors of modern
Montreal, offer their first large-screen film, ``Journey of Man,''
at the IMAX Old Port. Filmed all over the world, it follows a child
as he travels from birth to adulthood. $8.45, seniors and
teen-agers $7. Information: (514) 496-4629, or www.imaxoldport.com.
 &HT;    The Montreal Botanical Garden, 4101 Sherbrooke East, one of the
world's largest, hits full bloom in late June. With 21,000 species
of plant, the gardens sprawl over 30 acres, ranging from formal
European gardens, to a Chinese pavilion in the style of the Ming
Dynasty, to a 16-acre arboretum and 10 exhibition greenhouses.
Admission $6.45, seniors and students $4.75, ages 6 to 17 $3.20;
(514) 872-1400.
 &HT;    After stopping to smell the roses, you may desire more vigorous
activity. There's bicycling along an eight-mile lighted, paved path
from Rene Levesque Park to the Pere Marquette Promenade, a route
that passes by the Lachine Rapids. Bikes can be rented at any of
several kiosks in the Old Port.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    American tourism is expected to surge this summer, so expect
higher seasonal rates. Rooms can be scarce during major festivals.
 &HT;    With 487 spacious rooms, the Holiday Inn Montreal-Midtown, 420
Sherbrooke St. West, (514) 842-6111, fax (514) 842-9381, is a good
bet during the peak season. Many of the rooms have views along
Sherbrooke, Montreal's Fifth Avenue. Doubles are $114 to $150.
 &HT;    For the charm of Old Montreal, the Auberge du Vieux-Port, 97 Rue
de la Commune East, (888) 660-7678, fax (514) 876-8923, is a
late-19th-century stone building converted to a hotel. The 27
neo-classical rooms, in great demand, have brass beds, stone or
brick walls, and large casement windows overlooking the port docks.
Doubles are $129 to $179, including full breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: At the junction of the busy bar, restaurant and boutique
scene, at the corner of Rue Ste.-Catherine and Rue Crescent, the
Comfort Suites, 1214 Rue Crescent, (514) 878-2711, fax (514)
878-0030, offers 96 simple, comfortable rooms, each with balcony.
Doubles: $80 to $112.
 &HT;    One block to the east, the Novotel, 1180 Rue de la Montagne,
(514) 861-6000, fax (514) 861-0992, offers slightly higher priced
rooms on a street lined with boutiques and restaurants. The 227
rooms have bright, modern decor, and there is a fitness center.
Doubles: $87 to $135.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Ritz-Carlton Montreal, 1228 Sherbrooke West, (514)
842-4212, fax (514) 842-4907, the 88-year-old empress of Montreal's
Golden Mile, has just emerged from a renovation that added luster
to its marble bathrooms, its rooms appointed with antiques, and to
its piano bar and delightful garden restaurant. The
turn-of-the-century ambience melds nicely with two-line phones in
the 229 rooms. Doubles are $288.
 &HT;    The largest of half a dozen inns to open in historic buildings
in old Montreal in recent years, the Auberge Bonaparte, 447
St.-Francois Xavier, (514) 844-1448, fax (514) 844-0272, offers
views of Montreal's historic heart from many of its 30 individually
decorated rooms. On a quiet side street, the Bonaparte has an
excellent restaurant of the same name. Doubles $98 to $132.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    It used to be said that, after language and politics, food was
the favorite topic of conversation in Quebec. But now, judging by
the expanding waistlines of the graying separatist leaders, food
may be winning out .
 &HT;    My introduction to the sensuous culinary delights of Montreal
came last winter when a waitress at Toque instructed me to place a
chunk of warm foie gras on my tongue and feel it dissolve around
the sides. In an unpretentious setting on Montreal's restaurant
row, Toque, 3842 Rue St.-Denis, (514) 499-2084, is near the top of
the city's dining pyramid. Giving Quebecois products a new spin,
the chef, Normand Laprise, serves maple-syrup-glazed quail as an
appetizer, and roasted saddle of lamb with butternut squash and
fiddlehead ferns among the main courses. Dinner for two, with wine,
was $150. Reservations are essential.
 &HT;    Within walking distance of the Sherbrooke Street hotels is an
old favorite for a quiet romantic dinner by the fireplace, Chez la
Mere Michel, 1209 Rue Guy, (514) 934-0473. As flute music warbled,
we had lobster souffle Nantua and tournedos bearnaise. Dinner for
two, with wine, was $142.
 &HT;    In heavily French-speaking East Montreal, Laloux is an elegant
restaurant popular with the business crowd at lunch. It is run by
an expatriate French chef, Andre Besson, and is at 250 Avenue des
Pins East, (514) 287-9127, on a quiet street far from the tourist
flow. Laloux offers veal escalope with dried apricots, almonds,
muscat wine sauce and linguini, or poached red snapper with white
wine, a la mandarine, and crispy vegetables. Dinner for two, with
wine, $68.
 &HT;    An affordable place in the Old Port neighborhood is Stash's
Cafe, 200 St.-Paul West, (514) 845-6611, a Polish restaurant with a
Warsaw counterculture air. Ensconced behind thick stone walls with
views of pedestrian traffic, Stash's offers four-course menus for
$13 to $16.50. Specialities include zurek (a white borscht), wild
boar and strudel.
 &HT;    Pino, 1471 Rue Crescent, (514) 289-1930, with a heavily Italian
menu, is strategically perched on a second-floor corner, with
tables placed by the curving windows for people-watching along Rue
Ste.-Catherine. Calamari with garlic butter, a three-cheese green
pasta and beers came to $36 for two.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By RYAN J. DONMOYER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It was almost midnight and my girlfriend, Patty, and I were
tiptoeing behind our guide, deep in the bush of Stewart Island, the
smallest and least populated of New Zealand's three principal
islands. So far, we had seen three possums, but I had practically
given up hope of spotting a kiwi, the furry, nocturnal, flightless
bird that has been New Zealand's national symbol for more than a
century.
 &HT;    ``Use your fingers to filter your torch,'' whispered the guide,
Matt Gaze, of Kiwi Wilderness Walks. ``Kiwis cannot tolerate strong
light.''
 &HT;    Then, about 100 feet up the track, there was movement, and our
flashlights shone in unison. A pair of red, evil-looking eyes
beamed back at us. Another possum. ``I guess we should turn back,''
Matt said with a sigh.
 &HT;    My heart sank _ after four trips to New Zealand spent trying to
see in the wild just one of the elusive, charismatic creatures,
another chance to do so was slipping away.
 &HT;    We started heading back through the ferns to the Old Island Hill
Homestead, a former farmhouse where we would stay overnight as part
of our five-night package. Four hours earlier, we had hiked there
after a six-seater Cessna flew us about 25 miles from Riverton on
South Island, where we spent our first night, across Foveaux Strait
to the beach in Mason Bay on Stewart Island.
 &HT;    The homestead is administered by New Zealand's Department of
Conservation and is one of only two lodging sites on Mason Bay, a
three-day walk from Oban in Halfmoon Bay, where all 350 or so of
Stewart's human residents live.
 &HT;    This is kiwi country. There are at least 10 times as many kiwis
as there are people on the 670-square-mile Stewart Island, about
the size of Oahu in Hawaii, and these endangered birds are easiest
to spot on its unpopulated west side, near Mason Bay.
 &HT;    Only 75 years ago, with no natural predators, some 5 million of
the birds roamed New Zealand. Today, because of farming and the
introduction of predators such as cats, dogs and weasel-like
stoats, only about 75,000 of the six varieties of kiwis remain in
pockets around the country.
 &HT;    Their numbers are dwindling by half every 10 years, say
researchers at the Kiwi Recovery Program, a nonprofit venture
sponsored by the Bank of New Zealand, the Department of
Conservation and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. As a
result, despite being the country's mascot, most New Zealanders
have never seen a live kiwi outside of one of the dozens of kiwi
aviaries catering to tourists.
 &HT;    Although we, too, still had not yet seen a kiwi, we were finding
plenty of evidence of them. We encountered a few trekkers who had
spun tales of seeing kiwis feeding on the beach at sunrise or
plodding along the trails in front of them in broad daylight
(unlike the country's other kiwis, the Stewart Island brown kiwi is
frequently active during the day). Matt showed us holes where the
birds had plunged their long, pointy bills into the ground in quest
of worms and insects.
 &HT;    Once, he leaned over to pluck something off the ground. ``Kiwi
feathers,'' he pronounced, handing Patty and me tiny wisps of soft,
brown down.
 &HT;    And then there was the noise _ a repetitive, high-pitched
whistle by the males, and a coarser, raspier answer by the females.
Their calls filled the forest. Unfortunately, to the untrained ear,
they are easily confused with possum.
 &HT;    Suddenly, there was rustling in the bush about 25 feet to our
left. Another false alarm, I thought, as our flashlights swarmed
across the area until I finally saw movement.
 &HT;    ``There!'' I gasped. And the kiwi, a knee-high bundle of dark,
hairlike feathers, stepped into our makeshift spotlight. It lunged
with its long beak, using the nostrils at the end of it to snuffle
through the leaves. An instant later, it was gone.
 &HT;    ``Kill your lights,'' Matt whispered. ``And don't move.''
 &HT;    A moment later, the fern next to his boot shook, and the kiwi
stepped onto the track. My heart flipped. The kiwi glanced at us,
turned and waddled up the trail, its muscular legs supporting a
squat, bristly backside. Then it made an abrupt about-face and
plodded toward us. It sniffed curiously at Matt's boot, made
another about-face, and ran up the track into the dark.
 &HT;    I realized I had been holding my breath, so I exhaled. The whole
experience had lasted less than five minutes, but it had made the
entire trip to New Zealand worthwhile. ``I'm so happy we saw his
little face!'' Patty said.
 &HT;    I was thrilled, too. Seeing a kiwi in the wild had become
something of a life goal for me since becoming obsessed with the
birds 15 years earlier, when I lived in Auckland. I had tried to
book a one-night kiwi-spotting trip on Stewart Island in 1997, but
the tour had been full.
 &HT;    Patty, although this was her first trip to New Zealand, was also
falling in love with the kiwis, and was especially impressed by the
fact that compared with humans, they exhibit opposite sex roles.
 &HT;    Although kiwis live as monogamous pairs, the female is larger
than the male and is the dominant partner; the male tends to have
primary responsibility for incubating the eggs, which weigh up to a
third of the female's body weight. ``Ouch,'' Patty said.
 &HT;    As fascinating as they were, the kiwis were just one example of
the native New Zealand birds we would encounter. Matt had already
pointed out an area where local tribes of Maori (a Polynesian
people who inhabited New Zealand for nearly a millennium before
Europeans discovered it) gathered every year for a ritual harvest
of plump muttonbird. These birds are also known as short-tailed
shearwater, and the Maori have eaten them for hundreds of years.
 &HT;    Just off the coast of Mason Bay, most of the 62 flightless
kakapo parrots known to exist thrive on predator-free Codfish
Island. Stewart Island also is home to wild parakeets, bellbirds,
shags, heron, oystercatchers, large wood pigeons, rare dotterels,
and three species of penguin.
 &HT;    There are also tuis, which resemble priests with their jet-black
feathers and white tufts at their throats, and the cheeky,
flightless weka, which is often mistaken for a kiwi.
 &HT;    A few minutes after spotting our first kiwi we saw another, and
this time we were able to watch eagerly for a good 15 or 20 minutes
before it disappeared into the bush. We were still chattering
excitedly about the two sightings as the forest gave way to a
grassy clearing and the farmhouse where we would spend the night
appeared in the moonlight. It was basically a rustic cabin with no
electricity, an outhouse, and drinking water collected from
rainfall.
 &HT;    In the morning, Matt laid out a spread of muesli, powdered milk
and fruit. He boiled water on a gas camping stove and offered us
tea, which we greedily accepted.
 &HT;    ``Should be a nice day to walk,'' he said. ``And the kiwis are
more vocal where we're going at night.''
 &HT;    It was about nine miles through a swamp on the North-West
Circuit, a rugged 80-mile trail around the northern tip of the
island, to Freshwater Landing, where we would be staying that
night. After breakfast, we hoisted on our packs and set off. We
were joined by Marijka, a Dutch woman now living in New Zealand's
Southland, who had also signed on for Matt's tour. She set a
healthy pace.
 &HT;    Patty and I held back a little, marveling at the sheer
isolation. Stewart Island, known to the Maori as Rakiura, ``Land of
the Glowing Skies,'' really is a different world.
 &HT;    The day before, when the Cessna dropped us off at Mason Bay, our
little party had been the only people on the pristine,
10-mile-long, white sandy beach. When a man and a woman emerged
from the track ahead and began walking toward us, Matt said, ``It's
getting crowded out here.''
 &HT;    The absence of humanity was evident in unexpected ways. As the
terrain changed from grassy swamp to an archway of trees marking
the entrance of a new forest, there was furious fluttering above.
 &HT;    ``The bellbirds aren't too happy with us,'' Matt said. ``We're
trespassing.''
 &HT;    After we reached Freshwater Landing, another sparse
accommodation that we shared with a dozen independent trekkers
spread over two rooms of bunks, Matt prepared a scrumptious dinner
of pasta, sundried tomatoes and mushrooms. Pouring rain prevented
another kiwi-spotting excursion, so we went to bed when the sun
went down.
 &HT;    The next morning, we caught a reserved water taxi from
Freshwater Landing to Milar's Beach, to complete the journey by
kayak with Jo Paine, a guide from the Completely Southern Sky Sea
Kayaks Tour Company. After a few minutes of instruction from Jo
(Patty had never kayaked before), we paddled off into Paterson
Inlet, which has nearly 120 miles of sheltered coastline.
 &HT;    We drifted past oystercatchers, with their black bodies and
long, red bills. We passed several varieties of cranelike shags,
which flew inches above the water, hunting for fish. Before long,
we happened on a yellow-eyed penguin _ considered the world's
rarest _ floating on its back.
 &HT;    Jo took us up the Rakeahua River, where we got one last bit of
calm before the rain. Rain falls on Stewart Island 275 days a year,
according to the guidebooks. Only parts of Chile, Argentina and a
few remote islands off the coast of South Africa and New Zealand
are closer to Antarctica than Stewart Island, and the weather can
change suddenly.
 &HT;    What began as a calm, pleasant day trip quickly became an
adventure, as we paddled into nearly horizontal rain and rapidly
growing swells. By the time we made it to the boathouse in Halfmoon
Bay, we were like a bunch of drenched rats.
 &HT;    Fortunately, our final night on Stewart Island was spent in a
guesthouse called Ngahere. It had a view of Halfmoon Bay, hot
water, a fireplace and clean sheets on a double bed. After our 48
hours in the bush, the place felt luxurious. Over a dinner of bean
salad and the freshest salmon I have ever tasted,we discussed the
birds we had seen over the last few days.
 &HT;    ``Have you ever wondered how the kiwi lost its wings?'' Matt
said. The scientific explanation, he said, is that the kiwi is part
of an order of birds that includes the emu, ostrich and moa, a
giant flightless bird hunted to extinction by the Maori. The kiwi
evolved to be flightless over 30 million years because it had no
natural predators. But, Matt explained, Maori lore tells a
different story.
 &HT;    In the Maori version, the god of the forest, Tanehokahoka,
worried that the bugs were starting to eat the trees to death. He
asked three varieties of birds to live on the forest floor and eat
the bugs, but they all refused.
 &HT;    Finally, the kiwi agreed, even though it was told that it would
lose its wings and never see the light of day again. Tanehokahoka
was angry with the other birds and punished each of them.
 &HT;    Then, the legend goes, Tanehokahoka turned to the kiwi and said:
``You, kiwi, because of your great sacrifice, you will become the
most well-known and most-loved bird of them all.''
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: A LONG HIKE TO THE LAIR OF AN ELUSIVE BIRD  
 GETTING THERE  
 &HT;    My girlfriend and I flew from Los Angeles to Auckland, New
Zealand, on Air New Zealand, (800) 262-1234. Qantas Airways, (800)
227-4500, and United Airlines, (800) 538-2929, also serve Auckland
from Los Angeles.
 &HT;    To get to Stewart Island, we caught an Air New Zealand flight to
Christchurch on South Island, rented a car and drove eight hours to
Riverton. But we could have flown to Invercargill, the country's
southernmost city, about 30 minutes from Riverton.
 &HT;    From Riverton, we flew to Stewart Island in a six-seat plane,
landing at Mason Bay, on the uninhabited side, a flight that was
part of our tour package. It is possible to get to the island's one
township, Oban in Halfmoon Bay, by commercial ferry from Bluff, or
light aircraft from Invercargill on Southern Air, (64-3) 218-9129.
 SEEING THE KIWIS  
 &HT;    We took an organized tour with Kiwi Wilderness Walks, which is
run by Evan Bloomfield at the Riverton Rock Guesthouse, 136
Palmerston St., Riverton, New Zealand, (64-3) 234-8886; fax (64-3)
234-8816; www.riverton.co.nz/html/walks.
 &HT;    Although the peak time for such tours is November through April
(the summer season), they are available all year. The five-night
tour includes air or boat transportation to Mason Bay and three
nights on Stewart Island.
 &HT;    It begins and ends with a night's stay at the comfortable
Riverton Rock Guesthouse on South Island, a restored historic inn
with a half-dozen rooms, including one with an all-scarlet decor.
 &HT;    On Stewart Island, one night is spent at the Old Island Hill
Homestead, a former farmhouse with outside toilets; we spent
another night at Freshwater Landing on the North-West Circuit, but
now the tour goes straight to Oban for two nights. There, we stayed
at a guesthouse called Ngahere.
 &HT;    The kiwi-spotting tours take three to 12 people with each guide.
The price is about $500 a person (based on 2.18 New Zealand dollars
to the American dollar). The cost covers all meals and
transportation and five nights' lodging. The guide cooks during the
trek, featuring fresh fish.
 &HT;    Bravo Adventures in Oban offers a four-hour boat trip to see
kiwis every other evening. It costs about $28 but fills up quickly
and should be booked several weeks ahead at (64-3) 219-1144. A
snack and tea and coffee are served.
 WHERE ELSE TO STAY  
 &HT;    With only about 350 residents, Stewart Island offers few lodging
options. The South Sea Hotel, on Elgin Terrace across from the
wharf, (64-3) 219-1059, is the most modern and comfortable
accommodation for independent travelers. There are 26 rooms,
including 9 ``studios'' with private baths and kitchens. Rates
range from $18 to $36 for a double and $44 for a room with a view
of the bay. The studios are $48.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY ANN BANKS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It is the nature of armchair travelers to stay put, reading, not
wandering. But sometimes, when the wind is right, a book can send
us on our way.
 &HT;    On a winter's night some years ago in Oxford, England, Christina
Hardyment sat before the fire and read to her daughters from ``The
Wind in the Willows.'' This was their first encounter with Toad,
one of literature's most seductive dream peddlers.
 &HT;    Toad is by nature a traveling animal. He is met ``resting in a
wicker garden chair, with a preoccupied expression on his face and
a large map spread out on his knees.'' Before long, he's expounding
to Ratty and Mole his philosophy of the Life Adventurous:
 &HT;    ``Here today and up and off to somewhere else tomorrow! Travel,
change, interest, excitement! The whole world before you, and a
horizon that's always changing!''
 &HT;    Reading those lines stirred in Ms. Hardyment a Toadlike urge to
fling off the shackles of everyday routine. The next thing, she and
her family had set out in a yellow camper on the journey of a
lifetime, a 4,000-mile quest for the roots of storybook Europe.
They tracked Pinocchio in Tuscany, explored Hans Brinker's Holland,
looked for witches and wolves in German forests, hunted Babar in
Burgundy.
 &HT;    I picked up Ms. Hardyment's 1987 account of their adventures,
``Heidi's Alp,'' in search of a few hours diversion _ and found
myself lured into a world of daring and delightful possibilities.
 &HT;    What ``The Wind in the Willows'' had done for Ms. Hardyment,
``Heidi's Alp'' did for me. Christina Hardyment became my heroine,
an even more inspiring apostle of waywardness than Toad himself.
Toad may have followed the open road, but he didn't take along four
children in his yellow cart.
 &HT;    Not that I necessarily meant to trace Ms. Hardyment's tracks
(for one thing, I was three children short). But her breadth of
vision encouraged me to think about expanding my own family's
horizons.
 &HT;    We'd taken our school-age daughter on vacations _ to the beach,
to Grandma's _ and made the obligatory haj to Disney World. It was
time to consider voyages of discovery, the kind of travel that
challenges coping skills, stretches the imagination and allows for
the possibility of magic.
 &HT;    Our pursuit of the Life Adventurous in the last decade has taken
us to foreign countries and to back country; some trips have meant
tents, sleeping bags and whitewater rapids, others have involved
passports, strange languages and, one storybook winter, Heidi's
Swiss alp (where Kate christened our sleds Schwanly and Barli,
after Heidi's uncle's willful goats).
 &HT;    Sometimes, Kate, my husband, Peter, and I have traveled
together, a compact nuclear family. Often, it's been just Kate and
me. And on one wonderful, intergenerational occasion, my mother
took Kate and me on a driving tour of Wales, where we explored
castles and visited members of the family my grandmother had left
behind when she emigrated. (As an intrepid traveler, my mother was
easily the equal of Christina Hardyment.)
 &HT;    Whatever our destination, we've been budget-minded, given to
picnicking on a riverbank or railroad-station bench. (I don't
consider this a significant compromise, since travel with children
pretty much precludes serious dining experiences anyway.)
 &HT;    Airfare is generally the biggest expense, so I've become expert
at harvesting frequent-flier miles, discount coupons and seasonal
sales. We even volunteer to get bumped in case our flight is
overbooked; twice we've been awarded free tickets that way, and
consider it the equivalent to winning the lottery.
 &HT;    Whenever trip preparations are underway, I expect to hear
graphic warnings against ``the horrors of travel in general and
with children in particular,'' as Ms. Hardyment herself observed.
 &HT;    At first, I found myself internalizing this cautionary chorus.
What if Kate didn't like the food? What if I found unremitting
motherhood hard to take at times? What if the hotel was a dump? _ a
distinct possibility given our budget.
 &HT;    By now, all those things and more have come to pass and we've
survived. (She ate rice; I got grumpy; we changed hotels.) In the
long run, none of it has mattered much, and we've learned to allow
for both ups and downs.
 &HT;    Of course, the effort to negotiate an unfamiliar environment is
inevitably humbling. How do you pitch this tent, anyway? What's the
system in this country for using a pay phone? Will the waiters
bring plain water if you ask? And how do you ask in their language?
Nothing like total ignorance of what's expected to make you feel
frustrated and stupid _ like a kid, in fact.
 &HT;    I like traveling to strange places with Kate because it requires
me to join her on the steep learning curve that is the constant
condition of childhood. Fumbling around together has been great for
our relationship.
 &HT;    I do have an agenda _ the time-honored educational one.
Depending on our destination, we might read the ``Tales of King
Arthur'' en route to Wales, or on the way to Belize study the
nocturnal habits of parrot fish (they spin themselves a sleeping
bag from their mouths). This is as much for my benefit as for
Kate's; seeing that she gets the most out of our travels has
prevented me from getting lazy.
 &HT;    But I've tried to take a relaxed approach. If Merlin's
prophecies aren't holding our interest that day, we explore
whatever Kate finds more exciting _ a wax museum, possibly, or a
store that sells China cat figurines.
 &HT;    Here again, Christina Hardyment is my guide. In the course of
the family's travels, she found herself imposing less and less on
her children, learning to ``sit back and follow them'' instead of
trying to lead all the time. They had as much to teach her as she
them, Ms. Hardyment came to understand.
 &HT;    ``Looking at the world through the children's eyes made it look
a lot less jaded and tired and a lot more fun,'' she wrote. That
has been my experience, too.
 &HT;    I'd always admired in passing the smartly dressed Parisian
children clustered around the sailboat pond in the Luxembourg
Gardens, but with Kate for company I was no longer a mere observer.
 &HT;    Being 9, Kate was first to master the subtleties of guiding the
progress of our rented wooden sailboat with a baton, but she
generously showed me how and allowed me a turn. In a city where I
have stored up many favorite memories over many years, the
afternoon my daughter and I lingered by the boat pond tops the
list.
 &HT;    And so I maintain that kids make great traveling companions _
contrary to popular myth, and in defiance of the anticipatory
Schadenfreude that passes for friendly advice. We who can hitch a
ride on our children's curiosity and imagination are the lucky
ones.

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My department at work is in charge of arranging our annual
regional conference, and we don't want to repeat last year's
disaster _ too hot, too many bugs and too many guests at the hotel.
Plus, I know that many of my co-workers would like to bring their
families. Do you know of a resort that can accommodate us in
comfort?
 &HT;     A:  One of the best places I can recommend is the Marriott
Resort &AMP; Golf Club on Marco Island in South Florida. This resort
has mastered the art of having something for everyone.
 &HT;    The resort boasts over 40,000 square feet of meeting space
spread over seven outdoor function areas and three large, versatile
ballrooms.
 &HT;    You can also make use of the in-house production company, Wizard
Studios International, to design events that are suited to your
company's needs. After hours, your co-workers can take advantage of
one of the many lounges and restaurants.
 &HT;    The resort offers daily activities _ from sailing and shelling
excursions to parasailing, kayaking and windsurfing _ that take
advantage of the miles of shimmering white sand beach and the
tranquil blue-green Gulf waters. The 18-hole championship golf
course makes good use of the natural landscape.
 &HT;    Guests can also use the 16-court tennis complex, the health club
and spa options, island bike tours, and the three pools and
whirlpool. For kids, there are daily Kids Korner activities;
ping-pong tables; an arcade; and, on weekends, the ``Dive-In,''
where, instead of sitting in cars, they can watch movies while
floating in the pool.
 &HT;    It's easy to see why the Marco Island Marriott Resort &AMP; Golf
Club has won numerous awards for its full-service meeting and
convention properties as well as being named one of ``America's Top
20 Resorts'' by Conde Nast Traveler. For more information and
reservations, call (800) GET-HERE or (941) 394-2511.
 &HT;     Q:  Can you tell me if the Plaza Hotel in New York City is
really as special and luxurious as people say it is?
 &HT;     A:  Luxurious indulgence is what you'll find at the unsurpassed
Plaza Hotel. The Plaza has delighted young and old with memorable
stays for generations.
 &HT;    Located between Central Park and Fifth Avenue, The Plaza is both
contemporary and chic, yet exudes great charm. Highly attentive
service and attention to detail are hallmarks of this legend.
 &HT;    Rooms and suites are spacious, have exceptional high ceilings
and capture the feeling of old European charm. As an added bonus,
computers are available in all rooms and suites, and a beautiful,
8,000-square-foot spa and workout room are now open.
 &HT;    The Plaza is in a class by itself, and General Manager Gary
Schweikert plans to keep it that way. Room rates vary according to
season. Double rooms range in cost from $275 to $725; suites, $500
to $15,000. For reservations and more information, call (800)
527-4727.
 &HT;     Q:  My best friend and I are looking for a good golf package in
Las Vegas. Have you heard of any lately?
 &HT;     A:  The Golden Nugget, located in the heart of downtown Las
Vegas, is offering an amazing golf package that starts at $183.15
for two people. In addition to the room, the price includes green
fees, golf cart, tee times, bag storage and tax.
 &HT;    The Golden Nugget is ideal for quick-and-easy trips to
outstanding local golf coursesas American Golf's Badlands
Golf Club, Las Vegas National Golf Course, Painted Desert Golf
Course and the Wildhorse Golf Club.
 &HT;    Guests are free to enjoy the amenities that the Golden Nugget, a
recipient of the AAA Four Diamond award, offers. The resort boasts
breathtaking views, first-class rooms and suites, live
entertainment, shopping, several dining options and a luxury spa
and salon. For more information or reservations, call (800)
846-5336.
 &HT;     Q:  I recently completed an extensive family tree and
discovered that I am distantly related to Austrian royalty. As a
result, I will soon be visiting this country to learn more about my
heritage. Do you know of any museums or day tours there that place
an emphasis on Austrian history?
 &HT;     A:  Even better, why don't you discover what it felt like to be
Austrian royalty by spending a few nights in a 12th-century
medieval Austrian castle? The Schloss Matzen bed and breakfast is
located in the Alpbach Valley, just 30 minutes east of Innsbruck.
Here, guests are transported back in time as soon as they set foot
behind the heavy stone walls and into the medieval ambience of the
local antique decor.
 &HT;    The small community of the Alpbach Valley celebrates its local
cuisine, music, festivals and customs, which are sure to give you
plenty of insight into the lives of your Austrian ancestors.
 &HT;    For more information, call Schloss Matzen at (888) 837-0618, or
visit http://www.schlossmatzen.com
 &HT;    This unique hotel _ and others like it _ can be found in the
Spring/Summer 2000 Specialty Travel Index, which costs $10 per year
for two issues. Send orders to info(AT)specialitytravel.com.
 &HT;     Q:  My fiancee and I are looking for an escape from reality. We
want to eat well, pamper ourselves and feel like the world is a
million miles away. Please help us find a luxe hideaway.
 &HT;     A:  The ultraluxe and secluded Little Palm Island is exactly
what you are looking for. Located three miles offshore in the
Florida Keys, this island hideaway is only accessible by boat or
seaplane.
 &HT;    This Relais and Chateaux property is also offering an amazing
couples package through Sept. 30, 2000. The Island Indulgence
package includes four nights/five days accommodations, a welcome
bottle of wine, three gourmet meals daily, one ``hot stone''
massage per person, a daylong snorkel trip, a private sunset
cruise, tax, gratuity and airport transfers. The package is priced
at $4,790 per couple.
 &HT;    The absence of everyday nuisances, such as telephones and
televisions, at Little Palm Island make it perfect for couples who
want to spend quality time together. Whether soaking up some sun on
the beach or relaxing in your bungalow, you are sure to feel
removed from the everyday grind.
 &HT;    Also, don't miss a visit to the full-service spa, featuring
professional therapists and ecologically balanced Pevonia Botanica
products. 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Readers are invited to submit questions to William Tomicki, P.O.
Box 5148, Santa Barbara, Calif. 93150. Although he cannot answer
each query individually, selected questions will be included in his
column. Mr. Tomicki, who logs over 150,000 miles each year, is the
publisher of ENTREE, a travel newsletter.

 (Color slide included.) 
 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    From the Green Mountains of Vermont to the Sonoran Desert of
Arizona, the United States has plenty of vacation destinations for
adventurous travelers. Here's a sampling of trips for early fall.
Prices are per person, based on double occupancy, and land-only
unless otherwise noted.
 &HT;     Butterfield &AMP; Robinson  (70 Bond St., Toronto, Ontario, Canada
M5B 1X3; 800-678-1147; www.butterfield.com) has a ``Smoky Mountains
Getaway Walking'' trip, a five-day adventure that features a stay
at Blackberry Farm, a Relais &AMP; Chateaux property. Walkers also get
to spend the night in a luxury camp, when they're not walking past
the magnolia trees and red maples of the Great Smokies. The
September departure costs $3,695.
 &HT;    For the yachting set, the ``America's Cup Getaway Bike, Walk &AMP;
Sail'' is a five-day trip to Newport, Martha's Vineyard and
Nantucket. This trip combines biking and walking with sailing on
12-meter racing yachts. The September departure is $4,995.
 &HT;     Country Walkers  (P.O. Box 180, Waterbury, Vt. 05676;
800-464-9255; www.countrywalkers.com) has ``Utah: Natural Temples
of Zion and Bryce.'' During this six-day walk, which departs in
September and October, travelers stay in classic canyon lodges.
Equal time is spent exploring the crimson-colored cliffs of Zion
and the limestone formations in Bryce. The cost is $1,879.
 &HT;    The company also offers ``Arizona: Riches of the Sonoran
Desert.'' This seven-day trip visits Ramsey, Madera and Sabino
Canyons, as well as the Chiricahua Mountains. Exotic plant life and
wildlife are highlights of this trip. There are September and
October departures, and the cost is $1,969.
 &HT;     Equitour  (P.O. Box 807, Dubois, Wyo. 82513; 800-545-0019;
www.ridingtours.com) has a seven-day ``Redwood Coast Ride'' along
the coast of California that goes through Jackson State Forest and
includes a ride along 10 Mile Beach. In fact, much of the time is
spent riding on northern California's beaches.
 &HT;    Departures are in September and October, and the cost is $1,795.
This trip is perfect for intermediate riders, who can expect
upwards of five hours a day of riding.
 &HT;    Beginners might enjoy the ``Green Mountain Inn to Inn Ride.''
Timed for participants to enjoy foliage season in September, the
six-day ride is $1,650 and goes through Vermont's lakes region.
Riders stay in period inns and can expect to spend five to six
hours in the saddle daily.
 &HT;     New England Hiking Holidays  (P.O. Box 1648, North Conway, N.H.
03860; 800-869-0949; www.nehikingholidays.com) has a five-day trip
called ``North Carolina: Blue Ridge Mountains'' that follows the
route of the Blue Ridge Parkway. Hikers go through Moses Cone
National Park and have the option of ascending Grandfather
Mountain. There are departures in October, and the cost is $1,175.
 &HT;    ``Virginia: Shenandoah Mountains'' is a five-day hike through
Shenandoah National Park and the Blue Ridge Mountains. Highlights
include ascents of two, 4,000-foot peaks _ Mount Pleasant and Mount
Pompey. The cost is $1,175, and there are departures in October.
 &HT;     The Northwest Passage  (1130 Greenleaf Ave., Wilmette, Ill.
60091; 800-RECREATE; www.nwpassage.com) does international
destinations such as Crete and the North Pole, but it also focuses
on perhaps the most overlooked area in the United States for
adventure travel: the Midwest.
 &HT;    Their ``Isle Royale-Lake Superior'' trip is an eight-day
sea-kayaking voyage. The trip to the island, located 22 miles
offshore, offers what the company says is ``the most realistic
sealike destination for sea kayakers in the Midwest.'' This camping
trip runs in September and costs $825.
 &HT;    The ``Porcupine Mountains-Michigan'' is a four-day
hiking/camping trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The cost
for the September departure is $295.
 &HT;    River Odysseys West (P.O. Box 579, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho 83816;
800-451-6034; www.rowinc.com) offers a large number of western
rafting trips, although most of them will be completed by midsummer
due to water levels.
 &HT;    The exception is the five-day ``Snake Rmidsummerlls Canyon''
trip, which takes rafters through the deepest river gorge in North
America, Hells Canyon. On the border with Oregon and Idaho, the
river offers some of the largest rapids in the Northwest. There are
departures in September, from $995.
 &HT;     VBT  (P.O. Box 711, Bristol, Vt. 05443; 800-245-3868;
www.vbt.com) does the ``Lake Champlain Valley'' of Vermont for six
days in September and October. This is a biking trip, with an
optional half-day of sea kayaking on Lake Champlain, which lies
between the Adironadacks and the Green Mountains.
 &HT;    There are routes for varying abilities and an itinerary that
includes stops at such towns as East Middlebury. The cost is
$1,145.
 &HT;    The ``Purely Acadia'' trip is just that _ six days exploring
Acadia National Park. Most biking is done on the car-less carriage
roads that John D. Rockefeller built throughout the park. But there
are also trips to Swans Island and Little Cranberry Island. The
cost for the September departures is $1,395.
 &HT;     The Wayfarers  (172 Bellevue Ave., Newport, R.I. 02840;
800-249-4620; www.thewayfarers.com) offers a ``New Mexico: Land of
Enchantment'' trip, a six-day walk based in Taos and Santa Fe.
Walkers go to Abiquiu and the home of painter Georgia O'Keefe,
visit the Taos pueblo and wander through Frjoles Canyon. The cost
is $1,695, and there are departures in October.
 &HT;    The Wayfarers also have a ``Coast of Maine'' trip. Moving up the
coast, by van and by foot, travelers visit Damariscotta Mills and
explore the area around Camden and Rockport. The cost for this
September departure is $1,695.

 (Color slides and B&AMP;W map available.) 
 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By JAMES BROOKE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Every summer, after the steel bonds of winter fall away,
Montrealers leap forth for an outdoor season of street festivals,
cafe-hopping, bicycling along canals or simply strolling streets
imbued with the history of a city founded in 1642.
 &HT;    This bubble of Latin culture, the world's second-largest
French-speaking city, after Paris, has drawn Americans since the
days of Benjamin Franklin.
 &HT;    Promoting itself this summer as ``Paris without jet lag,''
Montreal can now throw in ``without the long ride from the
airport.'' All commercial air traffic now goes to Dorval
International Airport, a 15-minute cab ride from downtown, as
opposed to the 40-mile ride from Mirabel, the old airport.
 &HT;    Then there is the money: restaurant checks may look steep, but
subtract a third, because $1 American buys almost $1.50 Canadian.
 &HT;    As Americans reserve Montreal hotel rooms at the fastest clip
since the Expo 67 World's Fair, they will discover an attitude
change here. Montreal is on the economic rebound as investors
finally accept the ``French fact.''
 &HT;    With a huge concentration of college students, Montreal is
churning out a French-speaking middle class. With the French
language more dominant in Montreal than it has been since the
1760s, separatism is on the back burner and Quebecers are
increasingly self-confident and outward looking.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    Fireworks set to music is the theme of the Benson &AMP; Hedges
International Fireworks Competition on 10 nights, which began on
June 18 and ends on July 30, over the old World's Fair grounds on
Ile Ste.-Helene. Among the competitors are Japan, Germany, Italy
and the United States. From 10 p.m. Seats range from $21 to $28 and
can be ordered from (800) 361-4595. Information: (514) 872-6222.
 &HT;    The Montreal Jazz Festival will include 400 concerts, 300 of
them free, largely in and around Place des Arts downtown, from June
29 to July 9. It is dedicated to Louis Armstrong and is expected to
draw 2,000 musicians and an audience of 1.5 million.
 &HT;    Among the performers expected are the trumpet player Arturo
Sandoval, the bassist Dave Holland and the vocalist Ranee Lee.
Information: (888) 515-0515. Schedules and ticket sales at
www.montrealjazzfest.com.
 &HT;    The last weekend of the jazz festival, July 7 to 9, is also the
weekend for Carifiesta, Montreal's Caribbean carnival. Like almost
everything else here, the festival has a French touch, drawing on
the traditions of Guadeloupe, Haiti and Martinique, with blasting
bands to lure 150,000 people into the streets. A parade will be
followed by a free party at the Champ-de-Mars, behind city hall.
Information: (514) 735-2232.
 &HT;    The Afro beat picks up July 13 with Nuits d'Afrique for 10 days,
some 30 concerts and nearly 300 musicians from Africa, the
Caribbean and Black America. Information: (514) 499-9239. The
schedule includes Miriam Makeba on opening night at the Spectrum
nightclub (tickets $35) and Tiken Jah Fakoly, reggae singer from
the Ivory Coast, in one of the free nightly concerts at Place
Emilie-Gamelin.
 &HT;    What's so funny about Montreal? Find out at the Just for Laughs
festival, July 13 to 23. Many of the 1,500 performances in French
and English by stand-up comics and troupes from around the world
will be free on outdoor stages along Rue St.-Denis. Among the
headliners are Tim Allen, Eric Idle and William Shatner. For
information, call (514) 845-3155, or visit www.hahaha.com.
 &HT;    July finishes with the Lesbian and Gay Pride celebration on the
31st. It draws from all over North America, with attendance
expected to hit half a million for the Pride Parade on the last
day, Aug. 6. An outdoor big-band concert is planned for
Emilie-Gamelin Park at 8 p.m. on Aug. 1, and a street fair will
take place at Ste.-Catherine East between Berri and Papineau on
Aug. 5. Information: (514) 285-4011.
 &HT;    Through Oct. 15, the Museum of Fine Arts, 1380 Sherbrooke West,
(514) 285-2000, will display 81 paintings, including Cezannes,
Renoirs and Picassos, on loan from the Musee de l'Orangerie in
Paris through Oct. 15. Open daily 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission $10.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The delights of a Montreal summer require footwork: strolling
centuries-old blocks and streets, inspecting architectural details,
reading historic plaques, window shopping on streets lined with
antiques shops, or sipping an allonge coffee at a sidewalk cafe.
 &HT;    The best neighborhoods for walks are Vieux-Port, the Old Port
section where the city began life 358 years ago; the Rue St.-Denis
restaurant, cafe and shopping streets; and Rue Ste.-Catherine, the
shopping and entertainment district.
 &HT;    For $13.50, the Montreal Museum Pass allows holders to visit 21
museums over two days. A good place to start is just off the docks
in the old port section.
 &HT;    The new Pointe-a-Calliere Montreal Museum of Archaeology and
History, Place Royale at Rue de la Commune, offers visitors a good
background on the city's development, starting with a fast-paced,
Monty Python-style bilingual multimedia show on Montreal's history.
The tower provides a bird's-eye view of Old Montreal and the St.
Lawrence River. Open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Tuesday to Friday, 11 a.m.
to 5 p.m. weekends; (514) 872-9150. Admission $5.75, $2 ages 6 to
12.
 &HT;    If you need a break from the heat (yes, it can happen even in
Montreal), slip into the cool and soothing, robin's-egg-blue
interior of Notre-Dame Basilica, about three blocks up the hill
from the history museum, at 110 Rue Notre-Dame West. This graceful
Gothic Revival church was believed to be the largest religious
edifice in North America when it opened in 1829.
 &HT;    The architect, a New Yorker named James O'Donnell, was so taken
with its soaring, gold-leaf interior and stained-glass windows
depicting the history of Montreal that he converted to Catholicism
in order to be buried there. Admission is $1.35.
 &HT;    Four blocks away, at the corner of Rue St.-Laurent and the
river, Cirque du Soleil, the cultural ambassadors of modern
Montreal, offer their first large-screen film, ``Journey of Man,''
at the IMAX Old Port. Filmed all over the world, it follows a child
as he travels from birth to adulthood. $8.45, seniors and
teen-agers $7. Information: (514) 496-4629, or www.imaxoldport.com.
 &HT;    The Montreal Botanical Garden, 4101 Sherbrooke East, one of the
world's largest, hits full bloom in late June. With 21,000 species
of plant, the gardens sprawl over 30 acres, ranging from formal
European gardens, to a Chinese pavilion in the style of the Ming
Dynasty, to a 16-acre arboretum and 10 exhibition greenhouses.
Admission $6.45, seniors and students $4.75, ages 6 to 17 $3.20;
(514) 872-1400.
 &HT;    After stopping to smell the roses, you may desire more vigorous
activity. There's bicycling along an eight-mile lighted, paved path
from Rene Levesque Park to the Pere Marquette Promenade, a route
that passes by the Lachine Rapids. Bikes can be rented at any of
several kiosks in the Old Port.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    American tourism is expected to surge this summer, so expect
higher seasonal rates. Rooms can be scarce during major festivals.
 &HT;    With 487 spacious rooms, the Holiday Inn Montreal-Midtown, 420
Sherbrooke St. West, (514) 842-6111, fax (514) 842-9381, is a good
bet during the peak season. Many of the rooms have views along
Sherbrooke, Montreal's Fifth Avenue. Doubles are $114 to $150.
 &HT;    For the charm of Old Montreal, the Auberge du Vieux-Port, 97 Rue
de la Commune East, (888) 660-7678, fax (514) 876-8923, is a
late-19th-century stone building converted to a hotel. The 27
neo-classical rooms, in great demand, have brass beds, stone or
brick walls, and large casement windows overlooking the port docks.
Doubles are $129 to $179, including full breakfast.
 &HT;    Budget: At the junction of the busy bar, restaurant and boutique
scene, at the corner of Rue Ste.-Catherine and Rue Crescent, the
Comfort Suites, 1214 Rue Crescent, (514) 878-2711, fax (514)
878-0030, offers 96 simple, comfortable rooms, each with balcony.
Doubles: $80 to $112.
 &HT;    One block to the east, the Novotel, 1180 Rue de la Montagne,
(514) 861-6000, fax (514) 861-0992, offers slightly higher priced
rooms on a street lined with boutiques and restaurants. The 227
rooms have bright, modern decor, and there is a fitness center.
Doubles: $87 to $135.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Ritz-Carlton Montreal, 1228 Sherbrooke West, (514)
842-4212, fax (514) 842-4907, the 88-year-old empress of Montreal's
Golden Mile, has just emerged from a renovation that added luster
to its marble bathrooms, its rooms appointed with antiques, and to
its piano bar and delightful garden restaurant. The
turn-of-the-century ambience melds nicely with two-line phones in
the 229 rooms. Doubles are $288.
 &HT;    The largest of half a dozen inns to open in historic buildings
in old Montreal in recent years, the Auberge Bonaparte, 447
St.-Francois Xavier, (514) 844-1448, fax (514) 844-0272, offers
views of Montreal's historic heart from many of its 30 individually
decorated rooms. On a quiet side street, the Bonaparte has an
excellent restaurant of the same name. Doubles $98 to $132.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    It used to be said that, after language and politics, food was
the favorite topic of conversation in Quebec. But now, judging by
the expanding waistlines of the graying separatist leaders, food
may be winning out .
 &HT;    My introduction to the sensuous culinary delights of Montreal
came last winter when a waitress at Toque instructed me to place a
chunk of warm foie gras on my tongue and feel it dissolve around
the sides. In an unpretentious setting on Montreal's restaurant
row, Toque, 3842 Rue St.-Denis, (514) 499-2084, is near the top of
the city's dining pyramid. Giving Quebecois products a new spin,
the chef, Normand Laprise, serves maple-syrup-glazed quail as an
appetizer, and roasted saddle of lamb with butternut squash and
fiddlehead ferns among the main courses. Dinner for two, with wine,
was $150. Reservations are essential.
 &HT;    Within walking distance of the Sherbrooke Street hotels is an
old favorite for a quiet romantic dinner by the fireplace, Chez la
Mere Michel, 1209 Rue Guy, (514) 934-0473. As flute music warbled,
we had lobster souffle Nantua and tournedos bearnaise. Dinner for
two, with wine, was $142.
 &HT;    In heavily French-speaking East Montreal, Laloux is an elegant
restaurant popular with the business crowd at lunch. It is run by
an expatriate French chef, Andre Besson, and is at 250 Avenue des
Pins East, (514) 287-9127, on a quiet street far from the tourist
flow. Laloux offers veal escalope with dried apricots, almonds,
muscat wine sauce and linguini, or poached red snapper with white
wine, a la mandarine, and crispy vegetables. Dinner for two, with
wine, $68.
 &HT;    An affordable place in the Old Port neighborhood is Stash's
Cafe, 200 St.-Paul West, (514) 845-6611, a Polish restaurant with a
Warsaw counterculture air. Ensconced behind thick stone walls with
views of pedestrian traffic, Stash's offers four-course menus for
$13 to $16.50. Specialities include zurek (a white borscht), wild
boar and strudel.
 &HT;    Pino, 1471 Rue Crescent, (514) 289-1930, with a heavily Italian
menu, is strategically perched on a second-floor corner, with
tables placed by the curving windows for people-watching along Rue
Ste.-Catherine. Calamari with garlic butter, a three-cheese green
pasta and beers came to $36 for two.

 FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES 
 By RYAN J. DONMOYER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It was almost midnight and my girlfriend, Patty, and I were
tiptoeing behind our guide, deep in the bush of Stewart Island, the
smallest and least populated of New Zealand's three principal
islands. So far, we had seen three possums, but I had practically
given up hope of spotting a kiwi, the furry, nocturnal, flightless
bird that has been New Zealand's national symbol for more than a
century.
 &HT;    ``Use your fingers to filter your torch,'' whispered the guide,
Matt Gaze, of Kiwi Wilderness Walks. ``Kiwis cannot tolerate strong
light.''
 &HT;    Then, about 100 feet up the track, there was movement, and our
flashlights shone in unison. A pair of red, evil-looking eyes
beamed back at us. Another possum. ``I guess we should turn back,''
Matt said with a sigh.
 &HT;    My heart sank _ after four trips to New Zealand spent trying to
see in the wild just one of the elusive, charismatic creatures,
another chance to do so was slipping away.
 &HT;    We started heading back through the ferns to the Old Island Hill
Homestead, a former farmhouse where we would stay overnight as part
of our five-night package. Four hours earlier, we had hiked there
after a six-seater Cessna flew us about 25 miles from Riverton on
South Island, where we spent our first night, across Foveaux Strait
to the beach in Mason Bay on Stewart Island.
 &HT;    The homestead is administered by New Zealand's Department of
Conservation and is one of only two lodging sites on Mason Bay, a
three-day walk from Oban in Halfmoon Bay, where all 350 or so of
Stewart's human residents live.
 &HT;    This is kiwi country. There are at least 10 times as many kiwis
as there are people on the 670-square-mile Stewart Island, about
the size of Oahu in Hawaii, and these endangered birds are easiest
to spot on its unpopulated west side, near Mason Bay.
 &HT;    Only 75 years ago, with no natural predators, some 5 million of
the birds roamed New Zealand. Today, because of farming and the
introduction of predators such as cats, dogs and weasel-like
stoats, only about 75,000 of the six varieties of kiwis remain in
pockets around the country.
 &HT;    Their numbers are dwindling by half every 10 years, say
researchers at the Kiwi Recovery Program, a nonprofit venture
sponsored by the Bank of New Zealand, the Department of
Conservation and the Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society. As a
result, despite being the country's mascot, most New Zealanders
have never seen a live kiwi outside of one of the dozens of kiwi
aviaries catering to tourists.
 &HT;    Although we, too, still had not yet seen a kiwi, we were finding
plenty of evidence of them. We encountered a few trekkers who had
spun tales of seeing kiwis feeding on the beach at sunrise or
plodding along the trails in front of them in broad daylight
(unlike the country's other kiwis, the Stewart Island brown kiwi is
frequently active during the day). Matt showed us holes where the
birds had plunged their long, pointy bills into the ground in quest
of worms and insects.
 &HT;    Once, he leaned over to pluck something off the ground. ``Kiwi
feathers,'' he pronounced, handing Patty and me tiny wisps of soft,
brown down.
 &HT;    And then there was the noise _ a repetitive, high-pitched
whistle by the males, and a coarser, raspier answer by the females.
Their calls filled the forest. Unfortunately, to the untrained ear,
they are easily confused with possum.
 &HT;    Suddenly, there was rustling in the bush about 25 feet to our
left. Another false alarm, I thought, as our flashlights swarmed
across the area until I finally saw movement.
 &HT;    ``There!'' I gasped. And the kiwi, a knee-high bundle of dark,
hairlike feathers, stepped into our makeshift spotlight. It lunged
with its long beak, using the nostrils at the end of it to snuffle
through the leaves. An instant later, it was gone.
 &HT;    ``Kill your lights,'' Matt whispered. ``And don't move.''
 &HT;    A moment later, the fern next to his boot shook, and the kiwi
stepped onto the track. My heart flipped. The kiwi glanced at us,
turned and waddled up the trail, its muscular legs supporting a
squat, bristly backside. Then it made an abrupt about-face and
plodded toward us. It sniffed curiously at Matt's boot, made
another about-face, and ran up the track into the dark.
 &HT;    I realized I had been holding my breath, so I exhaled. The whole
experience had lasted less than five minutes, but it had made the
entire trip to New Zealand worthwhile. ``I'm so happy we saw his
little face!'' Patty said.
 &HT;    I was thrilled, too. Seeing a kiwi in the wild had become
something of a life goal for me since becoming obsessed with the
birds 15 years earlier, when I lived in Auckland. I had tried to
book a one-night kiwi-spotting trip on Stewart Island in 1997, but
the tour had been full.
 &HT;    Patty, although this was her first trip to New Zealand, was also
falling in love with the kiwis, and was especially impressed by the
fact that compared with humans, they exhibit opposite sex roles.
 &HT;    Although kiwis live as monogamous pairs, the female is larger
than the male and is the dominant partner; the male tends to have
primary responsibility for incubating the eggs, which weigh up to a
third of the female's body weight. ``Ouch,'' Patty said.
 &HT;    As fascinating as they were, the kiwis were just one example of
the native New Zealand birds we would encounter. Matt had already
pointed out an area where local tribes of Maori (a Polynesian
people who inhabited New Zealand for nearly a millennium before
Europeans discovered it) gathered every year for a ritual harvest
of plump muttonbird. These birds are also known as short-tailed
shearwater, and the Maori have eaten them for hundreds of years.
 &HT;    Just off the coast of Mason Bay, most of the 62 flightless
kakapo parrots known to exist thrive on predator-free Codfish
Island. Stewart Island also is home to wild parakeets, bellbirds,
shags, heron, oystercatchers, large wood pigeons, rare dotterels,
and three species of penguin.
 &HT;    There are also tuis, which resemble priests with their jet-black
feathers and white tufts at their throats, and the cheeky,
flightless weka, which is often mistaken for a kiwi.
 &HT;    A few minutes after spotting our first kiwi we saw another, and
this time we were able to watch eagerly for a good 15 or 20 minutes
before it disappeared into the bush. We were still chattering
excitedly about the two sightings as the forest gave way to a
grassy clearing and the farmhouse where we would spend the night
appeared in the moonlight. It was basically a rustic cabin with no
electricity, an outhouse, and drinking water collected from
rainfall.
 &HT;    In the morning, Matt laid out a spread of muesli, powdered milk
and fruit. He boiled water on a gas camping stove and offered us
tea, which we greedily accepted.
 &HT;    ``Should be a nice day to walk,'' he said. ``And the kiwis are
more vocal where we're going at night.''
 &HT;    It was about nine miles through a swamp on the North-West
Circuit, a rugged 80-mile trail around the northern tip of the
island, to Freshwater Landing, where we would be staying that
night. After breakfast, we hoisted on our packs and set off. We
were joined by Marijka, a Dutch woman now living in New Zealand's
Southland, who had also signed on for Matt's tour. She set a
healthy pace.
 &HT;    Patty and I held back a little, marveling at the sheer
isolation. Stewart Island, known to the Maori as Rakiura, ``Land of
the Glowing Skies,'' really is a different world.
 &HT;    The day before, when the Cessna dropped us off at Mason Bay, our
little party had been the only people on the pristine,
10-mile-long, white sandy beach. When a man and a woman emerged
from the track ahead and began walking toward us, Matt said, ``It's
getting crowded out here.''
 &HT;    The absence of humanity was evident in unexpected ways. As the
terrain changed from grassy swamp to an archway of trees marking
the entrance of a new forest, there was furious fluttering above.
 &HT;    ``The bellbirds aren't too happy with us,'' Matt said. ``We're
trespassing.''
 &HT;    After we reached Freshwater Landing, another sparse
accommodation that we shared with a dozen independent trekkers
spread over two rooms of bunks, Matt prepared a scrumptious dinner
of pasta, sundried tomatoes and mushrooms. Pouring rain prevented
another kiwi-spotting excursion, so we went to bed when the sun
went down.
 &HT;    The next morning, we caught a reserved water taxi from
Freshwater Landing to Milar's Beach, to complete the journey by
kayak with Jo Paine, a guide from the Completely Southern Sky Sea
Kayaks Tour Company. After a few minutes of instruction from Jo
(Patty had never kayaked before), we paddled off into Paterson
Inlet, which has nearly 120 miles of sheltered coastline.
 &HT;    We drifted past oystercatchers, with their black bodies and
long, red bills. We passed several varieties of cranelike shags,
which flew inches above the water, hunting for fish. Before long,
we happened on a yellow-eyed penguin _ considered the world's
rarest _ floating on its back.
 &HT;    Jo took us up the Rakeahua River, where we got one last bit of
calm before the rain. Rain falls on Stewart Island 275 days a year,
according to the guidebooks. Only parts of Chile, Argentina and a
few remote islands off the coast of South Africa and New Zealand
are closer to Antarctica than Stewart Island, and the weather can
change suddenly.
 &HT;    What began as a calm, pleasant day trip quickly became an
adventure, as we paddled into nearly horizontal rain and rapidly
growing swells. By the time we made it to the boathouse in Halfmoon
Bay, we were like a bunch of drenched rats.
 &HT;    Fortunately, our final night on Stewart Island was spent in a
guesthouse called Ngahere. It had a view of Halfmoon Bay, hot
water, a fireplace and clean sheets on a double bed. After our 48
hours in the bush, the place felt luxurious. Over a dinner of bean
salad and the freshest salmon I have ever tasted,we discussed the
birds we had seen over the last few days.
 &HT;    ``Have you ever wondered how the kiwi lost its wings?'' Matt
said. The scientific explanation, he said, is that the kiwi is part
of an order of birds that includes the emu, ostrich and moa, a
giant flightless bird hunted to extinction by the Maori. The kiwi
evolved to be flightless over 30 million years because it had no
natural predators. But, Matt explained, Maori lore tells a
different story.
 &HT;    In the Maori version, the god of the forest, Tanehokahoka,
worried that the bugs were starting to eat the trees to death. He
asked three varieties of birds to live on the forest floor and eat
the bugs, but they all refused.
 &HT;    Finally, the kiwi agreed, even though it was told that it would
lose its wings and never see the light of day again. Tanehokahoka
was angry with the other birds and punished each of them.
 &HT;    Then, the legend goes, Tanehokahoka turned to the kiwi and said:
``You, kiwi, because of your great sacrifice, you will become the
most well-known and most-loved bird of them all.''
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: A LONG HIKE TO THE LAIR OF AN ELUSIVE BIRD  
 GETTING THERE  
 &HT;    My girlfriend and I flew from Los Angeles to Auckland, New
Zealand, on Air New Zealand, (800) 262-1234. Qantas Airways, (800)
227-4500, and United Airlines, (800) 538-2929, also serve Auckland
from Los Angeles.
 &HT;    To get to Stewart Island, we caught an Air New Zealand flight to
Christchurch on South Island, rented a car and drove eight hours to
Riverton. But we could have flown to Invercargill, the country's
southernmost city, about 30 minutes from Riverton.
 &HT;    From Riverton, we flew to Stewart Island in a six-seat plane,
landing at Mason Bay, on the uninhabited side, a flight that was
part of our tour package. It is possible to get to the island's one
township, Oban in Halfmoon Bay, by commercial ferry from Bluff, or
light aircraft from Invercargill on Southern Air, (64-3) 218-9129.
 SEEING THE KIWIS  
 &HT;    We took an organized tour with Kiwi Wilderness Walks, which is
run by Evan Bloomfield at the Riverton Rock Guesthouse, 136
Palmerston St., Riverton, New Zealand, (64-3) 234-8886; fax (64-3)
234-8816; www.riverton.co.nz/html/walks.
 &HT;    Although the peak time for such tours is November through April
(the summer season), they are available all year. The five-night
tour includes air or boat transportation to Mason Bay and three
nights on Stewart Island.
 &HT;    It begins and ends with a night's stay at the comfortable
Riverton Rock Guesthouse on South Island, a restored historic inn
with a half-dozen rooms, including one with an all-scarlet decor.
 &HT;    On Stewart Island, one night is spent at the Old Island Hill
Homestead, a former farmhouse with outside toilets; we spent
another night at Freshwater Landing on the North-West Circuit, but
now the tour goes straight to Oban for two nights. There, we stayed
at a guesthouse called Ngahere.
 &HT;    The kiwi-spotting tours take three to 12 people with each guide.
The price is about $500 a person (based on 2.18 New Zealand dollars
to the American dollar). The cost covers all meals and
transportation and five nights' lodging. The guide cooks during the
trek, featuring fresh fish.
 &HT;    Bravo Adventures in Oban offers a four-hour boat trip to see
kiwis every other evening. It costs about $28 but fills up quickly
and should be booked several weeks ahead at (64-3) 219-1144. A
snack and tea and coffee are served.
 WHERE ELSE TO STAY  
 &HT;    With only about 350 residents, Stewart Island offers few lodging
options. The South Sea Hotel, on Elgin Terrace across from the
wharf, (64-3) 219-1059, is the most modern and comfortable
accommodation for independent travelers. There are 26 rooms,
including 9 ``studios'' with private baths and kitchens. Rates
range from $18 to $36 for a double and $44 for a room with a view
of the bay. The studios are $48.
 &HT;    Another option is Stewart Island Lodge, Post Office Box 5,
Halfmoon Bay, Stewart Island, New Zealand, phone and fax (64-3)
219-1085; www.stewartislandlodge.co.nz. It has five rooms, all with
king beds, bath and electric blankets. There is a dining room and
lounge. Rates start at about $65 a person a night, including
breakfast.
 &HT;    More information on lodging and transportation is available from
the Stewart Island Visitor Center, (64-3) 219-1130.

 (Free to clients of Way to Go!) 
 (FROM THE NEW YORK TIMES) 
 BY ANN BANKS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    It is the nature of armchair travelers to stay put, reading, not
wandering. But sometimes, when the wind is right, a book can send
us on our way.
 &HT;    On a winter's night some years ago in Oxford, England, Christina
Hardyment sat before the fire and read to her daughters from ``The
Wind in the Willows.'' This was their first encounter with Toad,
one of literature's most seductive dream peddlers.
 &HT;    Toad is by nature a traveling animal. He is met ``resting in a
wicker garden chair, with a preoccupied expression on his face and
a large map spread out on his knees.'' Before long, he's expounding
to Ratty and Mole his philosophy of the Life Adventurous:
 &HT;    ``Here today and up and off to somewhere else tomorrow! Travel,
change, interest, excitement! The whole world before you, and a
horizon that's always changing!''
 &HT;    Reading those lines stirred in Ms. Hardyment a Toadlike urge to
fling off the shackles of everyday routine. The next thing, she and
her family had set out in a yellow camper on the journey of a
lifetime, a 4,000-mile quest for the roots of storybook Europe.
They tracked Pinocchio in Tuscany, explored Hans Brinker's Holland,
looked for witches and wolves in German forests, hunted Babar in
Burgundy.
 &HT;    I picked up Ms. Hardyment's 1987 account of their adventures,
``Heidi's Alp,'' in search of a few hours diversion _ and found
myself lured into a world of daring and delightful possibilities.
 &HT;    What ``The Wind in the Willows'' had done for Ms. Hardyment,
``Heidi's Alp'' did for me. Christina Hardyment became my heroine,
an even more inspiring apostle of waywardness than Toad himself.
Toad may have followed the open road, but he didn't take along four
children in his yellow cart.
 &HT;    Not that I necessarily meant to trace Ms. Hardyment's tracks
(for one thing, I was three children short). But her breadth of
vision encouraged me to think about expanding my own family's
horizons.
 &HT;    We'd taken our school-age daughter on vacations _ to the beach,
to Grandma's _ and made the obligatory haj to Disney World. It was
time to consider voyages of discovery, the kind of travel that
challenges coping skills, stretches the imagination and allows for
the possibility of magic.
 &HT;    Our pursuit of the Life Adventurous in the last decade has taken
us to foreign countries and to back country; some trips have meant
tents, sleeping bags and whitewater rapids, others have involved
passports, strange languages and, one storybook winter, Heidi's
Swiss alp (where Kate christened our sleds Schwanly and Barli,
after Heidi's uncle's willful goats).
 &HT;    Sometimes, Kate, my husband, Peter, and I have traveled
together, a compact nuclear family. Often, it's been just Kate and
me. And on one wonderful, intergenerational occasion, my mother
took Kate and me on a driving tour of Wales, where we explored
castles and visited members of the family my grandmother had left
behind when she emigrated. (As an intrepid traveler, my mother was
easily the equal of Christina Hardyment.)
 &HT;    Whatever our destination, we've been budget-minded, given to
picnicking on a riverbank or railroad-station bench. (I don't
consider this a significant compromise, since travel with children
pretty much precludes serious dining experiences anyway.)
 &HT;    Airfare is generally the biggest expense, so I've become expert
at harvesting frequent-flier miles, discount coupons and seasonal
sales. We even volunteer to get bumped in case our flight is
overbooked; twice we've been awarded free tickets that way, and
consider it the equivalent to winning the lottery.
 &HT;    Whenever trip preparations are underway, I expect to hear
graphic warnings against ``the horrors of travel in general and
with children in particular,'' as Ms. Hardyment herself observed.
 &HT;    At first, I found myself internalizing this cautionary chorus.
What if Kate didn't like the food? What if I found unremitting
motherhood hard to take at times? What if the hotel was a dump? _ a
distinct possibility given our budget.
 &HT;    By now, all those things and more have come to pass and we've
survived. (She ate rice; I got grumpy; we changed hotels.) In the
long run, none of it has mattered much, and we've learned to allow
for both ups and downs.
 &HT;    Of course, the effort to negotiate an unfamiliar environment is
inevitably humbling. How do you pitch this tent, anyway? What's the
system in this country for using a pay phone? Will the waiters
bring plain water if you ask? And how do you ask in their language?
Nothing like total ignorance of what's expected to make you feel
frustrated and stupid _ like a kid, in fact.
 &HT;    I like traveling to strange places with Kate because it requires
me to join her on the steep learning curve that is the constant
condition of childhood. Fumbling around together has been great for
our relationship.
 &HT;    I do have an agenda _ the time-honored educational one.
Depending on our destination, we might read the ``Tales of King
Arthur'' en route to Wales, or on the way to Belize study the
nocturnal habits of parrot fish (they spin themselves a sleeping
bag from their mouths). This is as much for my benefit as for
Kate's; seeing that she gets the most out of our travels has
prevented me from getting lazy.
 &HT;    But I've tried to take a relaxed approach. If Merlin's
prophecies aren't holding our interest that day, we explore
whatever Kate finds more exciting _ a wax museum, possibly, or a
store that sells China cat figurines.
 &HT;    Here again, Christina Hardyment is my guide. In the course of
the family's travels, she found herself imposing less and less on
her children, learning to ``sit back and follow them'' instead of
trying to lead all the time. They had as much to teach her as she
them, Ms. Hardyment came to understand.
 &HT;    ``Looking at the world through the children's eyes made it look
a lot less jaded and tired and a lot more fun,'' she wrote. That
has been my experience, too.
 &HT;    I'd always admired in passing the smartly dressed Parisian
children clustered around the sailboat pond in the Luxembourg
Gardens, but with Kate for company I was no longer a mere observer.
 &HT;    Being 9, Kate was first to master the subtleties of guiding the
progress of our rented wooden sailboat with a baton, but she
generously showed me how and allowed me a turn. In a city where I
have stored up many favorite memories over many years, the
afternoon my daughter and I lingered by the boat pond tops the
list.
 &HT;    And so I maintain that kids make great traveling companions _
contrary to popular myth, and in defiance of the anticipatory
Schadenfreude that passes for friendly advice. We who can hitch a
ride on our children's curiosity and imagination are the lucky
ones.

 &HT;    
 By WILLIAM T. TOMICKI 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;     Q:  My department at work is in charge of arranging our annual
regional conference, and we don't want to repeat last year's
disaster _ too hot, too many bugs and too many guests at the hotel.
Plus, I know that many of my co-workers would like to bring their
families. Do you know of a resort that can accommodate us in
comfort?
 &HT;     A:  One of the best places I can recommend is the Marriott
Resort &AMP; Golf Club on Marco Island in South Florida. This resort
has mastered the art of having something for everyone.
 &HT;    The resort boasts over 40,000 square feet of meeting space
spread over seven outdoor function areas and three large, versatile
ballrooms.
 &HT;    You can also make use of the in-house production company, Wizard
Studios International, to design events that are suited to your
company's needs. After hours, your co-workers can take advantage of
one of the many lounges and restaurants.
 &HT;    The resort offers daily activities _ from sailing and shelling
excursions to parasailing, kayaking and windsurfing _ that take
advantage of the miles of shimmering white sand beach and the
tranquil blue-green Gulf waters. The 18-hole championship golf
course makes good use of the natural landscape.
 &HT;    Guests can also use the 16-court tennis complex, the health club
and spa options, island bike tours, and the three pools and
whirlpool. For kids, there are daily Kids Korner activities;
ping-pong tables; an arcade; and, on weekends, the ``Dive-In,''
where, instead of sitting in cars, they can watch movies while
floating in the pool.
 &HT;    It's easy to see why the Marco Island Marriott Resort &AMP; Golf
Club has won numerous awards for its full-service meeting and
convention properties as well as being named one of ``America's Top
20 Resorts'' by Conde Nast Traveler. For more information and
reservations, call (800) GET-HERE or (941) 394-2511.
 &HT;     Q:  Can you tell me if the Plaza Hotel in New York City is
really as special and luxurious as people say it is?
 &HT;     A:  Luxurious indulgence is what you'll find at the unsurpassed
Plaza Hotel. The Plaza has delighted young and old with memorable
stays for generations.
 &HT;    Located between Central Park and Fifth Avenue, The Plaza is both
contemporary and chic, yet exudes great charm. Highly attentive
service and attention to detail are hallmarks of this legend.
 &HT;    Rooms and suites are spacious, have exceptional high ceilings
and capture the feeling of old European charm. As an added bonus,
computers are available in all rooms and suites, and a beautiful,
8,000-square-foot spa and workout room are now open.
 &HT;    The Plaza is in a class by itself, and General Manager Gary
Schweikert plans to keep it that way. Room rates vary according to
season. Double rooms range in cost from $275 to $725; suites, $500
to $15,000. For reservations and more information, call (800)
527-4727.
 &HT;     Q:  My best friend and I are looking for a good golf package in
Las Vegas. Have you heard of any lately?
 &HT;     A:  The Golden Nugget, located in the heart of downtown Las
Vegas, is offering an amazing golf package that starts at $183.15
for two people. In addition to the room, the price includes green
fees, golf cart, tee times, bag storage and tax.
 &HT;    The Golden Nugget is ideal for quick-and-easy trips to
outstanding local golf courses, such as American Golf's Badlands
Golf Club, Las Vegas National Golf Course, Painted Desert Golf
Course and the Wildhorse Golf Club.

 &HT;     Q:  I recently completed an extensive family tree and
discovered that I am distantly related to Austrian royalty. As a
result, I will soon be visiting this country to learn more about my
heritage. Do you know of any museums or day tours there that place
an emphasis on Austrian history?
 &HT;     A:  Even better, why don't you discover what it felt like to be
Austrian royalty by spending a few nights in a 12th-century
medieval Austrian castle? The Schloss Matzen bed and breakfast is
located in the Alpbach Valley, just 30 minutes east of Innsbruck.
Here, guests are transported back in time as soon as they set foot
behind the heavy stone walls and into the medieval ambience of the
local antique decor.
 &HT;    The small community of the Alpbach Valley celebrates its local
cuisine, music, festivals and customs, which are sure to give you
plenty of insight into the lives of your Austrian ancestors.
 &HT;    For more information, call Schloss Matzen at (888) 837-0618, or

 &HT;     Q:  My fiancee and I are looking for an escape from reality. We
want to eat well, pamper ourselves and feel like the world is a
million miles away. Please help us find a luxe hideaway.
 &HT;     A:  The ultraluxe and secluded Little Palm Island is exactly
what you are looking for. Located three miles offshore in the
Florida Keys, this island hideaway is only accessible by boat or
seaplane.

televisions, at Little Palm Island make it perfect for couples who
want to spend quality time together. Whether soaking up some sun on
the beach or relaxing in your bungalow, you are sure to feel
removed from the everyday grind.
 &HT;    Also, don't miss a visit to the full-service spa, featuring
professional therapists and ecologically balanced Pevonia Botanica

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    From the Green Mountains of Vermont to the Sonoran Desert of
Arizona, the United States has plenty of vacation destinations for
adventurous travelers. Here's a sampling of trips for early fall.
Prices are per person, based on double occupancy, and land-only
unless otherwise noted.
 &HT;     Butterfield &AMP; Robinson  (70 Bond St., Toronto, Ontario, Canada
M5B 1X3; 800-678-1147; www.butterfield.com) has a ``Smoky Mountains
Getaway Walking'' trip, a five-day adventure that features a stay
at Blackberry Farm, a Relais &AMP; Chateaux property. Walkers also get
to spend the night in a luxury camp, when they're not walking past
the magnolia trees and red maples of the Great Smokies. The
September departure costs $3,695.
 &HT;    For the yachting set, the ``America's Cup Getaway Bike, Walk &AMP;
Sail'' is a five-day trip to Newport, Martha's Vineyard and
Nantucket. This trip combines biking and walking with sailing on
12-meter racing yachts. The September departure is $4,995.
 &HT;     Country Walkers  (P.O. Box 180, Waterbury, Vt. 05676;
800-464-9255; www.countrywalkers.com) has ``Utah: Natural Temples
of Zion and Bryce.'' During this six-day walk, which departs in
September and October, travelers stay in classic canyon lodges.
Equal time is spent exploring the crimson-colored cliffs of Zion
and the limestone formations in Bryce. The cost is $1,879.
 &HT;    The company also offers ``Arizona: Riches of the Sonoran
Desert.'' This seven-day trip visits Ramsey, Madera and Sabino
Canyons, as well as the Chiricahua Mountains. Exotic plant life and
wildlife are highlights of this trip. There are September and
October departures, and the cost is $1,969.
 &HT;     Equitour  (P.O. Box 807, Dubois, Wyo. 82513; 800-545-0019;
www.ridingtours.com) has a seven-day ``Redwood Coast Ride'' along
the coast of California that goes through Jackson State Forest and
includes a ride along 10 Mile Beach. In fact, much of the time is
spent riding on northern California's beaches.
 &HT;    Departures are in September and October, and the cost is $1,795.
This trip is perfect for intermediate riders, who can expect
upwards of five hours a day of riding.
 &HT;    Beginners might enjoy the ``Green Mountain Inn to Inn Ride.''
Timed for participants to enjoy foliage season in September, the
six-day ride is $1,650 and goes through Vermont's lakes region.
Riders stay in period inns and can expect to spend five to six
hours in the saddle daily.
 &HT;     New England Hiking Holidays  (P.O. Box 1648, North Conway, N.H.
03860; 800-869-0949; www.nehikingholidays.com) has a five-day trip
called ``North Carolina: Blue Ridge Mountains'' that follows the
route of the Blue Ridge Parkway. Hikers go through Moses Cone
National Park and have the option of ascending Grandfather
Mountain. There are departures in October, and the cost is $1,175.
 &HT;    ``Virginia: Shenandoah Mountains'' is a five-day hike through
Shenandoah National Park and the Blue Ridge Mountains. Highlights
include ascents of two, 4,000-foot peaks _ Mount Pleasant and Mount
Pompey. The cost is $1,175, and there are departures in October.
 &HT;     The Northwest Passage  (1130 Greenleaf Ave., Wilmette, Ill.
60091; 800-RECREATE; www.nwpassage.com) does international
destinations such as Crete and the North Pole, but it also focuses
on perhaps the most overlooked area in the United States for
adventure travel: the Midwest.
 &HT;    Their ``Isle Royale-Lake Superior'' trip is an eight-day
sea-kayaking voyage. The trip to the island, located 22 miles
offshore, offers what the company says is ``the most realistic
sealike destination for sea kayakers in the Midwest.'' This camping
trip runs in September and costs $825.
 &HT;    The ``Porcupine Mountains-Michigan'' is a four-day
hiking/camping trip to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The cost
for the September departure is $295.
 &HT;    River Odysseys West (P.O. Box 579, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho 83816;
800-451-6034; www.rowinc.com) offers a large number of western
rafting trips, although most of them will be completed by midsummer
due to water levels.
 &HT;    The exception is the five-day ``Snake Rmidsummerlls Canyon''
trip, which takes rafters through the deepest river gorge in North
America, Hells Canyon. On the border with Oregon and Idaho, the
river offers some of the largest rapids in the Northwest. There are
departures in September, from $995.
 &HT;     VBT  (P.O. Box 711, Bristol, Vt. 05443; 800-245-3868;
www.vbt.com) does the ``Lake Champlain Valley'' of Vermont for six
days in September and October. This is a biking trip, with an
optional half-day of sea kayaking on Lake Champlain, which lies
between the Adironadacks and the Green Mountains.
 &HT;    There are routes for varying abilities and an itinerary that
includes stops at such towns as East Middlebury. The cost is
$1,145.
 &HT;    The ``Purely Acadia'' trip is just that _ six days exploring
Acadia National Park. Most biking is done on the car-less carriage
roads that John D. Rockefeller built throughout the park. But there
are also trips to Swans Island and Little Cranberry Island. The
cost for the September departures is $1,395.
 &HT;     The Wayfarers  (172 Bellevue Ave., Newport, R.I. 02840;
800-249-4620; www.thewayfarers.com) offers a ``New Mexico: Land of
Enchantment'' trip, a six-day walk based in Taos and Santa Fe.
Walkers go to Abiquiu and the home of painter Georgia O'Keefe,
visit the Taos pueblo and wander through Frjoles Canyon. The cost
is $1,695, and there are departures in October.
 &HT;    The Wayfarers also have a ``Coast of Maine'' trip. Moving up the
coast, by van and by foot, travelers visit Damariscotta Mills and
explore the area around Camden and Rockport. The cost for this
September departure is $1,695.

  ATTENTION EDITORS: The 100th anniversary of the birth of Antoine de
Saint-Exupery is June 29. This ``separate-buy'' article can be
purchased _ the cost is not prohibitive _ by contacting one of the
New York Times Syndicate sales representatives listed at the end of
the text.) 
 By STACY SCHIFF
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rarely have an author and a character been so intimately bound
together as Antoine de Saint-Exupery and his Little Prince. They
make for an odd couple: the hulking, balding aviator who preferred
stapling to buttoning his shirts; the dapper little
extraterrestrial with the mop of golden curls and what seems an
extensive wardrobe for someone who hails from an asteroid the size
of a house. Where the Little Prince religiously tends his planet,
his creator was a champion procrastinator. (If the wreckage found
off the coast of Marseille this spring, weeks before
Saint-Exupery's centennial on June 29, proves to be that of his
lost World War II airplane, it will be one of the first occasions
on which he has turned up on time.) The Little Prince is a
determined walker; Saint-Exupery _ the toast of every cabdriver in
Paris _ was allergic to exercise. He had no use for nature. Yet the
two remain tangled together, twin innocents who fell from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always so. Reviewers of 1943 assumed the novel's
narrator _ the downed pilot who befriends the Little Prince and
elicits the story of his travels _ was Saint-Exupery. This was as
much the publisher's doing as anything else; the oddball volume was
advertised everywhere as ``a story of St. Exupery and the desert.''
Inadvertently the author assisted in the conflation; in its April
26, 1943, issue, Time reported that he had ``last fortnight left
the U.S. for active service against the Axis in Africa.'' Weeks
later, after having bent a few rules, and to his immense
satisfaction, he began flying again with his old reconnaissance
squadron. His publisher celebrated with a press release, one that
ended in a postscript: ``Although he is in the general neighborhood
where the Little Prince appeared to him, he has not seen him
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Exupery's friends saw a good deal of the Little Prince,
however. The author waved the book around proudly, boyishly, as if
handing over a kind of personal manifesto. He demanded reader's
reports from those who asked to borrow a precious copy. (The volume
was not published in occupied France, where all of Saint-Exupery
had fallen out of print, and was banned in North Africa.) His
letters are punctuated with versions of the flying figure, soon
grounded and disconsolate, as Saint-Exupery was himself to be,
having clumsily damaged an $80,000 airplane in the middle of a war.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the spring of 1944 did he manage to talk his way back
into active service, in a plane into which he did not fit, that he
could not comfortably fly, communicating with the control tower in
a language he did not speak. Over the next months he knew every
kind of near disaster. He experienced engine trouble and landing
difficulties, he fainted in flight, he was pursued by enemy
aircraft, he battled a fire on board. Any one of his 1944 missions
could have been his last.
</P>
<P>
   On July 31, 1944, he disappeared, under circumstances upon which
has swelled a great grassy knoll of literature. In much the same
fashion as the Little Prince, Saint-Exupery vanished into thin air.
This was enough to assure his legend. (Insofar as he died for his
country, his was also a death that extended the French copyrights
in his work for an additional 30 years.) ``The Little Prince'' read
differently in France in 1945, where it was published after the
liberation, than it had in America in 1943; to the French reader it
amounted to an eerie chronicle of a death foretold. The mystery
surrounding the disappearance has only enhanced the myth. From the
Titanic to the Loch Ness monster, we cannot resist the appeal of
the large object that slips suddenly from view.
</P>
<P>
   Clinching the equation of author and character, beckoning to the
mystic interpreters, is the curious matter of the sunsets.
Saint-Exupery met his end weeks after his 44th birthday. The Little
Prince lives on a planet so small that he is able to watch the sun
set 44 times a day. Case closed for the suicide contingent. There
is only one small problem. The Little Prince indeed witnesses 44
sunsets in the Katherine Woods rendering, as it seems he will
continue to do in Richard Howard's sparkling new translation of the
novel, published this month. But in French the sun fades from the
Little Prince's view as it always has: 43 times.
</P>
<P>
   Books have lives _ ``The Little Prince'' has had at least two,
and on the occasion this week of Saint-Exupery's centenary is about
to enjoy another _ and they have legacies. As J.M. Barrie's massive
oeuvre has been eclipsed by the shadow of Peter Pan, so has
Saint-Exupery dissolved largely into the author of a children's
classic. The volume has been as kind to his royalty account as it
has been detrimental to his reputation; the successful children's
book writer is one of those thankless half-breeds, like the
academic celebrity, the child star.
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Exupery's fall from literary grace begins with ``The
Little Prince'' in his native country, where he is the Norman
Rockwell of letters. His offenses are legion. As one French
apologist has it: ``He manages to eschew Cartesian thinking, to
sidestep the subtlety of our rhetoricians, to rise above our
Talmudic taste for criticism _ in short, to escape all of our
national vices.'' Most maddeningly, Saint-Exupery refuses to
subscribe to schools; he slips through nets. This was, after all, a
writer who won both the Academie Francaise's fiction prize and the
American Booksellers Association's nonfiction prize for ``Wind,
Sand and Stars,'' who got himself condemned as a Vichyite and
banned for singing the praises of a Jew all at once.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is perfect,'' sighs the Little Prince's fox, trading
on his creator's wisdom. Even on a good day the road to immortality
has been as convoluted for Saint-Exupery as was the mortal one. In
1992 the Banque de France resolved to feature an aviator on one of
its new bills. A poll was conducted; France's most celebrated flier
was determined to be Jean Mermoz. Mermoz was a stellar and
unflappable pilot, a better pilot than Saint-Exupery, but he also
happened to have a few unfortunate ideas about fascism. Under a
Socialist administration he hardly qualified as banknote material.
Saint-Exupery profited from his disaster and today graces the
50-franc note by default. Which did not guarantee that his name
would be spelled correctly on the original issue of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Just as each generation embraces its favorite flier, so have we
had several Saint-Exuperys. This is not surprising; for years the
French biography of record was Pierre Chevrier's 1949 ``Antoine de
Saint-Exupery,'' a volume beside which Edmund Morris' ``Dutch''
looks slavishly literal. Pierre Chevrier was none other than Nelly
de Voge, Saint-Exupery's longtime mistress. Dashing into a phone
booth, she emerges as ``un ami'' whenever she needs to enter her
text. Needless to say, Saint-Exupery's wife, Consuelo, is mentioned
only in passing.
</P>
<P>
   Posthumously, Mme. de Saint-Exupery is enjoying her revenge.
Reworked by a critic, her memoirs _ bearing the seductive belly
band ``Le Manuscrit Retrouve de la Femme de Saint-Exupery'' _ have
become a best seller in France. (They were not so much recovered as
finally released by her executor, who _ appropriately for the woman
who advertised herself as the model for the Little Prince's
melodramatic rose _ happened also to be her gardener.)
</P>
<P>
   Consuelo's pages ``topple the statue of our hero, supplying
damning evidence for the prosecution,'' trumpeted L'Express,
although the ``memoir'' reveals very little that is new. A portrait
of marital bliss was not to be expected from the party whom
Saint-Exupery crisply informed, ``If you're not here I can't think,
and if you talk I can't write.'' Two additional volumes devoted to
Consuelo join her own in Parisian bookstores this month. Both take
as their basis the idea that ``The Little Prince'' is the story of
a man's struggle with his marriage, which it is, every bit as much
as it is a volume that read backward reveals that the Lindbergh
baby was acting alone in Roswell.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the other shoes drop slowly. Now we have Consuelo,
but sometime down the road we will have another piece of the story,
the intoxicating love letters Saint-Exupery wrote Nelly de Voge.
(``They will not be published until after you are dead,'' she
informed this biographer, 45 years her junior.) Additional
documents will reframe that publication; the man who expounded so
eloquently on duty was perfectly capable of confessing his love to
two different women on the same afternoon. All the same, a
consistent image emerges. ``Pierre Chevrier'' tells of
Saint-Exupery having forced Benzedrine down her throat so that she
might read his new pages with unflagging attention. What should our
hero do in the course of his first evening with Consuelo but ply
her with sedatives? Small wonder the man has not often been allowed
to venture out with a biographer unchaperoned.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, Saint-Exupery's heirs have sought to protect him from
the indignity of a barnacle-encrusted P-38 rising from the ocean.
Can the myth survive the solution to the riddle of Saint-Exupery's
death? What happens when his fate and the Little Prince's no longer
coincide? Does the book lose its allure, in all the 95 languages in
which it is published? Once again we are on the verge of answering
those questions.
</P>
<P>
   The identity bracelet fished from an inlet off Marseille in 1998
appears to be authentic; the airplane parts currently under
investigation turned up only a mile away. Saint-Exupery may not
slip through the net this time. All the same, the question of how
he went down may never be solved; it is highly improbable that he
was shot from the sky. It seems that the essential will remain
invisible to the eye, and Saint-Exupery will remain as maddeningly,
irresistibly elusive as ever.
</P>
<P>
   For his part the blue-booted Little Prince has never stood so
solidly on this planet. The dolls are in stores already.

&HT;     SHADOWY, RETRO LOOK FOR FALL MAKEUP 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Heads up, girls . . . the '50s have returned. At
least on the face.
</P>
<P>
   Makeup for fall is on the retro side, concentrating on elegantly
groomed and definitively sexy eyebrows, smoked-up eyes and
blood-red lips. Think: The Wicked Queen, Cruella De Vil, Joan
Crawford, Lisa Fossangrieves (photographer Irving Penn's
deliciously haute model wife whose face was the icon of the age).
</P>
<P>
   Yves Saint Laurent's collection is called Snapshot because of
its graphic imagery: squared off nails, the perfect match for the
Copyright Red lips; eyes fringed with dark lashes, lids softly
grayed down and nearly naked; loads of dark mascara.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Klein's look is almost identical to YSL's but far more
pared down. Instead of heavily defined eyes, Calvin's lids are
nearly naked, slicked with very sheer tones of gray-beige and
barely coated with mascara _ only the top lid is lined. Lips are
the lightest of all the fall collections with a mocha and a beige;
however, Calvin's Merlot lipstick is as burgundy as its namesake.
</P>
<P>
   Jean and Jane Ford can always be counted on for an interesting
twist on a current trend. Their retro Fall 2000 color collection is
called Strictly Ballroom, a bounty of deeply satisfying,
outrageously shimmery lip and eye sparkles. Three
industrial-strength lip glosses injected with glimmer finish in
shades of bright red (Work That Skirt), mauve (Count the Beat) and
copper (Dip Me, Don't Drop Me). For eyes, the twins have
resurrected the powdered disco shadows of the '70s with gold
(Jitterbug), cherry burgundy (Swing) and sparkled anthracite
(Hustle). Three words of advice: Practice, practice, practice.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel's fall collection adheres to a silver standard _ that is,
silver sparkle on the eyes with deeply satisfying black lashes,
gemstone-hued lips in tones of burgundy (Pulsar), deep red
(Calypso) and fuchsia (Laser Pink) heated up with a dual compact of
ruby/blush pink gloss. Over all of it: Platinum Face Power which
wreathes the face in a halo of soft, moonstruck light.
</P>
<P>
   The lips have it with MAC's equally graphic Lady Danger
collection. You have a choice of reds in shades so deep, you could
drown in them: Underworld (blackened red), Miss Dish (deep cherry
red), Lady Danger (fiery orange red) and Russian Red (said to be
Madonna's favorite, a deep blue-red). Eyes may be lined with liquid
liner and emphasized with individually applied lashes in shades of
gold and black, but lids are fairly naked and shimmery with Pixel,
a pale, icy silver and Graphito, a gun-metal gray with dark silver
shimmer. If you're particularly gutsy, red around the eyes will not
make you look like a bunny, particularly if it's Flammable, a
glistening crimson. Believe it or not, it'll do wonders for your
eyes and reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Stay tuned for more makeup fashion for fall. New colors are
arriving every day.

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ In a marriage made in goofy name heaven,
Yahoo Inc. has tapped Google Inc. as its primary search engine.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, Google will provide an underlying Web
search engine to Yahoo's Web directory and navigational guide.
Yahoo expects to integrate the services within the next 30 days.
</P>
<P>
   Financial terms of the multiyear agreement, announced Monday,
were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo selected Google because they share our strong consumer
focus,'' said Jeff Mallett, president and chief operating officer
of Yahoo. ``Google has clearly demonstrated its ability to scale
with the rapid growth of the Web, making it a particularly good
match for Yahoo as we continue to expand our global presence. We
are very pleased by this agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo had been using the search engine of Inktomi Corp. for
general Internet search queries. Yahoo officials said Monday they
would continue to use Inktomi for corporate search engine
applications.
</P>
<P>
   From Google's end of the deal, this was a match made three years
ago when the company's founders first met Yahoo co-founder David
Filo.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been wanting to do this deal for a long time,'' Google
chief executive and co-founder Larry Page told a news conference at
the corporate headquarters in Mountain View. ``Filo actually
encouraged us to start this company three years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Google officials also released its new index of Web sites,
containing more than 1 billion site locations.

IMMIGRATION LAW CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tough new US immigration policies have triggered a wave of
deportations that are disproportionately affecting people of color
and refugees from countries whose relations with the United States
have soured, according to immigration activists and attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The legal changes, which are based on two bills passed in 1996,
have made it easier for the US Immigration and Naturalization
Service to deport a broad range of people.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials say they are applying the law fairly, but
activists say cases are piling up that indicate that some races,
and people from unpopular nations, are routinely deported, while
others who commit similar offenses are not vigorously pursued.
</P>
<P>
   There are no definitive statistics. But consider: The number of
deportations in the Boston INS district rose 22 percent between
1996 and 1999. Deportations of Cape Verdeans rose 100 percent, and
of Jamaicans, 66 percent. The percentage of Britons and Russians
deported did not change at all.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the number of deportations to Mexico have tripled,
to 150,000 last year; deportations to Latin American countries have
doubled, to between 3,000 and 4,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, authorities deported 32 people from Ireland and 86
from Russia _ nations that are widely recognized as having large
numbers of undocumented immigrants in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a general lack of evenhandedness'' in the application
of immigration law, ``and it is based on race and on politics,''
said Daniel Kanstroom, director of the Immigration and Asylum
Project at Boston College Law School. A prime example, he said, is
that authorities ``have not sought to target or infiltrate the
Irish as they have the Cape Verdeans. There are clearly as many
illegal Irish.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Lena Deevy, director of Boston's Irish Immigration
Center, which works with diverse groups of immigrants, contends
that how the law is applied ``depends on the political relationship
between the US government and the country of origin. . . . It has
little to do with human rights. `Give me your tired, your poor' is
fine as long as it fits in with what (the leadership of) this
country wants.''
</P>

individuals whose cases illustrate what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   Baptista, 25, came from the West African nation of Cape Verde as
a young boy, had several brushes with the law, and was on his way
to a career as a street thug in Boston until, at the urging of a
priest, he turned himself in, got a job, and started helping other
youths. But today he faces deportation. His offense: A barroom
brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Samadi came to the United States six years ago with the resume
of a hero: prisoner of the fundamentalist Muslim rulers of Iran,
torture victim, freedom fighter, refugee. But she could be thrown
out soon, wearing a very different label. She has been branded a
terrorist because years ago she was a member of the resistance to
Iran's fundamentalist Muslim regime.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Topic. The ethnic Serb served as a guard at a camp
in Bosnia where women and girls were imprisoned and abused for
being Muslim. He committed the same technical offense as Samadi _
not disclosing a military affiliation to the INS. But while Samadi
and Baptista were jailed immediately for their alleged offenses,
Topic continues to live quietly in Everett, more than a year after
his past was revealed.
</P>
<P>
   When Samadi entered the country, she did not disclose on her
immigration forms that she was a member of Iran's National Council
of Resistance. If she had, she almost certainly would still have
been granted asylum, for she did state on the forms that she was
involved in efforts to overthrow the fundamentalists, a goal with
which the US government was sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Samadi became widely known in North America as a human rights
activist. But when she returned to the United States from a trip to
Canada on April 3, she was arrested on charges that she had
obtained asylum fraudulently, by not disclosing her membership in
the Iranian group.
</P>
<P>
   Years after Samadi left the council, and at a time when the
United States was attempting to court purported moderates in Iran's
ruling circles, the State Department declared the council a
terrorist organization. Now it considers Samadi deportable for not
having disclosed her association.
</P>
<P>
   Since her arrest, Samadi has been held in jails in New York,
Georgia, Alabama, and Virginia, often in remote locations where her
attorneys and supporters could not readily contact her.
</P>
<P>
   Her treatment at the hands of immigration authorities contrasts
with that of Topic, the Serb prison camp guard.
</P>
<P>
   Three former prisoners identified Topic as a guard on the basis
of photos taken of him at the door of his home, and the immigration
service promised to investigate. Steven Farquharson, regional
director of the immigration service, said Topic's file had no
indication that he had disclosed his military service.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did not divulge'' such associations to immigration
officers overseas, ``it would be a very serious, major
consideration in revoking his refugee status and resulting in his
removal from the United States,'' Farquharson said. ``If all of
this is verified, this gentleman is going to face the serious
prospect of having his refugee status revoked.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, 16 months after Topic's past was disclosed, he remains
free, while Samadi is shuffled among rural Southern jails and is
denied bond while the case against her is processed.
</P>
<P>
   In response to inquiries about Topic, Farquharson said he
contacted immigration service headquarters and ``asked if they
could give me an update on what was going on and where the
investigation stood,'' but he received no response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I had tried to get a response long before this,'' he
said, ``and I did not get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kraushaar, a spokeswoman at immigration service
headquarters in Washington, first said she would not comment on
details of the cases, then said the reason for the difference in
treatment ``is really very simple. Any member of a known and
recognized terrorist organization is not eligible for admission.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization to which Samadi belonged ``is among those
groups that are recognized by the State Department'' as terrorist,
``so this is a national security issue.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it did not matter whether a refugee was a member of a
group only before that group was listed as terrorist because ``the
law is retroactive.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Constitution bars Congress from passing laws that
penalize behavior that occurred before the law was passed, but the
Supreme Court has ruled that the prohibition does not apply to
civil matters such as immigration cases, and that deportation is
not a punishment under the terms of the Constitution. Those rulings
facilitated deportations of Chinese laborers in the late 19th
century and of alleged communists during the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the targets of the State Department and immigration
service are more often immigrants and refugees from the Middle East
and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Baptista is one of scores of Cape Verdeans targeted for
deportation in recent years, many for serious offenses, but many
others for relatively mild infractions that, under the 1996 laws,
were classified as ``aggravated felonies.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of a priest, the Rev. Filipe Teixeira,
Baptista turned himself in last year and was placed on probation
after, in legal parlance, he ``admitted to sufficient facts''
related to the assault charges against him. The admission was urged
by a lawyer despite Baptista's insistence that he was the victim of
an attack; the attorney subsequently said he did not know that the
admission could subject his client to mandatory deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Baptista got a job, adhered to the terms of his probation, and
began helping Teixeira reach out to other youths in trouble. But,
in February, he was arrested, jailed, and scheduled for deportation
hearings by the immigration service, which said it was acting on
information provided by a law enforcement agency it would not name.
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, Dorchester (Mass.) District Court Judge Sydney
Hanlon allowed Baptista to withdraw his admission, clearing the way
for a trial. If he is found not guilty, the grounds for deportation
will disappear. But it is unclear whether that trial can be
completed before his deportation hearing, which is scheduled for
July 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem to me that justice may not have been done,''
Hanlon said, explaining her reason for allowing the withdrawal.
``It seems justice may not be done in the future, but that is not
the issue before me.''

 ACTIVISTS WORRY ABOUT CRIME'S LURE FOR ANGOLANS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROCKTON, Mass. _ Looking at Eulidio Monteiro, it's hard to tell
where the Cape Verde in him ends and the Angola in him begins.
</P>
<P>
   His face burns caramel, part almond brown from his Cape Verdean
mother, part deep coffee from his Angolan father. His hair doesn't
so much coil as wave, weaving a story of two peoples whose shared
history is evident even worlds away, in a Brockton parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come because Cape Verdeans were here,'' said Monteiro, 22,
who left his parents behind and came to the United States in 1998
from the Angolan capital of Luanda. ``They say, `Come to Brockton,
it's nice.' So, we come.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of miles of African coastline separate the Cape Verde
Islands from Angola. But common culture has long united the former
Portuguese colonies, cemented by a huge migration of Cape Verdeans
to Angola in the 1950s. Now, a growing stream of Angolans, whose
homeland has been ravaged by civil war, has followed Cape Verdeans
to the United States seeking stability.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Boston area _ the largest hub for Cape Verdeans, and
now Angolans, in the United States _ activists in the midst of a
losing battle against Cape Verdean youth violence are driving a
major effort to keep young Angolan men from following some of their
cultural kin into a cycle of crime, prison, and deportation.
</P>
<P>
   The need for prevention was punctuated 11 days ago in Boston,
when five Cape Verdean teenagers allegedly chased down a Dorchester
teenager and one of them, a juvenile, shot him to death. The
shooting capped six months of increasing violence in Dorchester and
Roxbury, as well as Brockton, Randolph, and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   So far, activists say, incidents among Angolans have remained
low, maybe a dozen in the past three years, when the flow of
Angolans to Massachusetts began in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of incidents is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the number to stay small,'' said the Rev. Filipe
Teixeira, an activist whose background is part Angolan and Cape
Verdean. ``But we are already seeing some serious incidents
happening with Angolans, including the aggravated felonies and drug
charges that classify them to be deported.''
</P>
<P>
   Teixeira and other Cape Verdean community leaders as well as
police have stressed that the ongoing violence among Cape Verdeans
involves only a small group of feuding teens.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, six
Angolans were deported for criminal reasons from 1993 to 1997, the
latest years for which figures were available. About 75 Cape
Verdeans were deported in that period.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the INS office in Boston, Paula Grenier, said
it was unclear whether any Angolans were in detention awaiting
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most recent deportations of Angolans, Teixeira said,
was that of Bruno Edison, 21, of Brockton, whose court records show
that he began working as a salesman, then piled up misdemeanors
before being convicted on assault and firearms charges. He was
deported six months ago, according to Teixeira.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much activity going on with Cape Verdeans and guns
in the Brockton area,'' Teixeira said. ``This is where a lot of
Angolans are landing. They get there with no language, no housing,
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   As they gravitate to Cape Verdeans for help with everything from
apartments to home-cooked hot sauce, Angolans are particularly
vulnerable to falling into violence, Teixeira and others say.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new arrivals are men 16 to 30 years old. Almost all
come without their parents and with few language skills, banding
together to rent affordable apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Many are more than familiar with guns, having served in or
narrowly escaped serving in a 30-year-old civil conflict between
guerrilla groups and the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to give these kids support and really watch how they
are mixing with some of these Cape Verdean youth,'' said Herberto
Agostinho, owner of Angolan BBQ in New Bedford. ``We have to make
them aware of the laws in the US, to steer them away from
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Agostinho, 31, of Fairhaven, is an elder of this young
community. He, his wife, Selma Agostinha, and Teixeira founded the
Angolan Association of the USA, which seeks to end war in Angola as
it shepherds Angolan youth who have left war behind. The group of
about 50 began meeting in April.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his restaurant, Agostinho said that helping Angolan
youths is a delicate dance to avoid stereotypes between the two
close cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Agostinho and Teixeira have quietly encouraged Angolans to leave
Brockton and to find housing in New Bedford or other nearby areas.
At a meeting of the association last month, leaders went to pains
to explain how teens should avoid trouble without talking about the
trouble itself.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the conversations about Cape Verdeans and crime, many
Angolans here say, is a longstanding belief that Cape Verdean
culture has tended more toward violence and drug abuse than Angolan
culture _ both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Mendes, 18, an Angolan who lives in New Bedford and works
at Agostinho's restaurant, said he has tried to draw a line between
himself and some Cape Verdean youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are my friends, but some are always in trouble,'' he
said. ``They don't think what they could make by working hard is
enough. They want to make more. People in Angola are different.
Even at home, if you look at Cape Verdeans and Angolans in Portugal
or back home, we have never gone to this violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Monteiro, born of Cape Verdean and Angolan parents, said he
hopes the new association will be a uniting force to galvanize the
Angolan community _ something many say is missing among Cape
Verdeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad,'' he said. ``We hear about Cape Verdeans who
come here and get into drugs. I don't know why. It's a thing I
don't like to think about, because they help us, too.''

WHY ISN'T THE MOON AS VISIBLE IN THE NORTH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why is it that we never see the moon in the north as we do in
other sectors? R.N., Tempe, Ariz. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It is a remarkable fact about our solar system that the Earth
and all the planets move in orbits that lie in almost the same
plane.
</P>
<P>
   The moon in its orbit around the Earth also lies in more or less
the same plane as the one that contains the Earth's orbit about the
sun, and the Earth itself rotates in a plane that is also about the
same.
</P>
<P>
   What all this means is that you could get a pretty good picture
of how everything in the solar system moves by imagining that
everything sits in one plane all the time, as if it were all
happening on a table top.
</P>
<P>
   When you're in the Northern Hemisphere, above the plane, you
sort of look ``down'' on the moon _ it appears to be in the South.
When you're in the Southern Hemisphere, you're below the plane and
you sort of look ``up'' at the moon, and you see it in the Northern
Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is a little more complicated if you're near the
equator, as the plane of the moon's orbit is really tilted by about
5 degrees, so within 5 degrees of latitude of the equator the moon
can appear a little North or South depending on where you are and
when you look.

SUCCESS HASN'T SPOILED BRANDI CHASTAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are times when it gets old, when every Mr. Original from
two blocks over yells ``Hey, Brandi!'' and yanks his shirt over his
head. What she did, she said, was temporary insanity. Brandi
Chastain won the World Cup with a penalty kick and that's how
soccer players celebrate big goals. They pull off their jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened,'' she said, nearly a year after the exuberant
moment that put Chastain on the cover of Time, Newsweek, and Sports
Illustrated. ``I did it. I'm not unhappy I did it. I think it was a
liberating moment for myself. I think, hopefully, it was a
liberating moment for others, male or female.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as if Chastain planned to put herself on center stage
with 40 million people watching. The coaches told her she was
kicking fifth and it happened that her kick was the deciding one.
What if Julie Foudy had been kicking fifth? What if Chastain had
been fourth?
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what I would have done if I had been fourth,'' said
Chastain. ``Maybe something as silly as I did. I don't know. I
don't think you can go back and say, what if I hadn't been? There's
no reason to.''
</P>
<P>
   What if Buzz Schneider hadn't come off early at Lake Placid in
1980 and Mike Eruzione hadn't come over the dasher to beat the
Soviets? Would there still have been a Miracle on Ice? Would
someone else have scored? ``All I know is, I was in the right place
at the right time,'' Eruzione would say. ``And I did the right
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain is the female Eruzione, with one critical difference.
Eruzione never played another hockey game. Chastain is still lacing
up her boots, still playing friendlies against the likes of
Iceland, trying to make it back to Olympus this summer and pick up
another gold medal for the trophy case.
</P>
<P>
   It's all but certain that Chastain will be in Sydney in
September and highly likely that she'll be starting again on the
back line. But with a new coach (former teammate April Heinrichs)
shuffling new young faces in and out of the lineup, nothing is
assumed. Not in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every player needs that motivation to remind them that this is
something that is not a right,'' said Chastain. ``It's a privilege
to be on this team and you have to work hard every day to secure
your position. So it's good to not know whether it's going to be
the same 11 or not. Unknowing is really pushing us hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain has been on the team, off the team, and back on again.
She has been moved from forward to defense. She is 31 and playing
on rebuilt knees. Chastain may be a household name with a couple of
million dollars' worth of endorsements, but if Heinrichs thinks she
can't help the team, she'll be watching the Games on TV, and
Chastain accepts that.
</P>
<P>
   She was on the inaugural Cup-winning team with Heinrichs, but
coach Tony DiCicco left her off the 1995 squad and Chastain watched
her former teammates lose in the semifinals from a sports bar in
Salt Lake City. When some players went on strike later that year
over Olympic bonus money, DiCicco invited Chastain back and she
ended up playing every minute of the Games.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't like Chastain was just another ponytail on last
summer's Cup squad, but for most of the tournament the spotlight
was focused elsewhere: on Mia Hamm, on Michelle Akers, on Briana
Scurry.
</P>
<P>
   And for a few horrifying minutes in the quarterfinal against
Germany, after Chastain crossed wires with Scurry and put the ball
into her own goal, it seemed that she'd be in the sports screwup
pantheon along with Bill Buckner, Wrong Way Riegels, and Roberto de
Vicenzo: Own-Goal Brandi.
</P>
<P>
   So there was a lovely symmetry to it when Chastain walked to the
spot on the floor of the Rose Bowl. ``Hollywood,'' her mates had
dubbed her, always ready for her close-up. She had posed nude for
Gear magazine, bantered with David Letterman. ``Do you want a
kick?'' assistant coach Lauren Gregg asked her, when she was making
out the list. ``Yeah,'' Chastain said. ``Do you think you can make
it?'' ``Yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no way to know that Scurry would block China's third
attempt. No way to know that Chastain would be taking The Kick. And
no time to think about what making it would mean. Chastain simply
teed up the ball, swung her left foot and blasted a shot just
inside the right post that had lunging keeper Gao Hong reaching for
air.
</P>
<P>
   Chastain screamed in delight, ripped off her jersey, swung it
around her head _ and then the next half-dozen months became a
blur.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I slept very much,'' she said. ``I don't think I
ate very much. I think it was a pure adrenaline rush. It was just
working on overdrive.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, everybody wanted a piece of Ms. Sports Bra. Nike and
Volvo and Power Bar signed her to endorsement deals. There were TV
appearances, speaking engagements, an Air Bud movie to shoot. Tiger
Woods wanted to play nine holes with her.
</P>
<P>
   Some teammates admitted to a twinge of envy. ``We were asking,
`Why not me?' '' said Tiffeny Milbrett, who got little more than a
pat on the back for her goal against the Chinese that won the
Olympic gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't as if Chastain planned it that way. The jersey thing
was spontaneous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just the event and the moment and it surprised
people,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   It could have been Foudy, it could have been any of them, and
the Girls of Summer have come to understand that. What they did
together was bigger than any one of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody minds now how much attention Brandi
gets, how much Mia gets, how much I get,'' said Milbrett. ``Now
we're all getting attention as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain just happened to be the woman on the big screen when
the fireworks went off. And maybe it was happy chance that she
doesn't mind being asked . . . and asked . . . and asked about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy meeting new people,'' she said. ``I enjoy having an
opportunity to talk about this great game of soccer. Before, I used
to have to chain them to their chairs so they'd listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Chastain remembers coming home from China after winning the 1991
Cup and finding that most of her countrymen didn't even know
America had a women's team. She remembers NBC not showing the
Olympic gold-medal match four years ago. So if the world is going
to freeze-frame her forever in one celebratory moment, she won't
argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still haven't watched the game from start to finish,''
Brandi Chastain says. ``I haven't had a chance. But I will one of
these days. Probably after the Olympics are over.

   TAKE-BOS  
 UNDATED: ... realize it.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The parting occurred at the dawning of adolescence, and perhaps
it was inevitable. May Fair long ago had noted that her delivery of
identical twins had yielded disparate personalities. Their
schoolwork was the tipoff. Both were brilliant students, but the
methodology of one was foreign to the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``They never did their homework together,'' says May. ``Ronnie's
thinking is that she looks at a picture and absorbs all the
itty-bitty details all around, inside and outside, to find the
solution. Lorrie is more sequential. She absorbs things in logical
order to reach the same conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's why they picked colleges a mere 3,000 miles
apart. Ronnie attended Stanford, graduating with a degree in
biological sciences this month _ a year ahead of schedule despite
taking time off to travel Europe and tour with the under-20 and
under-21 national teams. Lorrie, a communications major, has about
a year to go at the University of North Carolina, which she helped
lead to the NCAA title on the heels of her World Cup crown last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Though they'd started a Twins Club at Los Altos High _ ``We had
seven sets of twins there, or some ridiculous number like that,''
says Ronnie _ the girls had determined they didn't want any part of
being a package deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided early that it was best,'' says Ronnie. ``There are
so many factors that go into choosing a college that I think for us
to say whether or not we were going to the same school or not would
be too much pressure to put on a decision. Both of us said, `If we
pick the same school, we pick the same school; so be it. If we
don't, that's the way it is.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, they already had started leading separate lives. Being
close to one another, they'd decided, didn't mean being glued to
one another. Each had developed a distinctive social circle. ``It
was good,'' says Lorrie. ``We liked to be together, but we also had
different friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorrie's, it turned out, were the more athletically inclined;
her best friend was the daughter of her youth soccer coach. Ronnie
was the more social, according to her mother and brother; Lorrie
remembers her sister associating ``more with girly-girls.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, Greg noticed, was that on weekends when no soccer
practice was scheduled, ``Ronnie would be talking on the phone to
her friends. Lorrie was a soccer machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, divergent pastimes produced a tangible split. In the
eighth grade, one of the twins was chosen for the Western Regional
Olympic Development Program team, the harvest ground for the
national team.
</P>
<P>
   Only Lorrie was picked. Only Lorrie got a trip to France with
the team. Only Lorrie became an alternate, just missing a spot on
the 1996 Atlanta Olympic gold medalists. Only Lorrie made the World
Cup team as a substitute utility player _ and the youngest of the
world champions.
</P>
<P>
   And only Ronnie was left to cope. ``At first, I was really upset
and wanted to quit,'' she says. ``Sometimes I thought I should've
made it. Other times I thought I needed to work on things. Of
course I was jealous _ here she was going to France.''
</P>
<P>
   The envy was short-lived. Ronnie didn't want to go to France
instead of her sister; she wanted to go with her. And that's what
defined the relationship. Ronnie, who has played on age-group
national teams and has earned three caps for international matches
with the senior team, did not begrudge Lorrie an iota of success.
``One thing I have to say about my sister,'' says Ronnie, ``is that
I'm very proud of her.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ronnie was one of the 90,000 witnesses in the Rose Bowl
last year for the Americans' epic shootout victory over China in
the World Cup final. And Brandi Chastain still had all her clothes
on after making the winning kick when Ronnie started dancing around
announcing, ``My sister is a world champion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm still telling people that,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Greg believes that upon reflection, Ronnie ``realized she had
made decisions that didn't allow her to be the best soccer player
she could be. But she didn't regret the decision, because she
thinks she is a more well-rounded person.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the air needed some clearing.
</P>

   The hilltop Mormon church presents a panoramic view of Oakland,
a perfect locale for sightseeing. Or soul-searching.
</P>
<P>
   May Fair was offering her 15-year-old daughters a chance for the
former when she stopped the car in front of the spectacular house
of worship on their way home from the University of California at
Berkeley, where Greg, who is now at Michigan studying to be an
opera singer, was an undergraduate.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a bench, the girls ignored the vista in favor of a
more limited focus: their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   They hadn't spoken in three days. They hadn't necessarily been
angry with one another; they just had nothing to say.
</P>
<P>
   It was Ronnie who initiated this conversation, though the
subject also had been on Lorrie's mind. ``I'm sure if I'd mentioned
it, it would have felt awkward,'' says Lorrie. ``So she said, `I
want to get this off my chest.' ''
</P>
<P>
   There were no revelations for Lorrie. She knew things
occasionally had been tough for Ronnie: ``At school, when I was off
traveling, people would say to her, `I hear your sister's off in
so-and-so,' or `Your sister's better than you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing you can say to that,'' Ronnie realized.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something they could do about it. Or not do about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a talk about everything,'' says Lorrie. ``Ronnie said
this was no reason for us to be upset with each other or not talk
to each other or grow apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they've simply grown.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of this week's visit, Ronnie has called Lorrie
``and threatened to take me out.''
</P>
<P>
   The hostess has definite plans. ``I'll show her what I know of
the city,'' Ronnie says. ``I know some cool places in the North End
and some places in Chinatown where you can get good Chinese food.''
Presumably without struggling to eat it.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they'll discuss their soccer over dinner. Lorrie, who
scored a pair of goals Friday night against Trinidad &AMP; Tobago, is a
veteran of the fast track, and Ronnie still aspires to someday make
the national team, though she believes her game needs some
refinement. April Heinrichs, the first-year US coach, offers
encouragement: ``She's remarkably similar to her sister, very
gifted technically, with a tremendous ability to control the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' Heinrichs adds as if she's read the Fair family
dossier, ``sometimes society and socialization dictate where we end
up. I see (Ronnie) as being a player who, if she applies herself
over the next three or four years, she has all the tools.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Ronnie is subsidizing her soccer by giving
clinics funneled through the Renegades. ``I'm playing soccer and
I'm not broke,'' she says. ``Getting paid for something you love _
that's my definition of success.''
</P>
<P>
   As an intermediate step toward the national team, the first
women's US pro league, the WUSA, is on the horizon next year.
Lorrie hopes to play in it when the time comes, and she expects
Ronnie to try out, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her she'd better,'' says Lorrie.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for the twins to get back together.

A MOVE TO BANISH LATEX PRODUCTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MEGAN SCOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Josephine Pandolfo's illness began three years ago as a slight
rash on her hands, accompanied by chronic sinus headaches. But it
progressively got worse.
</P>
<P>
   There were days when Pandolfo, a dentist, had difficulty
breathing. Her tongue would swell and she couldn't swallow. Then,
she almost lost her life after going into anaphylactic shock, an
often fatal allergic reaction, at Brigham and Women's Hospital in
Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a test confirmed it: Pandolfo had developed a severe
reaction to latex, the rubber that is found in everyday products
from surgical gloves to baby's pacifiers.
</P>
<P>
   Pandolfo is one of an estimated 18 million Americans, or 6
percent of the population, who have latex sensitivity. The allergy
has been responsible for at least 21 deaths nationwide since 1989,
16 as the result of an allergy to the latex in barium enema tips, a
product no longer on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in one of the strongest moves ever taken against latex in
New England, Rhode Island Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse is
calling on hospitals, restaurants and manufacturers to discontinue
using latex gloves. He has written a resolution recommending that
the state health department regulate the use of latex in the
health-care, food-service and day-care industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the big message is to get the word out,'' Whitehouse
said. ``Particularly in the food-service and day-care industries,
there is no need for the (latex) products. It's a little difficult
in health care where the alternatives have to meet the standards of
latex gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitehouse has met with Allegiance Healthcare Corp., a latex
gloves manufacturer, to encourage them to provide more non-latex
products and bring awareness about the allergy to the general
population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a particularly difficult allergy because it's so hard
(for consumers) to find out if latex is in a product or not,'' he
said. ``Therefore, the risk of exposure to latex is very high. You
don't really know if you are going to be exposed.''
</P>
<P>
   The natural, milky substance, made from the rubber tree Hevea
brasiliensis, is used in 40,000 products, including items such as
balloons, diaphragms, condoms, and even mouse pads. Of these 40,000
latex-containing products, 300 are medical items.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the federal government greatly increased the use of
latex in 1987, when new regulations required all health care
workers to wear latex gloves to prevent the spread of the
HIV-virus. That year, Americans used 2 billion pairs of gloves for
medical purposes. Today, the number is estimated to be around 20
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the increase in latex use, the number of people with
an allergy to the natural rubber has dramatically risen. The Food
and Drug Administration reports that between January 1985 and March
1999, there were five deaths from allergies to latex gloves and
2,330 allergic reactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, we see a significant increase (of allergic
reactions) because of the increased use of latex gloves,'' said Jim
Brady, a disability lawyer. Brady has represented more nurses with
latex allergies than any other lawyer in New England. ``I think,
among many people, there's no awareness of the problem with latex
gloves.''
</P>
<P>
   An allergic response generally triggers a poison-ivy-like rash
12 to 36 hours after contact. While this is not life-threatening,
some people may have a reaction to the latex protein itself. A
full-blown allergic response often affects the skin and other
organs, producing hives, swelling, asthma and, in extreme cases,
anaphylactic shock.
</P>
<P>
   Pandolfo has had reactions to food prepared by people wearing
latex gloves, latex powder residue left on a table at the doctor's
office, and, once, to a water glass that was handled by a girl
wearing the gloves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go out to eat anywhere unless I've talked to the chef
first,'' Pandolfo said. ``This is life-threatening.''
</P>
<P>
   When she travels, she telephones the hotel ahead of time to talk
with the chef. She brings her own food on an airplane. And she only
uses self-adhesive stamps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't lick a stamp. I can't lick an envelope,'' she said.
``(Latex) is out there everywhere, and you can just die.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the people who are most at risk are health-care workers.
The American Academy of Family Physicians estimates that between 10
and 17 percent of these workers, which include nurses, dentists and
surgeons, are at risk for latex reactions. Children with spina
bifida, a disabling birth defect, people exposed to products
containing latex, and those who have hay fever or other allergies
are also at risk.
</P>
<P>
   While many hospitals have voluntarily changed to non-latex
products, some health care facilities have been reluctant to
discontinue its use. A majority of restaurants, day-care centers
and beauty salons continue to use latex, unaware that they are
messing with a deadly allergen.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the places that haven't changed over, education hasn't
gotten out to the degree that it needs to,'' said Gail Lenehen,
editor for the Journal of the Emergency Nurses Association. Lenehen
went into anaphlyactic shock three years ago while working in the
emergency room of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. ``They
haven't reached the average nurse, physician or hairstylist.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the National Institute of Occupational Safety and
Health recommended that non-latex gloves be used for all activities
that are not likely to involve contact with infectious materials,
such as food preparation, routine housekeeping and maintenance.
That same year, the Food and Drug Administration established rules
for labeling all medical devices that contain latex.
</P>
<P>
   But still, said Whitehouse, who has been working on this
campaign since January 1999, progress is slow. While some Rhode
Island restaurants have volunteered to change to non-latex on their
own, many are still using the allergenic material.
</P>
<P>
   While there are a number of non-latex products available,
including gloves made of vinyl or polyvinyl chloride, nitrile or
other synthetics, many hospitals are slow to change because of the
additional cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's money,'' Brady said. ``The vinyl gloves are not as cheap
as latex gloves. The latex gloves are very accessible, very easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady said, however, that the health-care industry is under the
false impression that latex gloves are always less expensive. He
said a growing number of non-latex gloves are just as good and
priced competitively with latex.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pro-active actions that need to be taken, which are to
eliminate latex gloves, are very doable, but there is tremendous
reluctance at the facilities,'' said Evelyn Bain, associate
director of occupational safety and health for the Massachusetts
Nurses Association. ``It doesn't make sense not to do it.''

GENETIC CURES: THE BEGINNING OF A NEW SCIENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RONALD ROSENBERG AND RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the announcement that scientists have completed a rough
draft of the human genome, the race to the starting line is over.
</P>
<P>
   Now the post-genomic marathon officially begins cheered on by
high expectations for possible cures to major diseases, new drugs
for treating a host of problems such as depression and hypertension
based on a patients' individual genetic makeup, and new ways to
diagnose illnesses, perhaps even before symptoms arise.
</P>
<P>
   The speed with which these new products and therapies can be
tested and brought to market has just been accelerated, but they
still won't arrive overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche of human genome data being made available now
actually tells researchers relatively little, other than that
nature still has many secrets to reveal.
</P>
<P>
   Like someone who has found all the individual letters contained
in a copy of The Boston Sunday Globe, scientists cannot make sense
of the information until it is arranged in proper order. Merely
sequencing the genetic code does not tell us what all the genes do
or how the cells are formed. Nor does the genome reveal how
diseases begin or how we age. Before genetic drugs can be developed
to attack a specific disease, researchers must understand exactly
how that gene causes the disease in the first place. By
understanding how genes work and studying how they go awry,
scientists expect to develop new medical therapies that attack the
underlying causes of disease vs. many of today's drugs that only
treat the symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   And by offering better treatments than existing medications, the
makers of gene-based drugs expect to command premium prices. Even
when scientists know that a defect in a single gene is responsible
for a disease, such as Huntington's Disease, Duchenne muscular
dystrophy and cystic fibrosis, the complexity of determining how
they are linked to multiple genes scattered among 60,000 to 100,000
genes in the genome has made it difficult to find an effective
medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cystic fibrosis, where you are trying to restore a function
in the body that has been lost turns out to be more difficult than
in diseases where you want to replace something or slow down a
process that is out of control, such as in arthritis,'' said Josh
Boger, founder and chief executive of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.
whose Cambridge, Mass. company has used genomic data to develop
several drugs now in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   Boger and others, however, predict the first series of
gene-targeting drugs will hit the market, in part, because of
discoveries from existing genetic code. These include therapies to
treat cancer, asthma, certain wounds and aging, where certain genes
have been identified as playing key roles in these conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just at the beginning of understanding how widely you
can scan through this information and extract the gold nuggets,''
said Kellie Watson, manager at Feinstein Kean Healthcare, a
Cambridge consulting company for biotech firms.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those chunks are stretches of genomic code linked to
particular diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, cancer tumors and
Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joel F. Habener, director of molecular endocrinology at
Massachusetts General Hospital, has located six genes involved in a
common form of diabetes. He suspects there are many other and
continues his search. Once he finds all the diabetes-related genes
in the genome, he can stop his search with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   This security _ which has never really existed _ is one of the
genome's biggest pluses.
</P>
<P>
   After identifying the genes, population tests will be conducted
to see how the genes mutate to cause diabetes, then on to the
development of drugs that can correct the genetic problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're several years away, maybe five, from bringing a
drug to market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the genome assures that the drugs will be safe. Take
Rezulin, which Habener calls a ``miracle'' diabetes drug. It was
recently taken off the market because several hundred people had
serious reactions to it. This was simply because something in their
genetic makeup clashed with the drug. Having the genome map will
allow tests to be developed to catch such side effects in advance.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, drugs work better on some people because of
their genetic makeup. So, drugs can be tailored to work best with a
particular person's physiology _ so-called designer drugs. Genetic
diagnostics could provide scientific confirmation that one drug
will work better than another, thereby organizating and
accelerating the process of matching drugs for all sorts of disease
with appropriate patients or groups of patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now its pretty much trial and error with drug
efficacy,'' Habener said. ``But it's astonishing how fast this
field is developing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, knowing how individuals react to specific medicines and
what these drugs might do to prevent future illnesses will change
the practice of medicine. Already there are chips the size of
quarters that will be able to screen for 6,000 genetic conditions
in a single person. The chips will eventually hold a person's
entire genetic code and will be able to reveal at the molecular
level whether particular genes are turned on or off.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year a personalized genetic test to predict whether
skin cancer will spread in a person recovering from the disease
will be launched by Millennium Pharmaceuticals Inc. of Cambridge
and Becton Dickinson Co. It is the first of seven cancer diagnostic
tests the two companies plan to develop.
</P>
<P>
   But learning which genetic diseases and defects an individual
faces raises some profound ethical, legal and social concerns.
</P>
<P>
   For example, who protects the privacy of people who submit their
genetic information to scientists and doctors? And, if doctors spot
certain defects or genetic predisposition to diseases through
interpretation of a patient's genetic makeup, will they be
obligated to inform the patients, their families, their employers
or insurance company?
</P>
<P>
   Last year, federal legislation called the Genetic Information
Nondiscrimination in Health Insurance Act was introduced but the
bill has not been acted on.
</P>
<P>
   Medical ethicists have questioned whether health-care providers
should be required to obtain written informed consent before
proceeding with a genetic test. Similarly, should testing
laboratories be required to obtain an assurance that informed
consent has been obtained before providing test services?
</P>
<P>
   There also are fears that employers might disqualify an
individual from certain jobs. Genetic tests can reveal whether a
person is a disease carrier as well as the likelihood of passing on
a genetic condition to their children. The Americans For
Disabilities Act, however, offers some protection from workplace
discrimination for people with genetic predispositions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gene has become more than a piece of information, it has
become a cultural icon, a symbol, almost a magical force,'' George
J. Annas, chairman of the health law department at the Boston
University School of Public Health, stated in his recent book
``Some Choice: Law, Medicine and the Market.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that we accord special status to our genes and
what they reveal,'' he wrote, ``genetic information is uniquely
powerful and uniquely personal and thus merits unique privacy
protection.''

MARS PUZZLE: HOW TO GET TO THAT WATER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prospects for the exploration of Mars got a lot more exciting _
and a lot harder _ with the news last week that there may be liquid
water near the planet's surface.
</P>
<P>
   On both counts _ the renewed urgency of Mars exploration, and
the new challenges that accompany it _ some scientists argue that
it may be time to send humans, not just robots, to explore the red
planet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humans can do a lot more than robots can, let's face it,''
said Jack Farmer, an astrobiologist at Arizona State University.
``Ultimately, I think humans have to go to Mars. It's our nature to
explore.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest questions that an armada of robotic craft
have been sent to Mars for decades to address has now been
answered, at least tentatively: Is there liquid water on Mars
today, and if so, where? But the exciting answers revealed last
week have been both enigmatic and daunting.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 pictures taken by the Mars Global Surveyor have been
found to show clear evidence of recently flowing water down the
steep slopes of craters and canyon walls, but their location and
orientation are so puzzling that it may take scientists some time
to truly understand where the water is coming from and why it flows
where it does.
</P>
<P>
   But, whatever the explanation for why and where water is
present, most scientists agree that it greatly improves the odds of
finding living microorganisms there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There could be life in the subsurface of Mars today, in a way
that we didn't think was possible,'' said Bruce Jakosky, a
planetary scientist at the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The new discovery also poses a daunting challenge for those
planning future missions. The sites that show signs of water,
considered to be the most important locations for future research,
happen to be in some of the most inaccessible and inhospitable
places possible _ on cold, sunless, steep, crumbling slopes that no
existing or planned spacecraft could land on or near.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of scattered sites showing signs of water near the
surface, Jakosky said, ``really says that's where you want to go.
The problem is, these things are not accessible.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Squyres, a planetary scientist at Cornell University,
added, ``Nature has played a nasty trick here. I'd be hard pressed
to imagine a more difficult place'' for spacecraft to visit. ``This
is a massive technical challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists argue that it is a technical challenge that may
be too much for unmanned space missions.
</P>
<P>
   As good as robots may be at giving scientists a planetary
overview, they say, they can't be counted on for the intricate work
of drilling for water in such a harsh environment.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt about the importance of trying to go to the
``wet'' areas of Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists agree that it's clear that Mars has had all of the
ingredients necessary for life _ solar energy, the necessary
chemical building blocks, and now liquid water.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have also known for many years that life began on
Earth as soon as the needed ingredients were present, virtually
within the blink of an eye.
</P>
<P>
   Once life began, it spread wherever conditions were even
remotely favorable. One discovery after another has shown that life
is far hardier, more persistent, and more able to adapt to
seemingly hostile conditions than biologists had ever imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Just last week, for example, a team of Russian scientists
reported finding living microbes in ice miles below the surface of
Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   And so, if life ever did get a toehold on Mars, the new evidence
means that ``there's no reason to think that the life is not still
there,'' Jakosky said.
</P>
<P>
   There's an even more amazing implication to this and the other
recent findings about Mars: Whatever forms of life scientists find
there, if they ever do, could turn out to be our ancestors.
</P>
<P>
   Not in the way the recent movie ``Mission to Mars'' portrayed
it, with intelligent Martians deliberately seeding the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, some scientists suggest that life might actually have
originated on Mars, which cooled earlier and became a possible
abode for life earlier than the Earth in the formation of the solar
system.
</P>
<P>
   Life almost certainly never had a chance to progress beyond the
level of bacteria there, though, because the planet probably cooled
to the point that life could exist only in limited underground
``oases.''
</P>
<P>
   But those bacteria could have hurtled through space inside
meteorites, providing the original forms of terrestrial life from
which everything else on Earth evolved.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for believing that scenario, said Robert Zubrin,
president of the Mars Society, a group that advocates increased
exploration, is that ``despite centuries of investigation, no one
has ever found any free-living life form on Earth simpler than the
bacteria.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, bacteria are so complex biologically that they must have
evolved from simpler forms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believing that bacteria were the first form of life is like
believing the Concorde was the first machine,'' Zubrin said.
</P>
<P>
   Since earlier life forms typically go on living side-by-side
with later forms, it is surprising to scientists that we don't find
any more primitive forms of life today. But that would make sense
if those more primitive forms got their start on Mars, then were
blasted to Earth in rocks lofted into space by an asteroid whose
impact seeded the Earth.
</P>
<P>
   If that theory turns out to be true, scientists may find our
distant ancestors on Mars _ and perhaps the crucial clues to
understand just how life got started.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that meteorites do reach the Earth from Mars is now
well established, and some kinds of bacteria have been shown to be
capable of surviving the rigors of space flight _ high radiation,
years of dormancy and dehydration.
</P>
<P>
   If scientists do travel to Mars someday and find signs of ``not
only bacteria, but pre-bacteria,'' Zubrin said, those could be
``the missing links between life and non-life.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, that could help solve ``one of the deepest mysteries of
science: How life came to be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because that evidence might be located in the rugged,
steeply-sloped terrain, and in many scattered places, some
scientists think finding it might be too far beyond the capability
of any present or near-future robotic missions, and might argue
strongly for the need to send humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a robot on this planet right now that can take
your laundry down to the laundromat, wash it and dry it and bring
it home,'' Zubrin said.
</P>
<P>
   Drilling for water a few hundred feet deep, where signs of
Martian microbial life might be found, would be a relatively normal
task for humans, but ``is a lot more complicated than a trip to the
laundromat,'' he said.

GORE'S REAL PLAN; BUSH'S FAKE ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; WASHINGTON _ Al Gore stands accused of having made a
retirement income proposal almost one month to the day after George
W. Bush is said to have made his, an accusation that will no doubt
weigh heavily on voters four-plus months from now.
</P>
<P>
   Let Gore plead guilty, and then send everyone to the charts to
see how much better off they'll be, if they aren't blessed with
six-figure incomes. As always, a useful way of examining a proposal
is through the principal attack points used by the opposition _ in
Governor Bush's case, three:
</P>
<P>
   1. Gore's proposal to create individual investment accounts as a
supplement to, not a partial replacement of, Social Security, does
nothing to get Social Security through its lean years of fewer
workers and more retired beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposal is actually made feasible by his much earlier
proposals and commitments about the budget surplus and Social
Security itself, ideas that resemble those advanced during the
Republican primary season by John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, you can keep Social Security solvent and avoid
slashing the benefits structure if you do three things: Put
maintaining an operating budget surplus at the top of your priority
list; don't blow the non-Social Security budget surplus on income
tax cuts that slash the top rates on the highest incomes; don't use
the surplus within the Social Security system for any purpose other
than shoring up that system as we know it; and above all don't
touch it to fund the establishment of investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   It you avoid those Bush goofs, non-Social Security deficits
cannot eat up the Social Security surpluses as they did during the
1980s and nearly all of the 1990s; and all of the Social Security
surpluses will accumulate untouched. You can then give the system
an added boost by dedicating to it the ridiculous sums spent from
the general fund to pay interest on a national debt that could be
eliminated in a dozen years.
</P>
<P>
   That has immense implications for Social Security, all positive.
As things stand, demographic pressures are projected to collapse
the system in 2037. With non-Bush fiscal responsibility, soundness
extends past midcentury, at which point most baby boomers will be
pushing up daisies.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, if you take the trillion or so out of Social
Security it would take to set up the investment accounts, you make
the day of solvency reckoning and benefits cuts inescapable as well
as hasten it by a good 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   2. Gore's proposal would force lower-income workers to ante up
their own scarce dollars to get the three-for-one government match
for his accounts. Because Bush wants to shift some of existing
Social Security revenue, the up-front cost to people with modest
incomes would be zero.
</P>
<P>
   Partly right, mostly wrong. For up to $30,000 in income, each
individual or each spouse in a couple could ante up $250 a year in
order to get the full match in the form of a refundable tax credit.
After that there would be a sliding scale, with a cutoff at
$100,000. It is not unreasonable to imagine workers flocking to an
opportunity to accumulate a nest egg for retirement that would be
in addition to untouched Social Security income.
</P>
<P>
   In a study by the Century Foundation, a couple making $30,000
annually and saving $10 a week in a conservative fund and getting
the full match, could accumulate more than $400,000 over 35 years
on top of the $15,877 Social Security would provide. The great
canard in this ``debate'' is that Gore's proposal should be
compared to ``the Bush plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Nice idea, except for one problem: There is no Bush plan. It's
amazing how a false notion can be spread by repetition, but that's
what the governor has done. To date, he has uttered not one
noteworthy syllable beyond the notion of ``individually controlled,
voluntary accounts.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush won't say what amount should be taken out of Social
Security revenue to fund the accounts; he won't say what the
accounts will cost to administer or how he would make up the huge
shortfall in the revenue that is used to pay current benefits, or
what the age cut-off is for the ``near-retirees'' he would exempt
from benefits cuts, or what the extent of benefits cuts would be
for everyone not exempted. And he won't say what the extent of
benefits cuts would be for those who choose to have investment
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that getting specific as Gore did would expose the
truth: Robbing Peter (current revenues) to pay Paul (investment
accounts) would produce lower, net retirement income for people of
average means because of the cuts in future Social Security
benefits, and it would cut Social Security benefits for a huge
chunk of the baby boom generation who would have no time to enjoy
the cash earned from investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   3. The Gore proposal is an attempt to establish another federal
entitlement program to be funded by income taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Absolutely right. This bit of conservative cant excites the
ideologically fervent and no one else. Gore is indeed proposing a
means of increasing national savings, and promoting wealth, outside
the Social Security system for any worker who chooses to take
advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   For good measure, he is also proposing that access to affordable
prescription drugs be made an automatic part of Medicare for
everyone. These are new entitlements adding to our system of social
insurance, and can happen as long as precious resources aren't
diverted from Social Security revenue and from general revenue by
slashing income tax rates on the highest incomes.
</P>
<P>
   There is now a full Gore proposal. Let's see if Bush, the real
Man With No Plan, dares counter.

METALLICA, ON HIATUS, COULDN'T PASS UP THE CALL OF THE ROAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The summer is here and Metallica _ the world's most popular and
progressive-minded heavy metal band _ was supposed to be on
vacation, part of a yearlong plan to Not Be Rock Stars and, then,
eventually, work up some new material come 2001.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't quite work out that way. Instead, Metallica headlines
a multiband bill that includes Korn and Kid Rock, called the
``Summer Sanitarium'' tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured out the difference between a year on and a year off
is that when you're off they come to you versus you having to go to
them,'' says drummer and de facto band spokesman Lars Ulrich.
``Whoever they may be. So, we're sitting there in March and we get
a phone call from somebody who was very interested in putting
Metallica out on the road for a couple of weeks this summer.
Initially, we weren't all that keen on it, but we sat down and
realized that in some way the essence of this band is going out and
playing live, sweating, acting, all that stuff. And what appealed
to us was to go out and play a short run of dates. The days of
going on the road for four years at a time are not that appealing
anymore.'' (This tour runs just three weeks, and all shows are
outdoor events _ some at stadiums, some at racetracks.)
</P>
<P>
   The guys in Metallica _ singer-guitarist James Hetfield,
guitarist Kirk Hammett, bassist Jason Newsted and Ulrich _
discussed what bands they should bring along and opted, says
Ulrich, ``for people that we care about, have respect for, and find
musically intriguing. It wasn't so much about `Let's put this great
big package together.' It was more about `We're going on the road,
and let's see who wants to join us.' Then, all of a sudden, you get
the two biggest other rock entities, Korn and Kid Rock, who want to
come along for the fun, and all of a sudden it became a different
thing. Which is cool because we haven't really done this thing for
a while.'' Last time: A tour with Guns N' Roses (remember them?)
that hit Foxborough in September of 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once in a while, you have to step up to this level,''
continues Ulrich. ``I think the buzz on this thing is enormous.
Without putting too much of a `selling hat' on, this really is an
opportunity, if not of a lifetime, then at least to see three or
four of the biggest bands in the country all play together.'' Note:
This tour needs no promotional help. It's sold out. And Metallica
has had a big airplay hit with ``I Disappear,'' from the ``Mission:
Impossible 2'' soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the great thing about being in a band like Metallica,''
Ulrich says of the 18-year-old San Francisco-based band. ``We can
go from playing stadiums to arenas to clubs to your neighbor's lawn
all in the space of a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Another buzz has involved Metallica's stand against Napster,
which enables people to easily download music from the Internet for
free. ``I am sort of surprised the way this whole thing blew up
over the past eight weeks,'' Ulrich says, adding that a supposed
``backlash'' toward the band, the most vocal of many Napster
critics, hasn't occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The group has had but two personnel changes over the years: They
sacked guitarist Dave Mustaine, who went on to form Megadeth, early
in the game. And Newsted replaced founding bassist-writer Cliff
Burton, who died in a van crash in September 1986. The band
snatched up Newsted from the group Flotsam and Jetsam.
</P>
<P>
   The show will, as usual, feature some pyrotechnics. One of the
highlights of a Metallica show has been a ferocious strobe-lit and
smoke-filled rendition of ``One,'' the antiwar song based on Dalton
Trumbo's book. ``People know when they see Metallica they're going
to get their money's worth,'' says Ulrich. ``You know you'll get
something visually to complement what we're doing _ without it
being crass and without it taking away from what we're doing.
There's not going be landings of a space shuttle inside Foxboro
Stadium or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Metallica is not a band for the meek. And neither are the others
on the bill, which includes Powerman 5000 and System of a Down.
Might it get rough out in the crowd? ``I guess it could,'' says
Ulrich, ``but it can get rough at political rallies. It gets rough
outside abortion clinics. Anytime you put 50,000 people together
and you turn the temperature up to 90, you have the potential for _
whatever. But I think it's unfair to just throw that in the
direction of `That only happens at a Metallica-Korn show.' ''
</P>
<P>
   After the tour ends, Ulrich says the band members will chill _
Hetfield may hunt in Argentina, Ulrich plans to take his son to the
park in Santa Barbara a lot _ and reconvene in January ``to get
back to ultimately doing what this is really all about, which is
creating and formulating new music and new ideas.'' On their
downtime, Ulrich says the band members don't socialize much,
although he and his kid did participate in an Easter egg hunt at
the Hetfield home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of us still being together is the fact that we all give
each other some space,'' says Ulrich. ``If we didn't, I think this
band would have collapsed quite awhile ago.'' And whatever tension
is there within the band, Ulrich says, tends to benefit the music.
</P>
<P>
   Metallica can be a serious band _ it tackles knotty subjects,
both personal and political. It recorded ``S &AMP; M,'' a tremendous
live album last year, with accompaniment by the San Francisco
Orchestra. Still, the band members know about living it up and
pushing the extreme, onstage and off. It nicknamed itself
Alcoholica in the early days, but Ulrich says, ``as opposed to your
Boston boys up there (Aerosmith) we were just fortunate enough to
never have personalities that went too far. We never had addictive
personalities to the point it affected what else we were doing.
It's all about balance. You know what your limits are and you find
an awareness and understanding of those and you're OK. . . .
There's nobody here that goes to AA meetings or anything yet. We
still have our moments. We can still hang in there with some of
these younger kids.''

UNPOLLUTED HIP-HOP A REFRESHING NEW RAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With their back-in-the-day precision scratching and classic
rhymescapes recalling such rap luminaries as A Tribe Called Quest,
EPMD, De La Soul, and Cold Crush Brothers, it's tempting to call
Jurassic 5 and Dilated Peoples old-school hip-hop.
</P>
<P>
   And many already have. The Source calls Jurassic 5 an
``old-school styled hip-hop group,'' while the Miami Herald noted
that even the cover art _ a Los Angeles subway station _ for
Dilated Peoples' major-label debut, ``The Platform,'' ``evokes a
New York rap album from a previous decade.'' Certainly, both ``The
Platform'' and Jurassic 5's ``Quality Control'' are reminiscent of
sounds that might have spilled from a boombox in the late 1980s and
early 1990s, when hip-hop had moved from novelty to the new Sound
of Young America.
</P>
<P>
   The old-school tag immediately places them in the lofty company
of The Roots, Fugees (will Wyclef, Lauryn Hill, and Pras ever make
another record together?), Common, Mos Def, and the Black Eyed
Peas. But I've never much cared for the label, which makes such
groups seem more like imitators instead of innovators. Whether
intended or not, it implies hip-hop groups like Dilated Peoples
(DP) and Jurassic 5 (J5) are just throwbacks repackaging history
with no sense of the present or flava for the future.
</P>
<P>
   It's an undermining distinction that all but says ``This is your
grandfather's hip-hop,'' as pristine and quaint as a parlor game _
and it ignores the fact that DP and J5 have produced two of the
best hip-hop CDs of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, you won't find either group on magazine covers or
see their videos in heavy rotation. They won't be chatting with
Carson Daly on MTV's ``Total Request Live,'' and you won't hear
kids from Boston to Berkeley sprouting such tunes as DP's ``Ear
Drums Pop,'' or J5's ``Dop Woo.'' And while both albums have been
available for several weeks and have received enthusiastic reviews,
they haven't made much of a splash on the charts yet.
</P>
<P>
   That may be because of what DP and J5 are not _ namely, members
of the fool-school of hip-hop where rappers waste their breath and
our time talking about fast cars and even faster women, or spinning
nonsense about the ice dangling from their skinny necks, and the
gold and platinum in their ragged mouths.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do these groups have anything to do with the increasingly
cruel-school of hip-hop where murder, misogyny, and mayhem rule.
They don't subscribe to the brutality that mars way too many rap
albums, where rappers pathetically boost their manhood and record
sales by dogging women, boy bands, and gay folks.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they weave rhymes that incorporate such disparate
images as the Harlem Renaissance and cultural figures like David
Lynch and Randy Newman. These are CDs for hip-hop heads who refuse
to acquiesce to the incessant pollution of their music by those who
see only dollar signs in controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Both DP _ DJ Babu and rappers Rakaa and Evidence _ and J5 _ DJs
Nu-Mark and Cut Chemist, and rap masters Akil, Zaakir, Marc 7even,
and Chali 2na (yes, J5 has six members) _ hail from Los Angeles,
and have been underground heroes of the West Coast hip-hop scene
for years. Like fellow Left Coast rappers, the Pharcyde, DP and J5
steer clear of all those hometown cliches about guns, hos, 40s,
low-rider Chevys. Instead of old-school _ and what could be older
at this point than spewing all that mess about bullets and blunts _
both groups talk about the state of the world in a way that is
sparkling, fresh, and new, quite unlike anything else in hip-hop
these days.
</P>
<P>
   On ``Doo Wop,'' the hip-wiggling first cut off ``Quality
Control,'' J5 lets the world know what they are _ and aren't _ all
about:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A lot of these kids think that commercial
</P>
<P>
   Is rocking fly suits and jewelry
</P>
<P>
   But we can rock shows with no rehearsal
</P>
<P>
   With the rebels of rhythm and unity
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(poetry style) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's a declaration that could apply to both DP and J5, who have
the talent, honesty, and savvy to continue to forge hopeful, smart,
positive directions in rap. Frankly, that's not old-school at all _
that's true-school hip-hop.

GIVE IT UP FOR YOUR RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is June 27, the sixth day of summer, and the
baseball season in Boston is already over. The Red Sox are not
going to the playoffs. If you want to see a real postseason team
around here, you'll have to wait for Rick Pitino's young and
exciting Celtics to begin their season in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Why did it take me so long to figure this out?
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are clearly the worst team in the American League. They
have only 91 games remaining, and I don't know if that's enough
time to make up the massive 2 1/2-game gap that separates them from
the first-place Toronto Blue Jays. Excuse me. The
(itals)mighty(unitals) Toronto Blue Jays.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I lived in Toronto so I could see the Jays play every
day. Not only do they play well, they play in a lovely,
retractable-roof stadium that looks as if it is related to the Mir
Space Station. The place is carpeted with lush artificial turf.
It's paradise. The sorry Sox play in an antiquated, 88-year-old
park. It has a manual scoreboard, natural grass, a towering green
wall in left, and, on clear nights, views of MIT and Beacon Hill.
Isn't that terrible? That's fitting, because the Sox are terrible,
too.
</P>
<P>
   Since May 1, the Sox have lost 12 games by one run. They have
played 50 games in that time, so that means they are currently in a
rut in which they lose by a run every four days. They have won two
one-run games since the first of May. If they had come up with a
single in half of those 12 one-run losses, they would be sitting
atop the AL East this morning. They aren't. It should be obvious,
then, that Dan Duquette has done a poor job of constructing this
team.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette claims he went to Amherst College, but there are some
alums there who swear he is behaving like one of the Ephs of hated
rival Williams. Do you realize that Duquette traded Carl Pavano and
Tony Armas Jr. for Pedro Martinez? What an awful deal for the Sox!
Pavano and Armas have combined for 142 innings and 10 wins.
Martinez has thrown 106 innings and produced nine wins. In the last
couple weeks, his ERA has soared from 0.99 to 1.44.
</P>
<P>
   The guy is a 21st century Teddy Higuera. You remember Higuera,
the talented Brewers pitcher who was always hurt. Martinez is the
same way. He's overrated.
</P>
<P>
   He has a sore oblique muscle now and has given up a total of
nine home runs this season, six in his last two starts. He gave up
26 homers in 1998, when he had an ulcerlike condition; he won 19
games that year. He had a sore back in October, barely held the
Cleveland Indians scoreless and hitless in six innings of playoff
relief, and baffled the Yankees in Game 3 of the American League
Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   (If the guy were really as good as everyone says, why did he
have to pitch in relief?)
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Martinez is hurt again should prove that he is too
small to have a long career. He is only 5 feet 11 inches and 175
pounds. His slight build is directly related to his current
problem. And don't tell me that a big man _ 6-4, 205-pound pitcher
Steve Avery _ was once troubled by the same injury; that
information contradicts my Martinez-is-too-small harangue.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Dr. Timothy Kremchek said that common remedies for sore
side muscles include stretching and rest. Kremchek is the team
doctor for the Cincinnati Reds, one of Avery's former employers.
Stretching and rest doesn't sound as scary as, say, Tommy John
surgery. But do you want to trust this Kremchek character? I mean,
he's only an orthopedic surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez insists that he is not hurt. When the oblique muscle is
sore, twisting and turning, which are the staples of a pitcher's
delivery, can become painful. Symptoms are a loss of velocity and
control.
</P>
<P>
   But on Sunday, Martinez suggested that some folks have become
entangled in overanalysis. Today, it is not unusual when someone
hits a home run. Baseballs stripe stadium skies like moonlets.
Martinez happened to give up three moonlets Sunday in Toronto,
including one that tied the game.
</P>
<P>
   You ever see John Wasdin do that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad that I gave up those five runs, so you don't think
I'm a robot,'' Martinez said Sunday. ``It's almost relaxing for me,
so you think I am normal.''
</P>
<P>
   He is normal. And it is completely miserable in New England.
Forget about the playoffs. Forget about the street festival
atmosphere in Kenmore Square. Forget about the bunting lining the
ancient walls of Fenway. The Sox won't be playing in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   They are too weak. Nomar Garciaparra could hit .370 and Carl
Everett could hit 40 homers. Pedro Martinez could miss a start and
still have his win total in the high teens. Ramon Martinez could
win 14 games and Derek Lowe could save 35 games. Jose Offerman and
Troy O'Leary and Brian Daubach could remember how to hit again.
</P>
<P>
   It won't be enough.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays are too good. The Yankees appear to be
unstoppable. In the National League, the Atlanta Braves are
nonpareil. Their closer, John Rocker, is a compassionate man known
for speaking out on injustice. When he rides the No. 7 train in New
York, he doesn't discriminate. He also likes Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Other cities have fun. There is no fun here. It's not the Fourth
of July and the season is done. Do you know how hard it is to make
up 2 1/2 games? It could take an entire week. Maybe even two.

RENOWNED ART DEALER FEIGEN RELISHES BAD-BOY IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``There's so much money out there,'' Richard Feigen
says, ``and there are very few objects.'' As one of the world's
foremost dealers in Old Master painters and drawings, few people
are in a better position to know either fact than Feigen is.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Milken thought highly enough of him to propose a $200
million junk bond offering in the mid-'80s to finance his operation
(Feigen declined). Works sold by his firm, Richard L. Feigen &AMP; Co.,
hang in 106 museums, and among his private clients is the financier
Saul Steinberg, who is currently selling 60 works in his
collection, worth an estimated $52 million, through Feigen
(pronounced FIE-ghen).
</P>
<P>
   ``He certainly cuts a figure in the New York and international
art world, as great a figure as anyone,'' says Ivan Gaskell,
Margaret S. Winthrop curator of the department of paintings,
sculpture, and decorative arts at Harvard's Fogg Art Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Feigen also cuts a figure in the world of transatlantic
aviation, and that fact (or, rather, what underlies it: a sense of
command and unwillingness to take no for an answer) helps explain
his singular status _ part grandee, part bad boy _ in the upper
reaches of the art world.
</P>
<P>
   This fact comes to light while Feigen's sitting in his office
(oak paneling, inlaid floor, Turkish carpet, floor-to-ceiling
bookcases with oversized shelf space to accommodate his many art
books _ and, just so no one confuses it with a Regency gentleman's
library, an iMac and espresso machine, too), which sits atop the
chateau-style townhouse on the Upper East Side where his gallery is
located. Feigen's delivering outrageous opinions and scandalous
stories: both the on-the-record kind to be found in his new book,
``Tales From the Art Crypt,'' and some off-the-record ones only
marginally more outrageous and scandalous.
</P>
<P>
   An assistant pokes her head in to ask about getting a painting
to a client. Its size means shipping might be a problem. Feigen
knows what to do. Find a big-enough case, he tells her. ``Bring me
the case, put it in, then I will tell you if you can bully it onto
an airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   He uses the verb so matter-of-factly a visitor almost laughs.
Presumably Feigen has bullied a few pictures onto planes in his
time?
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I had a great early Italian painting, worth $8.5 million.
I knew I'd have a problem getting it on the plane in Paris, so I
took the Concorde. Although the Concorde is a small airplane, the
crew is very attentive to passengers. So I figured I'd be better
off, talking this on, than with a bigger plane. Well, it did work.
But the painting wouldn't fit _ literally wouldn't fit _ in the
cabin, so the pilot took it up in the cockpit.''
</P>
<P>
   Feigen turns 70 in August, but it doesn't show. ``Very
dynamic,'' is how he's described by Jack Kilgore, the president of
Jack Kilgore &AMP; Co., a New York gallery specializing in Dutch and
Flemish Old Masters. ``There's no one like him. There's a certain
kind of charisma he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Kilgore, who used to work for Feigen, recalls the time his
then-boss ``had a director and a curator in his office _ from the
Kimbell and Met, I think _ looking at a painting by Claude Lorrain,
and there was Richard screaming at his Porsche mechanic over the
phone. They were listening to this and would start to leave, and
he'd motion for them to stay. It was very funny. He's always doing
two or three things at the same time. You watch it and think, `How
can he do that?' But he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Feigen has craggy-handsome looks somewhere between those of
Charlton Heston and Elizabeth Taylor's onetime husband, US Sen.
John Warner. Neither the Hollywood nor Washington reference is
gratuitous. Feigen was in a movie (Michael Douglas outbids him for
a $2 million painting in Oliver Stone's ``Wall Street'') and he has
family on Capitol Hill (Sen. Carl Levin and Rep. Sander Levin, the
Michigan Democrats, are his cousins).
</P>
<P>
   Politics comes naturally to Feigen. He worked behind the scenes
to get Jane Alexander appointed head of the National Endowment for
the Arts, in 1993, and was active in the campaigns of John Lindsay,
Eugene McCarthy, and George McGovern. Feigen's liberal politics _
and brusque manner _ earned him the rare, if unenviable,
distinction of being filleted by Tom Wolfe in ``Radical Chic'':
``somehow Radical Chic reaches its highest, purest state . . . as
Richard Feigen, in his tuxedo, breaks in to ask (a Black Panther
leader), from the bottom of his heart, `Who do you call to give a
party?' ''
</P>
<P>
   (Thirty years later, the question has switched to ``Who do you
call for a blurb?'' The answer _ surprise _ is Tom Wolfe, a glowing
paragraph from whom adorns the dustjacket of ``Tales From the Art
Crypt.'')
</P>
<P>
   Feigen lives with his second wife and twin stepchildren in a
Fifth Avenue duplex and Westchester County estate. (He also has two
grown children from his first marriage.) In residences, as in
trade, he's in the heart of the heart of the New York swirl. Yet
he's a native Midwesterner who very much remains a Chicago guy:
tough, no-nonsense, a little full of himself, not afraid to swagger
a bit, profane as well as polished.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know every block of that city,'' he says with pride. ``If I
get tied up in traffic getting in from the airport, I know exactly
how to go to duck it! That's my hometown, and I'll always feel that
way. I'd rather live in Chicago than New York. I feel much more
like a Chicagoan than a New Yorker, but I couldn't do what I do in
Chicago.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in Chicago that Feigen began to collect art. He was all
of 10 years old. ``You know, quite honestly, at the very beginning
I don't think it was loving art. It was business, it was trading.
The attachment to the objects came early, but gradually, not at the
very beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   Feigen comes from a prosperous, cultivated background _ he
remembers going to hear Rachmaninoff play his Second Piano Concerto
with the Chicago Symphony _ and went to Yale, then Harvard Business
School. He worked for an insurance company in Los Angeles, then for
a trading house on Wall Street. All the while, though, it was art
that interested him, and in 1957 he sold his seat on the New York
Stock Exchange and returned to Chicago to open a gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Feigen specialized in Expressionist art (he
considers Max Beckmann the greatest painter of the 20th century).
However, as both dealer and collector, he began to focus on earlier
work. And with New York increasingly becoming the art capital of
not just the United States but the world, Feigen saw what he had to
do. While maintaining his Chicago operation, he moved to New York
in the mid-'60s. In so doing, he guaranteed himself a footnote in
any history of art-world real estate: His was the first gallery in
SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   The move to New York was inevitable, Feigen says. ``In New York
you have a plutocracy,'' and such a density of wealth _ and
ambition _ guarantees a seller's market for art, for there's no
quicker way to buy prestige than by owning the right pictures.
``There's so much money around that it's hard to gain power simply
with wealth _ or, put it this way, the ante keeps rising.''
</P>
<P>
   In a milieu where politesse and good form are de rigueur,
Feigen's willingness to throw around words like ``plutocracy'' and
``ante'' make him unusual _ and talked about. ``I try not merely to
curse the darkness but also light candles,'' he says with a shrug,
``and candles give off heat as well as light.''
</P>
<P>
   Seen in those terms, ``Tales From the Art Crypt'' qualifies as
enough candelabra to illuminate _ and heat up _ several museums'
worth of space. There is, for example, a scathing account of the
shenanigans several years ago at the Barnes Foundation, the fabled
museum outside Philadelphia, when trustees attempted to sell off
holdings in violation of its founder's will _ an attempt Feigen all
but single-handedly scotched. Or there's his comparing the
exhibitions policy at New York's Metropolitan Museum, with its
``random mixture of box-office frivolity with serious art,'' to ``a
nice girl of good family who just once in a while goes out and
turns tricks for some pocket change.''
</P>
<P>
   As such a statement suggests, Feigen is very much of the old
school about art (old school in beliefs, that is, not expression).
For him, the museum is about edification not entertainment, fine
art not fashion. The Metropolitan's director, Philippe de
Montebello, recently chided Feigen at a party for what he had to
say about his museum; and Malcolm Rogers, director of the Museum of
Fine Arts, is no likelier to approve of what Feigen has to say
about the MFA (see accompanying story).
</P>
<P>
   Feigen believes that connoisseurship, not commerce, should be
the supreme value in the art world. That's not exactly an opinion
one expects from a dealer, but Feigen doesn't see himself primarily
as a dealer. ``I really am a collector,'' he says. ``That's what I
really like to do. I love to buy. I don't like as much to sell.''
Artists in his collection include Poussin, Fra Angelico,
Domenichino Turner, and (of course) Beckmann. Feigen also owns
three of the 60 known works by Orazio Gentileschi.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, he sees art dealing as ``a dying business. I don't
know whether it'll still exist in 50 years.'' Asked why that is,
Feigen is quick to note that the art market consists of various
submarkets _ the problems he faces at Feigen Contemporary, his
gallery in New York's Chelsea district, which specializes in the
work of emerging artists, are considerably different from those he
faces selling Old Masters on the Upper East Side _ and then gives
some reasons. Old collections have been dispersed. The supply of
objects is finite, and the supply of available objects contracting.
Most European countries have sharpened export restrictions. The
number of museums has vastly increased (which means works that
might previously have gone on the market are now likelier to be
bequeathed to an institution, the resultant tax break oftentimes
making a donor as much of a financial gain as a sale would).
</P>
<P>
   Feigen cites the difficulties with characteristic, if
incongruous, gusto _ and why not? Selling Old Masters may be in
peril as a business, but you wouldn't know it by looking at such
items he has for sale from the Steinberg Collection as Titian's
``Salome With the Head of John the Baptist'' (estimated worth $12
million) or Jacob Jordaens' ``A Twelfth Night Feast'' (estimated
worth $7 million). And all else failing, he can always fall back on
his acting career.
</P>
<P>
   Feigen barks out a laugh at the suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed it,'' he says. ``I still get residuals (for `Wall
Street'). A check will come in the mail for $34, $32. The best of
it was I had one of those trailers. It was out there on Park
Avenue, with my name on the window. It was great. There were only,
let's see: Michael (Douglas) had a trailer, Darryl (Hannah) had a
trailer, Oliver Stone had a trailer, and I had a trailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm annoyed with a friend of mine, Leonard Goldberg, who
produced this movie called `Double Jeopardy.' There's an art dealer
in the movie, and after it came out I said to him, `Leonard, how
can you do this? I haven't had any work since `Wall Street!' ''

   A VOTARY VOTES
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am a Lutheran pastor living in a parsonage. Our school
district is debating a building project to be funded by increased
property taxes, a proposition I support (although I do not have any
children enrolled in the system). As the parsonage is exempt from
property tax, is it right for me to vote in the election,
considering that should the project be approved, my portion of its
taxation is passed on to neighbors?
</P>
<P>
   _ Douglas S. Larson-Sell, Lonsdale, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   A: Your exemption from property taxes is not germane. Many
people own no property and hence pay no property taxes; they still
get to vote. The United States long ago abandoned owning land as a
prerequisite for voting. (And I understand that in many states
women have been granted the franchise.) As a citizen, you should
vote on all ballot issues, even those that don't seem to affect you
directly. Otherwise, only motorists would vote on highway bills,
only backpackers (or bears) on funds for national parks. But these
issues concern the entire society. For instance, the bill you
describe finances school construction, and even those without
children have a stake in an educated populace. Democracy works best
when civic life is strong, when people have a broad sense of
community, shared experiences and mutual responsibility. Although I
must say, why church property like your house is exempt from taxes
is a mystery to me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My city will haul away only trash inside the bins. When a
garden project left more trimmings than fit into the bin, my
neighbor suggested I offer the trash collector $10 or $20 to take
the excess. Isn't this as bad as offering a policeman money to
avoid a ticket? Where do you draw the line between outright bribery
and a little ``lubrication,'' like slipping the maitre d' 10 bucks
for a better table?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.T., Los Angeles
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's one place to draw the line: when you pay someone to
break the law, as you contemplate here, it's a bribe. One reason
some people dislike tipping is because of the ambiguity you
describe. Are you showing appreciation for a job well done or
inducing someone to do something he otherwise would not? That is,
are you rewarding the maitre d' for attentive service or enticing
him to give you a table deserved by someone else?
</P>
<P>
   There is something to be said for clear responsibilities, decent
paychecks and hauling your own excess weeds to the dump.
Alternatively, you could simply stash your trash out back until
next week's pickup when there's room in the bin. As subtle as the
distinction between a bribe and a tip can be, it is lucidity itself
compared to this murky imponderable: what is the difference between
a bribe and a campaign contribution _ particularly when an interest
group donates to both candidates in a race? Science is baffled.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When we stay at motels, I bring the unused, wrapped soaps and
shampoos home to be passed on to a shelter for the homeless. My
husband maintains I'm stealing. I consider the cost of these items
to be built into the charge for the room and that they are ours to
do with what we wish. What is your opinion?
</P>
<P>
   _ R.S. Schenectady, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A: What you're doing isn't exactly stealing, but it is taking
advantage. While you're at the motel, you may wash yourself as
lavishly as you like, but you may not back a truck up to the supply
room or, for that matter, empty out the shelf above the sink. That
the motel budgets for such things is neither here nor there; they
budget for fire insurance, but you really ought not torch the
place. If you want to donate to a homeless shelter, do so out of
your pocket, not someone else's.

HOSPITALS REASSESSING HOURS WORKED BY INTERNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE BARNARD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   At a time of increasing concern about medical errors and young
doctors' long working hours, the number of hospitals being cited
for overworking their interns and residents is on the rise,
according to the group that sets standards for doctor training.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that this long-term, high burnout problem is reaching
crisis levels, teaching hospitals from Massachusetts to California
are reassessing their residency programs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 86 teaching hospitals reviewed last year by the private
organization that accredits residency training programs, 17 _
nearly one in five _ were cited for violating the organization's
work-hour standards.
</P>
<P>
   The standards don't purport to keep medical training from being
grueling: They call for one day off out of seven; overnight
hospital duty no more than once every three nights; and workweeks
of 80 hours or more, depending on the specialty. Still, the group
found violations in 28 of 92 training programs in internal medicine
and 25 of 69 general surgery programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The citations related to work hours and working conditions are
more frequent now than they have been in past years,'' said Dr.
David Leach, president of the evaluating group, the Accreditation
Council for Graduate Medical Education. The group does not disclose
which hospitals are cited.
</P>
<P>
   There are many possible reasons for the increase, doctors and
administrators said. A budget crunch has forced teaching hospitals
to lay off support staff and rely on residents for routine tasks.
An increased array of medical options gives residents more to learn
and more to do.
</P>
<P>
   The accreditation council and other medical groups have renewed
their interest in the problem of exhausted doctors, particularly in
the seven months since a National Academy of Sciences report, ``To
Err is Human,'' said that more Americans die each year from medical
errors than from car accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Physician training programs across the country, from
Massachusetts General Hospital to the University of California at
San Francisco School of Medicine, are reassessing the way they use
residents, in a flurry of activity not seen since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   That year, New York became the only state to regulate residents'
hours, responding to the 1984 death of 18-year-old Libby Zion,
whose father, a prominent journalist, blamed overworked,
unsupervised residents. Massachusetts hospitals headed off such
legislation by adopting voluntary guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's distressing to see the number of citations and the number
of programs that are not in compliance when this is a 10-year-old
issue,'' said Dr. Michael Whitcomb, vice president of the American
Association of Medical Colleges.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, some programs are now finding
innovative solutions to a longstanding problem _ how to reduce
hours while still providing intense training in the first three to
five years after medical school. That is one of the questions to be
tackled by a new task force to make medical institutions more
accountable for doctors' training.
</P>
<P>
   Outside forces may spur more hospitals to focus on the issue.
Last year, the National Labor Relations Board upheld a union
representing interns and residents at Boston Medical Center, ruling
that they are primarily employees, not students, and have a right
to organize.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors, including Bertrand Bell, the author of New York's
regulations, say the council should publicize its list of violators
to create more public pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be known to the patients, it should be known to the
residents who are about to start,'' said Josh Sharfstein, a
pediatrics fellow at Boston Medical Center who has written about
the issue for The New Republic.
</P>
<P>
   But Leach, head of the ACGME, said the group does not want its
members to ``waste time and energy dealing with the public fallout
that could be spent on improving the situation internally.'' He
said the group is not afraid to cite prestigious hospitals and even
remove their accreditation _ a step that is public _ if they do not
improve.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Hasan Bazari, director of internal medicine residency
programs at Massachusetts General Hospital, said that when his
program received a citation several years ago, it helped speed
changes doctors wanted to make anyway.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, he said, there were no caps on the number of patients
an intern could admit to the hospital in a night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't atypical for an intern to admit 14 or 15,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is in line with ACGME guidelines, which limit that number
to five. In addition, he said, internal medicine interns are on
``call'' _ all-night duty _ every four or even five nights, rather
than every three.
</P>
<P>
   Accomplishing that was expensive, and not every hospital can do
it, especially when the American Association of Medical Colleges
estimates that Medicare cuts will cost the average teaching
hospital $43 million by 2002. Bazari credits the leadership of
chief of medicine Dennis Ausiello. In two years, he said, MGH has
hired an additional 17 interns and residents, bringing the total to
119, without increasing the workload.
</P>
<P>
   It has also added a ``night float'' rotation, a 9 p.m. to 7 a.m.
shift that reduces the need for shifts that stretch to 36 hours. It
has shunted some tasks to doctors who have completed their training
so residents spend more time learning. That involved assigning nine
doctors _ five newly hired from other hospitals _ to focus on
caring for inpatients.
</P>
<P>
   Bazari said today's interns and residents need more time for
each patient than in his day because of the growing amount of
available treatments and an increase in acute ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we took care of a lot of patients, but we needed to know
less and we had less to offer them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brigham and Women's Hospital and Massachusetts General in Boston
have both transferred some duties to physician's assistants and
other aides, said Debra Weinstein, director of graduate medical
education for Partners, which includes both hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the University of California at San Francisco's
School of Medicine created a task force to reduce residents' hours,
partly to head off a San Francisco ballot initiative and a bill in
the state Legislature that would have imposed New York-style
regulations after a fourth-year medical student drew media
attention to the issue. The school has withdrawn its residents from
some hospitals where they were spread too thin, said David Irby,
vice dean for education.
</P>
<P>
   One of only two Boston-area hospitals with unionized residents
and interns, Boston Medical Center has seen working conditions
improve under chief medical officer John Chessare, said Sandy Shea,
organizer of the union there.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ruth Potee, an intern and union member, said that in some
rotations, such as surgery or obstetrics, she works 100 to 110
hours a week. She said she often takes patients in neighborhood
clinics after being up all night.
</P>
<P>
   Potee said that she would ask for help if she feared she would
injure a patient. But she has had other mishaps, including two
minor car accidents from ``being exhausted and backing into things
I shouldn't have hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucian Leape, a surgeon and adjunct professor at the Harvard
School of Public Health who was one of the authors of the medical
errors report, said many medical leaders still have not embraced
reducing resident hours, arguing it will cause mistakes when one
doctor hands off a patient to another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's disingenous,'' he said. ``Senior physicians can
go home at 5 p.m. We have ways of making sure people don't fall
between the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, `We have opened up a dialogue.. . .I bet in five
years this won't be an issue.''

SOME FEAR CHINA TRADE BILL IS UNRAVELING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More than a month after the US House approved a
sweeping trade agreement with China, the bill has been unexpectedly
delayed in the Senate, causing growing anxiety among business
officials who believed the political battle was won weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Senate leaders have not yet scheduled a vote on permanent
normalization of trade relations with China, or PNTR. Several
senators are now threatening to add amendments to the bill, which
would force the House to vote again on the revised measure. And
with time running out on the legislative calendar, business leaders
eager to tap into the sprawling Chinese marketplace are
increasingly worried that the deal could be postponed until next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement is of special interest in Massachusetts, where
business analysts believe expanded trade could add billions of
dollars to the technology and financial services industries. Yet
because the delay appears to be the result of internal Capitol Hill
squabbling, some industry leaders said they felt powerless to speed
up the process, especially after expending so much time and effort
on the fierce battle in the House last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be done and over with,'' said Bruce Holbein, vice
president for public policy at the Massachusetts Software &AMP;
Internet Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer we wait, the more it gets embroiled in
election-year politics,'' said Greg Garcia, director of
governmental affairs for the networking firm 3Com, whose New
England headquarters is in Marlborough. ``The longer we wait, the
danger increases that it will be put off until the following
year.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which would require China to lower its tariffs and
barriers in exchange for permanent normal trade status with the
United States, was always expected to face stiff opposition in the
House, where many Democrats are allied with powerful labor unions.
Labor believes the trade deal will endanger US jobs while doing
little to force China to treat its own workers with dignity.
Opponents also say China has an abysmal human rights record.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, eager to secure a major policy victory in his
final year in office, took on normalization as a personal crusade.
When it passed the House on May 24 by a vote of 237-197, Clinton
called it ``a historic step toward continued prosperity in America,
reform in China, and peace in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate passage was supposed to be a breeze. Currently, 75 of the
Senate's 100 members, including the two Democrats from
Massachusetts and most of the New England delegation, are expected
to vote in favor of PNTR. But for unrelated political reasons,
Senate majority leader Trent Lott has not yet taken the crucial
first step of putting the bill on the calendar for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Lott says he is waiting for his Senate colleagues to present a
so-called ``clean bill'' _ one identical to the House version, in
order to remove several procedural steps and clear its path to the
White House for Clinton to sign it into law.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also says he wants the Senate to handle several
appropriations bills first, to avoid an embarrassing struggle late
in an election year. But many political aides see partisan
maneuvering at work. One Republican aide said he believed Senate
GOP leaders are trying to draw out what is an uncomfortable issue
for many Democrats, dividing their loyalties between labor unions
and businesses. Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts said there
is a widespread fear that the bill is ``being taken political
hostage.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott insists he wants to schedule the vote before the summer
recess begins July 28. ``It is clearly my intent to call it up
before the August recess,'' Lott said last week.
</P>
<P>
   But he also conceded, ``It might not be as easy done as said.''
And after so many weeks of stalling, PNTR advocates overjoyed by
the House vote four weeks ago are beginning to fear that momentum
is starting to wane.
</P>
<P>
   They see troubling signs. US Commerce Secretary William Daley,
who guided the bill adroitly thus far, is leaving his job in
mid-July to take over the presidential campaign of Vice President
Al Gore. The following month, thousands of demonstrators are
planning to descend on the Democratic convention in Los Angeles to
protest, among other global issues, PNTR.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some on the Republican side would like to push this past the
conventions,'' Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat of Montana, said this
week in the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call. ``If that were to
happen, I see this vote losing. If anything like what happened in
Seattle happened in Los Angeles, then I think a number of senators
would be unlikely to vote for it.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Senator Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican,
is promoting a bill to establish an annual review of China's
nuclear weapons capacity _ a major change to the existing PNTR bill
that would force a new vote in the House. Under the rules of
Congress, both houses must vote on exactly the same bill before it
can be sent to the White House. With elections this fall, Congress
will be more or less on hold after July, making it extremely
difficult to get anything done.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, concerned about such procedural obstacles, summoned
nearly a dozen pro-PNTR senators to the White House earlier this
week to try to work out a strategy. Kerry was among them. ``The
president was resolute and clear about the need to achieve this,''
Kerry said. ``Our hope is the president is going to engage very
directly with the leadership on the Republican side, and we are all
going to engage with our colleagues, to see if we can get a date
certain to proceed.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the delay has worried many business leaders.
Especially in the technology industry, which has only recently
begun to interact with the government, this inside-the-Beltway
wrangling appears unnecessary and confusing. ``The dot-com
community already has this disdain for government,'' said one
Republican Senate aide. Political haggling of this kind, he said,
is likely to make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   While the slow action in the Senate is unsettling to business
interests, the procedural delay has had few practical effects thus
far. The effects of PNTR will not be felt in full until China
enters the World Trade Organization later this year or in early
2001.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, PNTR is a preventive measure: Under the rules of the
WTO, the United States is not allowed to make unilateral decisions
about how it trades with other countries, as it does with China
now. Without PNTR, China would have the right, under WTO
guidelines, to keep its high tariffs in place for US companies as
punishment for the annual trade vote now required on China in the
Congress. That vote, conditioned on a review of human rights
behavior, is galling to the Chinese; PNTR would do away with it.
</P>
<P>
   With PNTR, which makes China's trade status permanent, the
tariff playing field is leveled.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions believe the deal would harm US workers by
encouraging American companies to move abroad. But that argument
has been largely dismissed in the Senate, in part because so many
states' economies stand to benefit from the deal. Hundreds of
Massachusetts companies, especially those that sell technological
equipment and provide financial and insurance services, hope they
will be able to move swiftly into the giant marketplace, providing
products that are currently forbidden or highly taxed by the
Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty, said Garcia, the lobbyist for 3Com, is
preventing some companies from laying out new China business plans.
And, several business officials said, it is not winning any votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Washington, it's a political hot potato,'' said Chris
Anderson, the government liaison for the Massachusetts Hi-Tech
Council. ``From the perspective of those of us outside the Beltway,
it looks absurd.''

IS A VOTE FOR NADER A VOTE FOR BUSH? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT A. JORDAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; He may not do as well as Ross Perot did as a third party
candidate, but consumer advocate Ralph Nader and the Green Party
which endorsed him Sunday may have as much impact on the
presidential election as did Perot's Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   As Perot did in the 1992 election when he criticized both George
Bush and Bill Clinton as having no real differences between them,
Nader is now saying essentially the same about Texas Governor
George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   However, as some political analysts have suggested, Perot drew
more votes from people who might have voted for Bush, and thus may
have helped Clinton win the White House that year.
</P>
<P>
   And Nader is using his strong opposition to the current China
free trade bill, as Perot used the NAFTA (North American Free Trade
Agreement), to attract organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   Nader has drawn much praise from labor, including the United
Auto Workers and the International Teamsters, with his strong
argument that NAFTA has _ and the bill which grants China permanent
normal trade relations status will _ hurt US workers by exporting
hundreds of thousands of jobs overseas.
</P>
<P>
   There are at least two reasons why Teamsters president James
Hoffa Jr. attended the Green Party's endorsement of Nader. Although
he did not indicate whether he would endorse Nader's presidential
bid, he praised Nader for his stance on the trade bill, and
criticized Gore for supporting the China free trade bill. Hoffa
also said he expected Bush to support the trade bill, suggesting
that endorsing Bush is not high on the Teamsters' list of
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa and several other union presidents critical of Gore's
stance on the China free trade bill argue that they are openly
challenging the belief among some Democrats that organized labor,
which has been essential to the election of Clinton and members of
Congress, has nowhere to go but to Gore. If the Teamsters and the
UAW, and other large unions, decide to endorse Nader over Gore,
that could pose problems for organized labor and for Gore. Although
the national AFL-CIO and the CWA (Communications Workers of
America) endorsed Gore early in the campaign, a split in organized
labor over Gore and Nader could seriously weaken Gore's election
chances.
</P>
<P>
   To add to Gore's problem with Nader, some polls have shown that
Bush currently is in a virtual dead heat with Gore for rank and
file support of US workers. If anything, this support for Bush
suggests that organized labor has a lot of work ahead in educating
working families about what a Bush presidency, as opposed to a Gore
presiency, would mean to them.
</P>
<P>
   The bigger problem right now for Gore and labor is the
``bounce'' Nader will receive from the endorsement he received from
the Green Party.
</P>
<P>
   Some polls have Nader at 4 percent nationally, and about 9
percent in California, a state crucial to Gore's election bid.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another percentage on which Nader and the Green
Party is focused _ the 15 percent Nader and other presidential
candidates are required to reach in the polls to be eligible for
participation in the presidential debates, which begin Oct. 3 in
Boston. Both Nader and Pat Buchanan, the Reform Party's expected
presidential candidate, are legally challenging this 15 percent
threshold.
</P>
<P>
   If Nader and Buchanan, a former member of the Republican Party,
are able to participate in the debates, Nader could pose more of a
problem for Gore than Buchanan. Even if Nader is kept out of the
debates, that move could generate more positive publicity for the
consumer advocate. Either way, the Green Party's endorsement of
Nader gives him a higher profile that can't be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if his candidacy could take votes from Gore and
result in Bush's election in November, Nader brushed the question
aside by saying there was no real difference between Bush and Gore.
Of course, beyond the China free trade bill, there are clear
differences between Gore and Bush _ particularly on issues that
matter to organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   Nader knows it, and organized labor knows it. Before November,
organized labor will have to decide whether, in reality, that a
vote for Nader will, in the end, be a vote for Bush.

NET PIONEER'S IPO TOWERS OVER OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Who knew a contract to hook together a handful of computers
could lead to this?
</P>
<P>
   The event is this week's initial public stock offering of
Genuity Inc., which traces its corporate roots to the pioneering
days of the Internet and manages Web access for millions of
computer users today. It's a stock deal that towers over other
Massachusetts IPOs in size and complexity.
</P>
<P>
   The Burlington, Mass. company expects to raise about $2.3
billion for stock scheduled to begin trading Wednesday. Genuity
will probably hit the market with a total stock valuation of $13
billion or more, exceeded by just eight companies in Massachusetts
at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this is the kind of stock market inclined to swallow
millions of new shares in an Internet company up to its routers in
red ink is a serious debate. The early line: Genuity is a big
player with natural appeal to investors, but its stock sale is
being aggressively priced by underwriters who estimate a range of
$12 to $15 per share by the time the deal wraps up.
</P>
<P>
   The timing is being driven by factors beyond stock market
sentiment. Regulatory approval for the $65 billion merger between
Genuity's parent, GTE Corp., and Bell Atlantic Corp. is contingent
upon the public stock offering. That means it goes now.
</P>
<P>
   Genuity used to be called GTE Internetworking. The business was
built on GTE's acquisition of Bolt Beranek &AMP; Newman, a Cambridge
firm purchased for $616 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bolt Beranek was a technology consulting firm with an expertise
in acoustics when it won a government contract in 1969 to connect
computers located across the country for Pentagon research projects
_ a system that eventually evolved into the Internet. BBN delivered
the world's first electronic mail message and pioneered the use of
the ``(at)'' symbol now used in all e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Genuity operates one of the nation's largest Tier 1
Internet ``backbones,'' more than 17,000 miles of fiber-optic
cables routing and carrying Internet traffic around the world.
Among the millions of people who dial into America Online Inc. to
reach the Web, one of every three is connected along Genuity's
backbone.
</P>
<P>
   Genuity is also building Internet hosting services and ``virtual
private networks,'' for secure data transmission by corporate
clients.
</P>
<P>
   Genuity is no Internet seedling, having generated more than $700
million in revenue last year. It's on target to exceed $1 billion
in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The flip side: Genuity sure loses money like a young Web company
as it continues to pour cash into technology. It lost $647 million
last year, a figure that matched 92 cents of every sales dollar in
1999. More losses are in the future, and Genuity talks about
capital expeditures of as much as $13 billion over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Genuity pulls down most of its revenue from Internet access
charges. One customer, AOL, accounted for 52 percent of all sales
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the company's biggest access competitors, all operating
their own Tier 1 backbones, are connected with giant
telecommunciations companies like Worldcom's UUNet unit.
</P>
<P>
   Genuity's business of hosting Web sites and connecting Internet
visitors to them is growing, but accounted for only 7 percent of
revenue last year. Other developing businesses account for an even
smaller slice of the pie.
</P>
<P>
   Placing a value on Genuity becomes complicated because the
company operates in several businesses that command different
levels of interest among investors.
</P>
<P>
   Genuity's IPO appears to be valued at somewhere between
five-and-a-half and seven times the revenue forecast for 2001. But
other free-standing access companies, such as PSINet Inc., trade at
about three times next year's projected sales.
</P>
<P>
   Leading competitors in the hot hosting business command much
higher stock valuations, as much as 15 times revenue.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you come up with a value for Genuity? To buy the IPO
price, it helps to have faith that the company can grow its hosting
services to become as much as 20 percent of the business.
</P>
<P>
   Another unanswered question: Who will own how much of Geunity?
This is where it really gets complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Shareholders buying Genuity stock at the IPO appear to be
acquiring 90.5 percent of the company, but a twist in the offering
will likely turn control back to the seller before long.
</P>
<P>
   The combined GTE and Bell Atlantic, which will be called
Verizon, agreed to spin off most of its ownership in Genuity only
to satisfy federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   But Verizon will be allowed to convert its interest back into an
82 percent stake of Genuity later, at modest expense.
</P>
<P>
   The catch: Local telephone service in all the states covered by
Bell Atlantic must be successfully opened to competition.
</P>
<P>
   That process has to be accomplished state by state, but
investors are treating the Genuity IPO as if Verizon will in fact
become an 82 percent owner. It could take place over five years or
longer, but analysts suggested the conversion will take place
within three years and perhaps as quickly as 20 months.

NBA DRAFT PROSPECTS NOT AS FOREIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHIRA SPRINGER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With his West Virginia twang in full effect, Celtics general
manager Chris Wallace gave a quick lesson in Eastern European
history Monday. He talked about the dissolution of the Soviet Union
and the breakup of Yugoslavia. He rattled off the names of places
such as Serbia, Croatia, and Montenegro, stressing each exotic
syllable.
</P>
<P>
   The ever-changing borders of Eastern Europe provided context for
one of Wallace's biggest concerns: the evaluation of foreign talent
available for Wednesday's NBA Draft. As the physical and political
landscapes of countries are transformed, professional scouts assess
the talents of foreign players who may be capable of altering the
NBA landscape.
</P>
<P>
   While the NBA has shown serious interest in international talent
for more than a decade, the stateside performances of such players
has been mixed. Players such as Toni Kukoc, Vlade Divac, and Drazen
Petrovic legitimized overseas interest. But the return of Sasha
Danilovic and others to European leagues, the nine-year wait for
Arvydas Sabonis, and a disputed deal involving Sarunas Marciulionis
gave NBA teams pause about pursuing foreign talent. So far, more
international players have been forgotten than have made a name for
themselves in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But not so long ago, when familiarity with international players
increased and the number of rounds in the drafts decreased, the
calculus involved changed. Scouts, player personnel directors, and
coaches developed a better understanding of what international
players need to succeed. Now the risks are fewer, the upside
greater, and the talent pool larger and better prepared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what's happened now is we've been through a
decade-plus with a growing global tint to the NBA,'' said Wallace.
``Towards the end of the decade, we actually saw the arrival of
some bona fide European stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody doubts anymore in the NBA that European players can
perform and succeed in the league. That notion has been knocked
down. I don't know whether you call it xenophobia or whatever. That
doesn't exist anymore in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, 38 foreign-born players declared themselves eligible
for the draft, including 18 early-entry candidates (12 of the
early-entry candidates subsequently withdrew). The majority of
these players have spent their entire careers playing for European
teams, while 10 attended US colleges and one (Soumaila Samake)
played in the IBL.
</P>
<P>
   Some mock drafts have as many as five international, non-college
players being selected in the first round _ three more than were
selected last year (Frederic Weis, 15th by the Knicks; Andrei
Kirilenko, 24th by Utah) and a far cry from the days when Europeans
were seldom considered worth an early pick.
</P>
<P>
   Although Portland chose Sabonis with the final first-round pick
in 1986, the slots of Petrovic (third round, 60th overall to
Portland in 1986), Alexander Volkov (sixth round, 134th overall to
Atlanta in 1986), and Valerie Tikhonenko (seventh round, 157th
overall to Atlanta in 1986) were far more typical. Even the highly
touted Kukoc was not selected by Chicago until the second round in
1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing that has changed is we now have a
formal process for having them apply for the draft, which means we
get to watch them a lot, talk to them a lot,'' said Stan Kasten,
president of the Atlanta Hawks and one of the first talent
evaluators to look overseas. ``Everything is wide open now and
there's an easier method for comparing them to the other players in
the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, everything was somewhat cloak and dagger and
shrouded in mystery. You could not be sure of what you were
getting. You hadn't seen them play against this kind of
competition. You didn't know if they wanted to come over here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always reluctant to waste a No. 1 pick. Now, you're not
worrying about wasting a pick. You know the player's available and
is going to play and you have a much better handle on how well
he'll be able to play.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the European leagues produce fundamentally
sound shooters accustomed to a level of play less intense than the
NBA, especially regarding man-to-man defense. While the American
system rewards athleticism, European practices consist of
repetitive drills that break down each facet of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign players must adjust their game and lifestyle once they
reach the NBA. And that takes time and patience on the part of
their teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``You usually can throw away the first year because it's just
such a learning experience,'' said Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Fleisher, president of Entersport and an agent for such
European stars as Divac and former Celtic Dino Radja, said, ``It's
difficult in the first year, and (the transition) depends on the
team and coaching staff. Every player is different with different
personalities. I remember one player came over here and didn't know
how to work his refrigerator. He called and I explained what to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a full-service job, more so when you're representing
European players.''
</P>
<P>
   Petrovic and Dallas forward Dirk Nowitzki are examples of the
virtues of patience and the importance of finding the right fit.
</P>
<P>
   Before Petrovic died in a 1993 car accident, he was starting to
excel in the NBA. Portland tired of waiting for him to develop, but
after he was traded to New Jersey, he improved dramatically. In his
first year with the Nets ('91-92) he more than doubled his scoring
average and recorded career-highs in assists (252) and steals
(105). In his final NBA season, Petrovic averaged 22.3 points.
</P>
<P>
   Nowitzki had a similarly steep success rate this past season,
his second in the NBA. Playing in all 82 of the Mavericks' games,
he more than doubled his scoring average to 17.5 points, quadrupled
his assists (203), more than doubled his steals (29), and grabbed
three more rebounds a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to begin from zero,'' said Radja of his own
adjustment period. ``You have a certain name when you are in
Europe, then you come to the US and you have to earn every second
on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As foreign players become more prevalent in the NBA, teams
experience their own learning curve, improving the way
international talent is developed. Minnesota center Radoslav
Nesterovic benefited from the failure of Lithuanian forward
Virginius Praskevicius, a gifted athlete who was physically ready
to play in the NBA but had problems because of the language.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Praskevicius) could barely communicate when he first came
here,'' said Rob Babcock, the Timberwolves' director of player
personnel. ``He was just constantly so far behind. Once you get
going into the season, the coaches didn't have time to spend to
develop him. Logistically, it's a very difficult thing to do, and
he didn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really learned that the player not only has to have the
character and language base to be able to get going and make
continual progress, but they've also got to be good enough as a
basketball player that they're going to be able to get into your
rotation fairly quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're used to playing a lot. They're generally a star back
home. Though they're realistic in most cases and realize they're
playing in the best league in the world, they still want to play.
If you see you're earning more minutes and you're progressing, then
you have some motivation to stay here. If you don't, then you get
unhappy really fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota knew Nesterovic would remain with Virtus Roma for one
year after being selected with the 17th pick in the 1998 draft, but
the Timberwolves were willing to wait for young 7-footer from
Slovenia. They brought Nesterovic over just before the 1999
playoffs, after his European season finished. He played five games,
gaining a feel for the NBA, the organization, his new home, his
teammates, and his coaches.
</P>
<P>
   When injuries on the team forced coach Flip Saunders to make
Nesterovic the starting center this past season, the Minnesota
staff stayed patient. Nesterovic showed his commitment, practicing
extra hours. He averaged 5.7 points in 82 regular-season games,
then got significant minutes in four playoff contests.
</P>
<P>
   The coaches didn't put a lot of pressure on Nesterovic; they
didn't run plays directly at the young center and tried to keep up
his confidence by using him in the right matchups. After all,
Nesterovic represented a prized NBA commodity: a skilled true
center.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   International big men benefit from excellent teaching in the
European leagues and arrive fundamentally sound. Recently, there
has been a shortage of quality big men coming through the American
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you took away all the foreign-born players at the center
position in the NBA, we'd really be struggling,'' said Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Of the top foreign-born players being considered in this year's
draft, the majority are centers, including 7-foot-2-inch Iakovos
Tsakalidis and 6-10 Olumide Oyedeji, who have piqued the Celtics'
interest. But in Tsakalidis's case, unresolved contract issues with
his European team, AEK Athens, have made his future unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``NBA teams still look at signing a foreign players as a big
undertaking,'' said Fleisher. In addition to all the concerns about
adjustments, organizations interested in foreign talent must worry
about binding contracts and buyouts.
</P>
<P>
   Washington-based lawyer Lon Babby made his first foray into the
foreign market this year, adding Oyedeji and Hidayet Turkoglu to a
list of NBA clients that includes Tim Duncan and Grant Hill. Babby
figures foreign players are going to be an increasingly prominent
part of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Turkoglu is under contract to Efes Pilsen in his native Turkey,
so he would have to be bought out.
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, it's up to each international player what he
makes of his NBA experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I try to emphasize to all my players, European and
non-European, is that the draft is really just the beginning of the
process,'' said Babby. ``Wherever they go, that's just the
beginning of their career. The draft doesn't determine the outcome
of your career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (foreign) players in particular know that what they do
over the next few years and how they develop and what their
attitude is and what their work ethic is will determine how
successful they are.''

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The chopsticks were a mystery, an engineering enigma that defied
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, most of the Fairs had the hang of them. May Fair, of course;
she enjoyed cooking her Chinese ancestral dishes among her
cosmopolitan culinary repertoire at the family's Los Altos, Calif.,
home, and she showed a lifetime's expertise in handling the
utensils. Her husband, Ben, who was of European descent, was
equally adept. And their oldest child, Greg, was a natural.
</P>
<P>
   But the identical twin sisters were a puzzle. One of them,
Lorrie, maneuvered the sticks with effortless dexterity. But for
the other, Ronnie _ short for Veronica _ the journey from plate to
mouth was fraught with adventure. It was as if someone had turned
those infernal sticks into greased rails as the rice and noodles
and other delicacies took a tailspin into her lap.
</P>
<P>
   What was this all about? May wondered. Why was one of her
preschool twins so adroit, the other so hapless? Was her youngest
child _ Lorrie had seniority by 32 minutes _ that uncoordinated?
</P>
<P>
   Finally, not so much from inspiration but because she'd run out
of alternatives, May figured, what the heck, and placed the
chopsticks on Ronnie's left. ``Try it this way,'' she said,
shrugging in resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Problem solved. Instead of weapons of self-inflicted misery,
those sticks became a native appendage for Ronnie.
</P>
<P>
   And May Fair discovered two things. She had borne one
righthanded twin, one lefthanded. And they often took separate
routes to reach the same destination.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There will be a reunion this week in Boston on the eve of the US
women's national soccer team's Gold Cup match against Brazil
Tuesday at Foxboro Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Lorrie Fair will be there as a rising midfield star on the team
that became a planetary public relations supernova by winning the
1999 World Cup. With any luck, she'll be back here July 3 for the
title match, pursuing the jackpot that dwarfs the stakes in this
tournament that began Friday night against Trinidad &AMP; Tobago in
Hershey, Pa.: a spot on the US Olympic team at Sydney in September.
</P>
<P>
   May Fair, now widowed and retired, will be there to watch her
daughter perform, just as she travels the world, finances
permitting,
</P>
<P>
   to watch all her children perform.
</P>
<P>
   And Ronnie Fair will be there as tour guide. She, too, is a
soccer player, and Greater Boston _ Framingham, to be exact _ has
become her headquarters. She is a mainstay in the midfield as a
first-year member of the Boston Renegades. They play in the amateur
W-League, classified at the top as a W-1 team, and they're an
organization of national repute that lured Ronnie clear across
country to pursue her career. But as good as the Renegades are _
``amazing,'' Ronnie calls them _ they're a rung below the top.
Lorrie's perch.
</P>
<P>
   So at 21, the 5-foot-3-inch twins find their careers converging
by coincidence. And, almost as if mocking the stereotypes
associated with emerging from the same egg, each has taken her own
way to get here.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
-------- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They describe themselves as extremely close, and that was
evident from birth, which in itself became fodder for good-natured
teasing. When Lorrie proudly apprises a stranger of her half-hour
head start in entering the world, Ronnie will counter, ``That's
because I kicked you out.'' And, she'll point out by invoking
scientific data apparently known only to her, the older twin is the
less mature.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, their bond was unmistakable. They shared a room as
youngsters in affluent Los Altos _ ``The town is; we aren't,'' says
May with a laugh. And when May and Ben, both software development
managers at IBM, would come in to check on the toddlers at bedtime,
each sister was standing in her crib, engaged in earnest
conversation intelligible only to the two of them. Twin talk.
</P>
<P>
   The union carried over into sports, though that was more for the
sake of logistics than allegiance. With two parents trying to watch
three kids, it only made sense for the twins to double up on the
same team. And with a brother three years older who loved to play
ball, following suit was a matter of survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would beat us up,'' says Ronnie. ``He would make me carry
him piggy-back down the hall, and he was a pretty big guy and I'd
be wobbling all over the place. We played mud football with him and
all his friends. We'd wrestle with him. It was all fun and games
until one of us started crying.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of all, there was soccer. The three Fair kids would
absolutely assault the garage door with shots. ``We broke windows
at least three times,'' says Greg, ``and the garage door opener
once.''
</P>
<P>
   More conventionally, and less destructively, the children took
part in the spectrum of Los Altos youth recreation programs.
Soccer. Volleyball. Baseball. Basketball. Softball. Track. May
would serve as Greg's chaperone/cheerleader. Ben, who had retired
from IBM after suffering a heart attack at age 50, would coach the
girls. In a manner of speaking, anyway. He was a true
meat-and-potatoes sportsman. He knew baseball and football inside
out and scratched his head regarding the rest. So the Fair library
became a storehouse for how-to manuals. ``Dad was a chapter ahead
of the kids,'' May says in describing the typical practice.
</P>
<P>
   While the girls excelled at all sports, they gradually
gravitated toward soccer.
</P>
<P>
   For Ronnie, there was never an issue. ``Soccer is a fascinating
sport,'' she says. ``I wasn't born with a soccer ball stuck on my
foot, but it's definitely the most interesting of the sports that
I've played. It was like a perfect fit, I guess.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorrie's attraction was more pragmatic. ``It seemed like the
sport that came most easily,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   So much for symbiosis. Rather than two halves of the same
entity, the twins emerged as individuals. Oh, they still played on
the same teams, even after their father died of a second heart
attack nine years ago at 57, and they still drove one another to
excel as built-in training partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always had someone to play with,'' says Lorrie. ``It helped
us. If one was going only 50 percent, you'd realize you couldn't
keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   And there was still a certain telepathy during games. ``It was
kind of neat,'' says Greg. ``You could see they knew where each
other was on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were distinctions developing, too. May Fair thought
she detected them in the family scrapbooks. Each snapshot revealed
Lorrie's face scrunched up in ferocious determination, as if soccer
success were her reason for existence; Ronnie's was a perpetual
smile, as if she were distracted by the local flora and fauna while
wondering, ``Soccer game? What soccer game?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think Ronnie would be playing much soccer,'' says her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   But May eventually saw these photos were a mirage _ at least
some of them. Oh, those pictures of Lorrie were indeed telescopes
into her soul. But Ronnie's offered a distorted view, as if at the
bottom of a kaleidoscope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they both take it seriously,'' says May. ``But they
show it differently. Ronnie seemed more casual. Now I see she's
just as serious but has a different way of showing it.''
</P>
<P>
   And took longer to realize it.

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRATTLEBORO, Vt. _ Henry Tewksbury, known around here as ``Henry
the Cheeseman,'' boasts that he stocks more than 470 cheeses from
around the world in his shop at the Brattleboro Food Cooperative.
</P>
<P>
   But in a cooler case separate from the others, Tewksbury proudly
displays his personal favorites: the 100 or so distinctive cheeses
made in Vermont, most by small, family-run cheesemaking operations
using traditional methods and milk from their own herds. ``All the
Vermont cheeses are good, but some are now world class,'' he says.
``High quality farmstead cheeses are helping save the Vermont
family farm and preserve the Vermont landscape.''
</P>
<P>
   A dozen cheese makers, scattered around the state, welcome
visitors to their farms or creameries and to the ``caves'' where
cheeses are carefully aged, just like fine wines. And, as at
wineries, cheeses can usually be both sampled and bought. A trip
along this Vermont Cheese Trail is both a flavorful experience and
a scenic journey into the bucolic heart of New England's most
agricultural state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vermont has 25 farmstead cheesemakers, more than any other
state,'' says Tewksbury. Farmstead, or farmhouse, cheese is made at
a farm from the milk of animals _ cows, goats, or sheep _ that are
also raised and milked there. This means the cheese has a unique
flavor with subtle seasonal and annual differences, just like wine
from the same vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Cheesemaking is an old Vermont tradition. Crowley Cheese of
Healdville, which makes a creamier version of cheddar commonly
called Colby (but in Vermont often referred to as ``Crowley'') was
founded in 1882 and claims to be the oldest continuously operated
cheese factory in the country. The Cabot Creamery in Cabot, a
farmers' cooperative founded in 1919, has a large modern plant that
produces more than 12 million pounds of cheese, mostly cheddar, a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Farmstead cheesemaking operations, however, tend to be
relatively new and small in scale. Some get milk from as few as
four cows. They also generally make gourmet _ and pricey _ cheeses
such as blue, chevre, feta, and European-style sheep cheeses.
``There was plenty of cheddar out there, so we decided to go for a
niche cheese market,'' says Kate Wright, who with her husband ,Jon,
runs Taylor Farm in Londonderry.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Wrights began making Gouda, a cheese that
originated in Holland and is made from the milk of Holstein cows
and traditionally aged in a red wax covering. `The nice thing about
Gouda is that it ages fast and you can sell it after two months,''
Kate Wright says.`` Now we also make a maple smoked Gouda and are
working on an aged Gouda. It isn't as creamy as the regular cheese
but has a different flavor and costs more.''
</P>
<P>
   Farmstead cheeses like the Wrights' Gouda are handcrafted
products and priced accordingly, says Tewksbury, noting that the
best Vermont farmstead cheeses retail for as much as $17 a pound.
``They're not cheap,'' he allows.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Wrights are transplants to Vermont; he grew up in
Manhattan and she in the Boston suburb of Sudbury. Cheesemaking is
only one of the sidelines the couple have developed in order to
make a living and continue farming. They offer sleigh rides in the
winter and run a farm stand that sells vegetables, baked goods and,
now, cheese. ``We love it here and don't want to live anywhere
else,'' Kate Wright says.
</P>
<P>
   For some farmers, becoming cheesemakers has enabled them to keep
their animals after other uses became uneconomical. ``When my
father suggested that we milk our sheep instead of just raising
them for wool and meat, we thought it was a ridiculous idea at
first,'' says Cindy Major, ``but then we realized that cheeses like
Roquefort and mozzarella are made from sheep's milk.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia and David Major, both in their 30s, are the founders of
Vermont Shepherd of Putney, which makes French Pyrenees-style sheep
cheeses sold in gourmet food shops around the country. ``The first
cheese we made was so bad that we decided to go to France and see
how cheesemakers in the Basque country did it,'' says Cindy. That
was a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Vermont Shepherd's country style cheese, made with
unpasteurized milk from sheep that graze on fresh grass and wild
herbs, is prized for its rustic rind, grassy aroma, and nutty tang.
``I think it's better than anything from France,'' says Tewksbury.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to milking their own sheep, the Majors also buy
young cheese, made to their specifications, from other local
farmers, and age it in their large cave. They also now make some
cows' milk cheeses as well.
</P>
<P>
   The Vermont Shepherd cave, where the sampling room is located,
is an impressive sight. Its shelves are covered with wheels of
cheese ranging in shade from pale yellow to golden brown. For four
to eight months, each wheel is carefully turned and brushed every
other day so it will cure evenly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We baby them,'' says Brad Lussier, the cave's ``affineur'' or
cheese ager, ``that's how you make good cheese.''

GOOD REASONS TO HEAD TO EUROPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Europe: It's the place to be this year. Not only are there some
great happenings but the dollar is strong, which means the trip
could cost less than expected.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest savings will be found in countries that have adopted
the euro such as France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Belgium. The
dollar has been running almost 23 percent more against the euro.
While travelers may not see savings in everything, there are
bargains out there that could allow you to travel a little bit
better. For example, last year a room at the luxurious Hotel Adlon
in Berlin started at $283 a night; this year that same room costs
$205.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the savings, Europe is festive this year. It is
celebrating with the first world fair of the century in Hannover,
Germany. Nearly 200 nations are participating in the fair, which
runs through October. Also in Germany is the Oberammergau Passion
Play, held once every 10 years. In Rome, it is a Jubilee Year for
Christians. In London, visitors can ride the London Eye, a
450-foot-tall Ferris wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Other events to note: On July 1, the longest combined
rail/road/tunnel crossing in the world will open between Denmark
and Sweden. The Oresund Bridge is 10 miles long and has two decks,
with cars driving on the upper and trains on the lower. It cost $3
billion to build and will cost you about $30 to drive it one way.
For more information, go to www.oeresundsbron.com.
</P>
<P>
   In Wales, the first national botanic garden, and the first to be
created in Britain for more than 200 years, is open. The National
Botanic Garden of Wales cost $65 million and took 10 years of
planning. The garden is located about an hour by car from Cardiff
and costs about $9.50 to view. To learn more go to
www.gardenofwales.org.uk.
</P>
<P>
   Since both of these attractions are best visited by car, look
into renting a vehicle. Avis International has a Personally Yours
collection of free and unique preprinted itineraries for popular
driving tours in Europe. Each tour covers historic, cultural, and
scenic highlights based on recent drives. The tours make travel in
Europe all the more interesting. Travelers do need to book their
car 21 days in advance of the trip to obtain the Personally Yours
driving tour. Ask also about the 25 percent discount of the Avis
Super Value rate. And booking before you go is another way to save,
because all you can buy in the United States before heading to
Europe guarantees your price, can be less costly, and you don't
have to worry about exchange rates. For Avis, call 800-331-1084 or
see a travel agent. For a discount, mention AWD N917201.
</P>
<P>
   With the strength of the dollar against the franc, a visit to
Nice and Cannes on the French Riviera is a great value. The two
resort cities have a lineup of folk festivals and special
celebrations throughout the summer. For information on Nice, call
(+33) 493.928.291 or visit www.nice-coteazur.org; for Cannes, call
(+33) 492.993.135 or visit www.cannes-on-line.com.
</P>
<P>
   And, if you are in Denmark on July 4, you won't miss America's
birthday _ the largest July 4 celebration outside the United States
is held in Rebild National Park, 12 miles south of Aalborg, North
Jutland. The event, complete with bands, singing, and speeches by
prominent Americans and Danes has taken place every year since
1912, except for during the two world wars. The park was presented
to Denmark by Danish Americans in 1912.

Sculpture 2000
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Some of the finest sculptors from countries as diverse as
Israel, India, Morocco and Colombia will unite for Sculpture 2000
International, an outdoor invitational exhibition in the shoreline
city of New London, Conn. The free exhibit, spearheaded by Mitchell
College, continues through Aug. 22. Several artists will be
creating new pieces for the event that will become permanent gifts
to the community. During the showings there will be seminars and
workshops with the artists, and walking tours of the sculptures.
New London will also be the site of the tall ship celebration,
Opsail 2000, July 12-15.

&HT;     ONLINE GROCERS UNITE IN BID TO CHANGE SHOPPING PATTERNS

 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The planned merger of two of the more successful
on-line grocers is intended to strengthen the virtual supermarket
industry that so far has not been able to turn a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan Group Inc. announced Monday it was buying HomeGrocer.com
Inc. in a deal valued at more than $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the biggest deal done yet in e-commerce,'' said
Shawn Milne, senior electronic commerce research analyst for
EOffering Corp. in San Francisco. ``These are two well-funded
companies realizing one-plus-one can be three, not two.''
</P>
<P>
   It is still uncertain whether shoppers will switch from the
checkout lane to the keyboard in sufficient numbers to make the
industry profitable. Indeed, the two companies and several others
that are either in the home-delivery grocery business or are
experimenting with it have only a tiny presence in the market.
</P>
<P>
   Still, George Shaheen, the chief executive of Webvan, sounded
confident in a conference call with analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger will allow us to tighten our focus on changing
customer behavior,'' he said, ``by replacing a trip to the store
with giving them back their most precious commodity _ time.''
</P>
<P>
   The industry is in its early stages. Kirkland, Wash.-based
HomeGrocer began delivering to customers in the Seattle area in
June 1998, and now serves six markets. Webvan, of Foster City,
Calif., started in the San Francisco area a year ago and has
expanded into three markets.
</P>
<P>
   But compared with the total $440 billion in supermarket sales,
on-line grocery buying accounted for less than 0.1 percent, or $340
million, of those sales last year, according to the Boston
Consulting Group.
</P>
<P>
   The research group predicts sales for this year will reach $860
million, or 0.2 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``What matters more for the on-line grocery business is the
percentage of an individual city they have,'' said James Vogtle,
Boston Consulting's e-commerce research director.
</P>
<P>
   The grocery business is typically a low-margin business, with
on-line deliveries of perishable items considered a logistical
nightmare. But according to analysts, an on-line grocer only needs
2 to 4 percent of the customers in a particular market to make
money.
</P>
<P>
   Webvan declined to provide market penetration figures.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of both companies plunged after the merger announcement.
Webvan, which went public last November, fell $1.41, or 16.1
percent, to $7.31 per share. Shares of HomeGrocer, which went
public in March, dropped $1.22, or 15.1 percent, to $6.88 on the
Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts chalked up the stock price drop to some concerns over
merging the companies. But they were generally bullish on the
merger, primarily over the size of the combined company's war
chest: about $650 million in cash at the end of May this year.
</P>
<P>
   Although Webvan is the acquiring company, it is a little smaller
than HomeGrocer, with $16.3 million in revenues at the end of the
first quarter, compared with Home Grocer's $21.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   HomeGrocer has more than 100,000 customers at the end of the
quarter compared with 87,000 for Webvan in fewer markets. But
Webvan Group Inc., the name of the combined company, accounts for
most of the cash reserves.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a lot of money in the bank so this could play out
for a couple of years,'' Vogtle said. ``They've got the time to
weather this out.''
</P>
<P>
   The merger also keeps the companies from overlapping in what
could have been as many as nine of 15 markets by the end of next
year. Webvan currently serves the San Francisco Bay Area and
Sacramento and the greater Atlanta area, with plans to expand to
Chicago in August.
</P>
<P>
   HomeGrocer already serves six markets: Dallas; Los Angeles,
Orange County and San Diego in California; Portland, Ore.; and
Seattle. The combined company plans to be in 13 metropolitan
markets by the end of this year and in 15 markets by this time next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very positive deal,'' said Peter Swan, an analyst who
follows Webvan for Pacific Growth Equities in San Francisco.
``They're able to pool the capital and . . . they won't be laying
parallel track, to use railroad terminology.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the deal, former Netscape Communications chief
executive Jim Barksdale will join the Webvan board of directors. He
was formerly on the board of HomeGrocer.

A MOVING LOOK AT THE HOLOCAUST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faces and voices. More than anything else, they tell of the
horror of the Holocaust in a new, ex tensive, and moving exhibit at
our Museum of the Month, London's Imperial War Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The 4,000-square-foot Holocaust Exhibition covers two floors and
uses original artifacts, documents, photos, and film to tell of the
Nazis' unrelenting program of genocide. The main focus is the
persecution of Jews in Europe, but other groups are included, such
as Gypsies, Poles, Soviet prisoners of war, disabled people,
homosexuals, and prisoners of conscience. In developing the
exhibition, staff members visited other Holocaust displays and
memorials (including Boston's) around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many items are a funeral cart, a section of a rail car
used for deportation, and a dissection table. But it is the people,
captured in period photos, letters, and survivors' filmed
testimony, who will move visitors the most. Included are:
</P>
<P>
   --Photos of Jewish families smiling, celebrating, playing, or
posing for formal portraits. Within a short time, few members of
those families would be alive.
</P>
<P>
   --The words of a 13-year-old, recalling his first day as a
refugee in Britain: ``I spent most of that day in and out of the
toilet so that no one could see the tears rolling down my cheeks.''
</P>
<P>
   --A survivor, her voice breaking, remembering ``the screams from
the mothers who are separated from their children, from the boys,
their sons, from their husbands; it was just terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   --A photo of an 8-year-old girl in a First Communion dress. She
was actually a Jew, taken in by a Catholic family, and the photo
was displayed to fool her persecutors.
</P>
<P>
   --Another survivor, asking a question that perhaps has no
answer: ``How can you forgive the unforgivable?''
</P>
<P>
   The Holocaust Exhibition was opened this month by Queen
Elizabeth and is the final stage in redeveloping the Lambeth Road
building that was once the Bethlehem Royal Hospital for the Insane,
better known as Bedlam. The museum stresses that it is more about
social history than tanks, guns, and planes. But you will find
those, too, including such items as a massive V-2 rocket, twin
cannons at the entrance, and planes flown by both sides in World
War I and II. There are galleries of war art and interactive
exhibits that show what it was like to fight in a trench or
experience the bombing of Britain from a shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Prices are about $9 for adults, $7.50 for students, and free for
children. The Holocaust Exhibition is not recommended for younger
children, however. For more information, call 44-20-7416-5320 or
visit www.iwm.org.uk. For information on all London attractions,
call 800-462-2748 or visit www.londontown.com. A new Web site is
www.londonelite.com. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Meanwhile, in Raleigh: ``One Voice: From the Pen of Anne Frank'' is
the newest exhibit at Exploris, an interactive museum in Raleigh,
N.C. Displays and video clips help convey the family's experience
in hiding in Holland during World War II and the hope for a better
future that Anne expressed in her famous diary. For more
information, call 919-834-4040 or visit www.exploris.org. &QL;

 &QL; 
In a name: The Canary Islands were named by the Romans after the

Attention, TV addicts: Bathrooms in the new and luxurious Park
Hyatt Chicago have TVs with 7-inch liquid crystal display screens
mounted on walls near the tubs. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``A good part of all longing to travel consists in a
yearning for people one has never seen, a lust for the new _ to
look into strange eyes, strange faces, to rejoice in unknown human
types and manners'' _ Thomas Mann, German novelist.

London's largest hotel suite, at 885 square feet, and possibly its
most lavish. It has four bedrooms (each with a marble bathroom), a
dining room for up to 10 guests, a lounge, study, and kitchen. The
two master bedrooms have private balconies, and one of the bedrooms
converts into a well-equipped gym, with a personal trainer on call.
The cost: about $5,600 a night. For more information, call

<P>
   In this era of dot-coms, cellular phones and the designated
hitter, one of the many primitive skills to be cultivated and
refined by civilized men and women is the art of the human
sacrifice. Particularly children.
</P>
<P>
   During the past three weeks, members of the Arizona Legislature
have been offering up one child per day to the gods of
stubbornness, self-importance, pride and stupidity.
</P>
<P>
   It began earlier this month, when Gov. Jane Hull called
lawmakers into special session to address the state's growing
education crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agreed that something had to be done. Schools statewide
are in dire need of repair. There is a shortage of qualified
teachers, due in large part to the shortage of decent wages.
</P>
<P>
   A new testing system called AIMS was implemented before some of
the standards it requires were introduced in the classroom. And, in
just about every education survey conducted by just about every
public policy organization, Arizona ranks somewhere near the
bottom.
</P>
<P>
   When faced with such an obvious disaster, the governor and
legislators sprang into action.
</P>
<P>
   They compiled all the available statistics. They consulted with
educators and administrators. They spoke to financial and
governmental experts. They accumulated mounds of input from
interested members of the public. They had their staffs take all
this material, combine it, condense it and forge it into a workable
legislative package.
</P>
<P>
   Then, they ignored it.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Jeff Groscost didn't like the governor's proposal
to increase the sales tax. He decided the best position he could
take was one that had him facing Hull's office, sticking out his
tongue. The governor, in turn, sent out such lackeys as Lisa Graham
Keegan, state superintendent of public instruction, to call
Groscost's counterproposal a ``joke.''
</P>
<P>
   On and on it went.
</P>
<P>
   The governor blamed Groscost for stalling. The speaker blamed
the governor for not lining up the support she needed for her plan
before the session started.
</P>
<P>
   The cost to taxpayers for a single day of the special session is
reported to be $5,200.
</P>
<P>
   In most Arizona school districts, that's more than it costs to
educate one child for a year.
</P>
<P>
   Each passing day, it was as if lawmakers stuck a skewer through
one of Arizona's school-age shrimp and tossed him on the barbie.
</P>
<P>
   During the past three weeks, one kid per day has been sacrificed
while Maricopa County lawmakers collect $35 a day in expenses and
those from outside the county get $60.
</P>
<P>
   One boy or girl per day has become a burnt offering while
grown-ups claiming to have the interests of children at heart
continue pointing fingers at one another.
</P>
<P>
   More than five grand a day has gone up in smoke while
legislators bicker over how to put out the fire.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, it won't matter a bit because the folks at the
Capitol are going to pass the buck. Because their lack of brains is
matched only by their lack of guts, our elected officials will
refer the final education proposal to the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   That way, the people who spent the past three weeks sacrificing
one child per day will give you the chance to burn them all at
once.

 &HT;    TUTU URGES REVERING, NOT JUST RESPECTING, EACH OTHER(a) 
 &HT;    (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)(a) 
 &HT;    By MAUREEN JENKINS(a) 
 &HT;    c.2000 The Arizona Republic(a) 
<TEXT>
<P>
   .
</P>
<P>
   ``Ethnicity, skin color, all these are total irrelevancies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that invests all of us with a value that can't be
(measured) is that each of us is created in the image of God.''
</P>
<P>
   South African Archbishop and Nobel Peace Prize winner Desmond
Tutu brought a message of unity, tolerance and respect to a crowd
of more than 1,000 at the Arizona Biltmore on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the crowd at the $250-per-plate benefit for
Catholic Charities' Foundation for Senior Living and Catholic
Social Service were more diverse in age, race and background than
those typically seen at major fund-raisers.
</P>
<P>
   Prominent community leaders were plentiful. But thanks to
anonymous and corporate donors who provided free and discounted
tickets, young people and non-famous folks got the chance to
witness living history in their hometown. And a multiracial mass
choir, which marched in carrying candles and singing a South
African religious tune, set the stage for the archbishop's speech.
</P>
<P>
   Next to Nelson Mandela, 68-year-old Tutu probably served as the
world's most enduring symbol of hope during South Africa's
apartheid regime. More recently, the cleric has headed his nation's
Truth and Reconciliation Commission, helping heal the scars left by
decades of institutional racism and discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   To Phoenix, Tutu brought a message as relevant to 21st-century
America as to his post-apartheid homeland. But despite the often
political nature of Tutu's message, he ultimately sounded like a
man of God.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fantastic thing is that each of us is a God-carrier. We
shouldn't just respect each other - we should revere each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Tutu will soon return to South Africa. His Phoenix visit
followed a two-year visiting professorship at Emory University's
Chandler School of Theology in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   But in hopes of extending Tutu's message of tolerance and
justice beyond Monday's speech, the city of Scottsdale's Office of
Diversity &AMP; Dialogue will host a regional youth Town Hall meeting
on Aug. 12. A videotape of Tutu's speech also will be made
available to Valley schools.
</P>
<P>
   During his speech, in fact, Tutu saluted the youth in the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has this wonderful characteristic of wanting to use young
people,'' Tutu said. ``God regards you as some of God's best
partners. So go for it.''

 &HT;    Obsessive people hiding anxiety

   ``This traffic at lunch time is getting unbearable,'' he
thought, as he drove to his favorite restaurant for lunch. ``Those
dimwits at City Hall don't even try to coordinate the traffic
lights to speed things up.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, sliding into a booth at the restaurant, he noticed that
someone had spilled ketchup at some point in the past all over the
menu, and it needed to be replaced. As the waitress annoyingly
popped her gum while taking his order he noticed the man in the
next booth crudely applying his toothpick to his teeth like a
crowbar. ``I might as well write this lunch time off as another bit
of evidence that the world is full of idiots and imbeciles and I
need to move to another planet.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time he returned to work he had a pounding headache,
which became more severe that afternoon when his secretary
misspelled several words and asked to leave work early.

<P>
   Most of us pay lip service to the fact that the world is
unpredictable and imperfect _ but that's as far as it goes for
many. For the obsessive personality, life's main goal is to remedy
the uncertainties, injustices and imperfections that stand between
them and a safe and happy passage through life.
</P>
<P>
   High blood pressure, frequent indigestion, insomnia and bad
moods are but but some of the inevitable and necessary scars that
they feel must be endured along the way through life.
</P>
<P>
   The core of obsessiveness is the need for control. The finely
honed and sharpened tools of conscientiousness, thoroughness and
attention to detail are rewarded in our society by recognition in
the forms of material wealth, power and bountiful accolades. After
all, who wants a sloppy accountant, an irresponsible physician or a
mediocre minister? Words like balance, moderation, compromise and
flexibility conjure up images of weakness, inadequacy and even
disgust to the obsessive.
</P>
<P>
   If the need for control is the fuel that drives the obsessive,
then what is the source of the fuel? Like the magma that lies just
beneath the outer crust of the earth, unbridled anxiety directs the
need for control. Our obsessive is a thinly armored bowl of
quivering Jell-O. Fear that loss of control will result in such
horrible experiences as embarrassment, demotion, defeat or failure,
the obsessive makes focusing on reducing uncertainty and
imperfection the top priority.
</P>
<P>
   If you are an obsessive and want to begin changing, recognize
that the process of change is usually slow. I will return to this
topic again in future columns.

HOUSE AGREES TO ALLOW SALES OF U.S. FOOD AND MEDICINE TO CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After five hours of negotiations, Republican leaders in the
House of Representatives agreed early Tuesday to allow sales of
U.S.-grown food and medicine to Cuba, thereby relaxing the
sanctions that Washington invoked against the communist regime in
Havana 38 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise brokered early Tuesday morning in the office of
the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., would still prevent
U.S. government credits and loans from U.S. banks from subsidizing
the agricultural sales, as is routinely done for many other
countries.
</P>
<P>
   It also leaves intact long-standing restrictions on U.S. tourism
to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate had voted last year to ease the embargo against Cuba,
but the House had refused until now. But U.S. farm groups had
complained about having a logical market for U.S. produce closed to
farmers, leaving Cuba to import about $700 million worth of food
annually from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   While the agreement was reached primarily with Cuba in mind, it
could also open the way for sales of food and medicine to other
countries with which the United States has frosty or non-existent
relations, including Iran, Libya, North Korea and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The international sanctions against Iraq, which the United
States helped put in place, do not appear to be affected, but the
United Nations supervises its own program allowing Baghdad to sell
set amounts of oil to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The new provision would also prohibit the president from
including food and medicine in future embargoes without the consent
of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear how soon the sales of U.S. food to Cuba would
begin. The provision agreed upon Tuesday could be added to an
agricultural appropriations bill that has been delayed in the House
of Representatives or to other pending legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for any vehicle to get it signed into law, and
I think we have a great chance to do that,'' Rep. George
Nethercutt, R-Wash., said, according to The Associated Press.
Nethercutt called the agreement ``a great breakthrough for American
farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Ileana Ross-Lehtinen, R-Fla., said the pending
legislation would ``make it as difficult as possible'' for such
sales because it would not give Fidel Castro access to U.S.
financial markets. Ross-Lehtinen represents many Cuban-Americans in
her constituency and is an outspoken critic of Castro's government.

&HT;     NADER TARGETS GORE, BUSH; SEEKS SPOT IN NATIONAL DEBATES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DEMIAN BULWA  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Green Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader
energetically ripped the Republican and Democratic front-runners
and said his record as a corporate watchdog and political reformer
should impress voters.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing in San Francisco and Oakland on Monday, the consumer
activist called his candidacy a ``serious run,'' unlike his
shoestring bid four years ago. He deflected reports that his
campaign's biggest impact could be to steal votes from Vice
President Al Gore, the presumptive Democratic nominee, especially
in liberal Northern California. Texas Gov. George W. Bush is a
shoo-in for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were worried about hurting Al Gore's campaign, I wouldn't
be running for president against Al Gore and George W. Bush,''
Nader said. He added his votes would come from blue-collar workers,
the poor, the young and the old, among others.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, 66, said he would raise $5 million for the current
campaign, compared with $5,000 in 1996, when he garnered just
700,000 votes nationwide. An aide said Nader had about $900,000 as
of Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That $5 million will be the equivalent of $15 million when you
compare it to the other candidates' profligate spending,'' Nader
said, lacing nearly every sentence with blasts of the major
candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Nader spoke at the Ariba Juntos job-training center in San
Francisco. Later, he greeted hundreds of supporters in an Oakland
ballroom with U.S. Senate candidate Medea Benjamin and Oakland City
Council hopeful Rebecca Kaplan, Green Party candidates who echoed
Nader's belief that voters want to see strong third options.
</P>
<P>
   A national consumer advocate for more than 30 years, Nader was
nominated Sunday at the Green Party's convention in Denver. Members
of the 16-year-old, grass-roots organization say he has championed
many of their core values, and also view him as a vehicle for party
legitimacy.
</P>
<P>
   If he can win 5 percent of the vote in the fall election, the
party could qualify for federal matching campaign funds in the 2004
presidential race. Polls in recent months have given Nader up to 7
percent popularity nationally, and up to 9 percent in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Nader said he would spend his campaign pushing for publicly
financed elections _ he is accepting only individual contributions
of up to $2,000_ universal health care and more protections for
laborers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to make change, and I think (his campaign) will go a
significant way toward changing the consciousness of Americans,''
said Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the California Nurses
Association, which has endorsed Nader. ``When Al Gore starts
talking like Ralph Nader, I think Ralph Nader will feel like he has
been massively successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader said his campaign would get a major boost in this year's
race if he could confront the front-runners on national television.
The major debates, though, are limited to those winning at least 15
percent popularity in polls. Nader proposed lowering the figure to
5 percent or including candidates with a ``demonstrated record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when the focus of the public is most intense. . . . We
have to break through on this,'' said Nader, whose running mate is
American Indian activist Winona LaDuke. ``Americans are going to
fall asleep watching these debates.''

   GENOME-PATENTS (Undated) _ Long before scientists had completed
the task of reading the human genome, parts of it had already been
claimed for commerce. In what has often been compared to a land
grab, companies and universities have filed for patents on hundreds
of thousands of genes and gene fragments. Amid concerns that such
patents are being granted too liberally and that they could hinder
innovation, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office is about to
implement new guidelines that will make it harder to patent genes.
But critics say the new rules are still too lax. By Andrew Pollack.

   EDUCATORS-COMPUTING _ ATLANTA _ At the National Educational
Computing Conference in Atlanta this week, such heavyweights as
U.S. Education Secretary Richard Riley and Intel CEO Craig Barrett
have preached the value of technology in the classroom. At the
periphery, though, is a lone voice of caution: that of William
Rukeyser, head of an anti-technology group called Learning in the
Real World. He says that research hasn't proven that technology
improves learning, and he says it's too expensive for cash-strapped
schools. ``Everybody loves to play with new toys,'' he says. ``But
the fact is, when it comes to technology in schools, there is no
Santa Claus.'' His is not a popular view at the technology
conference this week. WITH PHOTO (Rukeyser). (Judd, Atlanta

   TEXAS-CHILDHEALTH _ The first time Carla Savannah applied for
Medicaid she was pregnant. She got a lecture, but no health
coverage. ``My son's now 1 and I'm still not covered,'' said
Savannah, 18, of Austin. ``I just have bills.'' Despite three or
four tries, Savannah has not successfully navigated the complex
Medicaid system, dominated by poor women and children entitled by
federal law to health care. Although Medicaid is intended as a
safety net for the state's most vulnerable residents, the poorest
children in Texas have the hardest time getting covered. Texas
maintains some of the nation's most stringent Medicaid rules. The
restrictions are in sharp contrast to Texas' new Children's Health
Insurance Program, which serves the working poor whose incomes
generally are higher than Medicaid families. Insurance Commissioner
Jose Montemayor plans Tuesday to present the results of a survey of
Texas health insurance carriers that offer coverage to children.

   MEXICO-CARDENAS _ MEXICO CITY _ To some he's the hero of
Mexico's impoverished and oppressed. To others he's in danger of
becoming the spoiler of an historic opportunity for democratic
change. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the spiritual leader of Mexico's left,
is running in third place as Mexicans prepare to elect a new
president on Sunday, according to most pre-election opinion
surveys. This is the third time Cardenas has tried to oust the PRI,
Mexico's ruling party. This time, however, Cardenas' underdog
campaign has been eclipsed by Vicente Fox, a conservative
opposition candidate whom polls show stands a credible chance of
defeating the PRI. Fox has alternately insulted and tried to woo
Cardenas to join his campaign. But at a huge rally here Sunday
Cardenas made it clear no 11th-hour deal will be cut. He bitterly
spurned Fox's latest public plea at his own rally the night before
to join him, and thus guarantee the PRI's defeat. (Ferris, Cox News

   center left Mihm with a few words that, three years later, are

Robinson told the young 7-footer that he some day expected to see
him in the NBA. ``I remember David telling me that Chris impressed
him on the court and off the court,'' said Jeff Austin, the
Washington, D.C.-based agent who represents both Mihm and Robinson.

&HT;     GROUP OFFERS HOPE FOR PEOPLE WITH CHROMOSOME DISORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By NICOLE FOY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It took 16 years for Torrie Bryant to realize she
was not alone. Born with a chromosomal abnormality that affected
her hearing and muscle tone, Bryant grew up without knowing there
were children with similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   Her doctors did not fully understand the disorder, and for years
they treated her symptoms without attributing them to the genetic
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant, now 20, said her life changed about four years ago
when she learned about the Chromosome 18 Registry and Research
Society, a one-of-a-kind organization that is based in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit group provides a support network for families with
children who have chromosome 18 abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps fund research at the University of Texas Health
Science Center aimed at unlocking the genetic mysteries behind the
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really amazing finding out there were other people like
me out there,'' Bryant said. ``It made me feel not so alone.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bryant joined about 35 children who have chromosome
18 abnormalities at the registry society's annual conference. The
seventh annual meeting, held at a resort near Boerne, Texas,
attracted families from as far as Scotland, Australia, Costa Rica,
Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant has a syndrome known as 18q-, which means she is missing
a piece from the ``long arm'' of chromosome 18. When she was born,
in addition to suffering from poor muscle control and hearing
difficulties, Bryant also had a clubfoot.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those difficulties since has been corrected, and Bryant,
now a college student, considers herself fortunate. Some children
with chromosome 18 abnormalities suffer more severely, with common
effects being stunted growth, developmental delays, congenital
defects and mental disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to 18q-, other syndromes of the disorder include
trisomy 18, where there are three copies of the chromosome rather
than the usual two; 18p-, where a piece is missing from the ``short
arm'' of the chromosome; Ring 18, in which one of the copies of the
chromosome forms a ring; and tetrasomy 18p, where an extra
chromosome is present.
</P>
<P>
   Trisomy 18 can be the most severe of the syndromes. The chances
of being born with the disorder are about 1 in 5,000, and about
half of the children survive to 6 months of age. Only 10 percent
might live through the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The overall outlook for children with chromosome 18 defects is
unknown, said Jannine Cody, a health science center geneticist who
is president of the registry and research society. Since the
disorder easily can be misdiagnosed or missed, it has been hard to
track the life spans of those afflicted, she said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports, however, of adults with chromosome 18
deletions living into their 30s and 40s, Cody said.
</P>
<P>
   Cody and Robin Leach, an associate professor of pediatrics, have
spearheaded the research effort at University of Texas Health
Science Center. They are involved in a project testing the effects
of human growth hormone on children with 18q-.
</P>
<P>
   The two also are searching for the specific genes that are
missing or altered in children with the disorder. To that end, they
have been intensely interested in the international effort to
sequence the entire human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Monique Mansoura, a policy analyst with the National Human
Genome Institute, spoke at the conference and noted the historic
achievement announced Monday by President Clinton and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair regarding the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders praised the international team of scientists
that completed a rough draft of the human blueprint after 10 years
of work.
</P>
<P>
   The project provides a map that researchers such as Cody and
Leach will use to try and unlock the mysteries of chromosome 18
defects.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain extent, we'll be able to treat some of the
symptoms of things like chromosome 18 just by understanding them,''
Mansoura said. ``The mapping effort gave us a parts list, and now
we need to go and say, `OK, how do we fix it?'''

 ACTIVISTS WORRY ABOUT CRIME'S LURE FOR ANGOLANS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROCKTON, Mass. _ Looking at Eulidio Monteiro, it's hard to tell
where the Cape Verde in him ends and the Angola in him begins.
</P>
<P>
   His face burns caramel, part almond brown from his Cape Verdean
mother, part deep coffee from his Angolan father. His hair doesn't
so much coil as wave, weaving a story of two peoples whose shared
history is evident even worlds away, in a Brockton parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We come because Cape Verdeans were here,'' said Monteiro, 22,
who left his parents behind and came to the United States in 1998
from the Angolan capital of Luanda. ``They say, `Come to Brockton,
it's nice.' So, we come.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of miles of African coastline separate the Cape Verde
Islands from Angola. But common culture has long united the former
Portuguese colonies, cemented by a huge migration of Cape Verdeans
to Angola in the 1950s. Now, a growing stream of Angolans, whose
homeland has been ravaged by civil war, has followed Cape Verdeans
to the United States seeking stability.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Boston area _ the largest hub for Cape Verdeans, and
now Angolans, in the United States _ activists in the midst of a
losing battle against Cape Verdean youth violence are driving a
major effort to keep young Angolan men from following some of their
cultural kin into a cycle of crime, prison, and deportation.
</P>
<P>
   The need for prevention was punctuated 11 days ago in Boston,
when five Cape Verdean teenagers allegedly chased down a Dorchester
teenager and one of them, a juvenile, shot him to death. The
shooting capped six months of increasing violence in Dorchester and
Roxbury, as well as Brockton, Randolph, and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   So far, activists say, incidents among Angolans have remained
low, maybe a dozen in the past three years, when the flow of
Angolans to Massachusetts began in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   But the number of incidents is growing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the number to stay small,'' said the Rev. Filipe
Teixeira, an activist whose background is part Angolan and Cape
Verdean. ``But we are already seeing some serious incidents
happening with Angolans, including the aggravated felonies and drug
charges that classify them to be deported.''
</P>
<P>
   Teixeira and other Cape Verdean community leaders as well as
police have stressed that the ongoing violence among Cape Verdeans
involves only a small group of feuding teens.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Immigration and Naturalization Service, six
Angolans were deported for criminal reasons from 1993 to 1997, the
latest years for which figures were available. About 75 Cape
Verdeans were deported in that period.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the INS office in Boston, Paula Grenier, said
it was unclear whether any Angolans were in detention awaiting
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most recent deportations of Angolans, Teixeira said,
was that of Bruno Edison, 21, of Brockton, whose court records show
that he began working as a salesman, then piled up misdemeanors
before being convicted on assault and firearms charges. He was
deported six months ago, according to Teixeira.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is so much activity going on with Cape Verdeans and guns
in the Brockton area,'' Teixeira said. ``This is where a lot of
Angolans are landing. They get there with no language, no housing,
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   As they gravitate to Cape Verdeans for help with everything from
apartments to home-cooked hot sauce, Angolans are particularly
vulnerable to falling into violence, Teixeira and others say.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new arrivals are men 16 to 30 years old. Almost all
come without their parents and with few language skills, banding
together to rent affordable apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Many are more than familiar with guns, having served in or
narrowly escaped serving in a 30-year-old civil conflict between
guerrilla groups and the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to give these kids support and really watch how they
are mixing with some of these Cape Verdean youth,'' said Herberto
Agostinho, owner of Angolan BBQ in New Bedford. ``We have to make
them aware of the laws in the US, to steer them away from
violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Agostinho, 31, of Fairhaven, is an elder of this young
community. He, his wife, Selma Agostinha, and Teixeira founded the
Angolan Association of the USA, which seeks to end war in Angola as
it shepherds Angolan youth who have left war behind. The group of
about 50 began meeting in April.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his restaurant, Agostinho said that helping Angolan
youths is a delicate dance to avoid stereotypes between the two
close cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Agostinho and Teixeira have quietly encouraged Angolans to leave
Brockton and to find housing in New Bedford or other nearby areas.
At a meeting of the association last month, leaders went to pains
to explain how teens should avoid trouble without talking about the
trouble itself.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying the conversations about Cape Verdeans and crime, many
Angolans here say, is a longstanding belief that Cape Verdean
culture has tended more toward violence and drug abuse than Angolan
culture _ both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Mendes, 18, an Angolan who lives in New Bedford and works
at Agostinho's restaurant, said he has tried to draw a line between
himself and some Cape Verdean youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some are my friends, but some are always in trouble,'' he
said. ``They don't think what they could make by working hard is
enough. They want to make more. People in Angola are different.
Even at home, if you look at Cape Verdeans and Angolans in Portugal
or back home, we have never gone to this violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Monteiro, born of Cape Verdean and Angolan parents, said he
hopes the new association will be a uniting force to galvanize the
Angolan community _ something many say is missing among Cape
Verdeans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad,'' he said. ``We hear about Cape Verdeans who
come here and get into drugs. I don't know why. It's a thing I
don't like to think about, because they help us, too.''

IMMIGRATION LAW CRITICIZED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tough new US immigration policies have triggered a wave of
deportations that are disproportionately affecting people of color
and refugees from countries whose relations with the United States
have soured, according to immigration activists and attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The legal changes, which are based on two bills passed in 1996,
have made it easier for the US Immigration and Naturalization
Service to deport a broad range of people.
</P>
<P>
   INS officials say they are applying the law fairly, but
activists say cases are piling up that indicate that some races,
and people from unpopular nations, are routinely deported, while
others who commit similar offenses are not vigorously pursued.
</P>
<P>
   There are no definitive statistics. But consider: The number of
deportations in the Boston INS district rose 22 percent between
1996 and 1999. Deportations of Cape Verdeans rose 100 percent, and
of Jamaicans, 66 percent. The percentage of Britons and Russians
deported did not change at all.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, the number of deportations to Mexico have tripled,
to 150,000 last year; deportations to Latin American countries have
doubled, to between 3,000 and 4,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, authorities deported 32 people from Ireland and 86
from Russia _ nations that are widely recognized as having large
numbers of undocumented immigrants in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a general lack of evenhandedness'' in the application
of immigration law, ``and it is based on race and on politics,''
said Daniel Kanstroom, director of the Immigration and Asylum
Project at Boston College Law School. A prime example, he said, is
that authorities ``have not sought to target or infiltrate the
Irish as they have the Cape Verdeans. There are clearly as many
illegal Irish.''
</P>
<P>
   Sister Lena Deevy, director of Boston's Irish Immigration
Center, which works with diverse groups of immigrants, contends
that how the law is applied ``depends on the political relationship
between the US government and the country of origin. . . . It has
little to do with human rights. `Give me your tired, your poor' is
fine as long as it fits in with what (the leadership of) this
country wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Armando Baptista, Mahnaz Samadi, and Jezdimir Topic are
individuals whose cases illustrate what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   Baptista, 25, came from the West African nation of Cape Verde as
a young boy, had several brushes with the law, and was on his way
to a career as a street thug in Boston until, at the urging of a
priest, he turned himself in, got a job, and started helping other
youths. But today he faces deportation. His offense: A barroom
brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Samadi came to the United States six years ago with the resume
of a hero: prisoner of the fundamentalist Muslim rulers of Iran,
torture victim, freedom fighter, refugee. But she could be thrown
out soon, wearing a very different label. She has been branded a
terrorist because years ago she was a member of the resistance to
Iran's fundamentalist Muslim regime.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is Topic. The ethnic Serb served as a guard at a camp
in Bosnia where women and girls were imprisoned and abused for
being Muslim. He committed the same technical offense as Samadi _
not disclosing a military affiliation to the INS. But while Samadi
and Baptista were jailed immediately for their alleged offenses,
Topic continues to live quietly in Everett, more than a year after
his past was revealed.
</P>
<P>
   When Samadi entered the country, she did not disclose on her
immigration forms that she was a member of Iran's National Council
of Resistance. If she had, she almost certainly would still have
been granted asylum, for she did state on the forms that she was
involved in efforts to overthrow the fundamentalists, a goal with
which the US government was sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Samadi became widely known in North America as a human rights
activist. But when she returned to the United States from a trip to
Canada on April 3, she was arrested on charges that she had
obtained asylum fraudulently, by not disclosing her membership in
the Iranian group.
</P>
<P>
   Years after Samadi left the council, and at a time when the
United States was attempting to court purported moderates in Iran's
ruling circles, the State Department declared the council a
terrorist organization. Now it considers Samadi deportable for not
having disclosed her association.
</P>
<P>
   Since her arrest, Samadi has been held in jails in New York,
Georgia, Alabama, and Virginia, often in remote locations where her
attorneys and supporters could not readily contact her.
</P>
<P>
   Her treatment at the hands of immigration authorities contrasts
with that of Topic, the Serb prison camp guard.
</P>
<P>
   Three former prisoners identified Topic as a guard on the basis
of photos taken of him at the door of his home, and the immigration
service promised to investigate. Steven Farquharson, regional
director of the immigration service, said Topic's file had no
indication that he had disclosed his military service.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did not divulge'' such associations to immigration
officers overseas, ``it would be a very serious, major
consideration in revoking his refugee status and resulting in his
removal from the United States,'' Farquharson said. ``If all of
this is verified, this gentleman is going to face the serious
prospect of having his refugee status revoked.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, 16 months after Topic's past was disclosed, he remains
free, while Samadi is shuffled among rural Southern jails and is
denied bond while the case against her is processed.
</P>
<P>
   In response to inquiries about Topic, Farquharson said he
contacted immigration service headquarters and ``asked if they
could give me an update on what was going on and where the
investigation stood,'' but he received no response.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, I had tried to get a response long before this,'' he
said, ``and I did not get one.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Kraushaar, a spokeswoman at immigration service
headquarters in Washington, first said she would not comment on
details of the cases, then said the reason for the difference in
treatment ``is really very simple. Any member of a known and
recognized terrorist organization is not eligible for admission.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization to which Samadi belonged ``is among those
groups that are recognized by the State Department'' as terrorist,
``so this is a national security issue.''
</P>
<P>
   She said it did not matter whether a refugee was a member of a
group only before that group was listed as terrorist because ``the
law is retroactive.''
</P>
<P>
   The US Constitution bars Congress from passing laws that
penalize behavior that occurred before the law was passed, but the
Supreme Court has ruled that the prohibition does not apply to
civil matters such as immigration cases, and that deportation is
not a punishment under the terms of the Constitution. Those rulings
facilitated deportations of Chinese laborers in the late 19th
century and of alleged communists during the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the targets of the State Department and immigration
service are more often immigrants and refugees from the Middle East
and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Baptista is one of scores of Cape Verdeans targeted for
deportation in recent years, many for serious offenses, but many
others for relatively mild infractions that, under the 1996 laws,
were classified as ``aggravated felonies.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the guidance of a priest, the Rev. Filipe Teixeira,
Baptista turned himself in last year and was placed on probation
after, in legal parlance, he ``admitted to sufficient facts''
related to the assault charges against him. The admission was urged
by a lawyer despite Baptista's insistence that he was the victim of
an attack; the attorney subsequently said he did not know that the
admission could subject his client to mandatory deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Baptista got a job, adhered to the terms of his probation, and
began helping Teixeira reach out to other youths in trouble. But,
in February, he was arrested, jailed, and scheduled for deportation
hearings by the immigration service, which said it was acting on
information provided by a law enforcement agency it would not name.
</P>
<P>
   On June 16, Dorchester (Mass.) District Court Judge Sydney
Hanlon allowed Baptista to withdraw his admission, clearing the way
for a trial. If he is found not guilty, the grounds for deportation
will disappear. But it is unclear whether that trial can be
completed before his deportation hearing, which is scheduled for
July 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does seem to me that justice may not have been done,''
Hanlon said, explaining her reason for allowing the withdrawal.
``It seems justice may not be done in the future, but that is not
the issue before me.''

&HT;     NUMBERS MAY ADD UP TO PEACE BETWEEN ARIZONA INDIAN TRIBES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ANDREW BROWNSTEIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ For more than 120 years, the Navajo and Hopi
tribes have fought bitterly over 1.8 million acres in the northeast
corner of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   To settle the dispute, they tried guns. They tried litigation.
But math?
</P>
<P>
   Meet Jamie Manygoats. A Navajo at Union College in Schenectady,
she hopes to succeed where Congress and the courts have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Using a formula patented by a Union professor, Manygoats's
senior thesis has sparked the interest of both sides with her
algebraic solution to the long and deadly conflict.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unlikely project for Manygoats, who despite growing up
in the ``Four Corners'' region of the Southwest was sheltered from
the dispute that had caused more forced relocation than the
internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I would drive with my father and we would see
abandoned houses,'' Manygoats recalled. ``I'd say `What a nice
house. Why aren't there any people there?'''
</P>
<P>
   During her junior year at Union, she became entranced by the
voila logic of Union mathematician Alan Taylor. Taylor's formula,
called ``adjusted winner,'' holds the promise of settling disputes
ranging from divorce to the religious unrest in the Middle East
with the simple application of high school algebra.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor took to Manygoats' idea of applying his work in conflict
resolution to the turmoil in her homeland. Convincing the leaders
of the Navajo and Hopi nations was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't take to it well,'' acknowledged Manygoats. ``For
most people, the idea of using math to solve a problem, especially
one with so many deep feelings, doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Manygoats' thesis completed a historical arc begun by another
Union College student after he graduated more than 150 years ago:
Chester Arthur, the future president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was Arthur, with hope of preventing Navajo incursions against
the Hopi, who set aside 2.5 million acres in Northeastern Arizona
for the Hopi in 1882. However, he also protected ``other Indians''
who might be settled there, a vagary that set off more than a
century of conflict between the village-dwelling Hopis and
scattered Navajo sheepherders who also occupied the land.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Congress sought a precise, geometric solution to the
problem. They split the area, inhabited almost entirely by Navajos,
into two equal sides. Those on the ``wrong side'' would be
relocated.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades since, about 13,900 Navajos and 100 Hopis have
been relocated at a total cost expected to exceed $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The toll in human misery, of course, is much harder to quantify.
Some of the Navajos, who called themselves Dine (``The People''),
refused to leave the isolated, haunting land of towering mesas and
multicolored canyons.
</P>
<P>
   It is a conflict that Manygoats seems to have understood in her
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Even her name is tinged with the sad history of U.S. policy
toward American Indians. Her great-great grandfather herded more
goats than sheep, so that is the name the government gave him. Her
true name, she explained, is barely translatable into English, a
secret only to be shared with the man she marries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is their homeland and they'll do anything to save it,''
Manygoats said. ``They've used guns. They have stayed on the ground
and refused to budge.''
</P>
<P>
   In completing her thesis for graduation, the test for Manygoats
was to keep her Navajo biases at bay. Of course, that was the major
appeal of using math to solve the problem: Both sides would have to
put aside their shared history and emotions in pursuit of an
objective goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Win-Win Solution: Guaranteeing Fair Shares to
Everybody,'' Taylor and New York University Professor Steven Brams
expound on the mathematical process that landed them in the
Encyclopedia Brittanica.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of ``adjusted winner'' is to settle disputes in a
manner that is equitable, efficient and envy-free. In a two-person
dispute, for example, the sides would divvy up 100 points each on a
host of contested items. The player who assigns the highest value
to a particular item ``wins'' that object or issue.
</P>
<P>
   After the trading and splitting of some items, the two sides
would have the same number of points, both getting more than
one-half of what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In her thesis, Manygoats identified 16 items of contention
between the Hopi and the Dine. Based on research and interviews
with leaders of both parties, she assigned values to each item. The
Hopi won out on two of their highest values: getting 500,000 acres
of land from the federal government and $15 million based on
assessments made in various lawsuits. The Dine won the right to use
Hopi land to bury their dead, one of their biggest wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides chose the duration of the Dine lease on Hopi land _
now 75 years _ as their top priority. But the Dine placed more of
their points on it, so the issue went to them.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, after trading and splitting, both sides walked away
with 58.41 of their own points.
</P>
<P>
   For her thesis, Manygoats won Union's Eugene W. Hellmich
Mathematics Prize, which goes to a student preparing for a career
in teaching math. The daughter of teachers, she plans to study at
Columbia University and return to the Navajo nation to teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, it was a great application of the theory,'' said
Taylor, her mentor. ``To my knowledge, this is the first time it
has actually been put on the table in a live dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, when presented with Manygoats' thesis, leaders of
both nations agreed with her assessment of the issues and their
value.
</P>
<P>
   One might have assumed that the hard part was over, but real
life is seldom so easy. This summer, she plans to promote the idea
among tribal leaders. She describes herself as a cautious optimist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge dispute,'' she said. ``It's going to take a lot
more than my thesis to resolve it.''

&HT;     GUIDE TAKES A LOOK AT THE BIZARRE SIDE OF SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE GANAHL  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ ``The mouse is inside out!''
</P>
<P>
   Not an exclamation one would normally hear at a book-release
party, but this one was different. This party celebrated the newly
printed ``San Francisco Bizarro: A Guide to Notorious Sights, Lusty
Pursuits, and Downright Freakiness in the City by the Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   It included, among other things, a demonstration of mouse
taxidermy by Jeanie M. _ who is featured in the book _ complete
with projection screen so the packed house at Edinburgh Castle bar
could catch every grisly second of her dissection and reassembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think because I grew up on a ranch in Montana I've always
been unnaturally attracted to animals,'' said Jack Boulware,
chronicler of the city's strangest goings-on. A longtime aficionado
of all things sick and twisted, Boulware inspects one of the mice,
declaring, ``I think he looks rather happy!''
</P>
<P>
   It's true. Jeanie M. has positioned this one standing, front
legs stretched out rather like a mouse cheerleader. Jeanie M.
apparently takes orders for stuffed mice and will do them up in
costume if you like _ including the ever-popular Catholic icon
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a full-service kind of organization,'' Boulware said
wryly.
</P>
<P>
   His book, released in paperback by St. Martin's Press, contains
no fewer than 192 entries: from offbeat churches (John Coltrane's,
Anton Lavey's Church of Satan) to odd tours (of historic Black
Panther sites), newsworthy sites (where Rudolph Nuryev was busted
for pot and where Jonathan Winters wigged out) to
off-the-beaten-path tourist attractions (the Vibrator Museum, the
Tattoo Hall of Fame.)
</P>
<P>
   It is written with a strong ironic tone by the oft-hilarious
Boulware, whose last offering, ``Sex American Style'' (1997), also
caused a stir.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the book is being marketed as a tourist guide. One
very satisfied Amazon.com reader calls it ``a guide for the VERY
intrepid'' visitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone thinks of San Francisco as this dream city with a
weird undercurrent, but no one has ever done a book about that side
of it,'' said Boulware, who covered ``that side of it'' for 10
years for the SF Weekly before moving on to Salon and other
national magazines. ``So I thought, let's put it together in a
funny way, and it will be something the whole family can enjoy. Hey
kids, there's the house where the Jefferson Airplane lived!''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, he's being ironic. Don't take this book home for
your pre-teens to read unless you want them to get an early
education in the more sordid angles of Baghdad by the Bay. There
are also entries for porn palaces like the Mitchell Brothers and
for strange practices, including a diaper-wearing sex cult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that was one of my personal favorites,'' Boulware said.
``You see, there's something for every interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Displayed on the wall behind Boulware at the party were examples
of memorabilia from the book, including some beautiful blotter-acid
art. A band that plays guitars made entirely of toilet seats was
also scheduled to play, but the mouse taxidermy demonstration was
all anyone can talk about. Of course, watching it gives rise to all
kinds of bad jokes from Boulware's literary pals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pretty appropriate, really, since book sales are
mouse-driven these days,'' said the humorist Ian Shoales.
</P>
<P>
   Scottish scribe Alan Black defended the display's questionable
taste. ``Hey, we sell fish and chips don't we? Rodents deserve a
presence here, too.''

have preached the value of technology in the classroom. At the
periphery, though, is a lone voice of caution: that of William
Rukeyser, head of an anti-technology group called Learning in the
Real World. He says that research hasn't proven that technology
improves learning, and he says it's too expensive for cash-strapped
schools. ``Everybody loves to play with new toys,'' he says. ``But
the fact is, when it comes to technology in schools, there is no
Santa Claus.'' His is not a popular view at the technology

   TEXAS-CHILDHEALTH _ The first time Carla Savannah applied for
Medicaid she was pregnant. She got a lecture, but no health
coverage. ``My son's now 1 and I'm still not covered,'' said
Savannah, 18, of Austin. ``I just have bills.'' Despite three or
four tries, Savannah has not successfully navigated the complex
Medicaid system, dominated by poor women and children entitled by
federal law to health care. Although Medicaid is intended as a
safety net for the state's most vulnerable residents, the poorest
children in Texas have the hardest time getting covered. Texas
maintains some of the nation's most stringent Medicaid rules. The
restrictions are in sharp contrast to Texas' new Children's Health
Insurance Program, which serves the working poor whose incomes
generally are higher than Medicaid families. Insurance Commissioner
Jose Montemayor plans Tuesday to present the results of a survey of
Texas health insurance carriers that offer coverage to children.

   MEXICO-CARDENAS _ MEXICO CITY _ To some he's the hero of
Mexico's impoverished and oppressed. To others he's in danger of
becoming the spoiler of an historic opportunity for democratic
change. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the spiritual leader of Mexico's left,
is running in third place as Mexicans prepare to elect a new
president on Sunday, according to most pre-election opinion
surveys. This is the third time Cardenas has tried to oust the PRI,
Mexico's ruling party. This time, however, Cardenas' underdog
campaign has been eclipsed by Vicente Fox, a conservative
opposition candidate whom polls show stands a credible chance of
defeating the PRI. Fox has alternately insulted and tried to woo
Cardenas to join his campaign. But at a huge rally here Sunday
Cardenas made it clear no 11th-hour deal will be cut. He bitterly
spurned Fox's latest public plea at his own rally the night before
to join him, and thus guarantee the PRI's defeat. (Ferris, Cox News

 &HT;    COASTAL EROSION WILL TAKE MANY BUILDINGS, REPORT WARNS
 &HT;    By ROB O'DELL
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ One-fourth of the homes within 500 feet of the U.S.
shoreline will be overtaken by erosion within the next 60 years,
the Federal Emergency Management Agency warned Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest-hit areas will along the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico
coasts, magnets for residential development where some areas are
losing several feet of shoreline every year, said a five-year study
issued by FEMA.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more people are moving and building in high-risk
coastal areas, approximately 3,600 people a day, which equals an
additional 27 million people moving to these areas in the next 15
years,'' said James Lee Witt, director of FEMA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need Congress to pass legislation to require the cost of
erosion to be included when setting flood insurance rates, and to
fund FEMA's preparation of erosion maps to determine safe areas
along the coast in which to build,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   The report, which also examined the Great Lakes and Pacific
regions, predicted that rising water levels, storms and currents
would claim 87,000 buildings by 2060, including 53,000 on the
Atlantic coast and 13,000 near the Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not describe erosion rates for every coastal
location, but singled out a few areas with severe problems.
</P>
<P>
   In Texas, it said, Galveston and Brazoria counties are losing
shoreline at the rate of 5 to 6 feet per year. In Florida,
shoreline areas of Brevard and Lee counties are shrinking by an
average of one foot a year.
</P>
<P>
   The hazardous effects of erosion are illustrated by the Cape
Hatteras lighthouse in North Carolina, the report said. When it was
built in 1870, the lighthouse was 1,500 feet from shore, but by the
late 1980s it was only 160 feet from the water and was in danger of
collapsing. In 1999, the National Park Service successfully moved
the lighthouse 2,900 feet from shore at the cost of $9.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The FEMA report was ordered by Congress and prepared by the H.
John Heinz III Center for Science, Economics and the Environment, a
non-profit institution dedicated to improving the scientific and
economic foundation for environmental policy.
</P>
<P>
   It recommended two steps:
</P>
<P>
   _ Congress should provide funds to FEMA to prepare coastal
erosion maps, similar to flood plain maps now in use, to determine
safe areas along the coast for housing and other construction. It
said such mapping would cost $44 million to start up and $5 million
a year to maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost of this effort ... pales in comparison to the $530
million annual cost of erosion in the United States,'' said William
Merrell, president of the Heinz Center.
</P>
<P>
   _ Congress should require FEMA to include the anticipated cost
of erosion when setting flood insurance rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Federal Flood Insurance Program is not currently permitted
to take into account expected losses from coastal erosion,'' Witt
said. ``However, flood insurance for some coastal areas is often as
much as 50 percent lower than it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Coastal Coalition, which represents governments,
businesses and residents in coastal areas, disagreed with much of

RUSSIAN POLITICIANS ASK BELARUS LEADER TO ENSURE DEMOCRATIC
ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian parliamentary leaders said Tuesday that they
are appealing to Belarus' autocratic president to allow the
country's opposition parties to take part in all aspects of
elections this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The appeal adds significant political weight to the message,
already delivered by European leaders, that Russia shares concerns
that the future of democracy is under threat in Belarus as
repression rises. Over the past year, some opposition leaders have
disappeared, fled or been jailed on political charges, newspapers
have been shutdown and journalists harassed.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, a delegation of the European Parliament admonished
the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, who has led the
country of 10 million since his election in 1994, to open talks
with opposition parties. European leaders have threatened to
withhold sending observers to Belarus this fall unless Lukashenko
allows opposition party members to join the electoral commission
that will supervise elections and gives opposition candidates
access to the state-controlled news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are taking our obligation seriously to do everything in our
power to democratize the electoral process in Belarus,'' said Oleg
Naumov, a member of Russia's parliament from the reformist Union of
Right Forces Party. ``We are trying to avoid any ultimatum because
an ultimatum could only lead to the strengthening of the Lukashenko
regime. That is the same thing that happened with Milosevic in
Yugoslavia.''
</P>
<P>
   The final draft of the appeal, which was coordinated with but
not openly endorsed by the Kremlin, will carry the signatures of
Yevgeny Primakov, head of the Fatherland-All Russia Party; Boris
Gryzlov, leader of the Unity Party, which is most closely aligned
with President Vladimir Putin; and the leaders of the Yabloko and
Union of Right Forces parties.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday evening, only the Communist Party leader, Gennadi
Zyuganov, had not signed the appeal, but organizers said the
Communists might yet sign the document before it is sent to Minsk,
the Belarussian capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced that the legislation for elections to the
Belarussian parliament must meet international standards, and the
vote should be democratic and fair,'' the appeal says. The document
calls on Lukashenko to form electoral commissions across the
country with the participation of all registered parties and to
grant them equal access to the state-run media.
</P>
<P>
   Lukashenko was in Moscow Tuesday to meet with Putin in a
gathering of the Supreme State Council of the Union of Belarus and
Russia. The union was sealed last December by Lukashenko and former
President Boris Yeltsin, and though it leaves both countries
independent it provides for integration of economic and security
policies.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and Lukashenko made no public comments Tuesday about the
looming confrontation over the elections in Belarus.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Minsk, Yuri Khodyko, deputy chairman of the opposition
People's Front, told reporters that it makes sense to take part in
elections that really give voters the right to choose. But based on
Lukashenko's statements thus far, he said, the opposition fears
that he is planning to hold a farce, not elections.
</P>
<P>
   Belarussian opposition leaders came to Moscow last week to seek
assistance from liberal party leaders to put pressure on
Lukashenko. ``This is our first step in giving assistance to the
democratic forces in Belarus,'' said Naumov of the Union of Right
Forces, ``and we thought it was very important that this appeal to
Lukashenko not come only from two parties but from all nine
factions in the Russian legislative body.''

<P>
   SCHENECTADY, N.Y. _ For more than 120 years, the Navajo and Hopi
tribes have fought bitterly over 1.8 million acres in the northeast
corner of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   To settle the dispute, they tried guns. They tried litigation.
But math?
</P>
<P>
   Meet Jaime Manygoats. A Navajo at Union College in Schenectady,
she hopes to succeed where Congress and the courts have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Using a formula patented by a Union professor, Manygoats's
senior thesis has sparked the interest of both sides with her
algebraic solution to the long and deadly conflict.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unlikely project for Manygoats, who despite growing up
in the ``Four Corners'' region of the Southwest was sheltered from
the dispute that had caused more forced relocation than the
internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, I would drive with my father and we would see
abandoned houses,'' Manygoats recalled. ``I'd say `What a nice
house. Why aren't there any people there?'''
</P>
<P>
   During her junior year at Union, she became entranced by the
voila logic of Union mathematician Alan Taylor. Taylor's formula,
called ``adjusted winner,'' holds the promise of settling disputes
ranging from divorce to the religious unrest in the Middle East
with the simple application of high school algebra.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor took to Manygoats' idea of applying his work in conflict
resolution to the turmoil in her homeland. Convincing the leaders
of the Navajo and Hopi nations was another matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't take to it well,'' acknowledged Manygoats. ``For
most people, the idea of using math to solve a problem, especially
one with so many deep feelings, doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Manygoats' thesis completed a historical arc begun by another
Union College student after he graduated more than 150 years ago:
Chester Arthur, the future president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It was Arthur, with hope of preventing Navajo incursions against
the Hopi, who set aside 2.5 million acres in Northeastern Arizona
for the Hopi in 1882. However, he also protected ``other Indians''
who might be settled there, a vagary that set off more than a
century of conflict between the village-dwelling Hopis and
scattered Navajo sheepherders who also occupied the land.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, Congress sought a precise, geometric solution to the
problem. They split the area, inhabited almost entirely by Navajos,
into two equal sides. Those on the ``wrong side'' would be
relocated.
</P>
<P>
   In the decades since, about 13,900 Navajos and 100 Hopis have
been relocated at a total cost expected to exceed $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The toll in human misery, of course, is much harder to quantify.
Some of the Navajos, who called themselves Dine (``The People''),
refused to leave the isolated, haunting land of towering mesas and
multicolored canyons.
</P>
<P>
   It is a conflict that Manygoats seems to have understood in her
blood.
</P>
<P>
   Even her name is tinged with the sad history of U.S. policy
toward American Indians. Her great-great grandfather herded more
goats than sheep, so that is the name the government gave him. Her
true name, she explained, is barely translatable into English, a
secret only to be shared with the man she marries.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is their homeland and they'll do anything to save it,''
Manygoats said. ``They've used guns. They have stayed on the ground
and refused to budge.''
</P>
<P>
   In completing her thesis for graduation, the test for Manygoats
was to keep her Navajo biases at bay. Of course, that was the major
appeal of using math to solve the problem: Both sides would have to
put aside their shared history and emotions in pursuit of an
objective goal.
</P>
<P>
   In the ``Win-Win Solution: Guaranteeing Fair Shares to
Everybody,'' Taylor and New York University Professor Steven Brams
expound on the mathematical process that landed them in the
Encyclopedia Brittanica.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of ``adjusted winner'' is to settle disputes in a
manner that is equitable, efficient and envy-free. In a two-person
dispute, for example, the sides would divvy up 100 points each on a
host of contested items. The player who assigns the highest value
to a particular item ``wins'' that object or issue.
</P>
<P>
   After the trading and splitting of some items, the two sides
would have the same number of points, both getting more than
one-half of what they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   In her thesis, Manygoats identified 16 items of contention
between the Hopi and the Dine. Based on research and interviews
with leaders of both parties, she assigned values to each item. The
Hopi won out on two of their highest values: getting 500,000 acres
of land from the federal government and $15 million based on
assessments made in various lawsuits. The Dine won the right to use
Hopi land to bury their dead, one of their biggest wishes.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides chose the duration of the Dine lease on Hopi land _
now 75 years _ as their top priority. But the Dine placed more of
their points on it, so the issue went to them.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, after trading and splitting, both sides walked away
with 58.41 of their own points.
</P>
<P>
   For her thesis, Manygoats won Union's Eugene W. Hellmich
Mathematics Prize, which goes to a student preparing for a career
in teaching math. The daughter of teachers, she plans to study at
Columbia University and return to the Navajo nation to teach.
</P>
<P>
   ``All in all, it was a great application of the theory,'' said
Taylor, her mentor. ``To my knowledge, this is the first time it
has actually been put on the table in a live dispute.''
</P>
<P>
   Amazingly, when presented with Manygoats' thesis, leaders of
both nations agreed with her assessment of the issues and their
value.
</P>
<P>
   One might have assumed that the hard part was over, but real
life is seldom so easy. This summer, she plans to promote the idea
among tribal leaders. She describes herself as a cautious optimist.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge dispute,'' she said. ``It's going to take a lot
more than my thesis to resolve it.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even Jane Fonda, who made millions by selling
videotapes promoting exercise as the way to slim down and catch a
man, now says she regrets their implied message that happiness
depends upon being thin.
</P>
<P>
   Hooray, it is finally happening. It is occurring to people that
maybe we aren't what we eat after all. Instead, we are what we
think. Our heads and hearts are more important than our size.
</P>
<P>
   Among government and private nutritionists, women's magazine
writers and the owners of pleasingly plump figures, a backlash is
beginning against the bag-of-bones look popularized by models and
female television stars.
</P>
<P>
   How far this will go is anyone's guess. Fashion designers who
prefer to drape fabrics over a toothpick on legs have yet to be
heard from. But their influence is waning in a world in which
substantial cleavage increasingly competes for attention with a
wasp waist.
</P>
<P>
   We are a nation obsessed with our weight, forking over millions
every year for fad diets, liposuction, pills, treadmills, anything
that promises a flat belly by tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   But there is plenty of evidence that this is a never-ending
struggle. Is the time and energy expended worth it, to say nothing
of the grumbles from an unfulfilled stomach? Can we find a
middle-weight ground here?
</P>
<P>
   Few of us are naturally thin with the busy metabolism that
allows us to be as lazy and eat and drink as much as we want and
never gain a pound. And the argument has raged for years over which
body weight is best for which person and why.
</P>
<P>
   The food frenzy has escalated in recent months. Newsweek moans
this week that our kids are too fat, for the same reasons adults
are overweight _ too much to eat and too little exercise to work
off the calories.
</P>
<P>
   Several women's magazines have begun questioning the health of
stars so skinny that their heads look like lollipops on stick
bodies. If they are anorexic, they are truly sick from an eating
disorder. But of course the lollipops all deny it and insist they
are thin through clean living.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble is that young girls searching for love or fame look
up to these impossibly thin women and want to be like them.
</P>
<P>
   People magazine earlier this month surveyed competing celebrity
diets and concluded that despite the hype it isn't easy sticking to
them or keeping the weight off.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest success story seems to be Sarah Ferguson, the
duchess of York, who is a paid Weight Watchers shill and takes her
role seriously, slimming down from a size 14 to a size 10. Monica
Lewinsky, alas, was not such a great role model for Jenny Craig and
was dropped as a spokeswoman after failing to meet her pound-loss
criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are also speaking out against the obsession with being
skinny. A month ago, the British Medical Association officially
blamed the media clamor over the superwaifs of fashion for a
pattern of health problems in British girls trying to imitate them.
Last year, the American Medical Association issued a report urging
the television, movie and magazine industries to employ models and
actresses whose poundage could be described as healthy, not
underweight.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the Board of Supervisors in San Francisco, a socially
pioneering city, passed an ordinance making it illegal to
discriminate against a person based on physical size, a category
left somewhat vague. It was clearly a strike for fat acceptance, at
least in principle.
</P>
<P>
   It might come as a shock to think that as a nation we could
admire thickened waistlines and middle-aged paunches as badges of
honor, not ugly signs of overindulgence. But one survey shows that
62 percent of American women wear at least a size 12. Such a large
majority is hard to ignore, let alone put down. A few retail stores
and female-oriented magazines are beginning to promote larger sizes
and use what are delicately called full-figured models.
</P>
<P>
   Rubens lovingly painted women whose bodily curves, hills and
valleys concealed those sharp-angled bones that are now in fashion.
His models looked pretty sexy in paint.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble for modern young women is that such lushness doesn't
look sexy on television; it looks tubby. But we'd be better off
getting used to it.

   Editors, managing editors, wire editors:
</P>
<P>
   Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six weeks, The New York
Times has been publishing a series of articles, ``How Race Is Lived
in America.'' The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort by a
team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of ordinary
people and some of the troubling issues that Americans continue to
face. These stories, two or three each week, will be approximately
6,000-7,000 words. The News Service will move each story in
advance, and an abridged version will also move, at approximately
3,000 words. They will move in the ``a'' news category and will
carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. Because the articles are
organized into chapters, papers with severe space restraints may
choose to spread a single article over several days.
</P>
<P>
   This article, originally intended for papers of Tuesday, June
22, is for papers of Thursday, June 29, and will be filed today:
</P>
<P>
   RACE-PAPER (Akron, Ohio) _ In New York in 1994, Carl Chancellor
and Bob Dyer looked like tourists, snapping pictures at the Statue
of Liberty, savoring Jamaican food at a trendy restaurant, clinking
beer bottles and wineglasses in heady toasts back at their hotel.
More than tourists, they were colleagues out on the town
celebrating. Chancellor and Dyer were part of a team of reporters
for The Akron Beacon Journal that had explored the racial attitudes
of this city of 215,000 people. Their series earned the paper
journalism's big award, the Pulitzer Prize. In Akron, there were
congratulatory speeches for a staff that had united behind the
series and gloried in having been a healing force in the city. The
Beacon Journal also tried to lead by example. Shortly after the
series ended, it introduced a lineup of columnists reflecting ``the
perfect demographic,'' as Dyer put it. They included a black woman
and a white woman as well as Chancellor, who is black, and Dyer,
who is white. The paper, it seemed, had become a proud model of
racial enlightenment. Which made it all the more startling when,
just a year later, the jubilation began to fade _ for the men and
the newsroom. Troubled by the state of race relations, The Beacon
Journal had gone further than most newspapers to investigate the
gap between blacks and whites and to understand why it had not
closed. It found mistrust and misperceptions, frustrations and
tensions; it even looked inward, discovering much the same in its
own newsroom. It had found, it seemed, a way to talk about race.
And yet even here, in a place where men and women make a living
seeking answers to questions and using words well, communication
can break down. And race still seeps back in. Many among the 157
people on the news staff _ 15 percent of whom are black and 4
percent other minorities _ say that although the city's racial
climate may have improved because of the series, seven years later,
the newspaper itself has shown less progress. By Dana Canedy. (6240

more complex one has replaced it, and now the system rewards

`THE PATRIOT': `LETHAL WEAPON' CIRCA 1776 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Production notes appear at end of review.)  
 By ELVIS MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Revolutionary War epic ``The Patriot,'' Mel Gibson is
Benjamin Martin, a gentle farmer in his 40s whose eyes glimmer with
love for his family. Among the film's assets are Gibson's
complicated love for his own children, who are similar to his brood
in the film, ranging in age from very young to teen-age. This may
seem trivial, but it's a theme that most contemporary movies, with
their incessant focus on prolonged adolescence, avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson shows an on-screen comfort and expansiveness he has not
revealed before. He's an astonishing actor for someone whose
technique all seems to come from the outside. Sometimes his
suffering can be a little glib, but he relates to the performers
playing his children, even the somewhat remote hunk Heath Ledger,
who plays Gabriel, the eldest son and the one most like his dad. In
their scenes together, Gibson almost seems to be directing Ledger
on screen, and the younger actor responds with an exasperated
bashfulness that makes him less cool and more likable.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise this sort of prequel to ``Independence Day'' (1996)
from that film's director, Roland Emmerich, is a gruesome hybrid, a
mix of sentimentality and brutality that suggests a ``Lethal
Weapon'' movie directed by Norman Rockwell. Assembled like an
entire season of a television series crammed into a
less-than-compact 158 minutes, ``The Patriot'' is shamelessly
stirring, brandishing Gibson's anguished masculinity like a musket.
It may be effective, but you leave the theater feeling used.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is simple: Gabriel is determined to enlist in the
action against the British. Benjamin is determined to keep his boy
out of the fighting and stay out of it himself. ``Why should I
trade a tyrant 3,000 miles away for 3,000 tyrants one mile away?''
Benjamin asks.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other Gibson characters, Benjamin is a man with a
Past. He has renounced violence because he's good at it. ``I have
long feared that my sins will come to visit me and that the costs
will be more than I can bear,'' he says in a narration at the
beginning, repeating the line later in the film.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, as they say in action movies, it's personal. When
he's forced to join the battle against the British, he grabs his
muskets and hatchet and makes fast, ruthless work of his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Emmerich exploits Gibson's physical directness with the same
ruthlessness. He's the best actor ever to work consistently in
action pictures, which is not a backhanded compliment, and he uses
the same intensity of concentration with machinery that he does
with people. This early scene, which should be shocking because
Benjamin grabs up two of his young sons and puts weapons in their
hands, is ugly because Emmerich accentuates the smoothness of the
assault. He is a competent action director, but he can't balance
action and contrasting emotion the way that Gibson does
effortlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin's efficient campaign prompts the merciless British
commander, Col. Tavington (Jason Isaacs), whose one-dimensional
evil is as old as the Revolutionary War, to smirk, ``He sounds more
like a ghost than a man.'' Benjamin soon gathers a small, ragtag
band of fellow fighters, and his stealthy methods begin to take a
heavy toll on the enemy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot'' seems even longer than it is because about a
third of it takes place in slow motion, as if the violence weren't
enough in itself, and the primitive weapons ensure that there's
plenty of face-to-face carnage. The film tries to emulate
``Braveheart'' and the extremely photogenic running and
bloodletting of ``The Last of the Mohicans,'' but it cannot be
favorably compared with either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot'' pits the scrappy young rebels against the
waistcoated British, who with their old-fashioned way of sending
men into battle belong in ``Jurassic Park'' with the velociraptors.
So does some of the script, which wants to celebrate the glory of
1776 America but ignores the less tidy aspect of its politics. Thus
we have the willful anachronism of Benjamin and his group hiding
out with a group of African-Americans who are so enlightened in
dress and lifestyle that the scene might be from an Erykah Badu
video.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that no one's going to make a movie that would
depict its hero as a proponent of slavery, so ``The Patriot'' has
other, sillier touches, like a racist lout (Donal Logue) who looks
down his nose at a slave who joins the group but who comes to
respect the black man. The movie is well cast, though some of the
actors, like Chris Cooper, are even given lines that sound as if
they come from a Ken Burns film. But ``The Patriot'' is a slow,
somber epic, or rather it is presented slowly and somberly, as if
such staging could give it substance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying
parent or adult guardian). It has extended and numerous depictions
of bloody violence and suffering.

HERB POLENTA WITH RED BELL PEPPER SAUCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the second of eight columns by Michel Richard, the chef
and owner of Citronelle in Washington. They are being written with
Marian Burros.)  
 By MICHEL RICHARD with MARIAN BURROS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was a child in the Champagne region, my mother served us
a dessert called gateau de semoule. It may sound exotic, but it's
really just semolina, the same as the American breakfast cereal
Cream of Wheat. Its grainy, creamy texture was so soothing.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, I was working in Paris for Gaston Lenotre, the
great pastry chef; he mixed semolina with olive oil and Parmesan to
make gnocchi alla Romana. They were tender and light, and I much
preferred them to regular gnocchi, which I find too gummy. I
suppose those two memories are the reason I make my polenta with
Cream of Wheat instead of cornmeal. I prefer the smoother texture
of Cream of Wheat to the rougher texture of cornmeal, probably
because it reminds me of my childhood, and Lenotre.
</P>
<P>
   In this dish, I combine my mother's cooking method with the way
polenta is made _ fortifying the grain with eggs and other flavors,
then chilling it and slicing it into rectangles. If you want to
make the polenta lighter, add an extra egg or two.
</P>
<P>
   You can also vary the herbs. I like the anise flavor of fennel
combined with the sweetly grassy, slightly peppery flavor of basil.
But you can also use tarragon _ just don't cut it too finely or it
will oxidize. Thyme would work too, but add it only after baking;
otherwise it will taste like soap. Try sticking a sprig of thyme
into the polenta after you have plated it, and then put the dish
back in the oven just long enough to heat the plate and enhance the
aroma.
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant, I serve sliced polenta with foie gras and
duck jus. Most people don't want to cook foie gras at home, so I've
created a red pepper sauce. Peppers sweeten when you cook them, and
the sauce adds brightness to polenta's creaminess.
</P>
<P>
   HERB POLENTA WITH RED BELL PEPPER SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 45 minutes, plus 2 to 24 hours' chilling
</P>
<P>
   For the herb polenta:
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup milk
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   { cup regular (10 minute) Cream of Wheat
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   \ cup plus 2 tablespoons finely grated Parmigiano-Reggiano
</P>
<P>
   1 well-packed cup thinly shredded spinach leaves
</P>
<P>
   12 large basil leaves, thinly shredded
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons finely chopped parsley or chervil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Sprigs of fresh oregano, for garnish
</P>
<P>
   For the red bell pepper sauce: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 large red bell pepper
</P>
<P>
   { anchovy, chopped, or { teaspoon anchovy paste, optional
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   \ cup chicken stock or broth, or as needed
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable oil for baking sheet.
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare herb polenta: Line an 8-by-8-inch pan with plastic
wrap, and set aside. In a medium saucepan, combine olive oil, milk
and 1 clove chopped garlic. Place over high heat to bring to a
boil, then remove from heat. Whisk in Cream of Wheat until well
blended. Return to high heat, and whisk until thickened but still
pourable. Remove from heat, and whisk in eggs. Return to heat, and
stir in \ cup cheese, the spinach, basil, parsley, and salt and
pepper to taste. Stir the mixture until thickened and no longer
pourable.
</P>
<P>
   2. Immediately spoon mixture into plastic-lined pan, smoothing
with a piece of plastic wrap to make a flat, even surface. Cover
and refrigerate until chilled and solid, 2 to 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   3. While polenta is chilling, prepare red bell pepper sauce.
Preheat a broiler. Place red bell pepper under broiler, turning
occasionally until blackened on all sides. Allow to cool. Peel and
seed pepper, cut into pieces and place in a blender. Add anchovy,
garlic and olive oil, and process until smooth. Add just enough
chicken stock to make a thick but fluid sauce. Transfer mixture to
a small saucepan over medium-low heat. Season with sugar and salt
and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer, remove from heat and keep
warm.
</P>
<P>
   4. To serve, preheat a broiler. Remove polenta from plastic, and
cut into 12 rectangles. Place on an oiled baking sheet and allow to
return to room temperature. Sprinkle with remaining 2 tablespoons
cheese. Broil until polenta is heated and cheese is lightly
browned. Place 2 pieces of polenta on each of 6 plates, and top
with a portion of sauce. Garnish with oregano sprigs, and serve
immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 6 servings.

FAST KIMCHI IN HOT TIMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK BITTMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like so many fermented products _ cheese, wine and pickles, for
example _ kimchi began as a way of preserving a bounty that would
otherwise go bad. Anyone who has seen the huge piles of cabbage
harvested annually in Korea knows that it cannot all be eaten in
the next days or weeks. Pickling allows the cabbage to be kept for
months.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a tradition of making kimchi for immediate
consumption, although even that might be more work than most people
would want on a weeknight. But it is easy enough to take the basic
ingredients and flavors of kimchi and create a fast cabbage salad
that puts ordinary coleslaw to shame. Use this as a bed for grilled
beef _ or anything else that has the flavor to stand up to it _ and
you have a great summer dish.
</P>
<P>
   Quick kimchi takes very little work, but the cabbage is best if
salted and allowed to sit for an hour or longer, drawing out excess
water and making the cabbage ultracrisp. Skip that step if you're
pressed for time; the salad will taste just as good.
</P>
<P>
   All kimchi packs a punch, thanks to plenty of garlic and chili
peppers, and I have included appropriate quantities of those here.
You can increase the amounts if you like, though many people will
find these proportions strong enough.
</P>
<P>
   If you can get to a Korean market, buy some of the ground chili
powder labeled co chu karo, which is hot but also flavorful.
Otherwise substitute any good ground chilies or crushed red pepper
flakes. Fish sauce is traditional (in truth, dried oysters or dried
shrimp are traditional, but fish sauce has the same character),
although you can use soy sauce if you prefer.
</P>
<P>
   I grill the flank steak with nothing but salt and pepper; a
drizzle of the salad dressing on top gives it plenty of additional
flavor. Grilled pork, shrimp, tuna or chicken (legs, for best
flavor) would also be good.
</P>
<P>
   GRILLED FLANK STEAK WITH KIMCHI-STYLE COLESLAW
</P>
<P>
   Time: About an hour, plus at least one hour's resting
</P>
<P>
   1 small head Napa or Savoy cabbage, about 1{ pounds
</P>
<P>
   Coarse salt
</P>
<P>
   3 spring onions or 6 large scallions, trimmed and chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 cloves garlic, minced, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon co chu karo or crushed red pepper flakes, or to
taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon peeled and minced ginger
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons fish sauce or soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons rice wine or other vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 flank steak, about 1{ pounds
</P>
<P>
   Ground black pepper.
</P>
<P>
   1. Remove tough exterior leaves of cabbage; core it by cutting a
cone-shape wedge out of the stem end. Shred cabbage into thin
strips, and separate the strips by hand. Put in a colander, and
toss with about 1 tablespoon salt and the onions or scallions. Let
sit for at least an hour, preferably two, tossing occasionally,
until cabbage wilts.
</P>
<P>
   2. Meanwhile, prepare a grill. Combine garlic, co chu karo,
ginger, fish sauce and vinegar in a bowl. Grill steak for about 4
minutes to a side for medium rare (more time or less according to
the degree of doneness you prefer), turning once. Sprinkle steak
with salt and pepper as it cooks.
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove steak from grill, and let it rest. Squeeze as much
liquid as you can out of the cabbage, and toss it with dressing. To
serve, carve steak. Place a portion of cabbage on a plate, and top
with slices of steak. Spoon a little dressing over steak, and
serve.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

PROOF THAT THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN'T BE IMPROVED 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMANDA HESSER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Measuring spoons have a clear purpose and a simple design that
you would think should be foolproof. And yet, aside from the food
processor with all of its parts, there may be no other tool that
can be more of a pain in the neck to use and clean. There are those
bound by an inseparable ring, so that every time you use one, you
must clean them all. There are others with seams that catch specks
of flour or grease, and those that inevitably spill their contents
when set down on a counter.
</P>
<P>
   CuisiPro, in New Castle, Del., did something about these
problems. Its spoon set is held together by a ring with a separable
joint. Each spoon is made of a single piece of stainless steel, so
there are no seams, and has a long, narrow head to fit into all
sorts of bottles and jars. The most innovative feature, though, is
a handle that curves downward at the end, so when you put a spoon
down, it sits level.
</P>
<P>
   The spoons also have gentle curves and a nice heft. Why not have
something that's pleasurable to hold as you dutifully measure
something down to the last eighth of a teaspoon?
</P>
<P>
   CuisiPro measuring spoons are $6.98 at Zabar's, 2245 Broadway
(80th Street), New York, (212) 787-2000. Call CuisiPro for
locations of other stores: (302) 326-4802.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I spent the first 18 years of my life in Baltimore, and not once
did I eat pit beef. I am not particularly proud of this fact, but
it does reflect the parochialism of the region's food. I grew up in
the suburb of Pikesville, Md., and the foods of my childhood
embraced the four C's of Baltimore gastronomy: crab, corned beef,
coddies (leaden cakes of codfish and potatoes) and chocolate tops
(cookies crowned with a rosette of chocolate icing).
</P>
<P>
   Pit beef came from a working-class neighborhood on the east side
of town, which for me might as well have been another planet.
</P>
<P>
   Pit beef is Baltimore's version of barbecue: beef grilled crusty
on the outside, rare and juicy inside and heaped high on a
sandwich. Several things make it distinctive in the realm of
American barbecue.
</P>
<P>
   For starters, pit beef is grilled, not smoked, so it lacks the
heavy hickory or mesquite flavor characteristic of Texas- or Kansas
City-style barbecue. It is also ideally served rare, which would be
unthinkable for a Texas-style brisket. Baltimore pit bosses use top
round, not brisket, and to make this flavorful but tough cut of
beef tender, they shave it paper-thin on a meat slicer.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the bread: The proper way to serve pit beef is on a
kaiser roll or, more distinctively, on rye bread. The caraway seeds
in the rye reflect the Eastern European ancestry of many
Baltimoreans in this part of town and add an aromatic, earthy
flavor to the beef.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there is the sauce. No ketchup, brown sugar and liquid
smoke, as you would find in Kansas City. No Texas-style chili
hellfire or piquant vinegar sauces in the style of North Carolina.
The proper condiment for Baltimore pit beef is horseradish sauce _
as much as you can bear without crying. And speaking of crying, you
need slices of crisp, pungent white onion to make the sandwich
complete.
</P>
<P>
   The center of Baltimore pit beef is an industrial thoroughfare
called Pulaski Highway, also known as Route 40. As you drive east
out of the city, you pass truck stops, tractor dealerships and
inexpensive motels. Nestled among them are the simple roadside
eateries that purvey pit beef.
</P>
<P>
   You could stop at one of the best known, Chaps, a white
cinder-block building with picnic table seating. It has been
cooking old-fashioned pit beef _ over blazing charcoal _ since
1987. Or you could head for Big Al's, where every pit beef sandwich
comes with a nugget of Italian hot sausage.
</P>
<P>
   For my money, there's no better place to sample pit beef than
Big Fat Daddy's in Rosedale, Md., next to a country-Western dance
hall named Little Texas. To call Big Fat Daddy's a restaurant would
be stretching. The ``dining room'' is a yellow and red tent with
plastic siding. The pit (a gas and lava stone grill) is housed in a
cinder block building not much bigger than a closet. You place your
order at the window and dine at a picnic table, watching the
traffic rumble by.
</P>
<P>
   Big Fat Daddy's takes its name from Brian Schafer, 31, a ruddy
barbecue entrepreneur. He is big, all right, tipping the scales at
280 pounds. But he has shed 65 pounds since he opened the eatery in
1996 and worked 100 hours a week, running the restaurant and a
catering business. ``I got tired of working for other people,'' he
said. ``I thought I could do things a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   If perfection lies in attention to detail, the details
distinguish Big Fat Daddy's from the other pit beef emporiums.
Schafer rubs his beef with a tangy mixture of seasoned salt,
pepper, oregano, garlic powder and paprika, and he lets the meat
sit in the rub for three days. (Most Baltimore pit beef is grilled
without all this.) When he makes a sandwich, he takes the time to
slice a few burnt edges (the charred crust) to mix with the rare
beef, thus adding smoke, crunch and flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Most pit beef places serve bottled prepared horseradish, but
Schafer makes his own sauce, a rich, creamy confection of
horseradish and mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   Regulars may miss the old days, when Big Fat Daddy's grilled its
beef over charcoal. Schafer switched to gas two years ago, he said,
because ``we got tired of looking like we cooked in a coal mine.''
</P>
<P>
   These touches have brought big success. In the summer, Big Fat
Daddy's goes through 40 top rounds (each weighing 25 pounds) a
week. That is enough to serve 3,000 to 4,000 sandwiches, at $4
each, every week.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore pit beef isn't difficult to prepare at home and makes
a nice switch from the usual ribs and brisket for a party. The only
real challenge is slicing the beef thin enough. If you have a meat
slicer, you will have no problem. If not, a thin-slicing disc on a
food processor will do the trick. Cut the roast in pieces small
enough to fit into the feed tube. Or, just slice the meat as thin
as possible by hand, then chop it with a cleaver.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe here will give you eight two-fisted sandwiches. The
rub is based on the seasoning mix used at Big Fat Daddy's. Lettuce
and tomatoes are optional.
</P>
<P>
   This Baltimore boy never knew what he was missing.

<HEADLINE>
STILL LOOKING FOR NEW VINEYARDS TO CONQUER 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the most remarkable figures in the French wine business,
Jean-Michel Cazes, has retired at 65. Sort of. In 1986, when the
conventional wisdom held that most French businessmen were still
trapped in the dark ages, Cazes was already well ahead of the
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   With his friend Claude Bebear, Cazes was running a successful
insurance agency in Pauillac, in the center of the Bordeaux wine
country. He was also the owner of Chateau Lynch-Bages and other
wine properties. Bebear was the president and managing director of
Axa, a huge insurance group. The two had met in the 1950s when they
were students and playing rugby in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Axa had decided to get into the wine business, and Bebear asked
his friend about buying Cantenac Brown, a well-known wine chateau
in Bordeaux. Cazes told him to do it. But another group, Compagnie
du Midi, outbid Axa. Bebear waited and then bought Compagnie du
Midi.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he asked Cazes to head a new subsidiary called
Axa-Millesimes, formed expressly for buying and developing wine
properties. Under French law, insurance companies must invest part
of their assets in French real estate. In the 1980s, as the
Bordeaux wine trade came out of a decade's slump, the big insurance
companies began to move. As a French newspaper said at the time:
``They bought Paris, then they bought the forests; now they want to
buy Bordeaux.''
</P>
<P>
   Working together, Bebear and Cazes assembled a top-line
portfolio, which includes the Pichon-Longueville Baron, Cantenac
Brown, Suduiraut and Petit Village chateaus in Bordeaux and, moving
away from France, the Quinta do Noval, a Port producer in the Duoro
Valley in Portugal, and the Disznoko estate in Hungary, which makes
Tokay.
</P>
<P>
   They are always attracted by high-quality properties.
</P>
<P>
   Cazes took on Axa-Millesimes while continuing to manage his
family's holdings, which include Lynch-Bages, Chateau Les Ormes de
Pez in St.-Estephe and Villa Belair, a chateau in the Graves
region, south of Bordeaux. Of course, there is still the insurance
agency in Pauillac and, almost next door to Lynch-Bages, where he
lives, Chateau Cordeillan-Bages, once a minor wine estate and now
an elegant small hotel and restaurant, with its own vineyard and a
wine school.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch-Bages is the jewel in the Cazes diadem. In the famous 1855
classification of the 60 top Bordeaux chateaus, it was placed in
the fifth or lowest group. Under Cazes, Lynch-Bages has become one
of the finest of the rated chateaus. Today, it is informally
considered among the best of the original 60.
</P>
<P>
   Cazes' retirement implies no change in his frantic pace. It
means only that he is 65, and Axa says he has to give up that side
of his life. His friend Claude Bebear has to go, too.
</P>
<P>
   The Cazes family was not born to the chateau life. It came from
the Pyrenees, near the Spanish border, farmers and shepherds for
centuries. The first Cazes to arrive in the Bordeaux region in the
mid-1800s was named Jean. His second son, Jean-Charles Cazes,
became a baker, worked for a bank and then opened his insurance
agency in 1927. In 1933, he became a tenant farmer at Lynch-Bages,
buying it outright five years later. In 1940, he bought Les Ormes
de Pez.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Cazes, his son and Jean-Michel's father, took over the
insurance business in 1945, after five years as a prisoner of war
of the Germans. In 1949, Andre Cazes was elected mayor of Pauillac,
a post he held for 42 years.
</P>
<P>
   Jean-Michel Cazes planned a life away from Bordeaux and wine.
After graduating from France's MIT, the Ecole National des Mines in
Paris, he spent a year studying petroleum engineering at the
University of Texas in Austin. Back in France and in the Air Force,
he was exposed to computers for the first time, which led to 12
years with IBM in Paris. By 1973, his father needed help in
Pauillac, and the younger Cazes went home. They began a 15-year
renovation program at Lynch-Bages and Les Ormes de Pez.
</P>
<P>
   They decided, too, to make Lynch-Bages a top quality wine. A
second label was created, Haut-Bages-Averous, and henceforth only
the best vats of wines were used in Lynch-Bages. The rest went, as
it does today, into Haut-Bages-Averous.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a century, Bordeaux was dominated by a small,
clannish and powerful group of merchants who bought the wine from
each chateau, aged it and bottled it in their own cellars on a
section of the Bordeaux waterfront known as the Quai des Chartrons.
The Chartronnais, as they were called, set prices, lent money and
called in mortgages at will.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first to break the stranglehold of the Chartronnais
was Baron Philippe de Rothschild, at Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, who
insisted on bottling and selling his own wine. Alexis Lichine is
often credited with dragging the old conservatives into the 20th
century with his use of marketing and promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Cazes, partly with Axa's help but mostly on his own, has
emphasized the global dimensions of the Bordeaux wine trade. Thanks
in part to his example, the younger Bordelais are as comfortable
flying off to Bangkok for a sales meeting as their fathers were
dashing off to London for a couple of Savile Row suits.
</P>
<P>
   Cazes still has a seat on the Axa Millesimes board. He also owns
a wine wholesaling business and part of a company that makes wine
management software. He is grand master of the Commanderie du
Bontemps, a chateau owners promotional group.
</P>
<P>
   He is also looking at vineyard and winery investments around the
world, including other properties in Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   But he insisted: ``I am going to cut back. Really. I'm going to
retire from my insurance business next year, and my wife and I are
going to travel more.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyway,'' he added, almost guiltily, ``the Internet, e-mail
and a good connection allow everyone to keep in touch from
anywhere.'' Some retirement.

HOWARD COSELL, SPEAKING OF SPORTS ...  
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD SANDOMIR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hello again, everyone, this is Howard Cosell speaking of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Crude, vulgar, obnoxious, truculent, verbose, condescending, a
wiseacre.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Dennis Miller is all of these things.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written by print reporters, that seedy lot of
hangers-on, about Miller, in essence, replacing me on ABC's
``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   What a tribute to my palpable impact and how right I was for my
times that I have been irreplaceable for 16 seasons. Would that
young Dennis handle my halftime highlights, a historic
demonstration of ad-libbing proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Young Dennis is quite the mischievous monkey on his weekly HBO
program. I watched it Friday night and I have rarely in my
illustrious career, with my full knowledge of constitutional law,
listened to somebody in greater need of a First Amendment defense
lawyer. I don't blush easily, but young Dennis articulated
vulgarities 18 times in a mere 30 minutes. Young Dennis informed
viewers that ``golly'' will be his ``Monday Night'' code for a
famous epithet.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the Danderoo ever took such reckless verbal risks.
</P>
<P>
   I have not been so appalled _ so horrified, so assaulted _ since
Nov. 26, 1982 _ the Houston Astrodome _ when Larry Holmes
brutalized _ even destroyed _ a defenseless and desperately
untalented Randall ``Tex'' Cobb for 12 dehumanizing rounds.
</P>
<P>
   It is unsurprising to this reporter that Don Ohlmeyer, a man I
greatly respect, turned to young Dennis to save ``Monday Night
Football.'' But he doubtlessly got the idea from yours truly: In
1985, I wrote, with characteristic perspicacity, that the show
needed a star, like Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   We're dealing with football, an entertainment, not the
canonization of a saint. I believe young Dennis and I share much,
yet not enough. To his detriment.
</P>
<P>
   We each suffer from bad hair. For no apparent reason, he calls
attention to his slovenly tresses by nervously running his hand
through them. I dared not touch what I had, lest it move into
unsuitable and unstylish hairlines.
</P>
<P>
   Young Dennis and I are alumni of ``Saturday Night Live.'' My
version, on ABC, started before NBC's, yet it lasted but 22 weeks.
You are indisputably aware of its auspicious start: the American
debut of the Bay City Rollers.
</P>
<P>
   When I appeared as a guest on the NBC show, I dressed up as a
relative of Ed Grimley, the transcendent nerd created by Martin
Short. Dennis Miller merely emceed ``Weekend Update'' on that
program, replacing, in essence, Chevy Chase.
</P>
<P>
   I, of course, never replaced anyone.
</P>
<P>
   I was, and continue to be, an original.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, this young scamp works assiduously at being
unlikable.
</P>
<P>
   I never toiled at it, such a skill coming naturally.
</P>
<P>
   He employs words like weaponry as I wielded words and thoughts
like the jabs Ali threw before the U.S. government stripped him of
his right to work.
</P>
<P>
   Young Dennis's intelligence is eclectic, even catholic, like
mine. I can envision him hosting a show like my ``Speaking of
Everything.'' His potty-mouthed show on Friday ranged from
commentary on Bill Gates and the execution of the convicted Texas
murderer Gary Graham to security leaks at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   I confess to a modicum of shame at laughing when he remarked,
``It's always nice to know the doomsday machine is hooked up to a
Clapper.''
</P>
<P>
   I also confess that this lad is quite the communicator. Like me,
he possesses a rapport with young people, the type of skill that
told me I was the right person to report to America that John
Lennon had been assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as someone for whom ``Monday Night'' is a distant and bad
memory, I am concerned about whether young Dennis's penchant for
baroque similes will work for an audience weaned on pedestrian
analyses of X's and O's and an overdependence on scribbling with
the Telestrator.
</P>
<P>
   Can a tackle by the insouciant defensive end Bruce Smith, long
of the Buffalo Bills, now with the suddenly renascent Washington
Redskins, be rightly compared to a ``choice between walking and
hitching a ride with a bisexual trucker''? Will there be
credibility to young Dennis describing the muddied nose of an
offensive tackle as if it had ``inhaled Bob Marley feet first''?
</P>
<P>
   In the booth with Alfalfa Michaels, with whom I once called
``Monday Night Baseball,'' and Dan Fouts _ the newest recruit of
manifest ordinariness from the Jockocracy, a substratum of ex-jocks
and ex-coaches that does not respect the training required to be an
effective broadcaster _ Miller will divide viewers between those
who admire and those who abhor him.
</P>
<P>
   I have considerable expertise in this field, having once been
voted the most loved and hated sportscaster, simultaneously, in a
TV Guide poll.
</P>
<P>
   I made ``Monday Night.'' I was the one who gave it moment. Those
who succeeded me _ Joe Willie Namath, The Juice, Dan Dierdorf,
Boomer Esiason _ had their moments, too, but they occurred during
the time of William of Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I harbor some hope for young Dennis. He has none of my
experience, yet if he can make viewers hate him, and organize
screen-bashing keg parties to protest his most grotesque
utterances, ratings will ascend accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, Jim Brown described Howard Cosell as a warrior,
whose career could be measured by the caliber of his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Young Dennis has much to shoot for.
</P>
<P>
   This is Howard Cosell.

ANISE DISTILLED INTO THE SOUL OF TURKEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Besides being an accomplished architect,
Aydin Boysan is perhaps Turkey's most famous bon vivant. That
means, inevitably, that he is a passionate drinker of raki.
</P>
<P>
   ``Raki civilizes society,'' Boysan said between sips on a recent
evening. ``That's very important here, because Turkey is such a
huge mess that if we didn't have something like raki, we'd probably
become hopeless and all commit suicide. Raki is our only
consolation.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to imagine Turkey without raki. More than simply
the national drink, it is a potent, anise-flavored distillation of
the Turkish soul. It accompanies much of the best after-dark
conversation and is woven inextricably into the country's social
fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Boysan took his first drink of raki when he was 18 and now, 61
years later, describes it as ``my lawfully wedded wife.'' He
worries that two evils imported from the West, bars and cocktail
parties, are eroding the raki tradition.
</P>
<P>
   As long as Turks love life as much as he does, however, it seems
in no danger of disappearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to drink it like a gentleman, which of course means
never drinking too much,'' he said earnestly. ``All the senses are
involved. First you watch the water being poured into the glass and
mixing with the raki. Then you pick up the glass and inhale the
aroma. When you drink it, you take a small sip, feel the pleasure
of it flowing down your throat, take another small sip, then put
the glass down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best part is feeling it go down your throat. A giraffe _
that's an animal ideally made to appreciate raki.''
</P>
<P>
   Raki is clear when poured out of the bottle, usually into tall
glasses. The glass is filled about one-third with the liquor. Water
is then added, turning the liquid translucently white. That
appearance gives it the widely used nickname lion's milk.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual to see raki being consumed without food. Most
often it is served with the small appetizers called mezes that have
been a mainstay of Mediterranean cooking since time immemorial.
Most connoisseurs agree that the ideal dish is seafood.
</P>
<P>
   Records of raki production go back to the early 17th century.
Though it is one of Turkey's great passions, in Central Asia, where
Turkic tribes originated, there is no tradition of anise-flavored
liquor. That tradition is Mediterranean, and Turks adopted it
during Ottoman rule over Greece and nearby lands. To this day,
Greeks and Turks argue over the relative merits of raki and its
Greek counterpart, ouzo.
</P>
<P>
   Turks claim that the process for making classic raki is more
complex. It involves two distillations in traditional copper vats,
one using a concentrate made from seedless grapes and the other a
special variety of anise. Raki's alcohol content is 45 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There are three grades, but even drinkers who could easily
afford the small premium for the highest grade, Altinbas, say the
basic Yeni raki is best. It is cheaper because it is made partly
with pure alcohol, while Altinbas and the mid-grade Kulup are made
with fermented grapes only.
</P>
<P>
   The government liquor and cigarette monopoly, Tekel, is the only
legal producer of raki. In the countryside there are still
producers of bathtub raki, but the relatively low price of the
legal stuff _ about $5.75 for a 70-centiliter bottle of Yeni raki _
makes bootlegging a small-scale labor of love rather than a serious
business.
</P>
<P>
   Raki makes its way to the United States, much of it served in
Turkish restaurants. In New York a 750-milliliter bottle is sold at
Sherry Lehmann in Manhattan for $17.95.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the most famous of all raki drinkers was Mustafa Kemal
Ataturk, the founder of the Turkish Republic, who was born and
raised in what is now the Greek city of Thessaloniki. Ataturk died
of cirrhosis in 1938 at the age of 58, and there are countless
stories about his fondness for raki.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the Republic was founded, most members of Parliament were
very conservative religious figures, and alcohol was illegal,''
said Ali Gok, a manager of Tekel. ``Ataturk used to serve it to his
friends at home. They would say to him, `Pasha, it's great that we
can drink when we're with you, but why don't you make raki legal so
we can drink it in our own homes?' That made sense to him, and
after a while the ban was lifted.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a new biography of Ataturk, he once asked a dinner
guest what goes best with raki. ``Leblebi,'' the guest answered,
referring to a dish made from roasted chickpeas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wrong,'' replied the great man. ``The best accompaniment to
raki is good conversation.''
</P>
<P>
   Drinking raki is a social thing, not something you do alone.
``It's also a macho thing,'' said Warren Winkler, an American-born
physician who has lived in Turkey for nearly 40 years. ``A lot of
foreign women who live here develop a taste for it, but not many
Turkish women do. You'll see six or eight or 10 or 20 guys sitting
around a table drinking without a woman in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it is quite common to see working-class men drinking
raki, many intellectuals also consider it essential to provocative
discussion and debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the 1950s and '60s, educated people didn't want to
drink raki because it was considered too folksy and rural,'' said
Ilter Turan, a political scientist who is rector of Bilgi
University in Istanbul. ``It was considered more sophisticated to
drink wine or whiskey. But that didn't last long. Raki has been
reinstated as our national drink. It's a sign that Turkey is
becoming more comfortable with itself, a recognition that something
from our own tradition is not negation of the modernity we're
seeking.'' &QL;

FARRELLY BROTHERS NOT FOR THE DELICATE

<TEXT>
<P>
   It has four huge laughs, which is pretty good. But there's a
couple of things in there where I thought they missed the boat. Not
that they have to do things our way, but when, say, they steal that
bus from the school for the blind, they didn't set that up. It's
just mean; I think that movie could've worked a lot better if there
were more heart inside it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Farrellys feel threatened or anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought `American Pie' was good,'' Bobby concedes. ``They
did a great job, had a lot of different stories going on. Very
entertaining.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the masters of the form admit that it's not easy to
tell where entertainment ends and repulsion begins with this kind
of comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always thinking about going too far,'' Peter confesses.
``If we give ourselves and some other people a laugh, we try it.
But, ultimately, we're never comfortable until we show it in front
of an audience. Nobody tests a movie more than we do. We test it
and test it and test it, show it to strangers time and time again.
And we listen to them, and they tell us if we've gone too far.''
</P>
<P>
   And nowadays, due mainly to the conceptual monster the Farrellys
have unleashed, there's the constant, added threat of others going
too far before they can.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a scene (in 'Irene') involving Jim and a
watermelon,'' Bobby reveals. ``Basically, he was just so hung up on
Irene that he ended up ... It was very funny and we filmed it last
summer. Then, lo and behold, 'American Pie' came out and it had
that big pie scene. We thought, the last thing we wanted was anyone
conceiving that we were ripping off 'American Pie,' even though it
was a coincidental thing. So we cut that one out.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that kind of keen shrewdness that makes the Farrellys
kingpins of their fragrant realm ... for the near future, at least.
Next summer will see Heather Graham and Chris Klein falling into
unknowingly incestuous love in the brothers-produced ``Say It Isn't
So,'' and Gwyneth Paltrow is scheduled to be inflated up to 300
pounds in their next directing effort, ``Shallow Hal.'' Their
half-animated ``Osmosis Jones'' sends Chris Rock into Bill Murray's
circulatory system. And there are plans in the works for an
``Irene'' spinoff featuring the three foulmouthed brothers (Anthony
Andersobn, Mongo Brownlee and Jerod Mixon) and their albino pal
(Michael Bowman).
</P>
<P>
   But the question remains: How long will they be able to get away
with it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we're still amazed that the hair gel thing in 'Mary' got
in,'' Peter notes. ``20th Century Fox gave us a lot of freedom in
that movie, to their credit. They trusted us and it worked out for
them, and so they continue to.''
</P>
<P>
   And probably will until someone comes along who does it grosser
and better. &QL;

FARRELLY BROTHERS NOT FOR THE DELICATE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a Farrelly kind of world. We only have to smell it.
</P>
<P>
   ``How far will we go?'' Bobby Farrelly asks rhetorically at the
start of an interview. As anyone knows who's seen the movies he and
brother Peter have written and directed _ ``Dumb &AMP; Dumber,''
``Kingpin,'' ``There's Something About Mary'' and their latest,
``Me, Myself &AMP; Irene'' _ the answer to that one is pretty
(expletive) far.
</P>
<P>
   The two guys from Rhode Island suffered an unusual critical
drubbing for ``Irene,'' their outlandish reunion with ``D&AMP;D'' star
Jim Carrey. Usually respected as the Picassos of gross-out humor,
they were widely criticized for being too mean, repeating
themselves and, yes, going too far this time around.
</P>
<P>
   Among the more outraged comments: How could they let Carrey's
split-personality cop do that to a bratty little girl? Why, oh why,
do his three African-American, MENSA member sons have to use
expletives in every sentence? Where was the ASPCA observer when
that chicken scene was shot?
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Farrellys' comedy actually offended
sensibilities in this outing, and we just can't have that.
</P>
<P>
   But while ``Irene's'' ultimate box office fate remains to be
seen, it did register the brothers' biggest opening weekend gross
by a long measure, $24 million as opposed to long-run blockbuster
``Mary's'' $13 million debut. And although the film's initial
numbers lagged behind those of other Carrey comedy hits, they were
still the best ever registered for an R-rated original comedy.
</P>
<P>
   But numbers only tell part of the story. The Farrellys have
spawned a new era of slob comedy, as imitators flood the market
with movies that strain to top one another in the juvenile ickiness
department.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, no one does this skanky stuff quite as well as
Peter and Bobby (for those who need proof, check out the
scatalogical but comparatively witless ``Scary Movie'' opening next
week). And there is, of course, a method to the Farrellys' badness
that most of their shock comedy imitators just can't reproduce.
</P>
<P>
   The brothers themselves are fairly obtuse when it comes to
describing how their comedy works. They flog the idea that keeping
their hero likable is the key to making any disgusting joke
palatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't sit down and think, `Jeez, we had the hair thing in
``Something About Mary,'' how can we outdo that?''' notes Peter,
the younger, scruffier of the brothers, who are both in their early
40s. ``We think about plot and character first. Y'know, you can't
hang that thing off Ben Stiller's ear if you don't love that guy.
If you cut the gags out of our movies, I think you'd be surprised
to find that they're almost sickeningly sweet stories underneath.''
</P>
<P>
   True, as far as that goes. But it's the anything-could-happen,
rule-breaking zaniness of the brothers' humor that attracts and
repels with such magnetic intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rude and disgusting and borderline offensive and I love
it; isn't that terrible to admit?'' admits Renee Zellweger, the
well-mannered Texan who plays Irene, the object of desire for both
of Carrey's personalities in the movie. ``It's refreshing to
actually address the things that we're too embarrassed to talk
about and go beyond it. The Farrellys are talented filmmakers and
they understand comedy; they just have a keen awareness of what
social taboos are funny and how to address them. It's like a
relief, almost, the way they do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her co-star concurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peter and Bobby are just, for me, a breath of fresh air,''
Carrey explains. ``Especially after taking things seriously in my
last two movies (`The Truman Show' and `Man on the Moon'). I had
such a great experience the first time with them, I knew I was
going to have a good time and a lot of laughs on this one. But
those guys are just wonderful people, too; they're still connected
to everyone they've ever known in their lives. Me, I cut everyone
off!''
</P>
<P>
   That underlying sweetness thing again. But Carrey acknowledges
that the Farrellys' sense of humor can get as downright nasty as
his own _ which, perhaps, is what makes them the perfect comic
masterminds for our indelicate times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reflects what's going on in society, what we have to deal
with,'' Carrey observes. ``People talk about movies desensitizing
people; I think society desensitizes movies. But at the heart of a
movie like this, I think there's very good intentions, which is to
nail the things that we all do and all talk about, but nobody has
the guts to show.''

</P>
<P>
   &UR; COVER STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PATRIOTIC-SONGS (Undated) _ Kate Smith introduced ``God Bless
America'' on her radio show on Armistice Day, Nov. 11, 1938. It was
an instant sensation. Within weeks, the song was ubiquitous:
crackling across radio airwaves, sung in churches, schools and
ballparks, championed by many as a replacement national anthem for
Francis Scott Key's ungainly ``The Star-Spangled Banner.'' But not
every American took solace in the skyward-striving strains of ``God
Bless America.'' In the winter of 1940, Woody Guthrie was bedeviled
by the song: everywhere he went, Kate Smith's belting seemed to
follow him; the more he heard the song, the angrier he got. Soon
came ``This Land is Your Land,'' offering a folksier reverence.
This call and response between revered troubadours is one of the
most piquant episodes in American pop music. By Jody Rosen.
</P>
<P>
   STRANGE-FRUIT-MUSIC (Undated) _ ``Strange Fruit'' may not have
been on the soundtrack as the Freedom Riders boarded buses or
college students registered black Mississippians or marchers
marched from Selma to Montgomery; ``We Shall Overcome,'' more
optimistic and upbeat, better fit the zeitgeist. But it was the
song which, by confronting racial injustice in the starkest
possible terms at a time when it simply hadn't penetrated popular
culture, inspired many to march in the first place. By David
Margolick.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FILM &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PATRIOT-FILM (Undated) _ ``The Patriot,'' the new movie starring
Mel Gibson, will prove to many a satisfying way to spend a summer
evening. It's got big battles and wrenching hand-to-hand combat, a
courageous but conflicted hero and a dastardly and totally
guilt-free villain. There is just enough brain bran to keep the
post-film discussions from being dominated by people who want to
focus on how cool it was when Mel hit that guy with the hatchet.
Why, some may think it's the best Revolutionary War movie ever
made. Which brings us to our point: it is also one of the very few
Revolutionary War movies ever made. By Jamie Malanowski.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MUSIC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-MUSIC (Undated) _ The history of cinema parallels the
history of recorded music in that both have been concerned, since
the necessary technical discoveries were made at the end of the
19th century, with composing in time: composing images, and later
sounds, in film; composing sounds alone where music is concerned.
With a grand inevitability, therefore, Jean-Luc Godard's video
``Histoire(s) du Cinema'' presents itself also as ``Histoire(s) de
la Musique,'' and it is fitting that the soundtrack alone should be
available. By Paul Griffiths.
</P>
<P>
   CLASSICAL-MUSIC (Undated) _ If the news is true, the record
business is not being nice to classical music. The Washington Post
reports that such respected labels as RCA Red Seal, Deutsche
Harmonia Mundi and Melodiya, all owned or distributed by the
international giant BMG, will be either shunted aside as minor
activities of the American, pop-oriented RCA label or put out of
business altogether. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   U.S.-EUROPE-MUSIC (Undated) _ The book is called ``Kein' Angst,
Baby!'' (``Don't Worry, Kid!''), and it has a voluptuous Valkyrie
sizzling on the cover. Written for opera singers by opera singers
and first published in 1992 by the New York Opera Newsletter, it is
a guide to auditioning in Germany. American singers long regarded
the German audition tour as a useful _ indeed, essential _ career
move, and this book helped the uninitiated negotiate everything
from writing a letter to a German agent to dealing with German
telephones and money matters. But things have changed. German
theaters are not hiring singers as they used to. By Anne Midgette.
</P>
<P>
   SUPREMES-MUSIC (Undated) _ For a teenager living in the suburbs
of Detroit in 1964, the royals of AM radio were alarmingly obvious:
The Beatles were the imported kings of rock 'n' roll and Aretha was
the native Queen of Soul. Then along came the pop princess Diana
and her ladies in waiting, the Supremes. By David A. Keeps.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANCE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   CHAUTAUQUA-DANCE (Undated) _ In 1983, Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux,
recently retired as a principal dancer with the New York City
Ballet, was asked to take charge of the summer ballet school at the

appeared on maps in the 16th century. Wearing a feather headdress,
accompanied by a parrot and perched on an alligatorlike reptile,
she represented continental America alongside female allegories of
Europe, Asia and Africa. This early character, along with Liberty
and the lesser-known Columbia, is the subject of ``The Changing

SWISS REPORT INCREASE IN FUNDS FROZEN BECAUSE OF SUSPECTED MONEY
LAUNDERING 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Swiss authorities froze nearly $1 billion in suspicious
money over the past year _ five times as much as the previous year,
when the country began cracking down on money laundering to enhance
its international banking reputation, a monitoring agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Money Laundering Reporting Office, part of the federal
police department, said Swiss banks had blocked dubious funds
involved in 370 reports of suspicious transactions, mostly in the
financial centers of Geneva and Zurich. This compares with 160 the
previous year, and only about 40 before reporting became mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss figures, which covered the 12 months through March,
came a day after the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development issued a list of 35 places that have lenient laws for
tax evaders and a week after an international task force unveiled
its list of 15 countries accused of failing to curb money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland, which was not on either list but whose banking
industry is estimated to manage as much as one-third of the world's
offshore wealth, began its reporting system two years ago to clean
up its banking image. That is part of a plan to step up its fight
against organized and financial crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The figures show money launderers are no longer able to carry
on their activity without risk of detection,'' said Daniel
Thelesklaf, a lawyer who heads the reporting office.
</P>
<P>
   The higher figures for the past year were in part the result of
the discovery of funds linked to the former Nigerian dictator Sani
Abacha, who died in 1998, and his family, Thelesklaf said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 tips involved some $485 million in funds linked to
the Abacha cases; overall $670 million was uncovered in related
cases in 17 Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   Another 23 reports involved $12 million connected with the Bank
of New York, where some employees are accused of involvement in the
apparent laundering of billions of dollars from Russia. Last
September, Swiss authorities froze $16.8 million in bank accounts
linked to the investigation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An additional 23 reports involved bank accounts with Russian
owners but have not been tied to the Bank of New York
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Thelesklaf said the growing number of tipoffs is beginning to
approach what might be expected in a financial center of
Switzerland's importance.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion of wrongdoing can be based on many factors, such as
transactions involving money that cannot be traced to a logical
owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how much money is laundered,'' he said. ``This
is part of the iceberg, but whether it is the tip or not, we don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 79 percent of the reports, covering the vast bulk of the
suspicious money, showed evidence of sufficient wrongdoing to be
referred to legal authorities. Prosecutors are still investigating
the cases, a lengthy process because it almost always involves
other countries. Meanwhile, funds are usually kept frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 370 tips came from banks as opposed to asset
managers, lawyers and others who handle large sums of money,
Thelesklaf said. An April 1998 law requires banks and asset
managers to report suspicious fund activity to the government. He
said the non-banking entities were lagging behind in reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't won the money laundering fight yet,'' Thelesklaf
said, ``At the end of the day, we need convictions and asset
seizures to succeed.''

 &HT;    MEXICO'S CARDENAS: DEMOCRATIC HERO OR SPOILER?
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ To supporters he's the only true hero of Mexican
democracy and the impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   To others Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is in danger of going down in
history as a spoiler, the man who foiled a historic opportunity to
end 71 years of one-party rule in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   At 66, Cardenas is the spiritual leader of Mexico's left and the
son of one of this country's most beloved, nationalistic
presidents. In his third attempt at the presidency, polls are
showing that Cardenas is lagging in third place as Mexicans prepare
for the most competitive presidential election ever on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With all campaigning to stop by law on Wednesday, Cardenas has
rejected 11th-hour appeals to withdraw and unite with a stronger
opposition candidate, conservative Vicente Fox Quesada. A
withdrawal by Cardenas _ analysts agree _ would greatly enhance
Fox's chances of toppling Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the PRI, and forming what he promises would be a plural
``transitional'' government.
</P>
<P>
   In most opinion surveys of likely voters, Fox is in a virtual
tie with the PRI's candidate _ averaging out to around 40 percent
each _ while Cardenas ranges from 12-to-20 percent support. These
same polls also show that as much as 20 percent of the electorate
is undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understand, Cuauhtemoc: To unite forces is what's best for the
country and for your people. We would share the government and the
responsibility of a transition,'' Fox said in a speech Saturday
night before an estimated 200,000 supporters here.
</P>
<P>
   But at his own equally huge rally the next day, Cardenas
bitterly spurned Fox, who has alternately insulted Cardenas and
tried to woo him and his party, the Democratic Revolutionary Party,
or PRD.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mournful cries are those of one who knows he will lose,''
Cardenas, the former mayor of Mexico City, said, attacking Fox in
his speech with as much vigor as he attacked the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Fox) really had, as he claims, 40, 46 or 48 percent of all
votes, would he be calling me,'' Cardenas asked. ``Would he be so
desperately begging for the votes of the PRD?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody here is looking for work from him,'' Cardenas
continued, prompting cries of support from those gathered in the
main square in Mexico City, where the PRD is strong. ``To think
that Fox would share power would be to believe in another one of
his lies.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRD and Fox's party, the pro-free-market National Action
Party, the PAN, tried unsuccessfully last year to form an alliance
to select one candidate. Despite their ideological differences, the
parties have backed mutual candidates for several governors' races.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cardenas' position on Sunday was that the PAN and the PRD
are basically enemies: ``Our political proposals, our styles of
government and our way of life are diametrically opposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many Mexicans who voted for Cardenas in the past have
thrown their support to Fox, the crowd at Cardenas' rally relished
his words. For hard-core Cardenas supporters voting for the PRI and
the PAN are the same sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to kick out Bismarck so I can put Hitler into
office,'' said Jorge Martinez, 53, a university professor who wore
a yellow PRD scarf on his head at Cardenas' rally.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox, who has fought to overcome his party's stuffy image,
has picked up significant backing from some leftist leaders whose
priority is to defeat the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Two former top Cardenas advisors, Jorge Castaneda, a leading
writer, and Adolfo Aguilar Zinzer, an independent senator, are on
Fox's team. Porfirio Munoz Ledo, a PRD co-founder who broke from
the party for his own presidential bid, dropped out of the race
recently to support Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox held a meeting Monday with other leftists who chastised
Cardenas for refusing to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (PRI candidate) Francisco Labastida wins, it will be in
good part the fault of Cardenas, who, in spite of Vicente Fox's
repeated calls for unity, has acted with extreme stubbornness,''
said Indian community leader Julian Jimenez Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   For Cardenas, this will most likely be his last run at the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a dozen years he has been at the forefront of the
fight to make Mexico a more democratic, less economically polarized
nation. Although Mexico is the world's fifth-largest oil-producing
nation, half of its population lives in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas co-founded the PRD, which accuses the PRI of having
abandoned the ideals of the Mexican Revolution _ land and tools for
peasant farmers, free education at all levels and government
protection of national industries.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas' father, Lazaro, nationalized foreign-owned oil
industries in Mexico in the 1930s and distributed land, built dams
and other infrastructure to benefit the countryside. Lazaro named
his son after the last Aztec king.
</P>
<P>
   Fox last month called Cardenas ``jealous and ``a traitor to
democracy,'' as well as ``obsessed'' with becoming president, like
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas accused Fox of ``not having the pants,'' or courage, to
make such remarks to his face.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas was a member of the PRI, like his father, but he broke
with the party to run in 1988 as presidential candidate of a
leftist coalition. The election was widely viewed as stolen from
Cardenas by Carlos Salinas de Gortari _ burned ballots were found
and suspicious computer crashes occurred. After that, Cardenas
emerged as a tireless critic of PRI corruption and free-market
economic reforms led by President Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas lost a second run at the presidency in 1994, when
Mexicans were gripped by fear after a spate of political
assassinations, including PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo
Colosio.
</P>
<P>
   When the peso crashed in December 1994 and revelations of
corruption and mismanagement during the Salinas administration
began to come out, Cardenas emerged stronger again. He had warned
against selling state-owned industries, which Fox's PAN supported.
And he was vindicated after the reckless privatization of Mexico's
banks and highways ended up in disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardenas is really an extraordinary political figure. He stood
up like a mean old uncle and said of Salinas, 'This is not going to
come to a good end.' And later he got to say, 'I told you so,'''
said John Bailey, a Mexico expert at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas' party has also suffered repressive violence _ as many
as 600 killed, he says _ which gives him the moral high ground as
an opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Cardenas won the first election ever held for mayor of
Mexico City. The PRD also captured a large number of seats in
Mexico's Congress. Cardenas was, many thought, well-positioned for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned last year to begin his campaign, but the charismatic
Fox, who had started to wage a modern, media-friendly campaign two
years earlier, was already eclipsing him.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Cardenas' supporters lament that his administration
didn't have better media skills while he was mayor. Cardenas often
didn't respond to questions from the press promptly and his
typically unsmiling visage didn't help compared to Fox's openness.
</P>
<P>
   He was also subjected as mayor to a barrage of attack news
coverage from television stations widely viewed as biased in favor
of the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had very high expectations, too, for what Cardenas
would be able to accomplish as mayor,'' said Mexican political
analyst Jose Antonio Crespo.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardenas can still draw crowds of adoring supporters. And

   Taking a daily siesta is a Latin tradition many sleep-deprived
Americans would love to adopt, but snoozing every afternoon could
increase your chances of a heart attack, new research has found.
</P>
<P>
   About 1,000 Costa Ricans were surveyed recently, and those who
took a siesta every day had a 50 percent greater chance of having a
heart attack, says a study in the International Journal of
Epidemiology. Those who napped less than four times a week showed
no increased risk for heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the research on heart disease has been carried on in
Western countries, not in tropical areas or the developing world,''
says Hannia Campos, lead author of the study and an assistant
professor of nutrition at Harvard University School of Public
Health. ``Heart disease has become the major cause of death in many
developing countries. We were interested in the siesta because it's
a behavior that's common in tropical regions, but it's different
from U.S. or Northern European behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   And previous studies have shown heart attacks are most common
when people wake up in the morning, says Dr. Robert Kloner,
professor of medicine at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors suspect it is due to the release of catecholamines,
adrenaline-like neurotransmitters that gear your body up for the
day by stimulating the nervous system. In turn, this increases your
heart rate and force of heart contractions while raising blood
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   In people with atherosclerosis, or build-up of plaque in the
arteries, these changes can cause clots and heart attacks, Kloner
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have long known that cardiac events tend to occur more in
the morning, and within the first two to three hours of waking,''
Kloner says. ``These include angina, silent ischaemia (low blood
flow to the heart that does not cause pain), heart attacks, sudden
cardiac death, arrhythmia and even stroke.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be exactly what happens after waking up from a siesta,
Campos says. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the
United States. It has more recently become the leading cause of
death in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   The origin of the siesta goes back hundreds of years, Campos
said. Traditionally, about 80 percent of Costa Ricans have been
involved in agriculture. Coffee farmers got up early, worked hard
for several hours, and rested during the hottest part of the day.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent decades, Costa Rica has become more urbanized.
Only 18 percent in the control group were involved in agriculture,
and only 13 percent in the group that had heart attacks worked in
agriculture. About half in both groups were overweight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The siesta may not have been a problem when the people were
very physically active, but now people are becoming more sedentary
and developing more heart disease,'' Campos says.
</P>
<P>
   Campos and her colleagues studied 522 Costa Ricans who had
survived heart attacks and 505 who had never had a heart attack.
Among those who napped daily, the average length was almost two
hours. Among those who napped six days a week or less, the average
duration was 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Determining the likely times of day for heart attacks could help
doctors target the best times for giving heart drugs, Kloner says:
``If you can decrease the triggers for cardiac events, you can
decrease the total number of events.''
</P>
<P>
   Kloner also suggests waking up slowly, and waking to soft music.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for naps,'' he says, adding his suggestions about
waking slowly have not been tested. ``The bottom line is you can't
get away from this phenomenon. You have to sleep and you have to
wake up.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Although there will be many lessons to be learned from Mexico's
presidential election on July 2, we may have a notion of some of
them already.
</P>
<P>
   The most important is to recognize the consequences of last
year's failure of the two opposition parties to join forces. Their
reasons then were:
</P>
<P>
   1) An alliance wouldn't be possible.
</P>
<P>
   2) An alliance wouldn't guarantee victory.
</P>
<P>
   3) There were too many political differences dividing the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
   The first was unalterably true. But with the campaign's
evolution, the other two have since been disproved.
</P>
<P>
   Firstly, had there been one candidate representing an allied
opposition _ presumably Vicente Fox (PAN) since, according to
polls, he outgunned the PRD's Cuauhtemoc Cardenas by a ratio of
2-to-1 _ chances for a Fox victory would have been even further
enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   This is particularly so in a campaign where, right now, the two
frontrunners (Fox and the PRI's Francisco Labastida) are running
neck and neck. Had there been an opposition alliance where Cardenas
conceded to Fox as candidate, nobody today could deny that it would
have given Fox an overwhelming advantage and ultimately, victory.
</P>
<P>
   All the polls show the split vote is a committed one. But the
polls also show that the second choice for president among the
majority of those votes is Fox.
</P>
<P>
   This was also confirmed in a secret PRD internal survey
conducted between March and June, in which voters overwhelmingly
confirmed Fox, over Labastida, as their second choice. Over the
four-month period, the percentages for Fox increased concurrently
with the progress of the campaign, which would have eventually
given Fox a 5-point lead, and a sure win.
</P>
<P>
   The third reason _ political incompatibility _ has also been
disproved by evolving campaign events. Up till now _ and there is
no reason to expect any change in the last days before the election
_ the divergences between the two opponents have been personal: Fox
is a liar, Cardenas an anachronism; Fox is intolerant, Cardenas is
an egoist.
</P>
<P>
   Or historical: The Cristera War (a 1920s uprising against
government imposed anticlerical laws) vs. the Mexican Revolution;
for or against reforms implemented by former President Carlos
Salinas. But there has been nothing of substance or about
platforms, such as privatizing Pemex, legalizing abortion,
rescinding NAFTA, or re-establishing state ownership of Telmex, the
banking and steel industries, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Since none of these topics were debated, the difference between
the two candidates is moot, and so they failed to prove any
political incompatibility.
</P>
<P>
   Out of this political stumbling, emerges another, pivotal fact
that was highlighted by Cardenas' brief and belated skirmishes over
a second round of voting. If Mexico had a constitutional electoral
second balloting (as exists in most countries with presidents,
including the United States, through the primaries of the two big
parties) Fox would have a very strong possibility of defeating
Labastida in the final election.
</P>
<P>
   But why isn't there a second round vote? The PRI and the
government, supposedly, didn't want it; the PAN accepted the
decision without real conviction and only to please Fox, and the
PRD didn't say anything.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, another version of truth behind these
suppositions.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, in November 1998, Giovanni Sartori, the eminent
political expert and professor emeritus at Columbia University, had
a two-hour discussion with President Ernesto Zedillo on the virtues
of second round balloting, particularly for a country like Mexico.
It would give the country stability, legitimacy and a soundness, he
apparently said, which would neutralize in the long run any
disadvantage it could have for the ruling party in the short run.
</P>
<P>
   An impressed Zedillo suggested he present his ideas to the
opposing parties and their probable candidates. But after doing so,
Sartori disclosed that the followers of Cardenas were absolutely
opposed to second balloting.
</P>
<P>
   As to why Zedillo didn't promote it, even if Cardenas was
opposed, the answer is simple: With the full approval of the two
opposition parties, Zedillo might have been able to push through a
constitutional amendment, imposing it on a reluctant PRI wary of
the probable defeat it would mean _ a party which was, and still
is, totally opposed to such second round balloting. Asking Zedillo
to act against his party's interests and without the total support
of the opposition was too much.
</P>
<P>
   If that is the true story, the ostensible reasons for Cardenas'
rejection of a second round are now known.
</P>
<P>
   In the first place, Cardenas' estimates were wrong: in 1998 he
thought he would be the forerunner in the 2000 presidential
campaign. So a second balloting might mean taking away his victory
of the first round. In the second place, he thought (once again
mistakenly) that if there were a second round, PAN and PRI would
unite in a conservative alliance and defeat him in the second
ballot. He clearly never thought of a third possibility: that he
might not be a candidate in the second round and might have to
throw his votes to one of the other two candidates.
</P>
<P>
   But another possible motive for his opposition to the measure
might have been based on an even worse possibility: What to do if
he had, in the end, to decide on the lesser of two evils, between
PRI and PAN, between Fox and Labastida?
</P>
<P>
   This third possibility was so awful that it could not be
considered. Or even better: avoid creating the conditions that put
him in such a position. At least this way the decision would be
taken in pectore, implemented in private, far from the startled
looks or autonomous voters.
</P>
<P>
   And, as a matter of fact, Cardenas actually made his decision in
the solitude of his introversion and with full fidelity to his
obsessions and roots. This happened probably in the first days of
March, and surely no later than the first week of April, when he
received the results of the secret polls, which showed that the
proportion of votes for Fox and Cardenas was still the same
(2-to-1).
</P>
<P>
   Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a man of few decisions in his life, but all
of them transcendental, faced the terrible choice that history and
reality presented: He was not going to be president of Mexico. He
couldn't win this time, and there was no possibility of a new
attempt in 2006, when he would be 70. Nevertheless, he still had in
his hand the power to decide who would be Mexico's next president:
Labastida or Fox.
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt in my mind that Cardenas, faced with the
Hamletian drama he was living, suffered horribly, argued with
himself, agonized and doubted, but finally opted for the road of
his phantoms. Over and above the animosity between himself and Fox,
and of the greater certitude offered by a deal _ tacit or explicit,
suggested or signed _ with Labastida, Cardenas chose the system and
the PRI. To do otherwise would mean, to him, betraying his father,
President Lazaro Cardenas, and his legacy _ the most noble and
glorious of Mexico's 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, Lazaro Cardenas would never have understood how his son
could anoint a ``reactionary,'' a ``counterrevolutionary'' for
president.
</P>
<P>
   So, understandably, it's not easy to blame Cardenas for his
decision. It is, without doubt, the most loyal to his true past, to
his life and to his refusal to betray an everlasting and crushing
icon of Mexican politics.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, his decisions may have led his party to imminent
collective suicide, not only for not impeding Fox's victory _ now
quite imminent _ but for forgoing an alliance even with its
resulting limitations.
</P>
<P>
   The PRD may still have some chips to deal right now, but come
July 3 they will have lost their value in the face of a Fox
consistent in his proposals and magnanimous in victory _ and free
of the obligations that he would have had to adhere to had anybody
wanted to negotiate with him in the beginning when he needed
backing and supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Worse than an historical mistake, it is one of historical
blindness.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The summer our grandmother, a ninth-generation
Manhattanite, moved down South to live nearer to the family, she
brought with her a truckload of sleek, blond mid-century furniture,
a closetful of spike heels and a tattered, handwritten recipe for
pesto Genovese. The year was 1982, and we had never tasted anything
like it. Shining through the richness of Parmesan, pine nuts and
garlic was the sunny, uplifting flavor of fresh basil, an epiphany
we would forever associate with summer and urban sophistication.
</P>
<P>
   Basil is still the quintessence of summer for us, but over the
years it has lost its cosmopolitan credentials; every other
restaurant in America, it seems, is turning out some pale version
of fresh pesto, slathered over grilled chicken or salmon or pizza.
</P>
<P>
   Then, on a recent spring day at the Union Square Greenmarket, we
came across a stall with 11 varieties of basil, with alluring,
exotic names: Thai Siam Queen, Purple Ruffles, Burns' lemon basil,
and lime, cinnamon and holy basils. There were bushy plants with
dainty, teardrop-shaped leaves and the pale tone of pea soup
standing beside a lanky variety with razor-toothed leaves shot
through with purple veins. One basil had the saturated color of
inky zinfandel, and broad leaves that were ridiculously frilly at
the edges.
</P>
<P>
   We sampled them all, beneath the wary gaze of the grower, and
each bite brought on the excitement and thrill of the new.
Suddenly, basil was once again a culinary adventure.
</P>
<P>
   These basils really are different from the varieties available
year-round. Besides the familiar sweet basil flavor, they have
other beguiling flavors and aromas, like warm cinnamon toast, lemon
zest, bay leaf, ripe berries, tobacco and clove, to name a few.
These are delicate nuances, no matter how pronounced the flavors
may be. When you cook with an exotic basil, you have to think about
it differently and handle it differently or its distinctive essence
will vanish.
</P>
<P>
   That day at the market, we bought one of each plant, put them in
our Harlem community garden plot and bought even more plants
expressly for cooking.
</P>
<P>
   The 11 varieties we found represent only a fraction of the
number of basils. Eileen Boyle, the director of horticulture at the
New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx, ventures that there are
several hundred basil varieties among 60 or 70 species in the genus
Ocimum, native to India, Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   A cook can divide them into four flavor categories: the citrusy
basils, like lemon, lime or Mexican basil, all as intense as a
lollipop and perfect for perfuming sauces. Then, there are the
anise or licorice varieties _ less assertive than the citrus
basils, but more complex than the standard sweet basils. These
include Thai, Armenian and Holly's Painted basil.
</P>
<P>
   The spicy basils, like cinnamon, clove or chocolate basil, tend
to have flavors that are fleeting, and need to be eaten fresh.
Finally, there are the lustrous purple and opal basils. They are
generally muted versions of the basic sweet Italian basil; they can
add visual spice to a plate, but not a whole lot of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking with exotic basils is about preserving the herb's heady,
aromatic oils. The vibrancy of these oils makes them seem
invincible, but sustained heat will reduce even Burns' lemon basil
to a shadow of her outrageously lemony self. We had resolved to
keep heat to a minimum and still we slipped up. We coated two
small, whole red snappers with a generous rub of kosher salt,
ground black pepper and minced lemon basil, then wrapped the fish
in a nest of basil sprigs, hoping that a brief blast of heat on the
grill wouldn't dent the intense lemon perfume. After just five
minutes on the grill, it had faded into dark oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   So we tried a lemon basil beurre blanc, with a half-cup of
chopped leaves blended into the sauce once the pan was safely off
the flame. It was perfect for the fish, the lemony essence of the
basil deftly parting the richness of sauce and fish.
</P>
<P>
   We also learned that simply substituting a lemon basil or a
licorice basil in recipes that call for the standard Genovese won't
always work. Flattering their distinctive flavors can be a
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, cinnamon basil pesto sounded great, but lacked the
piney, peppery kick of good pesto; the bold synergy of herb, cheese
and nut collapsed. Using both basils, in a proportion of one to
one, added the mysterious note of cinnamon and sandalwood we were
after without upsetting the balance.
</P>
<P>
   With the most potent basils, like Burns' lemon basil or holy
basil, merely rubbing a leaf across a surface _ say, of a crisp
bruschetta or a fresh fig _ will release enough aroma and flavor to
set off visions of lush mountain meadows.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, we also discovered that a discreet twist of
lemon peel, a tablespoon of diced fennel or a cinnamon stick can
reinforce the character of the herbs without selling them short.
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   One sure bet with all basils is to let them shine on their own,
in salads: insalata Caprese, the rustic salad of sliced tomato,
fresh mozarella and basil, is a classic formula that can stand up
to a zinger, like holy basil. Any green salad can be intensified
with a handful of whole basil leaves thrown in.
</P>
<P>
   Our favorite recipe came about from free-association. Our lime
basil made us think of a favorite summer nibble: Cuban grilled
corn, lightly brushed with homemade mayonnaise and sprinkled with
lime juice and queso fresco. We set out to simulate that balance of
corn, lime and cheese flavors in a dish that would be a light
summer meal. A sweet corn risotto seemed perfect, with a dusting of
grated Parmesan and 40 dime-size leaves of lime basil folded in
just before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Basil's tarragonlike, herbal tendencies make it indispensable in
savory dishes, but its mint, cinnamon and anise qualities point
toward dessert. So we dunked strawberries into a pint of
store-bought creme fraiche that we had blended with chopped
cinnamon basil. Strawberries and cinnamon? Strawberries and basil?
Sounds odd, but it was delicious, easy, and it performed double
duty as a crudite dip when we added salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   We also made more ambitious desserts, after consulting Jerry
Traunfeld, the executive chef of the Herbfarm Restaurant in Fall
City, Wash., which has acres of kitchen gardens. His book, ``The
Herbfarm Cookbook'' (Scribner), was published this spring. The
popularity of Genovese basil among his clientele inspired the Basil
Banquet, nine courses with different varieties of basil, including
cinnamon, licorice and lemon.
</P>
<P>
   Traunfeld uses whole leaves in salads and sauces, and with
grilled fruit. He drops battered leaves into hot oil for basil
tempura, and smokes salmon with ``basil wood,'' the dried stems of
basil plants. But the real fireworks are in desserts, like licorice
basil and apricot sorbet and cinnamon basil and blueberry
shortcake, that use herb-infused simple syrups and creams.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you infuse,'' Traunfeld told us, ``you get that wonderful
spice flavor and strain out the green vegetal flavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Following his advice, we plunged whole leaves of basil into a
bath of hot cream, steeping them for half an hour. Once the cream
was suffused with the herb's flavor, we threw out the leaves and
made a superb lime basil and coconut ice cream, and a cinnamon
basil chocolate mousse. Chocolate and basil _ perhaps against one's
better instincts _ go well together. Note that the Michelin
three-star restaurant Arpege in Paris pairs a basil ice cream with
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the enthusiasm these basils inspire in chefs and
culinary tinkerers like us, they're decidedly underexposed in
American markets.
</P>
<P>
   They're less durable than supermarket varieties, said Susan Blew
of Oak Grove Plantation, a specialist in organic herbs in
Pittsfield, N.J., which sells exotic basils at the Union Square
Greenmarket all summer long. Blew begins her basil crop in her
greenhouse right after New Year's Day. She scrutinizes January
forecasts for a stretch of three days of full sun to allow seeding.
If the weather report is wrong, she'll start over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basil's like kids,'' she told us. ``They don't like cold and
they don't like wet feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there's the matter of distribution. Quincy Horan, a
Connecticut grower of organic heirloom produce, won't take the
chance of shipping bunches of the nine varieties of basil he grows
out of Litchfield County.
</P>
<P>
   The exotics wilt quickly after picking, so they're more often
sold as plants, roots and all, in garden markets rather than in
supermarkets. ``If Dean &AMP; DeLuca is out of Thai basil,'' one
shopper observed, ``I go to Home Depot.''
</P>
<P>
   When you find the exotic basils it's wise to preserve them.
Washed and dried leaves freeze well in a sealed plastic container
or in a tightly sealed freezer bag. Then, defrost and use them.
</P>
<P>
   But we prefer to pack basil tightly in a small jar, like those
used for baby food or spices, with olive oil and a layer of rock
salt at the neck of the jar. Store the jars in the refrigerator
and, after each use, top off the jar with a little more rock salt.
Leaves near the top may discolor, but will not lose flavor.
Vegetable oil is equally suited to preserving basil, but we find
the olive oil becomes infused with the essence of the herbs and is
superb _ especially in the first gray days of autumn _ when a
drizzle on a slice of apple will transport you back to a warm, slow
afternoon. Not a drop gets wasted. &QL;

&HT;     NEXT GENETIC MILESTONE: BETTER UNDERSTANDING THE MOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SYLVIA WOOD  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With scientists making astonishing breakthroughs
in understanding the genetic makeup of humans, researchers also are
keeping an eye on the mapping of the mouse genome.
</P>
<P>
   Without the mouse genome, experts say the information gathered
from the human genome is just that _ information. But a genetic map
of the most widely used lab animal in the world would give
scientists a way to manipulate and interpret those findings and aid
in the understanding of human diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the mouse genome, scientists are going to be able to
answer more questions about the human condition,'' said Lorraine
Flaherty, director of the Genomics Institute at the New York
Department of Health's Wadsworth Center.
</P>
<P>
   Although a draft copy of the entire mouse genome is still years
away, its potential is already causing excitement in both the
business and scientific communities.
</P>
<P>
   The genome is essentially an instruction manual for creating and
sustaining living things. On Monday, scientists announced that they
had completed a rough draft of the human genome after 10 years of
work.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, a rough draft of the entire human DNA sequence
seemed impossible. For years, scientists were limited to studying
genes a few at a time, a task that was cumbersome and not very
enlightening. Flaherty likens it to trying to understand
Beethoven's Fifth Symphony from a handful of notes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, with the help of technology, researchers can look at
thousands of human genes all at once. The potential impact is
boggling. Imagine going from having a few pages of a book to having
access to an entire library.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the geneticist's trip to the moon,'' Flaherty said.
``It's that kind of accomplishment.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet scientists are just beginning to understand all of the
information at their fingertips. And that's where the mouse genome
comes in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mice and humans get many of the same diseases,'' said Carol
Bult, an assistant staff scientist at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar
Harbor, Maine. ``Comparing the two will help us identify genes we
wouldn't be able to pick up any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The mouse will also give researchers a way to make those
comparisons, since most genetic experiments would be considered
unethical in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mice, on the other hand, don't have to sign consent forms,''
said Paulette McCormick, a professor of biological sciences and
co-director of the Center for the Study of Comparative Functional
Genomics at the State University of New York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mouse is going to be the key,'' Flaherty said. ``We can do
things in mice we can't do in humans.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, on a genetic scale, there isn't too much of a
difference between humans and mice. The two genomes are thought to
be about the same size, with 3 billion chemical bases, or letters
of DNA.
</P>
<P>
   And about 95 percent of human genes are also found in the mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having both genomes, we'll be able to answer the question,
`how many genes away are we?''' Bult said.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, researchers say the mouse genome will open the
door to a better understanding of human disease.
</P>
<P>
   Within the next decade, specialists predict that people will be
able to have their individual genetic profiles done to make sure
they get the best, most effective treatment for diseases.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, SUNY-Albany is setting up a Transgenic Mouse Facility
at its East Greenbush campus, a project that is being done in
cooperation with the Albany Medical Center, a teaching and research
hospital, and Taconic Farms, a breeder of laboratory animals based
in Germantown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The facility will start designing mice to over-express or lack
certain genes believed to be linked to specific illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   On a wider scale, Taconic Farms will act as a sort of storage
center for such mutant mice, freezing embryos for distribution to
scientists across the country.
</P>
<P>
   At the New York Health Department, Flaherty has already been
using genetically altered mice to better understand how genes may
control certain fear and risk-taking behaviors in the rodents.
</P>
<P>
   The implications for humans could be significant, especially in
dealing with certain anxiety or addiction problems. ``If we can
understand how this operates, we may be able to use drugs,
behavioral modification or environmental conditioning to help,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Her research has already indicated that there may be some
genetic underpinnings for mice to seek novelty, and she hopes to
have a specific location for the gene within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the mouse genome is progressing at such a rapid rate,
we can go from mapping to identifying at a much faster (pace),''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But the completion of the human genome, as well as the eventual
completion of the mouse genome, are just the first steps of a long
scientific journey.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is giving you the clues to the problem, but you still
have to follow up on the clues,'' Flaherty said.

BIG LAKE SEEKS TO JOIN PUSH FOR TEXAS TOURISM DOLLARS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Big Lake Mayor J.R. Dunn announced this month that he wants
Big Lake's dry lake filled with water, there was guffawing all over
the state.
</P>
<P>
   Dunn wants the state's largest natural dry lake pumped full of
water to draw tourists and boost the town's dwindling economy. He
figures it will take about 50 to 100 wells.
</P>
<P>
   Big Lake, in Reagan County, is about 280 miles southwest of Fort
Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not Don Quixote; we're realists out here,'' the mayor
told reporters. ``We have the largest natural dry lake in the state
of Texas, and the state's second-largest industry is tourism. We
feel like if we could take advantage of that, we could develop that
and we could create jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how much money is at stake can be seen in the latest
Scripps Howard Texas Poll on vacations, which indicates that 57
percent of Texas' 20 million people will travel this summer, and
that almost a third of them will stay in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   They'll drop between $500 and a $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Tourism is generally considered the third-largest industry in
the state, not the second; nevertheless, it creates $34.6 billion
in local and state revenues.
</P>
<P>
   That's why state tourism officials spent more than a
half-million dollars last month to show off the Lone Star State's
attractions to hundreds of foreign travel professionals meeting in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It also has an awful lot to do with why the city of Fort Worth
drives a handful of longhorn steers about three blocks, and back,
every day. It's why Big Lake's lake needs water.
</P>
<P>
   Texas cities like to show off because it is profitable.
</P>
<P>
   The Scripps Howard Texas Poll indicates that the high price of
gasoline isn't going to stop the locals from traveling around the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty-three percent of all vacationers plan to travel by car, 26
percent by airplane, and 1 percent each by boat or bus.
</P>
<P>
   The poll shows that most of the vacationers won't be gone too
long. Fifty-four percent plan to return home in a week or less.
About 34 percent will stay away for a week to two weeks, and 8
percent get to luxuriate for three weeks or more.
</P>
<P>
   The categories don't add up to 100 percent because there are
always the undecided.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question which city draws the most people. With the
Alamo as the primary backdrop, San Antonio's SeaWorld and Six Flags
Fiesta Texas draw thousands of visitors, along with the River Walk,
the San Antonio Zoo and the Institute of Texan Cultures.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio was the most visited place among Texans who
vacationed in the state last summer, and it is projected to lead
the pack again with about 16 percent of the travelers, down from 25
percent last summer.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest gainer this year seems to be Galveston. Last summer,
Galveston got 6 percent of instate vacationers. This year it
figures to get 9 percent, knocking Corpus Christi out of second
place.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Worth remained steady at about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Austin will get 8 percent; Dallas and Houston both figure at 7
percent.
</P>
<P>
   But there is room for improvement. The poll shows that nearly
half (46 percent) of the vacationing Texans will shamelessly visit
another state this summer. An additional 11 percent will travel to
another country.
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted between May 22 and June 16. One thousand
adult Texans were randomly surveyed by telephone. The margin of
error is plus or minus 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   No decision has been made on whether or not to fill Big Lake's
lake.

   PROTEINS AND CELLS
</P>
<P>
   The role of most genes is to make specific proteins, which are
the working parts of human cells. Depending on the nature of its
string of subunits, which are specified by its gene, a protein can
serve a structural purpose, like a collagen fiber, or catalyze some
chemical reaction important to the cell's metabolism.
</P>
<P>
   Although many proteins of interest have been studied in great
detail, the annotated genome will provide for the first time a
comprehensive parts list of all the proteins the body makes.
</P>
<P>
   Defects in these working proteins, caused by mutations in their
parent genes, are responsible for much of the burden of human
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Understanding the role of every human protein _ proteomics _
will be one of the goals of the post-genome era. The sequence of a
protein, meaning the composition of its subunits, can be predicted
from the sequence of DNA letters in its parent gene, but many
proteins are further processed by the cell in ways that cannot yet
be predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Another initiative made possible by the genome is the complete
understanding of the human cell. Thousands of genes may be active
in a cell at any time, and the cast of players changes when the
cell performs different roles, like responding to a hormone or
slipping into cancerous activity.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently it has been out of the question to study so many
genes simultaneously. But new instruments known as gene expression
chips allow researchers to track which of a cell's genes are
active.
</P>
<P>
   Gene expression chips are made in different ways but all require
prior knowledge of the genes' DNA sequence, now available from the
genome.
</P>
<P>
   The chips may also help elucidate the difference between the 220
known cell types of the human body.
</P>
<P>
   Although every cell possesses its own full copy of the genome,
each type is thought to use only its own special subset of the
genes, the rest being permanently switched off.
</P>
<P>
   The body is a kind of repressive socialist state where every
cell is equal but each must respond precisely to collective
authority or receive orders to self-destruct. The genome is the
authority's archive, containing the plans for each type of cell,
the master program for generating a 10-trillion-celled organism
from a single egg, and the life cycle instructions that guide it
from birth to adolescence and maturity.
</P>
<P>
   TRACKING HUMAN VARIATIONS
</P>
<P>
   In parallel with finding all the genes in the genome, biologists
will also try to track the major variants in DNA sequence found in
the human population. Any two individuals differ on average in one
nucleotide, or DNA unit, in every thousand.
</P>
<P>
   These one unit changes are known as single nucleotide
polymorphisms, or SNPs, and are a principal source of human genetic
variation.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of SNPs, or ``snips,'' should help track down the
variant genes that contribute to disease. Many common diseases,
like diabetes and heart disease, are thought to be caused by
several variant genes acting together. Because each variant makes
only a small contribution to the disease, these genes have hitherto
been particularly hard to identify.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly feel this is going to revolutionize medicine because
we are going to understand not only what causes disease but what
prevents disease,'' said Dr. Stephen T. Warren, a medical
geneticist at Emory University in Atlanta and editor of The
American Journal of Human Genetics. ``We will understand the
mechanism of disease sufficiently to do rational therapy. We will
be able to predict who is at higher risk for particular disease and
provide advice to individuals as to how best to maintain their
health.''
</P>
<P>
   ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS
</P>
<P>
   The ability to diagnose vulnerability to disease on a genomewide
basis will multiply the quandaries already raised by the present
level of genetic testing. Probably almost everyone possesses many
gene variants associated with adverse health effects. This
information could be used to the individual's detriment, if not
kept confidential, and could be psychologically devastating if
diagnosis runs ahead of treatment and the physician has no therapy
to offer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric S. Lander of the Whitehead Institute has contemplated a
``snip chip'' that would diagnose all the major SNPs, or gene
variants, found in the population. Such information would hold
considerable potential for forecasting an individual's medical
fate.
</P>
<P>
   These snip chips are unlikely to be developed soon and their
predictive powers should not be feared, said Dr. James Watson,
president of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think young people are the ones who are afraid to see the
future,'' Watson said. ``Old people see the future and would like
to reverse it.''
</P>
<P>
   Single nucleotide polymorphisms and other genetic elements are
useful in a quite different dimension, that of tracking the
movements of the earliest human populations within Africa and as
they spread throughout the rest of the world. By selecting SNP's
that arose in the course of this expansion, population geneticists
can track genetic differences that are specific to particular
continents and major ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these SNPs lie in regions of the genome that do not code
for genes and have no effect on the body.
</P>
<P>
   Population geneticists know that all people are extremely
similar to one another in genetic terms and believe that the
similarities overwhelm the very minor differences that they are
studying.
</P>
<P>
   But others fear the differences may not be used so benignly.
Caplan, the University of Pennsylvania ethicist, believes
geneticists underestimate both the appetite for this genetic
information and its potential for misuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize how important that drive is to understand
ourselves,'' he said. ``In most parts of the world we define
ourselves by blood and kin, and those are just surrogates for
genes.''
</P>
<P>
   But once the genetic kits have been developed to determine who
is of American Indian ancestry, say, ``It would not surprise me to
see eligibility for casino gambling profits requiring a genetic
test,'' Caplan said. ``We could find people asking who is the
`real' Jew or black person or Serbian.''
</P>
<P>
   He also foresees SNPs being used in conjunction with brain scans
to uncover genetic markers for personality traits like antisocial
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the big surprises for the man in the street will be how
much of our behavior is hard-wired,'' Caplan said. ``And the people
involved in the mapping are medical people who don't spend much
time thinking about the historical and social implications. So
there will be lots of bombshells, some of them sadly revisiting
some of the bigotry that has cycled around genetics for many
years.''

   THE NEW TEMPTATION
</P>
<P>
   Like all powerful knowledge, the genome can be put to good and
bad ends depending on how carefully the knowledge is used. The more
harmful genetic variants are discovered, the more compelling the
logic may seem of fixing the bugs in the genomic programming
directly instead of treating the symptoms in each generation, a
procedure called germ-line gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
   The danger is hardly pressing: Gene therapy applied to treat
ordinary body cells has so far been a failure. But in time the
technique will doubtless work, and the knowledge may be developed
to reprogram the human genome, perhaps to strip it of many known
disease-causing and life-shortening SNPs.
</P>
<P>
   Control of the genome would then fall to some extent under human
direction, bringing vast benefits for health and longevity, but
raising a dire risk of changing human nature in unintended and
unwarranted ways.
</P>
<P>
   The genome, the long-sought manual of evolution's biological
programming, comes with no warning labels as to careful reading and
cautious use. Maybe neither is necessary.

   CUBA-U.S. (Washington) _ House Republican leaders agreed Tuesday
to end 40 years of trade sanctions on food and medicine to Cuba, in
a compromise that carried great political significance but may be
of only symbolic economic value, at least in the short term. House
Republicans had long opposed any weakening of the embargo against
Cuba, arguing that Fidel Castro had done little to institute
democratic reforms. But an intense lobbying campaign from
agribusiness and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce softened their
resolve. Cuban-American lawmakers succeeded in placing serious
restrictions on the bill. Both the federal government and U.S.
banks would be barred from providing any financing for Cuba, making
it difficult for Cuba, which is cash-starved and credit-poor, to
buy goods. By Lizette Alvarez.

and several other states also want to use ``single task'' employees

  (Editors: a list of recommended wines appears at end of story.) 
 By ERIC ASIMOV   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Of all the seasons, summer demands the most of its
beverages, requiring refreshment as well as lightness and balance.
You could drink a heavy Chateauneuf-du-Pape or a tannic cabernet
sauvignon with a hearty roast, but who would want to? The first
rule of summer drinking is not to work up a sweat doing it. That's
where prosecco comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecco, a crisp, light-bodied sparkling wine produced in the
Veneto region of northeast Italy, is a perfect summer aperitif.
It's winsome and light in alcohol, generally around 11 percent, as
slim and stylish as an Italian motor scooter. You might not want
prosecco at a wedding or on New Year's Eve; it doesn't have the
depth of Champagne. But freed from the burden of heavy expectations
and pretensions _ and price, for that matter _ it exists simply to
please.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecco is produced from the white prosecco grape, which is
also used to make still wines, though you rarely see them in the
United States. Most of the sparkling varieties are labeled Prosecco
di Valdobbiadene or Prosecco di Conegliano, two of the prime
prosecco areas in Veneto. A small percentage of prosecco is called
frizzante, meaning it is lightly sparkling with a soft texture,
which I find particularly attractive. But most proseccos are
spumante, or fully sparkling, positively frothing compared with the
frizzante wines. Incidentally, the more famous Asti Spumanti, the
sweet sparkling wines from the Asti region, are made from the
muscat grape, not from prosecco.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, not all proseccos are created equal. It's easy to
find insipid versions that are either too sweet or too dull. But
the following proseccos, all nonvintage and spumanti unless labeled
otherwise, are just right for relaxed summer evenings, when the
world is your hammock and the most difficult problem is deciding
whether to roll over.  &QL; 
 &QL;

SWISS REPORT INCREASE IN FUNDS FROZEN BECAUSE OF SUSPECTED MONEY
LAUNDERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS first graf after optional end to CORRECT 23 to 33.)  
 By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Swiss authorities froze nearly $1 billion in suspicious
money over the past year _ five times as much as the previous year,
when the country began cracking down on money laundering to enhance
its international banking reputation, a monitoring agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Money Laundering Reporting Office, part of the federal
police department, said Swiss banks had blocked dubious funds
involved in 370 reports of suspicious transactions, mostly in the
financial centers of Geneva and Zurich. This compares with 160 the
previous year, and only about 40 before reporting became mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss figures, which covered the 12 months through March,
came a day after the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development issued a list of 35 places that have lenient laws for
tax evaders and a week after an international task force unveiled
its list of 15 countries accused of failing to curb money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland, which was not on either list but whose banking
industry is estimated to manage as much as one-third of the world's
offshore wealth, began its reporting system two years ago to clean
up its banking image. That is part of a plan to step up its fight
against organized and financial crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The figures show money launderers are no longer able to carry
on their activity without risk of detection,'' said Daniel
Thelesklaf, a lawyer who heads the reporting office.
</P>
<P>
   The higher figures for the past year were in part the result of
the discovery of funds linked to the former Nigerian dictator Sani
Abacha, who died in 1998, and his family, Thelesklaf said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 50 tips involved some $485 million in funds linked to
the Abacha cases; overall $670 million was uncovered in related
cases in 17 Swiss banks.
</P>
<P>
   Another 23 reports involved $12 million connected with the Bank
of New York, where some employees are accused of involvement in the
apparent laundering of billions of dollars from Russia. Last
September, Swiss authorities froze $16.8 million in bank accounts
linked to the investigation.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An additional 33 reports involved bank accounts with Russian
owners but have not been tied to the Bank of New York
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Thelesklaf said the growing number of tipoffs is beginning to
approach what might be expected in a financial center of
Switzerland's importance.
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion of wrongdoing can be based on many factors, such as
transactions involving money that cannot be traced to a logical
owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know how much money is laundered,'' he said. ``This
is part of the iceberg, but whether it is the tip or not, we don't
know.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 79 percent of the reports, covering the vast bulk of the
suspicious money, showed evidence of sufficient wrongdoing to be
referred to legal authorities. Prosecutors are still investigating
the cases, a lengthy process because it almost always involves
other countries. Meanwhile, funds are usually kept frozen.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the 370 tips came from banks as opposed to asset
managers, lawyers and others who handle large sums of money,
Thelesklaf said. An April 1998 law requires banks and asset
managers to report suspicious fund activity to the government. He
said the non-banking entities were lagging behind in reporting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't won the money laundering fight yet,'' Thelesklaf
said, ``At the end of the day, we need convictions and asset
seizures to succeed.''

`TRIXIE' MISSING A FEW CLUES
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 1 star 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the endurance test disguised as a detective movie spoof
called ``Trixie,'' Emily Watson speaks exclusively in malapropisms,
Nick Nolte voices nothing but hot air and everybody else says
exactly what you'd expect them to at any given moment.
</P>
<P>
   Watson's title Trixie is a security guard who, despite evident
mental limitations, is determined to prove herself as a private
eye. Via her new assignment at an upstate casino, she has ample
opportunity to encounter suspicious characters, including Nolte's
windbag politician, Dermot Mulroney's klutzy ladykiller, Nathan
Lane's ex-con entertainer and two women of fluid morals and
uncertain self-worth, played by Lesley Ann Warren and Brittany
Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   There's a runaway, some beatings, a mysterious death. Believing
that it's time to fish or get off the pot, Trixie is going to grab
the bull by the tail and look him in the eye, then get her man by
hook or ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Really. She says so _ endlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine two hours of dialogue like that. No, not dialogue, just
setups for Watson to mangle more aphorisms.
</P>
<P>
   When she's not snapping gum.
</P>
<P>
   Which is irritating, too.
</P>
<P>
   The movie was co-written and directed by Alan Rudolph and
produced by Robert Altman, and it exhibits the worst tendencies of
both filmmakers: Rudolph's to stroke a precious conceit to inflamed
rawness (``Welcome to L.A.,'' last year's ``Breakfast of
Champions''), Altman's to permit actors to indulge themselves well
beyond the point of watchability (``Popeye,'' ``Kansas City,''
roughly half of ``Short Cuts'').
</P>
<P>
   These two are, of course, also first-class filmmakers whose
movies are, more often than not, truly special. The same can be
said of the general run of work the fine ensemble members can
claim.
</P>
<P>
   But everything about ``Trixie'' _ comic timing, plot structure,
basic premise _ is so off that not all the talent in the world can
set it on the right track. If you need proof, you can see a good
chunk of it trying to and failing here.
</P>
<P>
   But take my word for it: You don't need proof that badly.
</P>
<P>
   The film: ``Trixie'' (R; sex, nudity, language, violence). &QL; 
The stars: Emily Watson, Dermot Mulroney, Nick Nolte, Nathan Lane,
Lesley Ann Warren, Brittany Murphy. &QL; 
Behind the scenes: Directed by Alan Rudolph. Written by Rudolph and
John Binder. Produced by Robert Altman. Released by Sony Pictures
Classics. &QL; 
Running time: One hour, 57 minutes. &QL; 
Our rating: 1 star

   GERMAN-STYLE POTATO SALAD &QL; 
WITH BACON AND BALSAMIC VINEGAR &QL; 
For German-style salads, the smaller new potatoes are more
attractive because the slices tend not to break up as they do with
bigger potatoes. Balsamic vinegar gives this salad an appealing
sweet/sour flavor. &QL; 
2 pounds red OR new potatoes, boiled, peeled, if desired and cut
into 1/4-inch-thick slices &QL; 
1/4 cup balsamic OR cider vinegar &QL; 
1 teaspoon kosher salt OR 1/2 teaspoon table salt &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper &QL; 
4 to 5 thick slices (about 4 ounces) slab bacon, cut crosswise into
1/4-inch strips &QL; 
1 medium onion, cut into medium dice &QL; 
2 tablespoons vegetable oil &QL; 
1/2 cup beef broth &QL; 
1/4 cup minced fresh parsley &QL; 
Layer warm potato slices in a medium bowl. Sprinkle with 2
tablespoons vinegar, seasoning with salt and pepper as you go.
</P>
<P>
   Fry bacon in a medium skillet over medium heat until bacon is
brown and crisp and fat is rendered, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer with
a slotted spoon to potatoes. Add onion to bacon drippings. Saute
until softened, 4 to 5 minutes. Add up to 2 tablespoons vegetable
oil to yield 2 tablespoons unabsorbed fat. (If bacon is fairly
lean, onion will absorb most of drippings.)
</P>
<P>
   Add beef broth and bring to a boil; add remaining 2 tablespoons
vinegar. Pour broth-onion mixture over potatoes. Add parsley; toss
gently to coat. Adjust seasonings; serve warm or at room
temperature. Makes 6 servings.

<P>
   So much for all the advice. I prefer to do things a tad
differently.
</P>
<P>
   When growing up, the potato salad in our household always had a
sour cream base as my father disliked mayonnaise and thus, it was
never a refrigerator staple. To this day, I don't keep mayo handy.
Instead I dress potato or tuna salads with plain non-fat yogurt or
sour cream (light or regular) doctored up with prepared mustard,
seasonings (sometimes dry ranch dressing mix), red wine vinegar,
chopped dill pickles, dill weed (fresh if I have it, otherwise lots
of dried) and such.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last few years, several of my potato salads have taken
a fresher twist with an olive oil and vinegar-style dressing and
lots of chopped fresh vegetables like tomatoes, cucumbers,
sometimes haricots verts or red or green bell pepper chunks, ripe
olives, plenty of chopped fresh basil and more. Lots of times I
stir in crumbled feta cheese and serve atop mixed baby greens for a
meatless entree when the weather is warm. It's a winner.
</P>
<P>
   For numerous years, I steered clear of making potato salad
entirely _ and whenever friends asked me to bring it to a potluck
summer party, I always begged them to let me bring something else.
I hated the mess (and cleanup) that resulted when I cooked the
potatoes on top of the stove. Even when I tried to monitor the
cooking closely, starchy water seemed to spray everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But one day years ago, it dawned on me that microwaving the
potatoes could save a lot of time, effort and cleanup. My shortcut
experimentation paid off _ and ever since making potato salad has
been a breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Simply rinse the whole unpeeled, potatoes well with cold water
(scrub with a vegetable brush to remove excess dirt), pierce them
in a few places with a sharp knife and arrange in a circle on a
microwave-proof dinner-size plate, stacking with a second layer if
necessary. Zap on high power, uncovered, without any water added
for 15 to 20 minutes (my microwave has a turntable), depending on
the number of potatoes, the density, etc. Check the potatoes after
the first 10 to 12 minutes and then again after 15 minutes or so,
piercing with a knife or fork. Remove any that are tender and done.
There always seem to be a few stragglers that need a few more
minutes of cooking time, probably because of the uneven cooking of
microwave ovens.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the plate to a sink and run cold water over the potatoes
a minute or two. Drain and leave at room temperature until cool.
Then stash, whole, in a plastic bag and chill until cold prior to
cutting up for a salad. If you use thin-skinned red or white
potatoes or Yukon Golds (all of which I prefer), there's no need to
peel them.
</P>
<P>
   I recently experimented with chilling the potatoes versus
cutting them into cubes while warm. I had much better success
cutting up the potatoes when cold _ they don't get mushy and fall
apart as was always my experience when the potatoes were warm.
</P>
<P>
   So now I cook the potatoes (in the microwave) in advance and
refrigerate overnight before making the salad. If you're in a bind,
you can also chill the potatoes quickly in a large bowl of ice
water, but be sure to dry them off before proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking potatoes is one of the best things the microwave oven
does, says former Encino resident Thelma Pressman, microwave
cookbook author and microwave cooking consultant for Bon Appetit
magazine who has been microwaving potatoes for almost 40 years
since she got her first microwave oven.
</P>
<P>
   But she prefers to microwave a few potatoes after wrapping each
one individually in a white paper towel which absorbs moisture and
allows for more even cooking (she does not cook the potatoes on a
plate). If you have several potatoes, she recommends using a paper
(not Styrofoam) plate and covering them (rinsed, but not dried)
with dry white paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to jazz up potato salad offerings on the Fourth and
beyond, consider some of the following takes on the theme, geared
to a variety of tastes. &QL;

POTATO SALAD: AN AMERICAN SUMMER TRADITION
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Potato salad, no matter how it is fashioned, is a summer holiday
tradition for barbecues or picnics. It's a natural with grilled hot
dogs, steaks, hamburgers, chicken and even fish.
</P>
<P>
   Potato salads conjure up lots of different taste memories
depending on what part of the country you hail from. There are
probably as many variations and subtle nuances on the theme as
there are cooks.
</P>
<P>
   They may be dressed with plain mayo, Miracle Whip, sour cream,
yogurt or even occasionally a hot bacon vinegar combination.
Accents can range from prepared yellow mustard and dill pickles to
sweet pickle relish, celery, green or white onions, chopped red
pepper, cucumbers, olives, assorted seasonings and more. Many also
include copious amounts of chopped hard cooked eggs.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are even numerous trendy, contemporary, new-fangled
creations, running the gamut from oil and vinegar-based salads with
lots of vegetables to curried salads with yogurt, mango chutney and
dried fruits _ and even Greek renditions with crumbled feta cheese,
Kalmata olives, cucumbers, tomatoes and such. You can turn potato
salads into main dishes in the blink of an eye with the addition of
chopped up ham, chicken, salmon, shrimp and more.
</P>
<P>
   So what kind of potatoes are best, what is the best way to cook
the potatoes and when should you cut up the potatoes? It all
depends on who's cooking and who you're talking to.
</P>
<P>
   In a chapter on the Perfect Potato Salad in her cookbook, ``The
Perfect Recipe,'' (Houghton Mifflin), author Pam Anderson includes
the following recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Use low-starch potatoes, boil them in their skins, don't salt
the water (seasonings don't penetrate the potato skin), don't peel
the potatoes unless you really want to and use a serrated knife to
cut them. While the potatoes are still warm, drizzle them with a
splash of vinegar. Then proceed with the recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   But other cooks have different thoughts. Some prefer redskin or
white new potatoes, while others use Yukon Gold, Idaho or russets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The type of potato to use in a potato salad has long been a
point of contention with potato salad aficionados,'' writes Philip
Stephen Schulz in his cookbook, ``As American as Apple Pie'' (Simon
and Schuster). ``Mealy versus waxy. Mealy potatoes (such as Idaho
or Maine), considered best for baking and mashing, are `mealy'
because their cells tend to separate when cooked. Waxy potatoes
(like Early Rose and Green Mountain), on the other hand, are more
cohesive and therefore do not absorb as much. I often use the mealy
type for vinaigrette-based dressings because they do absorb, and
waxy for mayonnaise concoctions because they do not. But as far as
I'm concerned, it's entirely up to the cook.''
</P>
<P>
   Tristan Millar, director of marketing for Frieda's, Inc., a Los
Alamitos- based distributor and marketer of specialty produce,
prefers any kind of red or white baby potatoes for potato salads
because you don't have to peel them and they have a firm, not
crumbly texture. Yukon Golds, with their waxy texture and buttery
flavor _ are also good for potato salad as are fingerlings with
their thin skin and nutty flavor. Idaho and purple potatoes are
soft and crumbly and are better for mashed potatoes, she says.
</P>
<P>
   After testing several varieties, Anderson preferred low-starch
boiling potatoes such as Red Bliss and new potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higher-starch potatoes _ russets, all-purpose and Yukon Golds
_ are not sturdy enough for salad making. They fell apart when cut
and looked sloppy in salad form,'' she notes.
</P>
<P>
   Boiling was Anderson's method of choice for cooking potatoes.
She also noted that warm potatoes are just as absorbent as hot ones
and hold together much better, so she advises cooling them a bit
before cutting.
</P>
<P>
   Shulz writes that potatoes, no matter which type you use, should
be cooked unpeeled in boiling water just until tender.
</P>
<P>
   ``Avoid overcooking as the potatoes will disintegrate into
pieces when tossed with a dressing.'' He tests the potatoes by
inserting a sharp knife into the center.

SEEING OPPORTUNITIES IN JAPAN, U.S. FINANCIER BUYS TOKYO SOWA
BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Japanese government said Tuesday that it would sell
the bankrupt Tokyo Sowa Bank to an investment fund led by Wilbur
Ross, a specialist in corporate rescues who has made a name for
himself through investing in financially distressed companies in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' fund, the Asia Recovery Fund, will pay 35 billion yen, or
about $331 million at Tuesday's exchange rates, for Tokyo Sowa, the
second Japanese bank it has purchased. Last month, the government
sold the fund the failed Kofuku Bank, which operates mainly in
Osaka, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo Sowa is the third bank the government has sold to
foreigners and the sixth nationalized bank it has returned to the
private sector since it began overhauling the country's shaky
financial system two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it hands Tokyo Sowa over to Ross, the government
will have spent 70 billion yen, or about $673 million, cleaning it
up.
</P>
<P>
   Ross has been one of the most serious foreign investors in Asia
since the financial crisis that gripped much of the region in 1997.
A bankruptcy specialist in the United States, he has promoted the
idea of ``vulture investing'' here, or purchasing distressed
businesses that can be salvaged for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Ross has said he sees vast opportunities in the Japanese banking
industry, which has been riddled with bad loans as a legacy of the
speculative bubble economy of the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   By melding the two troubled Japanese banks he is purchasing,
Ross plans to create a network of 200 branches offering services to
individuals and small and mid-sized companies in and around Tokyo
and Osaka, Japan's two largest cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will give us critical mass, making critical investments
in information technology and marketing more affordable,'' Ross
said.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo Sowa is smaller than Kofuku, but has several strengths
that Ross said he hopes will enhance the investment. The Tokyo bank
is known for having one of the best automated teller machine
networks in Japan, distinguishing itself by offering a broad range
of 24-hour services, still relatively rare here.
</P>
<P>
   It also issues credit cards, a business that Kofuku abandoned
but would now like to re-enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now will have a big distribution system through which we
can offer money management, insurance and other products that
generate fees,'' Ross said. ``Increasing sales of fee-based
products is key for Japanese banks. Interest rates are too low here
to make a good rate of return with your balance sheet alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Japanese interest rates have been near zero for more than a year
because of Japan's weak economy. The low rates have helped banks by
keeping their own borrowing costs down. But the low rates also mean
the banks have little reason to loan more money and must find other
ways to be profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Ross has been making a name for himself in Asia, at a time when
many private equity investors are complaining about what they call
the difficulty of finding attractive deals.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Ross' investment firm, W.L. Ross &AMP; Co., joined with
the American International Group Inc., a leading American insurer,
to invest $800 million in a mutual fund company that is part of
South Korea's giant Hyundai conglomerate. Ross' firm also owns a
life insurance company in South Korea and is managing the
resolution of some defaulted loans for the South Korean government.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, Ross has invested in a bankrupt auto parts
manufacturer and the two banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's baloney to say there aren't opportunities in this
region,'' Ross said. ``You just have to be prepared to do things
differently than the way we do them in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In the bidding for Tokyo Sowa, Ross beat out Shinsei Bank,
formerly known as Long-Term Credit Bank, which is owned by a group
of investors led by Ripplewood Holdings LLC, a Wall Street
investment firm, and H.I.S., a travel agency that specializes in
selling discount tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The government said the deal with Ross' group was the best for
Japanese taxpayers. But officials at the Financial Reconstruction
Commission, the agency overseeing the restructuring of the
financial sector, also may be irritated with Shinsei and
disinclined to do business with it.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of Ripplewood's purchase of Shinsei, the bank is
not responsible for a broad category of loans that go bad _ the
government must pay them instead.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the government have said such an arrangement is
unfairly generous to Shinsei and victimizes Japanese taxpayers.

THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR IS LOST ON HOLLYWOOD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 2)  
 By JAMIE MALANOWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like fireworks _ loud, dazzling, pleasing and scary to the most
impressionable _ ``The Patriot,'' the new movie starring Mel
Gibson, will prove to many a satisfying way to spend a summer
evening. It's got big battles and wrenching hand-to-hand combat, a
courageous but conflicted hero and a dastardly and totally
guilt-free villain, thrills, tenderness, sorrow, rage and a little
bit of kissing. There is just enough brain bran to keep the
postfilm discussions from being dominated by people who want to
focus on how cool it was when Mel hit that guy with the hatchet.
Why, some may think it's the best Revolutionary War movie ever
made.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to our point: It is also one of the very few
Revolutionary War movies ever made, most of which are not all that
good. Disney's ``Johnny Tremain'' (1957) is shallow and childish,
hardly a fair representation of Esther Forbes' flinty and
hardheaded novel; it even features a cringe-inducing moment when
smiling Sons of Liberty stroll the streets of Boston singing a kind
of fight song. John Ford's ``Drums Along the Mohawk'' (1939) just
transplants the Ford formula and stock company from Monument Valley
in 1876 to the Mohawk Valley in 1776. There the simple, amiable,
good-hearted and altogether too cute rustics turn ferocious when
their settlements are threatened by Indians; the British are nearly
invisible, represented almost entirely by a vulpine, eye-patched
John Carradine, who incites the Indians to commit their atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   ``1776'' (1972) is a pretty good parlor trick; not all that
great a musical, and not all that great a drama about declaring
independence, it's an engaging melding of the two. It now seems to
have found a niche as an educational tool for fifth-graders getting
their first exposure to U.S. history. Hugh Hudson's ``Revolution''
(1985), starring Al Pacino, is dark, murky and poorly plotted; its
box office toxicity warned future filmmakers with head-on-a-pike
firmness to stay away from this theme. Which may explain why the
sluggish ``Jefferson in Paris'' (1995) takes place entirely after
the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   There is also ``The Devil's Disciple'' (1959), a pretty good
adaptation of Shaw's play set during the Revolution, and Robert
Stack as ``John Paul Jones'' (1959), George Arliss in ``Alexander
Hamilton'' (1931), a bad 1940 Cary Grant movie called ``The Howards
of Virginia,'' and ``Funky Phantom,'' which according to the
Internet Movie Data Base (www.imdb.com) is a 1971 movie about
``three teens and the ghost of a patriot from the American
Revolution who set across the country to uphold justice and fight
for freedom.'' This isn't an exhaustive list _ it omits a few
silents and some minor talkies _ but it does appear we've managed
to pick out the biggest chunks.
</P>
<P>
   Think for a moment about what isn't there. Where's that George
Washington biopic starring Gary Cooper? The quiet, iconic
action-loving movie star would have done a good job playing the
quiet, iconic, action-loving father of his country. Errol Flynn
portrayed everybody from the Earl of Essex to Jeb Stuart, went
everywhere from the Crimea in ``The Charge of the Light Brigade''
to the Little Big Horn in ``They Died With Their Boots On'';
where's his Paul Revere? (Granted, while Flynn seems perfect for
the midnight ride part, he might not have been up to the
silversmithing aspect of the gig.)
</P>
<P>
   Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas, Gregory Peck _ any of them would
have done a good job besting the libertine Gen. Johnny Burgoyne
(Laurence Harvey, maybe, or Dirk Bogarde) at Saratoga, the turning
point of the war (and wouldn't John Wayne have been perfect as Col.
Daniel Morgan, the big heroic rifleman who once took 500 lashes for
slugging a British officer?). Did no one think to connect the
rebels of '76 with the rebellious kids of the '60s: Consider a
Boston Tea Party with Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, Christopher Jones
and Yvette Mimieux, Richard Lester directing. What about the dark
story of Benedict Arnold _ hero of the revolution, general of the
army _ who betrays the cause when he falls for the beautiful Tory
debutante Peggy Shippen; Jack Nicholson and Bob Rafelson would
surely have done something interesting with this tale of
self-destruction on a historic scale. Instead, ``Funky Phantom.''
We cast about for explanations.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 50 years of making motion pictures,'' said David Brown,
the dean of Hollywood producers, ``when it came to stories about
American history, particularly stories about the American
Revolution, the prevailing opinion, beginning with the studio
moguls like Zanuck and Selznick, was that the box office would be
bad. Jack Warner had a classic rule. `I don't want any pictures,'
he would say, `where they write with a feather.'''
</P>
<P>
   But obviously the old-time moguls allowed a lot of
feather-writers to make it to the screen _ Queen Elizabeth and the
Armada, Lady Caroline and Admiral Nelson, Napoleon and Josephine,
and multiple versions of ``The Scarlet Pimpernel,'' ``A Tale of Two
Cities'' and ``War and Peace.'' There was even the Spencer Tracy
movie about the French and Indian War, ``Northwest Passage''
(which, in combination with Michael Mann's splendid ``Last of the
Mohicans,'' means there have been more good movies about that
conflict than about the War for Independence.) It's not period
pieces the moguls didn't like; it's the American Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to remember,'' said Brown, who himself has tried to
develop the story of George Washington, ``that a lot of these men
came from Eastern Europe, and they were Anglophiles. A lot of us
had the sense that through these movies they somehow wanted to
endear themselves to the aristocrats who threw them out.''
</P>
<P>
   The film historian David Thomson also points to their
Anglophilia, as well as the extent to which the moguls were keeping
an eye on the passions of their own times. ``They were very against
the idea of revolution and revolutionary views. They saw it in
Europe, and they were afraid of it happening in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Along these lines, perhaps it was not entirely irrelevant to
their thinking that America's enemy in the Revolution just happened
to have been our ally in two world wars and a Cold War. Why go out
of your way to dredge up some long-reconciled misunderstandings
when they was a globe full of German, Japanese and Russian enemies
to conquer before the credits roll?
</P>
<P>
   Mogul psychology notwithstanding, some people _ historians _ who
would love to see more Revolutionary War movies are nonetheless
sympathetic to the view that the Revolutionary era is not easy for
modern audiences to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us have trouble at first perceiving those people as
real,'' said the historian David McCullough, whose biography of
John Adams will be published next year. ``Because of their
clothing, and the wigs, and their mannered way of speaking, they
are like characters in a costume pageant.
</P>
<P>
   ``Also, we're handicapped because they don't appear in
photographs. One reason we find the Civil War more accessible, and
why there have been more movies about it, is that we've seen the
Civil War soldiers, and we identify with them much more readily
than we do with those in the Revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   Joseph J. Ellis, whose 1997 biography of Thomas Jefferson,
``American Sphinx,'' won the National Book Award, said: ``The lack
of realistic images means that all we see are paintings and
iconographic renderings that all have a celebratory, patriotic,
posed quality. Because the movies are realistic, they have a hard
time measuring up. It's like when I was a kid, and I loved
listening to the Lone Ranger on the radio. When I finally saw him
on TV, I was disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis also sees the big differences between the eras as a
factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are, despite what Tom Brokaw says, really our greatest
generation, but they are also kind of a lost generation. Remember,
they are pre-modern _ pre-Marx, pre-Freud, pre-Darwin,
pre-Stravinsky, pre-Keynes, and they are covered with this
patriotic haze. They are sufficiently different from us that it
really requires a willingness on our part to put ourselves back to
a time that is really lost.''
</P>
<P>
   They are also different from us on the crucial matter of
slavery; as William Hallahan, author of ``The Day the American
Revolution Began,'' pointed out: ``It's very hard for today's
audiences to root for a slaveholder. We're very quick to spot
hypocrisy in our current politicians, and these guys, even the
non-slaveholders, though great and brilliant men, all have feet of
clay.''

   Ellis said: ``Coming to terms with your father is always a
tricky thing. One is never really capable of seeing them with
complete detachment, and these men are our political fathers. We
are still living with their institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   As ``The Patriot'' shows, however, the challenge of creating
characters that can be understood by modern audiences is hardly
insuperable. Mel Gibson's Benjamin Martin is pretty modern: devoted
to his family, wracked by guilt, and possessed of a Bob Vila-esque
interest in furniture-making. Although he is a South Carolina
planter, he is not a slave owner but an employer of freed blacks, a
circumstance that the film's advisers, from the Smithsonian
Institution, found completely credible. (It helped that the Martin
plantation is in the back country, not the low country, where
slavery was prevalent.) Martin does not seem to possess the hip,
edgy, self-referential sense of humor of many moderns; but then,
he's better with a flintlock.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Patriot'' screenwriter, Robert Rodat, who also wrote the
screenplay for ``Saving Private Ryan,'' saw the connective tissue
early on in his research phase, when he read the letters and
journals of the colonists. ``I was struck by how immediate they
felt,'' he said. ``They were very much like the letters and
journals I read for `Saving Private Ryan.' Their concerns were
identical: duty and family.''
</P>
<P>
   Roland Emmerich, director of ``The Patriot,'' said: ``I'm always
skeptical about historical dramas. But I could see that these were
characters I could relate to, and they were engaged in a conflict
that had a significant outcome _ the creation of the first modern
democratic government.'' It does not come as much of a surprise to
hear that the first thing Emmerich did after reading the
screenplay, which he liked immediately, was to thumb through a film
guide, looking to see if this kind of film had been done before,
wondering why it hadn't. It's encouraging that the studio, Sony,
showed no a priori aversion to the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope this movie is a good one,'' said McCullough, who would
like to see the film spark interest in the Revolution the way
``Saving Private Ryan'' rekindled interest in World War II. ``The
importance of what those people accomplished cannot be overstated,
and under those costumes and wigs they were as vivid and as capable
as any generation in our history. To fight and get shot and to die
like that, to suffer disease and hunger and really horrible
conditions, to be poorly clothed, poorly fed, and poorly led, and
to still fight on? They were as strong as any characters! To have
been in Philadelphia in the first days of July in 1776, knowing
that the British had just landed 32,000 troops _ a force larger
than the population of Philadelphia _ in Staten Island, just a day
and a half's march away, and to still declare independence? These
are characters! These are stories!''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of what they wrote with.

 &HT;    MEXICO'S CARDENAS: DEMOCRATIC HERO OR SPOILER?
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ To supporters he's the only true hero of Mexican
democracy and the impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   To others Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is in danger of going down in
history as a spoiler, the man who foiled a historic opportunity to
end 71 years of one-party rule in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   At 66, Cardenas is the spiritual leader of Mexico's left and the
son of one of this country's most beloved, nationalistic
presidents. In his third attempt at the presidency, polls are
showing that Cardenas is lagging in third place as Mexicans prepare
for the most competitive presidential election ever on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With all campaigning to stop by law on Wednesday, Cardenas has
rejected 11th-hour appeals to withdraw and unite with a stronger
opposition candidate, conservative Vicente Fox Quesada. A
withdrawal by Cardenas _ analysts agree _ would greatly enhance
Fox's chances of toppling Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the PRI, and forming what he promises would be a plural
``transitional'' government.
</P>
<P>
   In most opinion surveys of likely voters, Fox is in a virtual
tie with the PRI's candidate _ averaging out to around 40 percent
each _ while Cardenas ranges from 12-to-20 percent support. These
same polls also show that as much as 20 percent of the electorate
is undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understand, Cuauhtemoc: To unite forces is what's best for the
country and for your people. We would share the government and the
responsibility of a transition,'' Fox said in a speech Saturday
night before an estimated 200,000 supporters here.
</P>
<P>
   But at his own equally huge rally the next day, Cardenas
bitterly spurned Fox, who has alternately insulted Cardenas and
tried to woo him and his party, the Democratic Revolutionary Party,
or PRD.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mournful cries are those of one who knows he will lose,''
Cardenas, the former mayor of Mexico City, said, attacking Fox in
his speech with as much vigor as he attacked the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Fox) really had, as he claims, 40, 46 or 48 percent of all
votes, would he be calling me,'' Cardenas asked. ``Would he be so
desperately begging for the votes of the PRD?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody here is looking for work from him,'' Cardenas
continued, prompting cries of support from those gathered in the
main square in Mexico City, where the PRD is strong. ``To think
that Fox would share power would be to believe in another one of
his lies.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRD and Fox's party, the pro-free-market National Action
Party, the PAN, tried unsuccessfully last year to form an alliance
to select one candidate. Despite their ideological differences, the
parties have backed mutual candidates for several governors' races.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cardenas' position on Sunday was that the PAN and the PRD
are basically enemies: ``Our political proposals, our styles of
government and our way of life are diametrically opposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many Mexicans who voted for Cardenas in the past have
thrown their support to Fox, the crowd at Cardenas' rally relished
his words. For hard-core Cardenas supporters voting for the PRI and
the PAN are the same sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to kick out Bismarck so I can put Hitler into
office,'' said Jorge Martinez, 53, a university professor who wore
a yellow PRD scarf on his head at Cardenas' rally.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox, who has fought to overcome his party's stuffy image,
has picked up significant backing from some leftist leaders whose
priority is to defeat the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Two former top Cardenas advisors, Jorge Castaneda, a leading
writer, and Adolfo Aguilar Zinzer, an independent senator, are on
Fox's team. Porfirio Munoz Ledo, a PRD co-founder who broke from
the party for his own presidential bid, dropped out of the race
recently to support Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox held a meeting Monday with other leftists who chastised
Cardenas for refusing to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (PRI candidate) Francisco Labastida wins, it will be in
good part the fault of Cardenas, who, in spite of Vicente Fox's
repeated calls for unity, has acted with extreme stubbornness,''
said Indian community leader Julian Jimenez Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   For Cardenas, this will most likely be his last run at the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a dozen years he has been at the forefront of the
fight to make Mexico a more democratic, less economically polarized
nation. Although Mexico is the world's fifth-largest oil-producing
nation, halfenas was a member of the PRI, like his father, but he
broke with the party to run in 1988 as presidential candidate of a
leftist coalition. The election was widely viewed as stolen from
Cardenas by Carlos Salinas de Gortari _ burned ballots were found
and suspicious computer crashes occurred. After that, Cardenas
emerged as a tireless critic of PRI corruption and free-market
economic reforms led by President Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas lost a second run at the presidency in 1994, when
Mexicans were gripped by fear after a spate of political
assassinations, including PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo

   center left Mihm with a few words that, three years later, are
prophetic. Maybe he was just being polite or maybe he meant it, but
Robinson told the young 7-footer that he some day expected to see
him in the NBA. ``I remember David telling me that Chris impressed
him on the court and off the court,'' said Jeff Austin, the

HISTORY ASIDE, `PATRIOT' A SPECTACLE TO BEHOLD
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When they make films about the birth of our nation that try to
be thoughtful, like ``Revolution'' and ``Jefferson in Paris,'' the
results tend to be very bad. So now they've made one where thinking
is a secondary consideration, if even that, and the outcome is, if
not really better, at least rather fun.
</P>
<P>
   The key image in Roland Emmerich's long, unwieldy and resolutely
superficial ``The Patriot'' is not of Mel Gibson waving various
early combinations of red, white and blue, nor even of his face
covered in crimson blood to evoke fond memories of the Pictish
warpaint he wore in the just as dumb but cooler ``Braveheart.'' No,
the telling shot here is of a Continental soldier's head getting
knocked off by a British cannonball. It nicely encapsulates the
film's anything-for-an-effect ethos and, of course, symbolically
comments on the filmmaker's opinion of the picture's perfect
audience (right before the decapitation, there's a subjective shot
of the projectile barreling right at us). &QL; 
The rest of the movie is more subtle, if only incrementally. But
Emmerich, whose gift for action staging and visual splendor
counterbalances his tendencies to simplify and pander, often sweeps
us along with pure spectacle. ``The Patriot'' is a gorgeous film _
just, like too many pretty things, more emptier than it aspires to
be.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson's Benjamin Martin is a South Carolina widower with seven
children and _ in a flagrant attempt to avoid anything resembling
honest or, God forbid, complicated social history _ a plantation
worked by ``free'' blacks. Of course, Frances Marion, the
Revolutionary figure Martin is clearly based on, was as fervently
committed to slavery as he was to killing redcoats, an attitude
likely shared by most of his fellow Southern landowners in the 18th
Century.
</P>
<P>
   But that's a different, contradictory movie, and the last thing
a filmmaker like Germany's Emmerich _ whose usual speed is pop
culture pastiches like ``Independence Day'' and the ``Godzilla''
remake _ wants to do is challenge anyone's complacency. So Martin
is not only incredibly ahead of his time, racial
enlightenment-wise, he's also All About Family.
</P>
<P>
   Which we all know is really important. Maybe the most important
thing. Along with, maybe, freedom and stuff. And paying fewer
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   See, even though he was a holy terror in the French and Indian
Wars, Martin is reluctant to join the rebellion for the sake of his
children. He's also, it's bludgeoningly hinted, a little worried
about turning back into the brutal killer he became in the earlier
conflict. Indeed, it's the same psychic no-man's-land Clint
Eastwood explored so brilliantly against the backdrop of frontier
capitalism in ``Unforgiven,'' and it would have been very
interesting to examine how that kind of violent nature fit into the
idealistic struggle to create the first modern democratic republic.
</P>
<P>
   But nah, Martin only goes Mad Max when despicable Brits
terrorize his kids, which essentially lets him off any ethical
hook. With his Cherokee tomahawk and ragtag band of backwater
militia, Martin essentially invents modern guerrilla warfare and
harasses an uncomprehending Cornwallis (Tom Wilkinson,
self-parodying stuffiness with a deft intelligence that comes from
a whole other movie) all the way from Charleston to Yorktown.
During downtimes between ambushes, of which there are plenty,
Martin bonds with his oldest son/second-in-command Gabriel (Heath
Ledger, another Aussie), makes tentative passes at his just-waiting
sister-in-law (Joely Richardson, who is English) and tries to get
his mute youngest daughter to say she loves Daddy (I think the girl
who plays her might actually be American).
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to well-meaning, slightly psychotic family man
Martin, the main British villain, Reinhard Heydrich ... er, that
is, dragoon Col.William Tavington (Jason Isaacs), likes to ride
around the countryside slaughtering entire communities at a time.
While such depredations have certainly accompanied military actions
from Carthage through Mongol invasions to the Thirty Years War,
you'd think that if such Nazi-like atrocities had occurred during
our war of independence, they might have made their way into the
national lore before now. Really makes you dislike Tavington,
though, which, it could safely be argued, was the point.
</P>
<P>
   So, you wonder, what on Earth is right about ``The Patriot''?
Good gory battle scenes, first and foremost (the raid Martin takes
two of his youngest sons _ the only allies around who can handle
muskets _ on is particularly chilling). Though not quite as
visceral as ``Braveheart's'' best, nor as appallingly wasteful as
the point blank exchanges in the Civil War drama ``Glory,'' they
convincingly evoke the futility of fighting superior forces with
conventional methods. Conversely, we're given a clear understanding
of how imagination and surprise can be a general's greatest
weapons. Plus, all those blue and red uniforms blood-up real
pretty.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a nice ration of sly humor to counterpoint the grim
and sentimental goings-on. ``Patriot's'' script is credited to
Robert Rodat, whose screenplay for ``Saving Private Ryan'' had its
share of detractors, but compared to this melodrama, it clearly
stands out as a rigorous and complex study of men fighting the good
fight despite what it does to them.
</P>
<P>
   But if ``The Patriot'' is cartoon history, at least it's full of
color and motion like a good cartoon should be. Enjoy the
spectacle, let the cheap emotions touch you if they can ... but
don't forget to duck that cannonball. &QL;

`PATRIOT': VISUAL FIREWORKS, DUD OF A PLOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 Our Grade: B  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood's new Revolutionary War drama ``The Patriot'' has so
much going for it in terms of production design, believable battle
sequences and Mel Gibson's star power that it's actually painful to
gradually discover that it has a flag-waving dumbness at its core.
</P>
<P>
   With a gut-wrenching revenge theme that's similar to
``Gladiator,'' its fellow historical epic in this summer's movie
sweepstakes, it's likely to be every bit as popular with young
moviegoers and further re-establish this long dormant movie genre
as the hottest box-office prospect of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   But, unfortunately, it isn't nearly as smart as ``Gladiator''
and ends up being something of a missed opportunity. What could
have been Hollywood's greatest examination of our War of
Independence is finally a movie so intent on being ``Saving Private
Ryan: the Prequel'' that it clumsily distorts history.
</P>
<P>
   Suggested by the life of Gen. Francis Marion, the famous ``Swamp
Fox,'' it's the story of a wealthy South Carolina farmer (Gibson)
who _ remembering the horrors of the French and Indian War _
refuses to join the Colonies' rebellion against Britain.
</P>
<P>
   But when the nastiest British general this side of Jack the
Ripper (Jason Isaacs) murders his young son, he sees the errors of
his pacific ways and joins the cause with both barrels blazing,
forming an intrepid band of South Carolina irregulars that harasses
General Cornwallis and Co. with Viet Cong-like guerrilla tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Visually, it's a gorgeous movie. Production designer Kirk
Petruccelli and cinematographer Caleb Deschanel _ arguably
Hollywood's finest cameraman _ have created what could well stand
as the movies' most splendid evocation of Colonial America, and
have done it in a rather subtle way, without showy effects that
call attention to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Director Roland Emmerich (``Independence Day,'' ``Godzilla'')
also shines _ and boosts the film to the level of a satisfying
combat epic _ with some extraordinary battle scenes that recall
both star Gibson's work in ``Braveheart'' and Stanley Kubrick's
horrifyingly formal Napoleonic exchanges in his 1975 ``Barry
Lyndon.''
</P>
<P>
   The supporting performances _ Heath Ledger as Gibson's oldest
son, Tom Wilkinson as Cornwallis and especially Tcheky Karyo as a
Lafayette-like French adviser _ are all enjoyable, and Gibson
himself is terrific. His explosive power and personal charm fairly
light up the screen and, like Warren Beatty, he's learned that the
more flawed his character, the more the audience likes him.
</P>
<P>
   But, while ``Gladiator'' was a bona fide historical epic in the
tradition of ``Ben-Hur,'' ``Spartacus'' and ``Lawrence of Arabia''
that used Russell Crowe's star-power as one element of its complex
palette, ``The Patriot'' is very much a Mel Gibson star vehicle: a
movie in which every element is designed to showcase his
personality.
</P>
<P>
   So he's thoroughly sympathetic and politically correct (he's the
one big landowner in South Carolina who doesn't own slaves), and
often super-human _ as when he single-handedly takes on 20 armed
Redcoats, Douglas Fairbanks-style, and vanquishes them all with a
tomahawk. By the end of the movie, it's clear we owe our
independence to him personally.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, while it's understandable that Robert Rodat's
script might want to duplicate his ``Saving Private Ryan'' success,
and even admirable that he wants the film to be a similar tribute
to the sacrifices of our Revolutionary War servicemen, it's
disappointing that the only way Rodat can think to do this is to
turn the British into crypto-Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The historically complex Revolutionary War is, like ``Ryan,''
depicted here as a battle between good and evil, between
peace-loving Americans and slobbering, fiendish brutes who hang and
shoot small children, and _ at one point _ burn an entire village
of men, women and children to death in a boarded-up church.
</P>
<P>
   It's too bad. With a slightly lighter hand, a bit more
intelligence and a healthy dash of moral ambiguity in the script,
this might have been a classic _ a truly memorable movie about the
American Revolution _ instead of a stunning-looking, undeniably
compelling but empty-headed shoot 'em up.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriot. Directed by Roland Emmerich. Written by Robert
Rodat. Cast: Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, Joely Richardson, Jason
Isaacs, Chris Cooper, Tcheky Karyo, Tom Wilkinson. Columbia. 158
minutes. Rated R for violence.

 &HT;    RESTORING ``CROWN JEWEL'' GETS BIPARTISAN LOOK
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - With key administration officials looking on, a
bipartisan group of senators Tuesday unveiled a bill authorizing a
$7.8 billion, 30-plus year restoration of the Everglades.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the Everglades a ``crown jewel'' of America's
environment on the scale of the Grand Tetons or Yellowstone
National Park, Sen. Bob Smith, R-N.H., said ``it is our moral
obligation to restore this for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee
which today will vote on the restoration plan _ which is similar to
the administration plan commonly known as the ``restudy.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan establishes a science-based process of reversing more
than a century of efforts to drain and control the Everglades by
restoring the sheetflow of water across much of South Florida. The
bill provides assurances that most of the additional water will be
used for environmental purposes while giving the state greater
authority to determine how the water will be allocated.
</P>
<P>
   The bill authorizes 10 of the 68 projects included in the plan
at an initial cost of $1 billion to be split evenly between the
federal and state governments. The other projects are expected to
be authorized as they are ready for construction.
</P>
<P>
   Also included are four pilot projects, costing $69 million,
designed to test new technologies that might be used later in the
restoration.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who attended a news conference
unveiling the bill, called it a ``template for environmental
restoration'' and hailed it as the most important environmental
legislation in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Babbitt noted that the legislation attempts to save the dying
Everglades National Park by restoring an ecosystem stretching from
Orlando to Florida Bay. The bill coordinates the responsibilities
of numerous federal agencies and sets up an equal partnership
between the federal and state governments over the project's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hefty price tag, Smith _ one of the most
conservative members of the Senate _ said he felt it necessary for
the federal government to spend the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the right thing to do for everybody, especially for a
conservative,'' Smith said. ``I don't believe it is
anti-conservative to be pro-environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ---STORY COULD TRIM HERE---
</P>
<P>
   Environmental groups hailed the bill as a goal they have long
sought, but said they wanted an even stronger assurance that clean
water would be supplied to the natural areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation is a bipartisan starting point from which
</P>
<P>
   the Congress and the administration can work to conserve a
critical
</P>
<P>
   natural system on which both people and wildlife depend. It's a
</P>
<P>
   tremendous opportunity for Congress to demonstrate its
commitment to conserve and protect an irreplaceable national
treasure,'' said Michael Bauer, director of the National Wildlife
Federation's Everglades Project.
</P>
<P>
   Today's committee action could produce fireworks over the future
of Homestead Air Force Base, which is being considered for
conversion to a cargo airport.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, said he supports the restoration
bill but will offer an amendment asking that the airport's final
use be determined by the secretary of the Army in consultation with
the secretary of Interior and the head of the Environmental
Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``My personal opinion is that I would rather see anything other
than a large cargo airport right next to the Everglades,''
Voinovich said.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Sens. Bob Graham, a Democrat, and Connie Mack, a
Republican, indicated they would oppose the amendment. Graham is a
member of the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Both noted that Homestead's use has been studied once since 1994
and a second environmental impact study is nearing completion.
</P>
<P>
   Graham, who as Florida's governor launched the ``Save the
Everglades'' program in 1983, said the restoration bill would go a
long way toward his goal of ``rolling back the calendar'' and
making the area look more like it did in the 1880s than in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Graham noted that there were no differences between the projects
recommended by the Army Corps of Engineers' restudy and this bill,
but there are some differences in the relationships between the
federal agencies and between the federal and state governments.
</P>
<P>
   Mack, who is retiring from Congress this year after 18 years,
said an Everglades restoration bill would be a fitting parting
gift.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Browner, a Miami native and administrator of the
Environmental Protection Agency, said the restoration plan was
important not only to protect the environment but also to provide
an assured supply of clean water to South Florida's 6.5 million
people, a number expected to double within 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good news for the state's $14 billion tourism
industry, it's good news for the state's agriculture industry and
it's good news for future generations of Floridians,'' Browner
said.

   Many local experiments have shown that disabled students who
help shape their own education are far more likely to graduate, get
into college or support themselves.
</P>

   But a federal compliance audit issued this year said that at

be a condition of receiving federal funds for education of students

 &HT;    MEXICO'S CARDENAS: DEMOCRATIC HERO OR SPOILER?
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ To supporters he's the only true hero of Mexican
democracy and the impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   To others Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is in danger of going down in
history as a spoiler, the man who foiled a historic opportunity to
end 71 years of one-party rule in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   At 66, Cardenas is the spiritual leader of Mexico's left and the
son of one of this country's most beloved, nationalistic
presidents. In his third attempt at the presidency, polls are
showing that Cardenas is lagging in third place as Mexicans prepare
for the most competitive presidential election ever on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With all campaigning to stop by law on Wednesday, Cardenas has
rejected 11th-hour appeals to withdraw and unite with a stronger
opposition candidate, conservative Vicente Fox Quesada. A
withdrawal by Cardenas _ analysts agree _ would greatly enhance
Fox's chances of toppling Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the PRI, and forming what he promises would be a plural
``transitional'' government.
</P>
<P>
   In most opinion surveys of likely voters, Fox is in a virtual
tie with the PRI's candidate _ averaging out to around 40 percent
each _ while Cardenas ranges from 12-to-20 percent support. These
same polls also show that as much as 20 percent of the electorate
is undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understand, Cuauhtemoc: To unite forces is what's best for the
country and for your people. We would share the government and the
responsibility of a transition,'' Fox said in a speech Saturday
night before an estimated 200,000 supporters here.
</P>
<P>
   But at his own equally huge rally the next day, Cardenas
bitterly spurned Fox, who has alternately insulted Cardenas and
tried to woo him and his party, the Democratic Revolutionary Party,
or PRD.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mournful cries are those of one who knows he will lose,''
Cardenas, the former mayor of Mexico City, said, attacking Fox in
his speech with as much vigor as he attacked the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Fox) really had, as he claims, 40, 46 or 48 percent of all
votes, would he be calling me,'' Cardenas asked. ``Would he be so
desperately begging for the votes of the PRD?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody here is looking for work from him,'' Cardenas
continued, prompting cries of support from those gathered in the
main square in Mexico City, where the PRD is strong. ``To think
that Fox would share power would be to believe in another one of
his lies.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRD and Fox's party, the pro-free-market National Action
Party, the PAN, tried unsuccessfully last year to form an alliance
to select one candidate. Despite their ideological differences, the
parties have backed mutual candidates for several governors' races.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cardenas' position on Sunday was that the PAN and the PRD
are basically enemies: ``Our political proposals, our styles of
government and our way of life are diametrically opposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many Mexicans who voted for Cardenas in the past have
thrown their support to Fox, the crowd at Cardenas' rally relished
his words. For hard-core Cardenas supporters voting for the PRI and
the PAN are the same sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to kick out Bismarck so I can put Hitler into
office,'' said Jorge Martinez, 53, a university professor who wore
a yellow PRD scarf on his head at Cardenas' rally.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox, who has fought to overcome his party's stuffy image,
has picked up significant backing from some leftist leaders whose
priority is to defeat the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Two former top Cardenas advisors, Jorge Castaneda, a leading
writer, and Adolfo Aguilar Zinzer, an independent senator, are on
Fox's team. Porfirio Munoz Ledo, a PRD co-founder who broke from
the party for his own presidential bid, dropped out of the race
recently to support Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox held a meeting Monday with other leftists who chastised
Cardenas for refusing to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (PRI candidate) Francisco Labastida wins, it will be in
good part the fault of Cardenas, who, in spite of Vicente Fox's
repeated calls for unity, has acted with extreme stubbornness,''
said Indian community leader Julian Jimenez Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   For Cardenas, this will most likely be his last run at the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a dozen years he has been at the forefront of the
fight to make Mexico a more democratic, less economically polarized
nation. Although Mexico is the world's fifth-largest oil-producing
nation, half of its population lives in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas co-founded the PRD, which accuses the PRI of having
abandoned the ideals of the Mexican Revolution _ land and tools for
peasant farmers, free education at all levels and government
protection of national industries.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas' father, Lazaro, nationalized foreign-owned oil
industries in Mexico in the 1930s and distributed land, built dams
and other infrastructure to benefit the countryside. Lazaro named
his son after the last Aztec king.
</P>
<P>
   Fox last month called Cardenas ``jealous and ``a traitor to
democracy,'' as well as ``obsessed'' with becoming president, like
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas accused Fox of ``not having the pants,'' or courage, to
make such remarks to his face.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas was a member of the PRI, like his father, but he broke
with the party to run in 1988 as presidential candidate of a
leftist coalition. The election was widely viewed as stolen from
Cardenas by Carlos Salinas de Gortari _ burned ballots were found
and suspicious computer crashes occurred. After that, Cardenas
emerged as a tireless critic of PRI corruption and free-market
economic reforms led by President Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas lost a second run at the presidency in 1994, when
Mexicans were gripped by fear after a spate of political
assassinations, including PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo
Colosio.
</P>
<P>
   When the peso crashed in December 1994 and revelations of
corruption and mismanagement during the Salinas administration
began to come out, ision stations widely viewed as biased in favor
of the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had very high expectations, too, for what Cardenas
would be able to accomplish as mayor,'' said Mexican political
analyst Jose Antonio Crespo.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardenas can still draw crowds of adoring supporters. And
analysts believe he could still beat both Fox and Labastida in
Mexico City, home to more than 6 million voters and 10 percent of
the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since 1988, I've voted for Cardenas. He would be the only
real change in Mexico,'' said Norma Bonilla, 44, an administrative
worker at the Mexico City's Polytechnic Institute. ``The strength
of Cardenas is even if he doesn't win the presidency, the PRD will
continue to win in the Congress. The party will go on.''

&HT;     SMILES FOR DARIUS MILES AT NBA DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By GWEN KNAPP  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Five years after Kevin Garnett's giant leap for
teen-kind, another man-child heads for the promised land. The
critics have been muted, if not thoroughly silenced, because at 18,
Darius Miles looks like a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   No less an authority than Michael Jordan, Washington's general
manager in absentia, has said that Miles deserves to be the No. 1
pick in Wednesday's NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about Miles' entry into the league seems like a
feel-good story. He grew up in East St. Louis, Ill., one of
America's most blighted cities, and he should be a millionaire
before the year's out.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't have to worry that general managers will be shy about
drafting a high schooler. He can thank Kevin and Kobe for that.
They have vaulted into the elite of the NBA without benefit of
tutelage from the Kryzewski, Thompson &AMP; Tarkanian branch of the
basketball-industrial complex.
</P>
<P>
   What team wants to be known as the one that took Joe Smith first
in the '95 draft, when Garnett was available? What teams wants to
be known as the one that took Todd Fuller ahead of Kobe Bryant in
1996? What team, in other words, wants to be known as the Warriors?
</P>
<P>
   Well, perhaps that's too easy. Consider that other, saner
franchises, took Antoine Walker, Kerry Kittles and Samaki Walker
over Bryant. And that Philadelphia and Denver have to live down
choosing Jerry Stackhouse and Antonio McDyess over Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   Miles presents an even easier decision. Since so many collegians
have started bailing out as freshmen and sophomores, Miles isn't
competing for draft position with eminently safer picks. He is
competing against players almost as young as he is, or those who
were never sure things and, therefore, had to stay in school.
</P>
<P>
   So is it time to drop the fight against the kiddie pool turning
pro? Sure _ if you're talking about a sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   But for every pundit who mocks the choice of Joe Smith over
Garnett, there should be an advocate for another Smith kid, the one
who fell hard on the leap from high school to NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Smith's promised land turned out to be a mirage. Drafted at
the bottom of the first round last year, he ended up in a psych
ward, recovering from a suicide attempt, less than six months after
he was picked.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had been reared in group homes, and then he went to Dallas
to play for Don Nelson (no one has ever confused him with Father
Flanagan). When Smith couldn't make it there, the Mavericks pointed
him toward a European league for more seasoning. He rebelled. Then
he imploded.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's role in Smith's self-destruction is highly debatable.
Its need for a minor-league system, directly accountable to the big
clubs, is not.
</P>
<P>
   In baseball, the minors are the ``farm''; the majors are the
``parent club.'' Being sent to the triple-A affiliate does not feel
like excommunication. Stars go down to the minors when they get
hurt. Young stars-in-waiting go down on the farm, or start there,
without fear that the major-league club has given up on them.
</P>
<P>
   Not so in the NBA. A player ends up in the CBA one way and one
way only. He has to be cut.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the players who don't fall between the cracks, but
get caught in limbo? They're not Kobe or Kevin, but they're not
Leon Smith, either. They're Jermaine O'Neal, sitting on the bench,
waiting when they should be playing.
</P>
<P>
   With a minor league, they could put their games in order, play
40 minutes a night. Over the long term, who knows how much money
these kids might lose because their skills never matured?
</P>
<P>
   The NBA says it wants to fix this problem, because the league
will lose in the long term, too. It already has, in the quality of
play, and in the public-relations disaster that followed Leon
Smith's horrific crash.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, the plans for a minor league have yielded nothing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, hype surrounding Kobe and Kevin has reached dangerous
proportions. Nike ran ludicrous ads during the NBA playoffs, with a
whiney disc jockey asking why Garnett's choice had been so
vehemently criticized. Nobody rants about baseball, hockey and
tennis players skipping college, the DJ points out softly _ and
disingenuously.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball and hockey have the minors. Tennis is an individual
sport, without coaches to limit playing time, without lineups that
are dictated by front-office politics.
</P>
<P>
   But what can we expect from Nike? The same ad series showed a
bunch of women athletes _ ``our sisters,'' the DJ says _ and asked
why they weren't paid as much as men. Does Nike pay its female
endorsers as much as it pays men? Scott Reames, senior
public-relations manager, concedes: ``No, we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Nike just wanted to raise provocative questions, to make
people think. Problem is, with the Garnett ad, the company made
people think that the issue was ``To go to college or not to go.''
</P>
<P>
   The real question is more complicated. It's not about the Kevin
Garnetts. It's not about Darius Miles. It's about kids like Leon
Smith, about kids who don't have shoe deals, the ones on the fringe
of the pros. These youngsters _ heaven help them _ make less money
than some female stars. They have less clout. If there's a better
sign of their dire circumstances, I don't know what it is.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Warning against investigations conducted ``in
headlines,'' Attorney General Janet Reno refused Tuesday to say
whether she will appoint a special counsel to investigate Vice
President Al Gore's 1996 fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it proper for me to comment on pending
investigations and pending prosecutions,'' Reno told a Senate panel
looking into possible 1996 campaign fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Resisting calls by Republican senators for a special counsel in
Gore's case, Reno said that publicly discussing it could taint the
probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sound bites and quick conclusions are not conducive to
thorough analysis,'' she said. ``I think those matters should be
handled properly and professionally, not in headlines but in
courtrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., insisted that the evidence showed
that the vice president ``may have lied'' to federal prosecutors
and that the attorney general should turn the investigation over to
an outside counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Justice should not be investigating the vice
president,'' he said, adding that ``there is a conflict of
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, complained
that the Justice Department's probe of 1996 campaign finance
irregularities has taken too long and yielded too little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now find ourselves on the threshold of a new election with
many old questions still unanswered ... It is now time to make a
decision and be held accountable for it,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Specter, who has been holding hearings into campaign
finance abuses, announced that the head of the Justice Department's
campaign finance unit had recommended that Reno appoint a special
counsel to investigate Gore. According to Specter, Robert J. Conrad
Jr. told Reno that during an interview that he and two FBI agents
conducted two months ago with Gore, questions arose about the vice
president's truthfulness. Conrad reportedly said the questions came
when they asked Gore about a 1996 luncheon he attended at the Hsi
Lai Buddhist Temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Reno refused to comment on her discussions with Conrad about the
investigation, but she told the committee that she listens to a
``wide variety'' of advisers and that they often disagree with one
another and with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like `yes' people,'' she said. ``I also don't count up
the votes, with the majority winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., defended Reno, pointing out that
she has appointed seven independent counsels _ the most by any
attorney general _ to investigate members of the Clinton
administration, including the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inconceivable that Ms. Reno can be criticized on her
independence or her willingness to appoint independent counsels,''
he said. ``The facts simply aren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was previously questioned four times by campaign
finance investigators, was interrogated for four hours by Conrad
and two FBI agents on April 18. Gore has said that he was unaware
that the luncheon, attended by saffron-robed nuns and monks, was a
fund-raiser, although he has acknowledged that he knew it was
``finance-related.'' The event, which lacked the conventional
trappings of a fund-raiser such as expressions of thanks for
contributions, nonetheless raised $140,000 for the Democratic
National Committee. Much of the money was later returned when
questions arose about the donors. Longtime Gore fund-raiser Maria
Hsia was convicted this year of campaign finance violations, which
included disguising the true source of donations given by the
temple's nuns and monks. Last Friday, after Specter announced
Conrad's recommendation, Gore released a transcript of his
interview with the federal investigator and the FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   The transcript showed Gore heatedly denying under oath any
wrongdoing about his role at the Buddhist temple.

   ``I sure as hell don't recall having _ I sure as hell did not
have any conversations with anyone saying this is a fund-raising
event,'' Gore testified. ``As to whether or not I had any follow-up
conversations that said, were we able to set up this event or not,
I don't think I did. But I may have ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers have suggested that Conrad's recommendation was
leaked in an attempt to force Reno to name a special counsel during
the presidential campaign.

   On Tuesday, Specter bristled at that suggestion.

   ``I do not take lightly the comments of the vice president's
surrogates accusing me of working with the Bush campaign on this,''
he said. ``That is a matter I will take up personally with the vice
president to see if it was authorized.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has been strongly criticized by Republicans
for her past refusals to seek an independent investigation of the
Democrats' fund-raising. Justice officials insist that the
department's campaign finance unit, set up shortly after the 1996
presidential election, has ``vigorously'' pursued all leads and has
succeeded in winning 17 convictions. Conrad was appointed by Reno
six months ago to head the unit.

ACCOUNTING FIRMS TARGETING HIGH SCHOOLS TO SNARE RECRUITS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GREG WINTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When jobs are plentiful but applicants scarce, where do
accountants go to drum up enthusiasm for a profession whose very
name evokes images of number-crunching nerds with pen-holders in
their shirt pockets?
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, they now go to the one place where hostility to
all things uncool burns hottest: high school.
</P>
<P>
   Competing for the smallest pool of college graduates of
accounting programs in more than a decade, many of the nation's
largest accounting firms and associations have begun seeking talent
at secondary schools, the latest battlefield in an industrywide
recruitment war. With scholarships and internships in hand, they
are hoping to resuscitate a field that is rapidly losing devotees
to the wonders of technology and the glamor of being an
entrepreneur.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making big investments in the development of a high
school pipeline,'' said James Hayes, a partner at
PricewaterhouseCoopers who oversees recruitment efforts to about
3,000 schools a year. ``High school may almost be too late, and at
some point we have to start looking at middle schools.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say that the Big Five accounting firms _ Arthur
Andersen, Deloitte &AMP; Touche, Ernst &AMP; Young, KPMG and
PricewaterhouseCoopers _ have stopped their hiring efforts on
college campuses. In fact, driven by a boom in business, they are
crafting ever-wilder ways of grabbing college students' attention
and winning their loyalty. Ernst &AMP; Young now sends its interns to
Disney World, while Arthur Andersen sponsors a national tax
Olympics every year that awards the winning school $20,000 in
scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   But a 23 percent drop in enrollment in college accounting
programs since 1996 has prompted many in the industry to focus on
students before they are whisked away by other fields. The goal is
not to pluck recruits fresh from high school, but to plant the
corporate flag and push college-bound students into the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``One objective is to get them exposed to careers in
accounting,'' said Allen Boston, a recruiter with Ernst &AMP; Young,
which offers college scholarships to high school students in 15
states. ``The other is to get them to know Ernst &AMP; Young.''
</P>
<P>
   Leading the charge is the profession's primary association, the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, which will send
an accounting curriculum to about 10,000 high schools this fall.
</P>
<P>
   As much public relations as instruction, the institute's lessons
promote accounting across the disciplines, from physics to social
studies: history becomes a class on how sleuthing accountants
caught Al Capone; chemistry becomes a chance to set the price of an
electric car. Anything, in fact, to topple the stereotype of the
humorless drone in a back room.
</P>
<P>
   Some high school students are buying it. Lindsey Whitneck, who
graduated from Bristol Central High School in Connecticut in June,
said distaste for study had, at first, soured her on going to
college. But after taking classes with one of the accounting
curriculum's designers, she took an after-school bookkeeping job
last fall and has now enrolled in Central Connecticut State
University to major in accounting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like accounting saved me,'' Whitneck said, although she
added: ``Everyone in my family thinks it's only a bunch of numbers
on paper. They just don't understand.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, such converts remain rare, college professors say.
The profession holds a certain appeal in tough economic times: When
jobs are scarce, a certified public accountant is nearly assured
employment. In an economy that promises young people fun and riches
elsewhere, however, the profession must double its recruiting
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   College students ``don't want to dedicate themselves to the work
it takes to get a technical degree,'' said Sally Jones, an
accounting professor at the University of Virginia, where
accounting majors have dropped more than 50 percent since 1992,
despite rising applications to the business school. ``There's such
a demand for business students that they are going to work in
start-ups, finance, everything but accounting.''
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse, almost all states now require an extra
year of college courses before students can take exams to get a
license in accounting. The new rules, adopted at the accounting
institute's urging in the late 1980s, only recently went into
effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The timing was unfortunate,'' said Bea Sanders, the
institute's academic director. ``Ten years ago, no one imagined
that there would be a whole new economy drawing on the pool.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of first-time takers of CPA exams has fallen 13
percent since 1992, the institute said. And with fewer accountants
to choose from, many firms have taken to raiding one another for
talent, or simply buying smaller practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just nobody left to employ,'' said Kim Fantaci,
director of the National Association of Certified Public Accounting
Firms, an association of 47 small to mid-size practices.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the shortage has been a boon to salaries. In
an April survey of 70 academic disciplines at more than 120
schools, the National Association of Colleges and Employers
reported an 8.8 percent increase in starting pay _ now about
$37,000 _ for accounting graduates, second only to the gain for
information-systems majors.
</P>
<P>
   But accounting salaries still lag behind those in technology,
and accounting firms have proved reluctant to offer stock options,
the Holy Grail of many job seekers these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``People feel that they are covering their bets better by
getting a broader business degree,'' said Jane Rubin, an
accreditation specialist at the International Association for
Management Education.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin said she supports efforts to arouse teen-age curiosity,
though she thinks programs so far are insufficient. ``There's going
to have to be a much more comprehensive master P-R plan than even
what's been envisioned so far,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but the Big Five firms still stand to benefit from the
early exposure of their profession to young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually these kids are going to be adults with businesses
who are going to use their services,'' said Sanders, the accounting
institute's academic director.
</P>
<P>
   The accounting firms themselves seem to have no illusions about
their high-school expeditions. Easily distracted, convinced their
careers are eons away, teen-agers are moving targets, difficult to
track through college and beyond, they acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   But, they add, they have no choice but to take aim at them.
</P>
<P>
   ``As difficult as it is, given the number of high schools that
are out there, we need to do more,'' said William Nickey, New York
recruiting director for Deloitte &AMP; Touche. ``Even if the economy
slows down, we're always going to need more accountants than we're
currently producing.''

 &HT;    MEXICO'S CARDENAS: DEMOCRATIC HERO OR SPOILER?
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ To supporters he's the only true hero of Mexican
democracy and the impoverished.
</P>
<P>
   To others Cuauhtemoc Cardenas is in danger of going down in
history as a spoiler, the man who foiled a historic opportunity to
end 71 years of one-party rule in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   At 66, Cardenas is the spiritual leader of Mexico's left and the
son of one of this country's most beloved, nationalistic
presidents. In his third attempt at the presidency, polls are
showing that Cardenas is lagging in third place as Mexicans prepare
for the most competitive presidential election ever on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   With all campaigning to stop by law on Wednesday, Cardenas has
rejected 11th-hour appeals to withdraw and unite with a stronger
opposition candidate, conservative Vicente Fox Quesada. A
withdrawal by Cardenas _ analysts agree _ would greatly enhance
Fox's chances of toppling Mexico's Institutional Revolutionary
Party, the PRI, and forming what he promises would be a plural
``transitional'' government.
</P>
<P>
   In most opinion surveys of likely voters, Fox is in a virtual
tie with the PRI's candidate _ averaging out to around 40 percent
each _ while Cardenas ranges from 12-to-20 percent support. These
same polls also show that as much as 20 percent of the electorate
is undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understand, Cuauhtemoc: To unite forces is what's best for the
country and for your people. We would share the government and the
responsibility of a transition,'' Fox said in a speech Saturday
night before an estimated 200,000 supporters here.
</P>
<P>
   But at his own equally huge rally the next day, Cardenas
bitterly spurned Fox, who has alternately insulted Cardenas and
tried to woo him and his party, the Democratic Revolutionary Party,
or PRD.
</P>
<P>
   ``His mournful cries are those of one who knows he will lose,''
Cardenas, the former mayor of Mexico City, said, attacking Fox in
his speech with as much vigor as he attacked the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (Fox) really had, as he claims, 40, 46 or 48 percent of all
votes, would he be calling me,'' Cardenas asked. ``Would he be so
desperately begging for the votes of the PRD?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody here is looking for work from him,'' Cardenas
continued, prompting cries of support from those gathered in the
main square in Mexico City, where the PRD is strong. ``To think
that Fox would share power would be to believe in another one of
his lies.''
</P>
<P>
   The PRD and Fox's party, the pro-free-market National Action
Party, the PAN, tried unsuccessfully last year to form an alliance
to select one candidate. Despite their ideological differences, the
parties have backed mutual candidates for several governors' races.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Cardenas' position on Sunday was that the PAN and the PRD
are basically enemies: ``Our political proposals, our styles of
government and our way of life are diametrically opposed.''
</P>
<P>
   Although many Mexicans who voted for Cardenas in the past have
thrown their support to Fox, the crowd at Cardenas' rally relished
his words. For hard-core Cardenas supporters voting for the PRI and
the PAN are the same sin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to kick out Bismarck so I can put Hitler into
office,'' said Jorge Martinez, 53, a university professor who wore
a yellow PRD scarf on his head at Cardenas' rally.
</P>
<P>
   But Fox, who has fought to overcome his party's stuffy image,
has picked up significant backing from some leftist leaders whose
priority is to defeat the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   Two former top Cardenas advisors, Jorge Castaneda, a leading
writer, and Adolfo Aguilar Zinzer, an independent senator, are on
Fox's team. Porfirio Munoz Ledo, a PRD co-founder who broke from
the party for his own presidential bid, dropped out of the race
recently to support Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Fox held a meeting Monday with other leftists who chastised
Cardenas for refusing to step aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``If (PRI candidate) Francisco Labastida wins, it will be in
good part the fault of Cardenas, who, in spite of Vicente Fox's
repeated calls for unity, has acted with extreme stubbornness,''
said Indian community leader Julian Jimenez Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   For Cardenas, this will most likely be his last run at the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a dozen years he has been at the forefront of the
fight to make Mexico a more democratic, less economically polarized
nation. Although Mexico is the world's fifth-largest oil-producing
nation, half of its population lives in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas co-founded the PRD, which accuses the PRI of having
abandoned the ideals of the Mexican Revolution _ land and tools for
peasant farmers, free education at all levels and government
protection of national industries.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas' father, Lazaro, nationalized foreign-owned oil
industries in Mexico in the 1930s and distributed land, built dams
and other infrastructure to benefit the countryside. Lazaro named
his son after the last Aztec king.
</P>
<P>
   Fox last month called Cardenas ``jealous and ``a traitor to
democracy,'' as well as ``obsessed'' with becoming president, like
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas accused Fox of ``not having the pants,'' or courage, to
make such remarks to his face.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas was a member of the PRI, like his father, but he broke
with the party to run in 1988 as presidential candidate of a
leftist coalition. The election was widely viewed as stolen from
Cardenas by Carlos Salinas de Gortari _ burned ballots were found
and suspicious computer crashes occurred. After that, Cardenas
emerged as a tireless critic of PRI corruption and free-market
economic reforms led by President Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas lost a second run at the presidency in 1994, when
Mexicans were gripped by fear after a spate of political
assassinations, including PRI presidential candidate Luis Donaldo
Colosio.
</P>
<P>
   When the peso crashed in December 1994 and revelations of
corruption and mismanagement during the Salinas administration
began to come out, Cardenas emerged stronger again. He had warned
against selling state-owned industries, which Fox's PAN supported.
And he was vindicated after the reckless privatization of Mexico's
banks and highways ended up in disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardenas is really an extraordinary political figure. He stood
up like a mean old uncle and said of Salinas, 'This is not going to
come to a good end.' And later he got to say, 'I told you so,'''
said John Bailey, a Mexico expert at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas' party has also suffered repressive violence _ as many
as 600 killed, he says _ which gives him the moral high ground as
an opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 Cardenas won the first election ever held for mayor of
Mexico City. The PRD also captured a large number of seats in
Mexico's Congress. Cardenas was, many thought, well-positioned for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   He resigned last year to begin his campaign, but the charismatic
Fox, who had started to wage a modern, media-friendly campaign two
years earlier, was already eclipsing him.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Cardenas' supporters lament that his administration
didn't have better media skills while he was mayor. Cardenas often
didn't respond to questions from the press promptly and his
typically unsmiling visage didn't help compared to Fox's openness.
</P>
<P>
   He was also subjected as mayor to a barrage of attack news
coverage from television stations widely viewed as biased in favor
of the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   ``People had very high expectations, too, for what Cardenas
would be able to accomplish as mayor,'' said Mexican political
analyst Jose Antonio Crespo.
</P>
<P>
   But Cardenas can still draw crowds of adoring supporters. And
analysts believe he could still beat both Fox and Labastida in
Mexico City, home to more than 6 million voters and 10 percent of
the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since 1988, I've voted for Cardenas. He would be the only
real change in Mexico,'' said Norma Bonilla, 44, an administrative
worker at the Mexico City's Polytechnic Institute. ``The strength
of Cardenas is even if he doesn't win the presidency, the PRD will
continue to win in the Congress. The party will go on.''

   BUSH _ The end is finally in sight for the Bush fund-raising
effort that has shattered records by collecting more than $92
million. It will shut down in mid-July as the campaign shifts into
a federally funded operation after the GOP convention. But Bush
isn't done yet. A fund-raising letter in the mail this week seeks
to milk another $100 to $150 out of donors who have not hit the
$1,000 maximum. Bush says he needs it for TV ads. (Herman, Austin

   EDUCATORS-COMPUTING _ ATLANTA _ At the National Educational
Computing Conference in Atlanta this week, such heavyweights as
U.S. Education Secretary Richard Riley and Intel CEO Craig Barrett
have preached the value of technology in the classroom. At the
periphery, though, is a lone voice of caution: that of William
Rukeyser, head of an anti-technology group called Learning in the
Real World. He says that research hasn't proven that technology
improves learning, and he says it's too expensive for cash-strapped
schools. ``Everybody loves to play with new toys,'' he says. ``But
the fact is, when it comes to technology in schools, there is no
Santa Claus.'' His is not a popular view at the technology
conference this week. WITH PHOTO (Rukeyser). (Judd, Atlanta

   TEXAS-CHILDHEALTH _ The first time Carla Savannah applied for
Medicaid she was pregnant. She got a lecture, but no health
coverage. ``My son's now 1 and I'm still not covered,'' said
Savannah, 18, of Austin. ``I just have bills.'' Despite three or
four tries, Savannah has not successfully navigated the complex
Medicaid system, dominated by poor women and children entitled by
federal law to health care. Although Medicaid is intended as a
safety net for the state's most vulnerable residents, the poorest
children in Texas have the hardest time getting covered. Texas
maintains some of the nation's most stringent Medicaid rules. The
restrictions are in sharp contrast to Texas' new Children's Health
Insurance Program, which serves the working poor whose incomes
generally are higher than Medicaid families. Insurance Commissioner
Jose Montemayor plans Tuesday to present the results of a survey of
Texas health insurance carriers that offer coverage to children.

   PUBLIC-PRIVATE _First comes love. Then comes marriage. Then
comes a newborn shown off live on the World Wide Web before its
powdered bottom ever graces a baby carriage. That's the basic
premise behind a Baby Huey-ish new company that's already signed up
more than 75 hospitals nationwide and which could be coming to the
metro Atlanta area by the end of this summer. The company lets new
parents conduct live-action ``netcasts'' right from the hospital,
meaning relatives scattered around the country and co-workers stuck
back at the office don't have to miss witnessing Junior's first
gurgles and coos. And why would they want to, having perhaps
already spent months tracking the pregnancy via the parents-to-be's
personal web page _ and, even before that, keeping up with their
wedding plans on yet another web page. Remember when experts warned
us about the possible isolating effects of the Internet? (Vejnoska,

   MEXICO-CARDENAS _ MEXICO CITY _ To some he's the hero of
Mexico's impoverished and oppressed. To others he's in danger of
becoming the spoiler of an historic opportunity for democratic
change. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the spiritual leader of Mexico's left,
is running in third place as Mexicans prepare to elect a new
president on Sunday, according to most pre-election opinion
surveys. This is the third time Cardenas has tried to oust the PRI,
Mexico's ruling party. This time, however, Cardenas' underdog
campaign has been eclipsed by Vicente Fox, a conservative
opposition candidate whom polls show stands a credible chance of
defeating the PRI. Fox has altthe Supreme Court will reject the

University of Texas, Chris Mihm got an opportunity not afforded

with David Robinson. When they were done, by way of farewell, the
San Antonio Spurs' all-star

<P>
   center left Mihm with a few words that, three years later, are
prophetic. Maybe he was just being polite or maybe he meant it, but
Robinson told the young 7-footer that he some day expected to see
him in the NBA. ``I remember David telling me that Chris impressed
him on the court and off the court,'' said Jeff Austin, the
Washington, D.C.-based agent who represents both Mihm and Robinson.
``And that was three years ago.'' Robinson was right. Chris Mihm's
time has come. (Riggs, Austin American-Statesman). 28.

   BKN-DRAFT-TEXASPREPS _ AUSTIN _ Texas, long known for football,

 By JESSICA KERWIN  
 From W magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Claire Forlani isn't one to bottle up her emotions. One moment,
her raucous laugh is ricocheting off the walls in the quiet SoHo
Grand lobby, where the 28-year-old actress sits sipping tea; the
next, her big eyes are welling up with tears.
 &HT;    Only two days ago, Forlani was shooting a film in Vancouver.
Last night she hit a movie premiere and the alarm clock got her out
of bed half an hour ago, at noon.
 &HT;    ``It's been a very surreal few days for me,'' she says.
``Usually I have at least a week once I've finished a film to say
goodbye. I'm on an emotional roller coaster, and I just feel like I
could burst into tears at any moment.''
 &HT;    Fortunately all those feelings will be put to good use when the
next role comes along.
 &HT;    ``You relate to different things at different times in your
life,'' she says seriously, ``and you can give yourself to roles
purely because of what you need to experience or what you have
experienced.''
 &HT;    A second later, Forlani laughs out loud. ``I feel like I'm in a
therapy session,'' she says.
 &HT;    Not a moment too soon, either, to judge by the somber quality of
most of her major roles to date. She was Neal Cassidy's suicidal
girlfriend in ``The Last Time I Committed Suicide,'' the betrayed
girlfriend in ``Basquiat,'' and in ``Meet Joe Black,'' Forlani
hooked up with Death himself, in the form of Brad Pitt.
 &HT;    If those characters showed off her dark side, however, Forlani's
upcoming films will be a good deal sunnier. In ``Boys and Girls,''
she is a bouncy, wide-eyed college babe, and in ``Antitrust,''
slated for a fall release, she plays the techno-thriller's sole
Luddite.
 &HT;    ``My character's the one who puts a plant next to the computer
to absorb the negative energy,'' she explains.
 &HT;    Off-screen, Forlani's relationship with the press has also
seemed a bit gloomy, but she's given her attitude an overhaul as
well.
 &HT;    ``I was really bumming everybody out,'' she says of her
reluctance to publicize herself and her films. ``It was so deeply
depressing to me that I had to do those photo shoots, but you don't
want to not enjoy your day, and you don't want to destroy anyone
else's day. I'm finding ways to be less of a pain in the ass.''
 &HT;    As much as she may despise the pop of flashbulbs, Forlani loves
working her magic on the set.
 &HT;    ``I always ask for more takes,'' she says. ``I'm like a junkie.
Every director allocates me the amount I can have.''
 &HT;    Her addiction to acting began early, when, at age 11, Forlani
enrolled in the Arts Educational School in London. Later she moved
to San Francisco with her parents and then on to Los Angeles.
 &HT;    ``It's the same old story,'' Forlani insists. ``It was escapism.
My reality seemed gray, but the second I landed in L.A. _ it sounds
sick and twisted _ but when my feet hit the tarmac, I felt like I
went into Technicolor. My first years there were truly
intoxicating, even when nothing was happening and I was driving
around to pick up scripts in my shitty car. The air intoxicated me.
It's a bizarre feeling and an embarrassing one to admit to.''
 &HT;    It wasn't long before Forlani had bagged the coveted ``Meet Joe
Black'' role, opposite Pitt. Despite a decidedly negative critical
response to the otherworldly romance, Forlani was singled out for
praise.
 &HT;    Nevertheless, following that experience, she took a break from
movie making. ``I checked out,'' she says, looking into her tea.
``My mom was very sick, and I just went to be with her for a year.
No regrets.''
 &HT;    Forlani has been wary of the press since then, it's probably due
in part to a tabloid rumor that she and Pitt were involved in an
on-set romance. Was there anything to it?
 &HT;    ``I've answered the question so many times,'' she sighs,
exasperated. ``Is it still a question?''
 &HT;    With perfect timing, Forlani's 14-year-old goddaughter, Kyra,
who is visiting from England, appears beside her and takes a seat.
 &HT;    ``She's asking the Brad question,'' Forlani says.
 &HT;    ``The answer's no, isn't it?'' Kyra asks.
 &HT;    That's enough to get the actress laughing again. ``Thanks,
Kyra,'' she says. The two are looking forward to a day spent
wandering SoHo's boutiques.
 &HT;    ``Kyra's got the best taste of anyone I know,'' says Forlani,
who insists that she knows nothing about fashion. ``She loves to
shop, and I hate to shop, so Kyra dresses me.''
 &HT;    A few minutes later, the two bounce toward the door. Forlani
looks back over her shoulder.
 &HT;    ``I swear,'' she says, ``Kyra wasn't a ploy!''

 WILD CHILD  
 &HT;    When ``Beverly Hills 90210'' actress Jennie Garth told InStyle
magazine that her favorite fragrance is an obscure scent called
Child that she buys at Fred Segal Apothia in Los Angeles, readers

Robinson had to hire someone just to handle the inquiries.

worth of the obscure indie scent, which he has quietly carried for
the past decade.
 &HT;    Robinson doesn't think Garth's plug had much to do with the
frenzy. After all, celebrity endorsements are commonplace these
days. Rather, it was the fact that Garth said Child drives men
wild.
 &HT;    ``Everyone who calls asks if it really has that effect on men,''
he noted.

 BRITS TEE OFF ON CAMILLA'S COUTURE  
 &HT;    LONDON _ Poor Camilla. Her new look has bombed.
 &HT;    The British press has almost universally attacked the Versace
gown Parker Bowles wore to the gala dinner on June 20 to celebrate
the opening of the new headquarters of Prince Charles' The Prince's
Foundation.
 &HT;    The V-necked, pink gown with diamante swirls was a major fashion
statement by Parker Bowles, who previously has opted for low-key
dresses and suits by such designers as Valentino or Anthony Price.
Her new style included more blonde highlights in her hair and a
touch more makeup than usual.
 &HT;    But Camilla's makeover left fashion critics snarling.
 &HT;    ``So was this a dress too far?'' columnist Lesley Garner wrote
in The Daily Mail.
 &HT;    Garner contended Charles and his advisers were pushing Camilla
into the limelight too fast. Parker Bowles' choice of Versace was,
even unintentionally, identifying her with the late Diana, Princess
of Wales, who regularly wore dresses by the designer. Her dress was
also reminiscent of ones worn by the queen, Garner said, which
``might explain why Charles liked it.''
 &HT;    ``Can't they understand _ whoever they are _ that Camilla in her
normal black dress, or even her hunting jacket, had more integrity,
and thus earned much more sympathy, than this wholly manufactured
creature?''
 &HT;    The Times of London claimed Charles chose the bright-pink color
of the dress but not the design and either paid for the dress
himself or donated its value to one of Donatella Versace's favorite
charities. But whether Versace was the correct choice was clearly a
matter for debate even among Charles' advisers, the Times
indicated.
 &HT;    ``Camilla is never going to fit into the sort of slinky sheath
of the sort you would find on a Versace model,'' one royal source
said. ``She hasn't got a bad figure for a woman of that age. But I
suspect her outfits will hint at the curves instead of highlighting
them.''
 &HT;    The Evening Standard claimed Parker Bowles' choice was simply a
reflection of current society.
 &HT;    ``Donatella Versace dressing Camilla Parker Bowles _ in a frock
chosen by the Prince of Wales _ symbolizes the closing of a great
gulf, between city and county, aspirational chic and assured
frumpishness, youth (in spirit) and age,'' Melanie McDonagh wrote.
``It would be too much to call it a meeting of minds _ intellect
not being the distinguished feature of either set _ but it's
something like social and behavioral cross-dressing.''
 &HT;    But McDonagh went on to bewail the choice of Versace. Friends
and supporters of Parker Bowles have always claimed she's the type
of woman who would gladly leap off a horse and right into a
ballgown. Her appearance, though, left them wondering whether that
were still the case.
 &HT;    ``Camilla used to be the archetype of rural womanhood, if you
exclude the queen, and now the Prince of Wales has gone and spoiled
it,'' McDonagh wrote.

 NAOMI'S MODEL SCENT  
 &HT;    NEW YORK _ As a hairstylist, makeup artist, publicist and
photographer hovered expectantly in a 33rd floor suite at the Four
Seasons Hotel on June 14, it was clear that supermodel Naomi
Campbell was in the house.
 &HT;    But as Campbell herself sauntered into the elegantly appointed
sitting room in a girlish cream top and floral pleated skirt, it
definitely wasn't a leave-it-to-diva scene.
 &HT;    Instead, Campbell was upbeat, discussing her eponymous new
fragrance, which is making its American debut at Sephora. Sephora
will have a U.S. store exclusive on the fragrance until September,
and it will retain the Web exclusive indefinitely.
 &HT;    By year-end, the scent is expected to be in about 200 department
store doors, including Macy's and Dillard's.
 &HT;    Campbell signed an agreement with Cosmopolitan Cosmetics _ the
fragrance arm of the German beauty giant Wella _ to produce the
fragrance, which started rolling out last fall and is now available
in several global markets, including Germany, Japan, Australia and
the United Arab Emirates.
 &HT;    Campbell said that the decision to do a fragrance wasn't one she
took lightly.
 &HT;    ``I didn't want to just put my name on something, like I did
with the Fashion Cafe,'' said Campbell of the ill-fated New York
theme restaurant she was once a partner in. ``I wanted to be
involved with my fragrance every step of the way, and that meant
committing myself in every way _ to the promotion, to the
formulation of the scent, to everything.''
 &HT;    It's been a successful association thus far: ``The people at
Cosmopolitan are wonderful people to work with,'' Campbell said.
``They're experienced fragrance marketers, and since they also
market the Gucci and Anna Sui fragrances, I'm certainly in great
company.''
 &HT;    Naomi Campbell is slated to be the first in a series of Campbell
fragrances. Campbell, in fact, is ready to go with a second _
Naomagic _ which launches in Germany in September. It doesn't have
a firm U.S. release date yet.
 &HT;    Nor is Campbell limiting herself to fragrance. She plans a full
beauty range, including color cosmetics _ already in the planning
stages _ scented candles, incense and possibly skin care. Whether
they'll be produced by Cosmopolitan has yet to be determined,
although ``they've been so great, I can't imagine going
elsewhere,'' Campbell said.
 &HT;    When asked if she's an aspiring Estee Lauder, Campbell chooses
her words carefully.
 &HT;    ``I admire Estee Lauder a great deal and to reach that level of
success would be incredible. But I'm taking this all one day at a
time. I'm not doing this line because I am being forced to
financially _ instead, I'm doing it because it touches me. It makes
a statement about my sense of smell to the world.''
 &HT;    -----
 VOGUE AND VH1 REUNITE  
 &HT;    This year, suspense is promised. And it's bigger. The second
installment of the ``Vogue/VH1 Fashion Awards'' will take place
Friday, Oct. 20, and has moved from the 69th Regiment Armory to a
venue twice the size at The Theater at Madison Square Garden. It
will be shown live on VH1 and repeated again that night and several
times later in the month.
 &HT;    Richard Beckman, vice president and publisher of Vogue, and Jeff
Gaspin, executive vice president of programming at VH1, said
they're determined to work out the kinks and make the show livelier
than a year ago.
 &HT;    The biggest kink of all last December: Everyone knew the winners
in advance. Although the evening appeared to run smoothly and came
in under two hours, the suspense was missing, as December issues of
Vogue were mistakenly sent out to subscribers early and the winners
were widely reported the day before the event.
 &HT;    This year, three awards will be voted upon online by Vogue
readers and VH1 viewers: designer of the year, most stylish video
and breakthrough video. Seven other categories will be determined
by a style council, composed of designers, models, stylists and
journalists.
 &HT;    Last year, Vogue bought into VH1's annual fusion of rock and
fashion, and the two became 50-50 financial partners in the event.
VH1 will once again reap TV revenues, and Vogue will take the
magazine's revenues from ads surrounding the November awards issue,
which will profile the winners.

 LATIFAH CASTS HER VOTE  
 &HT;    Lane Bryant, whose past spokeswomen have included Camryn
Manheim, Anna Nicole Smith and Mia Tyler, is going the hip-hop
route.
 &HT;    The plus-size retailer, along with election.com, an online
election firm, is joining forces with Queen Latifah, recording
artist and TV host, in a national in-store campaign for fall to
encourage women to register to vote.
 &HT;    The campaign features Latifah in a fake mink vest and leather
jeans. She and Smith will also do the catwalk at the company's
Venezia Jeans fashion show on Sept. 6 in Manhattan.
 &HT;    ``Lane Bryant has some cool stuff, and it's affordable,''
Latifah said. ``I also like their positive outlook. I'm not ashamed
of who I am. And that's what they are all about.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Warning against investigations conducted ``in
headlines,'' Attorney General Janet Reno refused Tuesday to say
whether she will appoint a special counsel to investigate Vice
President Al Gore's 1996 fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think it proper for me to comment on pending
investigations and pending prosecutions,'' Reno told a Senate panel
looking into possible 1996 campaign fund-raising abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Resisting calls by Republican senators for a special counsel in
Gore's case, Reno said that publicly discussing it could taint the
probe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sound bites and quick conclusions are not conducive to
thorough analysis,'' she said. ``I think those matters should be
handled properly and professionally, not in headlines but in
courtrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., insisted that the evidence showed
that the vice president ``may have lied'' to federal prosecutors
and that the attorney general should turn the investigation over to
an outside counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department of Justice should not be investigating the vice
president,'' he said, adding that ``there is a conflict of
interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, complained
that the Justice Department's probe of 1996 campaign finance
irregularities has taken too long and yielded too little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now find ourselves on the threshold of a new election with
many old questions still unanswered ... It is now time to make a
decision and be held accountable for it,'' Hatch said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Specter, who has been holding hearings into campaign
finance abuses, announced that the head of the Justice Department's
campaign finance unit had recommended that Reno appoint a special
counsel to investigate Gore. According to Specter, Robert J. Conrad
Jr. told Reno that during an interview that he and two FBI agents
conducted two months ago with Gore, questions arose about the vice
president's truthfulness. Conrad reportedly said the questions came
when they asked Gore about a 1996 luncheon he attended at the Hsi
Lai Buddhist Temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Reno refused to comment on her discussions with Conrad about the
investigation, but she told the committee that she listens to a
``wide variety'' of advisers and that they often disagree with one
another and with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like `yes' people,'' she said. ``I also don't count up
the votes, with the majority winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., defended Reno, pointing out that
she has appointed seven independent counsels _ the most by any
attorney general _ to investigate members of the Clinton
administration, including the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is inconceivable that Ms. Reno can be criticized on her
independence or her willingness to appoint independent counsels,''
he said. ``The facts simply aren't there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who was previously questioned four times by campaign
finance investigators, was interrogated for four hours by Conrad
and two FBI agents on April 18. Gore has said that he was unaware
that the luncheon, attended by saffron-robed nuns and monks, was a
fund-raiser, although he has acknowledged that he knew it was
``finance-related.'' The event, which lacked the conventional
trappings of a fund-raiser such as expressions of thanks for
contributions, nonetheless raised $140,000 for the Democratic
National Committee. Much of the money was later returned when
questions arose about the donors. Longtime Gore fund-raiser Maria
Hsia was convicted this year of campaign finance violations, which
included disguising the true source of donations given by the
temple's nuns and monks. Last Friday, after Specter announced
Conrad's recommendation, Gore released a transcript of his
interview with the federal investigator and the FBI agents.
</P>
<P>
   The transcript showed Gore heatedly denying under oath any
wrongdoing about his role at the Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sure as hell don't recall having _ I sure as hell did not
have any conversations with anyone saying this is a fund-raising
event,'' Gore testified. ``As to whether or not I had any follow-up
conversations that said, were we able to set up this event or not,
I don't think I did. But I may have ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Gore advisers have suggested that Conrad's recommendation was
leaked in an attempt to force Reno to name a special counsel during
the presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Specter bristled at that suggestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not take lightly the comments of the vice president's
surrogates accusing me of working with the Bush campaign on this,''
he said. ``That is a matter I will take up personally with the vice
president to see if it was authorized.''
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general has been strongly criticized by Republicans
for her past refusals to seek an independent investigation of the
Democrats' fund-raising. Justice officials insist that the
department's campaign finance unit, set up shortly after the 1996
presidential election, has ``vigorously'' pursued all leads and has
succeeded in winning 17 convictions. Conrad was appointed by Reno
six months ago to head the unit.

&HT;     NEW GIANTS STADIUM TO HOST SHRINE GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A five-year agreement has been reached to bring
the East-West Shrine football game to Pacific Bell Park, beginning
Jan. 13, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   To accommodate the 76th annual event, the San Francisco Giants'
new baseball park will be converted into a gridiron for the first
time.
</P>
<P>
   The East-West Game has been played for the last 25 years at
Stanford Stadium, after an earlier history that included a 40-year
stop at Kezar Stadium, as well as much shorter stays at long-gone
Ewing Field (for its first year, in 1925), Candlestick Park and the
Oakland Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance for the college all-star game at Stanford Stadium,
which seats 80,000, had fallen off markedly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers hope to rekindle interest, in a facility that seats
about half as many spectators.
</P>
<P>
   There won't be much room to maneuver for players or fans in a
baseball-park-turned-football-stadium, but the setting should help
to improve the game's intimacy _ and perhaps boost its popularity.
</P>
<P>
   And the Giants, in signing a contract to bring in the historic
contest, will get a financial boost in paying off the costs of
building Pac Bell Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are extremely excited about returning the Shrine Game to
the city of its origin, San Francisco,'' said Jeffrey Foster, the
game's executive vice president. ``Given its intimate size and
convenient location, Pacific Bell Park is the perfect setting to
hold this type of event.
</P>
<P>
   ``By moving to Pacific Bell Park, we will create a more exciting
experience for our fans and athletes, and will further our goal of
providing national exposure for the Shriners Hospitals for
Children.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the game has raised more than $14 million for
the 22 Shriners hospitals located throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (Tickets to the 2001 game will be offered first to Giants
charter seat and season ticketholders, prior to going on sale to
the general public shortly after Labor Day. Those interested in
adding their name to a priority waiting list should contact
BASS/Tickets.com at 510-762-2277, or on line at www.tickets.com.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ It took 16 years for Torrie Bryant to realize she
was not alone. Born with a chromosomal abnormality that affected
her hearing and muscle tone, Bryant grew up without knowing there
were children with similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   Her doctors did not fully understand the disorder, and for years
they treated her symptoms without attributing them to the genetic
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant, now 20, said her life changed about four years ago
when she learned about the Chromosome 18 Registry and Research
Society, a one-of-a-kind organization that is based in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit group provides a support network for families with
children who have chromosome 18 abnormalities.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps fund research at the University of Texas Health
Science Center aimed at unlocking the genetic mysteries behind the
disorder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was really amazing finding out there were other people like
me out there,'' Bryant said. ``It made me feel not so alone.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Bryant joined about 35 children who have chromosome
18 abnormalities at the registry society's annual conference. The
seventh annual meeting, held at a resort near Boerne, Texas,
attracted families from as far as Scotland, Australia, Costa Rica,
Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, of Marion, Mass., has a syndrome known as 18q-, which
means she is missing a piece from the ``long arm'' of chromosome
18. When she was born, in addition to suffering from poor muscle
control and hearing difficulties, Bryant also had a clubfoot.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those difficulties since has been corrected, and Bryant,
now a college student, considers herself fortunate. Some children
with chromosome 18 abnormalities suffer more severely, with common
effects being stunted growth, developmental delays, congenital
defects and mental disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to 18q-, other syndromes of the disorder include
trisomy 18, where there are three copies of the chromosome rather
than the usual two; 18p-, where a piece is missing from the ``short
arm'' of the chromosome; Ring 18, in which one of the copies of the
chromosome forms a ring; and tetrasomy 18p, where an extra
chromosome is present.
</P>
<P>
   Trisomy 18 can be the most severe of the syndromes. The chances
of being born with the disorder are about 1 in 5,000, and about
half of the children survive to 6 months of age. Only 10 percent
might live through the first year.
</P>
<P>
   The overall outlook for children with chromosome 18 defects is
unknown, said Jannine Cody, a health science center geneticist who
is president of the registry and research society. Since the
disorder easily can be misdiagnosed or missed, it has been hard to
track the life spans of those afflicted, she said.
</P>
<P>
   There have been reports, however, of adults with chromosome 18
deletions living into their 30s and 40s, Cody said.
</P>
<P>
   Cody and Robin Leach, an associate professor of pediatrics, have
spearheaded the research effort at University of Texas Health
Science Center. They are involved in a project testing the effects
of human growth hormone on children with 18q-.
</P>
<P>
   The two also are searching for the specific genes that are
missing or altered in children with the disorder. To that end, they
have been intensely interested in the international effort to
sequence the entire human genome.
</P>
<P>
   Monique Mansoura, a policy analyst with the National Human
Genome Institute, spoke at the conference and noted the historic
achievement announced Monday by President Clinton and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair regarding the human genome.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders praised the international team of scientists
that completed a rough draft of the human blueprint after 10 years
of work.
</P>
<P>
   The project provides a map that researchers such as Cody and
Leach will use to try and unlock the mysteries of chromosome 18
defects.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a certain extent, we'll be able to treat some of the
symptoms of things like chromosome 18 just by understanding them,''
Mansoura said. ``The mapping effort gave us a parts list, and now
we need to go and say, `OK, how do we fix it?'''

   BUSH _ The end is finally in sight for the Bush fund-raising
effort that has shattered records by collecting more than $92
million. It will shut down in mid-July as the campaign shifts into
a federally funded operation after the GOP convention. But Bush
isn't done yet. A fund-raising letter in the mail this week seeks
to milk another $100 to $150 out of donors who have not hit the
$1,000 maximum. Bush says he needs it for TV ads. (Herman, Austin

   EDUCATORS-COMPUTING _ ATLANTA _ At the National Educational
Computing Conference in Atlanta this week, such heavyweights as
U.S. Education Secretary Richard Riley and Intel CEO Craig Barrett
have preached the value of technology in the classroom. At the
periphery, though, is a lone voice of caution: that of William
Rukeyser, head of an anti-technology group called Learning in the
Real World. He says that research hasn't proven that technology
improves learning, and he says it's too expensive for cash-strapped
schools. ``Everybody loves to play with new toys,'' he says. ``But
the fact is, when it comes to technology in schools, there is no
Santa Claus.'' His is not a popular view at the technology
conference this week. WITH PHOTO (Rukeyser). (Judd, Atlanta

   TEXAS-CHILDHEALTH _ The first time Carla Savannah applied for
Medicaid she was pregnant. She got a lecture, but no health
coverage. ``My son's now 1 and I'm still not covered,'' said
Savannah, 18, of Austin. ``I just have bills.'' Despite three or
four tries, Savannah has not successfully navigated the complex
Medicaid system, dominated by poor women and children entitled by
federal law to health care. Although Medicaid is intended as a
safety net for the state's most vulnerable residents, the poorest
children in Texas have the hardest time getting covered. Texas
maintains some of the nation's most stringent Medicaid rules. The
restrictions are in sharp contrast to Texas' new Children's Health
Insurance Program, which serves the working poor whose incomes
generally are higher than Medicaid families. Insurance Commissioner
Jose Montemayor plans Tuesday to present the results of a survey of
Texas health insurance carriers that offer coverage to children.

   PUBLIC-PRIVATE _First comes love. Then comes marriage. Then
comes a newborn shown off live on the World Wide Web before its
powdered bottom ever graces a baby carriage. That's the basic
premise behind a Baby Huey-ish new company that's already signed up
more than 75 hospitals nationwide and which could be coming to the
metro Atlanta area by the end of this summer. The company lets new
parents conduct live-action ``netcasts'' right from the hospital,
meaning relatives scattered around the country and co-workers stuck
back at the office don't have to miss witnessing Junior's first
gurgles and coos. And why would they want to, having perhaps
already spent months tracking the pregnancy via the parents-to-be's
personal web page _ and, even before that, keeping up with their
wedding plans on yet another web page. Remember when experts warned
us about the possible isolating effects of the Internet? (Vejnoska,

   MEXICO-CARDENAS _ MEXICO CITY _ To some he's the hero of
Mexico's impoverished and oppressed. To others he's in danger of
becoming the spoiler of an historic opportunity for democratic
change. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the spiritual leader of Mexico's left,
is running in third place as Mexicans prepare to elect a new
president on Sunday, according to most pre-election opinion
surveys. This is the third time Cardenas has tried to oust the PRI,
Mexico's ruling party. This time, however, Cardenas' underdog
campaign has been eclipsed by Vicente Fox, a conservative
opposition candidate whom polls show stands a credible chance of
defeating the PRI. Fox has alternately insulted and tried to woo
Cardenas to join his campaign. But at a huge rally here Sunday
Cardenas made it clear no 11th-hour deal will be cut. He bitterly
spurned Fox's latest public plea at his own rally the night before
to join him, and thus guarantee the PRI's defeat. (Ferris, Cox News

   center left Mihm with a few words that, three years later, are
prophetic. Maybe he was just being polite or maybe he meant it, but
Robinson told the young 7-footer that he some day expected to see
him in the NBA. ``I remember David telling me that Chris impressed
him on the court and off the court,'' said Jeff Austin, the
Washington, D.C.-based agent who represents both Mihm and Robinson.

 (SUBS to correct 12 rounds to 15 in 8th graf, bgng `I have

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hello again, everyone, this is Howard Cosell speaking of sports.
</P>
<P>
   Crude, vulgar, obnoxious, truculent, verbose, condescending, a
wiseacre.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that Dennis Miller is all of these things.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been written by print reporters, that seedy lot of
hangers-on, about Miller, in essence, replacing me on ABC's
``Monday Night Football.''
</P>
<P>
   What a tribute to my palpable impact and how right I was for my
times that I have been irreplaceable for 16 seasons. Would that
young Dennis handle my halftime highlights, a historic
demonstration of ad-libbing proficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Young Dennis is quite the mischievous monkey on his weekly HBO
program. I watched it Friday night and I have rarely in my
illustrious career, with my full knowledge of constitutional law,
listened to somebody in greater need of a First Amendment defense
lawyer. I don't blush easily, but young Dennis articulated
vulgarities 18 times in a mere 30 minutes. Young Dennis informed
viewers that ``golly'' will be his ``Monday Night'' code for a
famous epithet.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the Danderoo ever took such reckless verbal risks.
</P>
<P>
   I have not been so appalled _ so horrified, so assaulted _ since
Nov. 26, 1982 _ the Houston Astrodome _ when Larry Holmes
brutalized _ even destroyed _ a defenseless and desperately
untalented Randall ``Tex'' Cobb for 15 dehumanizing rounds.
</P>
<P>
   It is unsurprising to this reporter that Don Ohlmeyer, a man I
greatly respect, turned to young Dennis to save ``Monday Night
Football.'' But he doubtlessly got the idea from yours truly: In
1985, I wrote, with characteristic perspicacity, that the show
needed a star, like Bill Cosby.
</P>
<P>
   We're dealing with football, an entertainment, not the
canonization of a saint. I believe young Dennis and I share much,
yet not enough. To his detriment.
</P>
<P>
   We each suffer from bad hair. For no apparent reason, he calls
attention to his slovenly tresses by nervously running his hand
through them. I dared not touch what I had, lest it move into
unsuitable and unstylish hairlines.
</P>
<P>
   Young Dennis and I are alumni of ``Saturday Night Live.'' My
version, on ABC, started before NBC's, yet it lasted but 22 weeks.
You are indisputably aware of its auspicious start: the American
debut of the Bay City Rollers.
</P>
<P>
   When I appeared as a guest on the NBC show, I dressed up as a
relative of Ed Grimley, the transcendent nerd created by Martin
Short. Dennis Miller merely emceed ``Weekend Update'' on that
program, replacing, in essence, Chevy Chase.
</P>
<P>
   I, of course, never replaced anyone.
</P>
<P>
   I was, and continue to be, an original.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, this young scamp works assiduously at being
unlikable.
</P>
<P>
   I never toiled at it, such a skill coming naturally.
</P>
<P>
   He employs words like weaponry as I wielded words and thoughts
like the jabs Ali threw before the U.S. government stripped him of
his right to work.
</P>
<P>
   Young Dennis's intelligence is eclectic, even catholic, like
mine. I can envision him hosting a show like my ``Speaking of
Everything.'' His potty-mouthed show on Friday ranged from
commentary on Bill Gates and the execution of the convicted Texas
murderer Gary Graham to security leaks at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   I confess to a modicum of shame at laughing when he remarked,
``It's always nice to know the doomsday machine is hooked up to a
Clapper.''
</P>
<P>
   I also confess that this lad is quite the communicator. Like me,
he possesses a rapport with young people, the type of skill that
told me I was the right person to report to America that John
Lennon had been assassinated.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, as someone for whom ``Monday Night'' is a distant and bad
memory, I am concerned about whether young Dennis's penchant for
baroque similes will work for an audience weaned on pedestrian
analyses of X's and O's and an overdependence on scribbling with
the Telestrator.
</P>
<P>
   Can a tackle by the insouciant defensive end Bruce Smith, long
of the Buffalo Bills, now with the suddenly renascent Washington
Redskins, be rightly compared to a ``choice between walking and
hitching a ride with a bisexual trucker''? Will there be
credibility to young Dennis describing the muddied nose of an
offensive tackle as if it had ``inhaled Bob Marley feet first''?
</P>
<P>
   In the booth with Alfalfa Michaels, with whom I once called
``Monday Night Baseball,'' and Dan Fouts _ the newest recruit of
manifest ordinariness from the Jockocracy, a substratum of ex-jocks
and ex-coaches that does not respect the training required to be an
effective broadcaster _ Miller will divide viewers between those
who admire and those who abhor him.
</P>
<P>
   I have considerable expertise in this field, having once been
voted the most loved and hated sportscaster, simultaneously, in a
TV Guide poll.
</P>
<P>
   I made ``Monday Night.'' I was the one who gave it moment. Those
who succeeded me _ Joe Willie Namath, The Juice, Dan Dierdorf,
Boomer Esiason _ had their moments, too, but they occurred during
the time of William of Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Yet I harbor some hope for young Dennis. He has none of my
experience, yet if he can make viewers hate him, and organize
screen-bashing keg parties to protest his most grotesque
utterances, ratings will ascend accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Many years ago, Jim Brown described Howard Cosell as a warrior,
whose career could be measured by the caliber of his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Young Dennis has much to shoot for.
</P>
<P>
   This is Howard Cosell.

   The Al Gore campaign denounced new Republican hearings into 1996
Democratic fund-raising. Gore spokesman Chris Lehane charged Sen.
Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) of ``engaging in McCarthy-like tactics''and
said the Republican Party had turned Congress into a
``scandal-industrial complex''with George W. Bush as its ``CEO.''
The Bush camp, meanwhile, blamed Gore for high gasoline prices.
Said a Bush press release: ``Mr. Gore, who has been a part of the
anti-American-oil-production policies, wants voters to think
falsely of Governor Bush as a ``big oil'' man. What about Mr.
Gore's ``big oil'' interests?'' That last reference was to Gore
family stock holdings in Occidental Oil.
</P>
<P>
   COULD USE SOME TELEPROMPTER TECHNOLOGY, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Squinting into a punishing Philadelphia sun today with his back
to natural-gas pipelines and smokeless stacks of Trigen, a
cleaner-burning power plant, Al Gore delivered what his campaign
billed as a major address on energy policy: a call for $75 billion
in tax incentives for fuel-efficient technologies. His TelePrompTer
malfunctioned and was removed just before Gore took the stage to
the tune of Steve Winwood's ``Higher Love.'' Often criticized as a
halting speaker, Gore has recently begun to use the machine for
daily policy speeches in these weeks leading up to his crucial
address at the convention in mid-August.

   PERSONALITY OVER POLITICS, PART I
</P>
<P>
   Battling over personality rather than policies, GOP Rep. Merrill
Cook struggled to overcome allegations of erratic behavior and win
his party's nomination today for a third term in Utah. Cook is
considered to be one of the most vulnerable House members in the
country. Two years ago, Cook was briefly banned from state GOP
headquarters after a foul-mouthed tirade days before the November
election. Soon after winning his second term, he fired chief of
staff Janet Jenson, who accused him of delusional behavior. Cook's
primary opponent is millionaire computer company founder Derek
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONALITY OVER POLITICS, PART II
</P>
<P>
   Voters in South Carolina today were deciding between an
estranged husband and wife vying for a state legislative seat.
Domestic discord led to a bitter race between two-term Republican
state Rep. Shirley Hinson and her estranged husband, retired school
principal Jimmy Hinson. The election was steeped in the details of
their troubled marriage, including allegations of death threats and
infidelity. Mrs. Hinson said her husband was simply seeking
revenge; he said he could do a better job. The winner is assured of
the seat because there is no Democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   JUST PERSONAL _ NO POLITICS INVOLVED
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas of California wrote an open letter to
constituents denying any conflict of interest after the Bakersfield
Californian reported he had an ``intensely personal'' relationship
with a health care lobbyist, Deborah Steelman. The 11-term
Republican is head of the subcommittee governing health care
percent. It was 49-42 for Bush in the same poll late last month.
</P>
<P>
   CHECKS KEEP COMING IN
</P>
<P>
   Big money continues to roll into the Republican Party. New
Federal Election Commission reports show that in May the party and
its committees raised $12.2 million in soft money. That brought the
party's fund-raising total for the 2000 election to $106 million.
The Democratic soft-money totals have not yet arrived at the FEC,
but figures that include some of May's fund-raising has the
Democratic soft-money total at $86.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   SQUEEZING DOLLARS OUT OF WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are pursuing more than women's votes this year;
they're after their pocketbooks as well. From informal coffees to
major fund-raising dinners with President Clinton, the party is
targeting the nation's women who have been rising to more powerful
jobs but still give less than one-quarter of political donations.
``That's certainly a way to bring in new money.'' -to-be determined
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ALL DEPENDS ON THE AUDIENCE
</P>
<P>
   To help the Democrats pick up one of the six seats they need to
regain control of the House, Denver Mayor Wellington Webb sent out
a fund-raising letter on behalf of Colorado businessman Ken Toltz,
the Democrat challenging Republican Rep. Thomas Tancredo. But
Webb's letter, which characterized Tancredo as ``a right-wing
extremist'' and said ``this race could decide the majority in
Congress,'' has been turned against Toltz. Tancredo mailed the same
letter to Republican loyalists and raised $50,000 with it.

OFFICERS SENTENCED FOR ROLES IN LOUIMA ATTACK AND COVER-UP 
</HEADLINE>
   By JULIAN E. BARNES and ALAN FEUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal judge on Tuesday sentenced a former
Brooklyn police officer to 15 years and eight months in prison for
attacking Abner Louima and then trying to cover up the assault.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Eugene H. Nickerson of U.S. District Court also ordered
the defendant, Charles Schwarz, to pay $277,495 in restitution to
Louima. Schwarz had faced a maximum sentence of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Two other police officers, Thomas Bruder and Thomas Wiese, who
were convicted along with Schwarz in the cover-up scheme, were
sentenced Tuesday to five years in prison each.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz has steadfastly maintained his innocence through two
convictions. The first conviction came in June 1999 for holding
down Louima as he was sodomized by another officer, Justin A.
Volpe, and the second in March for concocting a story to minimize
his involvement.
</P>
<P>
   In a lengthy statement to the court before he was sentenced
Tuesday, Schwarz told Nickerson that he would not ask for leniency
because he is an innocent man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt in my mind that you will give me a harsh
sentence,'' Schwarz said. ``I refuse to demean myself and beg for
mercy for a crime I did not commit. I have already spent 384 days
in jail, isolated in a six-by-nine cell, 23 hours a day, and it's
384 days too many.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz, who has been held in jail without bail since his first
conviction, was taken from the courtroom Tuesday by federal
marshals after the verdict.
</P>
<P>
   The two other defendants received the maximum sentences they
faced for their role in covering up the attack. Bruder and Wiese
were found guilty of conspiracy to obstruct justice by making up a
story to cover up Schwarz's role in the attack. The officers were
acquitted in June 1999 of beating Louima while he was in a squad
car.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bruder and Wiese were allowed to remain free after the
verdict but must surrender to federal authorities within 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courtroom, Louima thanked the federal prosecutors
and the police officers who came forward to tell federal
investigators what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice is served,'' Louima said. ``I hope that this sentence
sends the message that no one is above the law.''
</P>
<P>
   During the first trial, prosecutors argued, and a jury agreed,
that Schwarz held down Louima while Volpe sodomized him. Volpe
confessed to the attack and was sentenced to 30 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Volpe has said that Schwarz was not involved, and instead said
the second officer in the bathroom was Wiese. Prosecutors have
contended that Volpe was not telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   At Schwarz's sentencing Tuesday, Nickerson said it was clear
that Volpe bore the greater culpability. The judge also cited
Schwarz's military service and the fact that he had cared for a
disabled brother in handing down a sentence far shorter than the
maximum.
</P>
<P>
   ``But for Volpe's extraordinary brutality, it is unlikely
Schwarz would now face a sentence for a sexual assault carried out
with such force,'' Nickerson said. ``Volpe and not Schwarz wielded
the stick.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Louima, an immigrant from Haiti, focused public
attention on police brutality. And the prosecution of Schwarz,
Wiese and Bruder was held up as an attempt to erode the code of
silence among the police, commonly referred to as the Blue Wall of
Silence.
</P>
<P>
   But to Schwarz, the case against him was an example of
overzealous prosecution. He attacked federal prosecutors for being
unwilling to admit they made a mistake, and revise their story in
light of Volpe's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz's lawyer, Ronald Fichetti, said he would continue to
appeal the conviction and seek to have Schwarz released.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the end of the Schwarz case; this is the
beginning,'' he said. ``This court house has a black stain on it.
</P>
<P>
   Schwarz's wife, Andra, called the sentencing Tuesday ``the worst
day of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But we will get over it,'' she said. ``We expect him to be
totally vindicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruder and Wiese also told the judge they were innocent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand before this court wrongfully accused, tried and
convicted,'' Wiese said. ``I never did anything wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Loretta E. Lynch, the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of
New York, said instead of helping Louima, they decided to protect
their fellow officers who committed the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``They chose instead self interest and to protect one of their
own,'' she told reporters after the sentencing. `When they did that
they turned their back on their oath and abdicated their
responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, the Rev. Al Sharpton, standing next to
Louima, also criticized the claims by the former officers. He said
although he wished Schwarz had been given a life sentence, the
conviction and sentences had helped to breach the New York Police
Department's so-called wall of silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``These policemen are the first policemen to be crushed on the
blue wall of silence in a federal court,'' Sharpton said. ``The
courts have reaffirmed his guilt. Mr. Schwarz is where he should be
today, in jail.''

MURAL NUDITY BRINGS OUTCRY FROM PROVINCE'S INDIAN LEADERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Does a woman's naked breast constitute a racial slur?
</P>
<P>
   Indian leaders in British Columbia say so, decrying a painting
depicting several topless native women at work as ``highly
offensive.'' They have launched an angry campaign to force the
government to remove the mural and other historic artwork from the
provincial legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The images are hateful, like putting a swastika on a public
building,'' said Edward John, grand chief of the British Columbia
First Nations Summit, which represents 140 tribal bands in Canada's
westernmost province.
</P>
<P>
   He said it is degrading to show Indian women with their breasts
bared since white women of the same era would not be portrayed
similarly unswathed, at least not on the walls of a provincial
capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paintings reflect racist attitudes,'' John said. ``We've
got to get rid of these relics of ugly history.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting, which has decorated the rotunda of the legislature
in Victoria for more than 60 years, is one of four adjacent murals
depicting colonial life in British Columbia. The artwork shows
several bare-breasted Indian women carrying baskets of fish to
white colonists during construction of a fortified trading post in
1843. Scantily clad native women also lug logs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It portrays aboriginal women as sluts,'' said Bill Wilson, a
British Columbia chief. ``Our women never exposed their breasts to
anyone other than to the man to whom they were married.''
</P>
<P>
   Historians are not sure Wilson is correct. But those reached
Tuesday were very sure they did not want to comment publicly on an
issue that has far more to do with raw racial politics than
historic verisimilitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ideas of modesty varied among tribes,'' said one academic
specialists on the Indians of the Pacific Northwest. ``Suffice it
to say that bare breasts were more of a European preoccupation than
something native people fretted on.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian activists have set a deadline of July 31 for the
government to get rid of two of the murals. If officials don't act,
the activists threatened to take matters into their own hands,
perhaps stealing or defacing the murals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are aboriginal people willing to remove the murals,''
Wilson said. ``These paintings have been highly offensive to us for
decades.''
</P>
<P>
   Indian activists also object to a scene in another mural that
shows a dejected Indian miscreant apppearing in court before a
stern magistrate. Each of the four paintings bears a title
reflecting virtues needed to build civilization: Labor, Courage,
Enterprise, and Justice.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioned by the province in 1932, the murals are the work of
English-born painter George Southwell, who died in 1961. The works
are viewed by thousands of visitors to the imposing legislative
structure every year.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians were quick to attack the sensibilities of the dead
white painter. But not so quick to promise that the murals will
come down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a distortion, a fanciful impression, based more on the
South Pacific than the west coast of British Columbia,'' Dale
Lovick, minister of aboriginal affairs, said of the artwork.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, argued Lovick, who is white, the paintings should
not be destroyed but instead preserved as testimony to the
insensitivity of those who are not Native Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are a total distortion of what First Nations were
about,'' said Lovick, using the term by which some Canadian
aboriginals prefer to be known. ``I don't defend them as art, I
don't defend them as history. But I defend them as part of our
culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ugly, unhappy part of our history,'' he said. ``So
you use it as an example of a world you want to do better than.''
</P>
<P>
   Responded Chief John: ``Bizarre.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, British Columbia Attorney General Andrew Potter
promised to launch an investigation into the Indian complaint.
``Depictions of a people and their cultural representation within a
government building are important,'' he said. ``If there are
concerns that the pictures are inaccurate or demeaning, I take
those concerns seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   But ridding the rotunda of the murals would be a major
undertaking. Artist Southwell, scorning canvas, painted his art
directly on to the wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will have to chisel them off because they are right on
the plaster,'' Marc-Andre Ouelette, director of legislature
protocol, told the Vancouver Sun. ``It's not like something is hung
there that you can just remove.''

CHINA CHIDES BRITAIN FOR VISIT BY FORMER PRESIDENT OF TAIWAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China condemned the British government Tuesday for
allowing Taiwan's former president, Lee Teng-hui, to visit Britain,
calling him a ``troublemaker'' who continues to work for Taiwan's
independence from the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Lee left Tuesday for his first trip abroad since he stepped down
in May after 12 years as president. His stated reason was to attend
the high school graduation of a granddaughter, though he is also
expected to be honored by an academic society in Manchester.
British diplomats said they had been assured that the trip was
private in nature.
</P>
<P>
   But a Chinese spokesman said that Lee ``goes to the United
Kingdom with clear political motives'' and that China is ``strongly
opposed'' to the trip. China has lodged formal objections in both
London and Beijing, said the spokesman, Zhu Bangzao, at a regularly
scheduled foreign ministry news conference Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its campaign to isolate Taiwan diplomatically and
force it to reunify with the mainland, China pressures other
countries not to give Taiwan diplomatic recognition or to allow
high-level official exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by the United States in 1995 to allow Lee to give a
speech at Cornell University, where he received a doctorate in
agricultural economics, caused severe tensions and may have
prompted China to test missiles near Taiwan in an attempt to
intimidate Taiwan's voters before a presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   China on Tuesday did not indicate any specific actions it would
take against Britain. But Zhu made clear that although Lee is now
formally a private citizen, heading a think tank in Taipei, China
did not consider him so and would continue trying to hem in the man
the Chinese leaders loathe as a wily advocate of Taiwan's separate
international identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee is by no means an ordinary person,'' Zhu said. ``Though he
has stepped down, he stubbornly sticks to the idea of Taiwanese
independence, continues his activity in splitting China and tries
every means to organize separatist activities in the international
community.''
</P>
<P>
   China officially is maintaining a wait and see policy toward
Lee's successor, Chen Shui-bian, who has called for dialogue with
China. Beijing is wary because Chen has a history of calling for
independence and now, though he says such a declaration is
unnecessary, he has refused to embrace Beijing's ``one China''
principle.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since Lee no longer holds office, his unofficial travels would
appear to be something of a sideshow, but China remains extremely
prickly on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement that in a way confirms China's fears, The Liberty
Times, a Taiwan newspaper with close ties to the former president,
said Tuesday morning that Lee's success in gaining entry to Britain
only one month after departing office ``of course goes beyond the
significance of a simple private trip.''

NEW REPORT DETAILS WORSENING AIDS EPIDEMIC IN AFRICA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAURIA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ UN AIDS experts issued a grim report on the
global epidemic Tuesday, saying that no one could predict when the
plague would be contained in Africa and that half of all 15 year
olds in South Africa and Zimbabwe would die from the disease.
</P>
<P>
   Issuing the first full UN report on the worldwide AIDS crisis in
two years, Peter Piot, head of the UN Joint Program on HIV/AIDS,
warned Tuesday that the human toll ``is only going to get worse
over the next years even if today, by some miracle, all HIV
transmission would stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts a few years ago to forecast when the AIDS crisis in
Africa would peak have failed miserably, Piot said, adding that no
one could predict when the plague would be contained.
</P>
<P>
   Its extent is staggering. Last year alone, 4 million sub-Saharan
Africans were infected. In 16 African countries, more than 10
percent of adults now have the virus and in seven southern Africa
nations one adult in five is living with AIDS, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a whole generation which is being taken out,'' Piot
said.
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, the virus has killed 19 million people and infected
34 million more, including 5.4 million last year alone. The
Caribbean, Eastern Europe, and Asia face catastrophe if effective
measures are not taken, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But for now Africa remains the center of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Botswana has been the hardest hit country in the world.
Thirty-five percent of all adults are infected and two-thirds of
all 15 year olds will die from the disease, the 135-page study
said.
</P>
<P>
   Young women are especially vulnerable in Africa, where their
infection rates are three times higher than in men, the study said.
</P>
<P>
   Over 13 million African children under the age of 15 have been
orphaned since the crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   ``The epidemic is undermining basic education in many parts of
African,'' Piot said. ``It's killing off teachers well before
retirement age and households are spending too much money on health
care and have less money for school fees.''
</P>
<P>
   In Zambia there are as many teachers dying from AIDS as are
being trained, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are only at the beginning of the impact on society of
AIDS,'' Piot said in a telephone news conference from Geneva.
``There are examples of the impact on agriculture, business, the
health sector, skilled labor and professionals who are dying.''
</P>
<P>
   The disease is bankrupting businesses throughout Africa, the
report says.
</P>
<P>
   The UN report has some good news. It shows that young people are
beginning to use preventative measures. There is evidence they are
delaying their first sexual encounters, are having fewer casual
partners and are using condoms more often. Infections of girls in
Zambia have dropped by half over the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   The news is better in other parts of the developing world, Piot
said. In Brazil, in particular, ``condom use for first sexual
intercourse is now becoming the norm, as it is here in Switzerland,
where it is used 50 to 70 percent of the time,'' Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   In Cambodia, the most infected nation in Asia, a program aimed
at achieving universal use of condoms is starting to take effect,
the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The improved treatment that has led to a dramatic decrease in
AIDS deaths in Western countries is starting to appear in parts of
Latin America, but not in Africa ``where even care for the simplest
infections does not exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also dealt with developed countries. The United
States remains the industrial country with the highest rate of
infection, with 1.7 percent of the population carrying the AIDS
virus. Spain has the most cases in Europe, and in Britain last
year, for the first time, heterosexual intercourse became the most
common way AIDS was transmitted.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Don't remain silent, praise high court
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a touch of drama seldom seen in the U.S. Supreme Court
chambers, Chief Justice William Rehnquist took center stage with an
aplomb for which he will long be remembered. He read aloud the
familiar Miranda warnings before declaring that they are indeed
constitutionally necessary:
</P>
<P>
   You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say may be
used against you in a court of law. You have a right to the
presence of an attorney. If you cannot afford an attorney, one will
be appointed for you.
</P>
<P>
   Those warnings, he stated boldly, guarantee that no individual
should ever be forced by the state to confess to something he
didn't do. Rehnquist's words were all the more dramatic because he
had questioned the Miranda decision several times earlier in his
career. Now, Rehnquist will be remembered for placing the
conservative stamp of approval on Miranda, a 34-year-old ruling
that conservatives have long labeled as a ``liberal'' decision of
the era of Chief Justice Earl Warren.
</P>
<P>
   After Miranda was handed down, a conservative Congress tried to
legislate an end run, passing a law defining exceptions when such
warnings aren't necessary. It was that long-dormant law, recently
upheld at the appellate level, that the high court rightfully
struck down. In so doing, the majority confirmed two other key
principles: the Supreme Court, not the Congress, interprets the
Constitution, and the court's prior interpretations will not be
easily disregarded.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, who dissented (along with Justice
Clarence Thomas) will also be remembered for his courtroom drama _
rolling his eyes while the chief justice spoke, as if to make light
of a constitutionally protected right against self incrimination.
But as Yale law professor Peter Brooks said, the decision wasn't
about a conservative or liberal court; it was about limiting state
power, a principle conservatives should rush to embrace.
</P>
<P>
   The warnings have become a cultural symbol at home and abroad
that in America, individuals have guaranteed rights and that they
will be informed of those rights before giving them up. Thanks to
the chief justice for saying so _ with a flourish.

SKAKEL HEARING A BIZARRE DISPLAY OF CHARACTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ The stakes are enormous, the subject is
murder, but the cast of characters in the drama unfolding at a
scruffy courtroom here seem better suited to the theater of the
bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   A troubled Kennedy castoff, a wise-cracking defense lawyer, a
prosecution witness who calls prison his home, and a Maine school
where students beat one another have all taken the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Now playing at Stamford Juvenile Court: The State of Connecticut
v. Michael Skakel.
</P>
<P>
   Preparations for the production, which resumes Wednesday, have
been nearly 25 years in the making, or ever since Greenwich
teenager Martha Moxley was discovered bludgeoned to death on her
leafy estate in the most-exclusive neighborhood in one of the
richest towns in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But until Skakel's indictment in January, the prospects for a
trial seemed improbable and a gruesome slaying seemed destined to
remain a frustrating, tantalizing mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the ``reasonable cause'' hearing to determine whether
Skakel will stand trial is seen as a fascinating prelude to an
irresistable examination of the confluence of money, power, sex,
and murder.
</P>
<P>
   Key witnesses in this hearing seem as damaged as the defendant,
and inflammatory figures such as Mark Fuhrman and the controversial
owner of a Maine school for troubled youths are hovering around the
periphery.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those cases where it will only get weirder and
weirder, and it's because of the characters involved,'' said
Timothy Dumas, a former Greenwich reporter whose book ``A Wealth of
Evil'' helped opened the literary floodgates on the Moxley case.
</P>
<P>
   Take Skakel as Exhibit A of the pastiche of players. At his
arraignment in March, the stocky 39-year-old nephew of Ethel
Kennedy had the chutzpah, or courage, to greet the mother of the
woman he is accused of killing with the words: ``I feel your
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Skakel would appear to be well-acquainted with pain. His mother
died of cancer when he was 13; his father generally left his
children unsupervised, a friend testified; and Michael Skakel
reportedly wrote in a book proposal that he became a ``full-blown''
alcoholic by his early teens.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a close friend of his cousin, Michael Kennedy, who
died in 1997 in a freak skiing accident in Colorado. However,
Skakel had seriously damaged relations with the Kennedys when he
answered questions from a Massachusetts district attorney about
allegations that Michael Kennedy had sexual relations with an
underage baby sitter.
</P>
<P>
   During this hearing, scheduled to resume Wednesday, Skakel has
been generally composed. But, as has been characteristic of his
severely troubled life, Skakel also has been stunningly
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he reportedly mouthed an obscenity at a former
classmate during his testimony that Skakel confessed to Moxley's
slaying. And when Skakel left the courtroom shortly afterward, his
chest heaved with effort as he broke down in tears.
</P>
<P>
   But, as he left the court at day's end, Skakel held his head
high, walked slowly, and calmly entered a waiting car as a horde of
jostling media strained to capture a hint of guilt or innocence in
his face.
</P>
<P>
   Such were the stage directions of the tanned Michael ``Mickey''
Sherman, a ferociously ambitious defense lawyer who brazenly cracks
jokes during cross-examination, counts singer Michael Bolton as his
best friend, and once walked into a hunting-violation case with
rubber duck feet protruding from his briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman, 53, told reporters that John Higgins, a key prosecution
witness, is a ``moron''; termed his testimony ``garbage''; and
tried to impugn his credibility by impersonating millionaire-maker
Regis Philbin with the sarcastic question: ``Is that your final
answer?''
</P>
<P>
   The case's reach extends far beyond Connecticut's Gold Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins and Gregory Coleman, two prosecution witnesses who
attended the Elan School with Skakel, have added disturbing context
to the harrowing efforts at ``rehabilitation'' that the trio
experienced as teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   The Elan School in Poland Spring, Maine, ``was a place to hide
your kids if they bothered you,'' Higgins testified. Beatings of
fellow students with paddles and open fists were sanctioned by
school staff and owner Joseph Ricci, Coleman testified.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci, himself, is a controversial bit player in Maine life who
has twice run for governor, publicly called Governor Angus King a
``pimp'' and ``prostitute,'' and been fined for using the
public-address system at Scarborough Downs, which he owns, to curse
out a state harness-racing official in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Even Ricci's attorney has had problems lately. The Maine lawyer
might face charges on allegations that he left his 4-month-old baby
unattended in a car for hours.
</P>
<P>
   Ricci, for his part, contends that Coleman and Higgins are lying
and interested in reward money and that he never heard Skakel
confess.
</P>
<P>
   The Skakel witnesses _ particularly Coleman, whose son's mother
died at the hand of a serial killer _ have pasts that separate them
from the general public.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman, who testified that Skakel boasted he would ``get away
with murder'' because ``I'm a Kennedy,'' is serving an eight-month
sentence in a New York state prison for criminal trespass against
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm an alcoholic and a drug addict. I've seen all sorts of
people,'' Coleman, 38, said from the witness stand. And, of all the
people Coleman has seen, Skakel apparently made an indelible
impression.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was one of the residents who had a problem with Michael
Skakel's attitude,'' Coleman said. ``Arrogant, cocky,
self-serving.''
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the school's ``goon'' or ``gorilla squad,''
Coleman said, his job was to keep escape-minded students like
Skakel in line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was involved in the rituals of the house,'' Coleman said,
which included attitude-adjustment unpleasantries known
euphemistically as ``haircuts'' and ``general meetings.'' These
measures were designed to break down fellow students through group
hostility _ both verbal and physical.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounding the case, as well, is the work of Fuhrman, the
bad-boy detective in the O. J. Simpson case whose book ``Murder in
Greenwich'' kept the public spotlight focused on Moxley's death.
Fuhrman fingered Michael Skakel as the likely killer, rather than
his brother Thomas, whom police had long considered the top
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Fuhrman was directed to the case by Dominick Dunne, the novelist
who was a fixture at the Simpson trial and whose fictional account
of the Moxley slaying, ``A Season in Purgatory,'' preceded
Fuhrman's true-crime analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Dunne has been an intent observer at the Skakel hearing,
watching the proceedings from an uncomfortable seat at the side of
the tiny courtroom, taking notes on dialogue and atmosphere with a
flowing hand as he gathers material for a Vanity Fair article.
</P>
<P>
   To Dunne, who lost a child to murder, Fuhrman ``found
redemption'' through his investigative work that led to Skakel. In
a story whose ending will not be known for months _ if ever _
stranger things are bound to happen.

 &HT;    Bush ends record-breaking fund raising
 &HT;    By Ken Herman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Bryant Conference Center at the University of Alabama,
with no fanfare to mark the moment, a key phase in the nation's
most successful presidential campaign fund-raising operation ended.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen months and more than $92 million into the effort,
probable GOP nominee George W. Bush attended his final ``Bush for
President Reception'' last Friday in Alabama, collecting more than
$400,000.
</P>
<P>
   From day one, the events always were called ``receptions,'' as
in Bush receiving money, lots of it.
</P>
<P>
   The receptions were part of a campaign that broke all records
for persuading people to give cash to a politician.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will be writing books about this a few years from
now,'' said Larry Makinson of the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonprofit watchdog group impressed and depressed by Bush's ability
to collect cash.
</P>
<P>
   The fund raising will continue for a few weeks through direct-
and e-mail. But in early August, after the Republican National
Convention, the Bush campaign becomes a federally-funded effort
that will get $67.6 million in government money.
</P>
<P>
   The Al Gore campaign will get the same amount after he is
formally nominated at the Democratic National Convention in
mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Money raised prior to the conventions cannot be spent during the
general election campaign. So far, Bush has collected more than $92
million, including $1.1 million in interest, and spent more than
$83 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's number dwarf those amassed by Gore. Unlike Bush, Gore _
who has raised $34 million and has $8.2 million on hand _ is
accepting federal matching money for the pre-convention campaign.
That should produce an additional $15 million for Gore to spend
before his party's convention.
</P>
<P>
   Though direct fund-raising for the presidential campaigns ends
with the national conventions, neither candidate will get out of
the fund-raising business. In fact, the game now becomes largely
unlimited as Bush and Gore can concentrate on raising ``soft
money'' _ unfettered by the $1,000 limit on individuals'
contributions to candidates _ that goes to the parties and goes a
long way toward helping the presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor is continuing to help build support for state
parties and the national party in order to help the entire
ticket,'' Bush spokesman Scott McClellan said of his boss' efforts
to raise money for non-campaign entities.
</P>
<P>
   At a closed-door event today in Cleveland, Bush will help raise
$1 million for the Republican National Committee and will speak at
an event that will collect $300,000 for the Ohio GOP. In recent
weeks, Bush has combined fund raising for himself and entities that
will help back his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In Alabama last Friday, Bush touted his Social Security
proposals at a morning event. That afternoon, he was at a reception
at Sen. Richard Shelby's home, where attendees paid $25,000 apiece
to mingle at an event that raised more than $1 million for the
Republican National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   That was followed by the University of Alabama campus event that
marked the end of Bush's appearances at campaign fund-raising
receptions. Throughout the campaign, as the dollars flowed in _ and
out _ Bush has worked hard to couch it in the positive, as in ``I
am honored and humbled by the broad-based support.''
</P>
<P>
   Makinson says it's not as wholesome as Bush spins it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't confuse a record-setting pile of $1,000 checks with a
popular uprising. It's not,'' Makinson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there is anything necessarily wrong with it,''
he said. ``Except for one thing. The one troubling aspect is that
Bush did not accept the spending limits and did not accept the
federal matching funds. I'm afraid he has opened a door that will
never close again for leading contenders for president.''
</P>
<P>
   By passing on the federal money for the primaries, Bush avoided
state-by-state spending limits that can hog-tie a candidate. Bush
now has spent more than twice as much as he could have if he had
accepted federal money for the primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway said Tuesday that Bush played by
the rules, but showed ``he is not at all serious about reform.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He flouted all the voluntary limits on the books,'' Hattaway
said. Money all along has been a trusted running mate for Bush. The
goal initially was to have enough cash _ and the freedom to spend
it _ to fend off GOP foe Steve Forbes, a self-funded billionaire
who also declined federal money.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the primary campaign, when Bush was going
head-to-head with Arizona Sen. John McCain, the money helped make
the difference. Bush says it allowed him to get his message out.
</P>
<P>
   Makinson says the money was the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that propelled George W. Bush to the top was the
absolutely extraordinary effort of raising money,'' he said. ``It
was a show of support by people who can afford to write $1,000
checks. We are talking about such a rarefied class of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign, however, noted that the average contribution
through May was $240. The average contribution to Gore has been
$120, a number his campaign says shows ``the broad support Gore has
received from individuals who give smaller donations.''
</P>
<P>
   And though the Bush for President fund-raising is ending, it is
not over. Bush says he needs more, soon, for pre-convention TV ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your gift of $100 or $150 will give my campaign the boost it
needs,'' Bush said in an e-mail message now modeming around the
country. ``Please be as generous as you can.''You may contact Ken

CHIRAC URGES FASTER INTEGRATION FOR SOME EUROPEAN UNION COUNTRIES 
</HEADLINE>
   By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ President Jacques Chirac of France urged Germany
Tuesday to join France in spearheading a core group of European
Union countries that would move faster than others toward political
and economic union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those countries that want to proceed further with integration,
on a voluntary basis and in specific areas, must be allowed to do
so without being held back by those who, with every right, do not
want to proceed as quickly,'' Chirac said in a speech to the German
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac cited the new European currency, the euro, as an example
of a success achieved with only 11 of the 15 European Union members
taking part.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac's speech was intended to be the high point of a two-day
visit here proving that the French-German ``motor'' was still
vigorous despite what has seemed like a cooling of the relationship
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   But his speech was seen here as the beginning of what is likely
to be a long and heated debate about the future of the European
Union. Last month, Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer,
suggested that a European federation with a directly elected
president and a parliament sharing real executive and legislative
powers was needed for the union to function effectively.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer's plan, put forward as his personal opinion, brought a
harsh reaction from the French interior minister, Jean-Pierre
Chevenement. At first, Chevenement said the proposal showed that
Germany had not yet recovered from the ``derailment'' of Nazism and
still wanted to restore a sort of Germanic Holy Roman Empire. He
later apologized for some of his remarks.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Fischer spoke out at all was widely applauded
in some quarters. As the European Union is poised to take in a
dozen new members in the next few years, there is a wide consensus
that its institutions must be overhauled or face paralysis. But
there has been little public discussion.
</P>
<P>
   Even at the most recent summit meeting of European leaders, last
weekend, the subject apparently was not discussed, and the minutiae
of certain tax policies and other smaller issues seemed to grab all
the attention. Chirac's speech was therefore eagerly awaited.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Chirac hinted at his position when he told reporters
that he hoped for a ``united Europe of states rather than a United
States of Europe.'' In his speech at the Reichstag Tuesday, the
first by a foreign head of state since its renovation, Chirac
maintained that theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nations are the source of our identities and of our roots,
'' he said, ``the diversity of our political traditions, cultures
and languages is one of the strengths of the union. In the future,
our nations will stay the first reference point for our people.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Chirac conceded that much work needed to be done to
ensure that the union continued to function and grow. He called for
lines of authority to be clarified, for allowing majority voting
instead of unanimity on most issues, and he endorsed the weighting
of member states' votes.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac also endorsed the drafting of a European constitution.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized, however, that he did not believe that there was
any need for a new treaty. And he said that nation states had to
remain the core of the union; envisaging their abolition was
``absurd,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither you nor we envisage the creation of a European
superstate that would take the place of our nation states and end
their role as actors on the international stage,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chirac's idea of letting some union countries go ahead with
reforms that others are not inclined to or ready for is a
controversial one. Some countries fear that a two-tier system could
result, with some nations' having second-class status.
</P>
<P>
   France is to take over the rotating presidency of the European
Union this weekend, and has set an ambitious agenda, including
agreement on many of these reforms by December. Germany has
expressed support for this aim. But Germany wants a second
intergovernmental conference before 2004 over the power-sharing
issue, a move that some experts believe could lead to foot-dragging
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac was warmly applauded at the Reichstag, particularly when
he evoked the five decades of friendship between France and Germany
since the end of World War II. Several members of parliament said
they welcomed his ideas because now the debate will really begin.

THE LAST DAYS AND SONGS OF BING CROSBY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGERS CADENHEAD 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I understand that shortly before his death, Bing Crosby
recorded a song. What was it?
</P>
<P>
   _ A.R.P., Auburn, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A: In the weeks before he died of a heart attack on Oct. 14,
1977, Crosby recorded two projects that were released as albums.
</P>
<P>
   From Sept. 12 to 14, Crosby recorded the album ``Seasons'' with
the Pete Moore Orchestra. The 12 songs all have seasonal themes,
including ``Sleigh Ride'' and a reprisal of his 1934 No. 1 hit,
``June in January.''
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 11, Crosby was a guest on a BBC Radio program where he
sang eight songs with the Gordon Rose Orchesta, ending with the
song ``Once in a While.'' This was released as an album, ``Bing:
The Final Chapter.''
</P>
<P>
   After the 1977 deaths of Crosby and Elvis Presley, the record
industry delayed 500 albums and manufactured 4 million records a
day to keep up with the demand for their music, The New York Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I write to Detroit Tiger Juan Gonzalez?
</P>
<P>
   _ M.F., Euless, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: Write to Gonzalez or any other player for the team in care of
the Detroit Tigers, 2100 Woodward Ave., Detroit, MI 48201.
</P>
<P>
   You might want to hurry with your letter. The Tigers are
reportedly talking with the New York Yankees about trading
Gonzalez, who becomes a free agent after this season.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, 30, is a two-time American League most valuable
player. He was traded to Detroit by the Texas Rangers in the
off-season in a nine-player deal.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How would I go about getting a videotape from the History
Channel?
</P>
<P>
   _ B.J.W., Arlington, Texas
</P>
<P>
   A: A&AMP;E Television sends out a World of A&AMP;E Catalog that includes
videotapes from the History Channel, A&AMP;E and the new Biography
Channel.
</P>
<P>
   To request a catalog, call (888) 423-1212 or visit the Web site
store.aetv.com.
</P>
<P>
   Among the History Channel shows offered on video are ``History
Undercover,'' ``America at War,'' ``Sea Tales'' and ``20th Century
with Mike Wallace.''

 &HT;    Rrefreshing drink tastefully breaks all the rules
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A few years back, Napa Valley winemaker R. Michael Mondavi was
searching for a dramatic way to make his point that the wine
industry needs to remove the mystery and inject some fun into its
products. In front of a symposium audience of wine trade veterans,
he uncorked a bottle of his sophisticated, pricey cabernet
sauvignon and held it alongside a large tumbler filled with ice,
then poured the regal red into the glass.
</P>
<P>
   Audience members gasped in dismay.
</P>
<P>
   What they should've done instead was run to the kitchen and cut
up some citrus fruits, and perhaps look for some club soda and
brandy, and maybe a pinch of sugar. Sangria! Let the party begin!
Hey, Mike _ dude _ how many more bottles of that cabernet did you
bring?
</P>
<P>
   Sangria is not merely a quintessential summer refresher. It also
mocks snobbish wine rules that try to tell us we should not drink
cheap wine, we shouldn't mix wine with other stuff and shouldn't
ever pour it over ice. Sangria does all of those things proudly,
unabashedly and exuberantly. It's perfect for a long holiday
weekend of potlucks, picnics and cookouts.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Castro knows a thing or two about sangria. The image of his
restaurant, El Meson in West Carrollton, is inextricably linked to
the large, frosty pitchers of red and white sangria that pour out
of his kitchens to complement the Central American, South American
and other specialties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really seems to give a signature stamp to our restaurant,''
Castro said. ``When people come in, they order a pitcher of sangria
before they even look at a menu.''
</P>
<P>
   Making sangria is simple, and that's a good thing because Castro
and other sangria aficionados strongly recommend that sangria is at
its best made fresh, not days in advance or out of a bottle
(remember Y'ago? Shudder...). But finding much consistency among
sangria recipes is anything but simple. All call for wine and
citrus fruits, and most include some sort of brandy, but beyond
that, no two recipes are alike. Other ingredients might include
cinnamon sticks, fresh mint, plums, nectarines or starfruit.
</P>
<P>
   Castro is happy to discuss the ingredients in El Meson's
sangrias, but he won't reveal the exact proportions. It's a family
recipe, handed down from generation to generation, he says.
</P>
<P>
   He uses wine, cut-up fruit (``cut an orange in half, and squeeze
half of it into the pitcher...''), brandy (not flavored, just
regular), sugar and club soda or sparkling water. The brandy
``gives it a little kick,'' while the club soda adds some body and
effervescence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using a dry wine is the key,'' Castro said. ``Where people
fail in making sangria is they'll start with a sweet wine, then add
all these things to it and wonder why it doesn't taste right. ...
Some people will use Lambrusco and come back and say, `It was
horrible.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to start off with a good wine,'' perhaps a Spanish
wine from Rioja or the Penedes region (Torres is a widely available
Penedes winemaker) in the $6-10 range, Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   A Dayton Daily News tasting panel didn't fully agree with the El
Meson proprietor, enthusiastically endorsing a white sangria made
from a semi-sweet Gewurtztraminer and taking a shine to a red
sangria that called for inexpensive California ``Hearty
Burgundy''-style wine that costs about half of what a Spanish wine
from Penedes typically costs.
</P>
<P>
   We sampled four recipes, two white and two red, on a Sunday
afternoon. For snacking purposes, we nibbled on cheese, pate and
crackers, chips and guacamole. The research was grueling. (The
recipes are included on page 4C). Here were some of the comments:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sparkling Fruit Wine: The consensus favorite. Zippy, zingy,
very refreshing, not too sweet. The blackberries are a surprising
and welcome addition. This is sangria for a party.
</P>
<P>
   _ White Sangria: Sweet, light and fruity, with a delayed kick.
Some tasters wanted a bit more flavor and a bit more oomph. The
fruit was great to nibble on, though.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ruby Red Sangria: Intense red-wine flavor; robust if a bit
simple. Not a sangria to guzzle. Those who already like red wine
will find it delicious; those who don't like red wine may not be as
enthusiastic. The consensus favorite among the two red sangrias.
</P>
<P>
   _ Red Sangria: The cherry brandy made this one taste a bit like
Kool-Aid to some tasters. More suitable for those who are not big
fans of red wine.

 &HT;    Eds. RUNS WITH SANGRIA
 &HT;    Chill out with these sangria offerings
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher
 &HT;    and Pat Thomas
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The surprise hit of our informal sangria tasting was this
sparkly, fruit-filled concoction featuring Gewurztraminer wine and
champagne or sparkling wine. Look for the driest sparkling wine you
can find, but remember, it's sangria _ don't spend more than $6 or
$7 on it.
</P>
<P>
   SPARKLING FRUIT WINE
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 bottle (3 cups) Gewurztraminer, chilled
</P>
<P>
   2 cups peach nectar, chilled
</P>
<P>
   2 limes cut into thin slices
</P>
<P>
   2 peaches or nectarines, halved, pitted and cut into small
wedges
</P>
<P>
   2 plums, halved, pitted and cut into small wedges
</P>
<P>
   1 cup blackberries
</P>
<P>
   1 bottle (3 cups) chilled champagne or sparkling wine
</P>
<P>
   Ice cubes (optional)
</P>
<P>
   In a large pitcher, stir together the Gewurztraminer and peach
juice. Reserve some lime slices for garnish and add the remaining
lime slices, peach or nectarine wedges, plum wedges and
blackberries to the pitcher. Chill for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, stir in the champagne or sparkling wine.
Add ice cubes, if desired. Pour into glasses, distributing some
fruit into each glass. Garnish with a slice of lime on the rim of
each glass and serve well-chilled.
</P>
<P>
   In three trips to area stores, we could not find anything
labeled ``peach nectar.'' We substituted natural peach juice
drained from a large can of peaches (do not use the kind packed in
heavy syrup), and it tasted just fine. Cut back on the peach juice
for a less-sweet version.
</P>
<P>
   _ Adapted from Summer: Recipes Inspired by Nature's Bounty by
Joanne Weir (Time-Life Books, $24.95).
</P>
<P>
   This is a classic white sangria, cool and pretty. We've been
making it for 20 years, since the recipe appeared in Dayton Daily
News food editor Ann Heller's book It's Simple!, published in 1980
by The Journal Herald. Here it is, word for word, and as Heller
originally wrote, ``Just be sure to have ingredients on hand for
seconds, because it goes down easy.''
</P>
<P>
   WHITE SANGRIA
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 to 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 fifth dry white wine, chilled
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Cointreau
</P>
<P>
   1 10-ounce bottle club soda, chilled
</P>
<P>
   1 unpeeled orange, sliced
</P>
<P>
   1 unpeeled lemon, sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 limes, cut in wedges
</P>
<P>
   1 unpeeled green apple, cut in wedges
</P>
<P>
   Green grapes
</P>
<P>
   Just before serving, combine the wine and Cointreau in a large
glass pitcher. Stir in ice cubes, soda and fruit and pour.
</P>
<P>
   Use an inexpensive California jug wine. To keep the cost down,
substitute the cheaper Triple Sec for Cointreau. And feel free to
use any other fruit you think looks pretty at the market.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe, courtesy of the San Francisco Chronicle, is elegant
and simple _ no brandy, no soda, just red wine, a bit of sugar and
lots of fruit. You can substitute inexpensive Spanish or Chilean
wine (the Spanish Tinto Zamora, at $6-$7 for a one-liter bottle, is
a good bet) for the California Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   RUBY RED SANGRIA
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 to 8 servings
</P>
<P>
   1 Valencia orange, unpeeled, cut into 1/2-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1 Granny Smith apple, cored and cut into 1/2-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, unpeeled, cut into 1/2-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 bottles (750 ml each) California Burgundy wine, preferably
Taylor Hearty Burgundy
</P>
<P>
   Divide the fruit and sugar between 2 pitchers. Add the wine and
stir until the sugar dissolves. Chill well before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sturdy, reliable red-wine sangria that uses the classic
ingredients of jug wine and club soda, but adds a kick with
brandy-marinated fruit. If you make a vat of this to tote to the
next potluck barbecue, you will be assured of a return invitation.
Warning: The brandy infused fruit packs a punch.
</P>
<P>
   RED SANGRIA
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 servings
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup cherry brandy
</P>
<P>
   2 unpeeled oranges, sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 cups of any single or combination of pitted cherries, red or
green grapes or apple slices
</P>
<P>
   1 jug of inexpensive red wine (a ``mountain burgundy'' works
well)
</P>
<P>
   110-ounce bottle of club soda, chilled
</P>
<P>
   Mix brandy and fruit in medium bowl and refrigerate for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Combine red wine and club soda, add fruit and brandy. Stir well
and serve chilled.

with whatever impulse floats their boat. But now there's a book
that seeks to bridge both worlds by promising to teach you how to
cook without an instruction manual. The title, ``How to Cook
Without a Book,'' seems to be either a contradiction in terms or a
Zen koan. It is neither.

 Glorious Fruit: Veteran pastry chef whips up a parade of
desserts  for the holiday weekend  By Janet Fletcher 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; For almost 20 years, making irresistible desserts
has been pastry chef Mary Jo Thoresen's daily challenge.
Fortunately, summer comes every year, bearing peaches, nectarines,
plums, apricots, cherries, melons and berries in fragrant
profusion.
<P>
   ``It really does make (my job) easy,'' says Thoresen, co-owner
of the 6-month-old Jojo in Oakland and a former pastry chef at Chez
Panisse. Armed with the impeccable summer fruit that she shops for
daily, Thoresen can make the sorbets, fruit tarts, fruit jellies
and compotes that she enjoys eating at the end of a meal. They're
also great finales for Fourth of July barbecues _ the seasonality
and colors are perfect _ as well as for other celebratory summer
meals.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, with fruit desserts, the least amount of fussing
the better,'' Thoresen says. Some of her favorite summer desserts
call for cooking the fruit just barely, or not at all, to preserve
the fruit's flavor. Starting with juicy, aromatic, intensely
flavored fruit is a must for these recipes where it has nothing to
hide behind.
</P>
<P>
   Like several chefs, Thoresen can go behind the scenes at
Berkeley's Monterey Market, where she often shops, and taste the
fruit she is considering buying. But she uses her eyes and nose as
much as her palate to determine quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I smell everything,'' she says. ``If it doesn't smell like a
peach, it's not going to taste like one.''
</P>
<P>
   Thoresen upends berry baskets to inspect for crushed or moldy
berries, and sniffs melons to find the ripest. She suggests asking
for help if you're unsure and can't sample; most produce managers
can point you to the most flavorful fruit. But, resist the impulse
to squeeze the peaches or snitch berries, she cautions; it isn't
fair to the store or other shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   At home or back in her restaurant, Thoresen arranges the fruit
on parchment-lined baking sheets, making sure that there's space
between each fruit. Berries are refrigerated uncovered. Stone
fruits are left at room temperature, stem-side down, until they
give to gentle pressure on the shoulders, then refrigerated. At
Chez Panisse, one of Thoresen's jobs was to check the fruit once a
day _ twice a day in hot weather _ so it would be used at its peak.
</P>
<P>
   When Thoresen finds exceptional fruit, she buys it in quantity.
She freezes extra berries on parchment-lined baking sheets, then
transfers them to freezer bags for later use in tarts, pies or
other cooked desserts. Even Chez Panisse freezes berries, she says,
when the pastry department gets more great fruit than it can use.
</P>
<P>
   Thoresen also frequently preserves a particularly delicious
batch of fruit by converting it into a sorbet base _ basically,
sweetened fruit puree. She freezes the base and thaws it as needed;
an ice-cream machine transforms the thawed puree into a creamy
sorbet. Home cooks can freeze peach, nectarine or strawberry puree
in batches just large enough for a dinner party, then thaw and
transfer the puree to an ice-cream machine on the afternoon of the
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Thoresen keeps sugar to a minimum in fruit desserts unless the
fruit is less than perfect. A little extra sugar can ``help push
the flavor forward'' in slightly underripe fruit, she says. Vanilla
extract also heightens flavor. The peaches for her peach galette
always get a few drops.
</P>
<P>
   Thoresen washes strawberries in a strainer just before using,
laying them out on towels to dry. She advises against washing
fragile bush berries such as raspberries, blackberries and
olallieberries. ``Once you get bush berries wet, they really start
to decline,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, the fruit near the end of its season is
sweeter and tastes better than the early harvest. It's often less
expensive, too. That's why Thoresen advises against rushing to buy
the season's first peaches or plums. Wait for warm weather to
develop the flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Thoresen's knack for pastry and her considerable knowledge have
been gained entirely on the job. She had no professional kitchen
experience when a childhood friend who worked at Chez Panisse
called her _ she was working at an insurance company in Michigan _
and invited her to come help. The restaurant had just opened the
upstairs cafe and needed more hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically they were looking for someone who would work for
free,'' Thoresen says. ``I'm not a risk-taker, but this just felt
like something I shouldn't pass up.'' After about three months of
volunteer work, she was put on the payroll and stayed in the pastry
department for 12 years. She then spent three years running the
cafe at the California College of Arts and Crafts in Oakland and a
couple of years as executive pastry chef for the group that owned
Enrico's, Tavolino and U.S. Restaurant in San Francisco. Last year,
she opened Jojo with partner Curt Clingman.
</P>
<P>
   Today, she makes the pastry at Jojo in a small corner of the
restaurant's small open kitchen. The following desserts will likely
appear on her menu over the summer, nature willing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_  &UR; Champagne Gelee with Mixed Berries. &LR;  ``It's really cold and
fresh and spectacular-looking, especially in a nice, clear glass,''
says Thoresen of this grown-up version of Jell-O.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the clean, clear taste of Champagne, seeing the golden
color of the jelly and all those deep, bright berries.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Peaches in Red Wine Raspberry Compote. &LR;  ``We used to make red
wine-raspberry sorbet at Chez Panisse, and I've always liked the
red wine and peaches thing,'' says Thoresen, referring to a
European tradition of slicing peaches into sweetened red wine. She
warms the wine just enough to dissolve the sugar, pours the warm
mixture over raspberries and lets them infuse, then presses the
berries through a strainer into the syrup.
</P>
<P>
   The peaches are peeled without blanching to preserve their
texture, then sliced and marinated in the light wine syrup. ``They
lose something when they're cooked,'' she says. ``Even just
blanched, they get that layer of translucency and they absorb the
wine differently.''
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Nectarines with Beaumes de Venise Sabayon. &LR;  Thoresen pairs
unpeeled nectarines with this billowy sabayon flavored with French
Muscat wine. Apricots, strawberries, bush berries or a mixture of
fruit would be equally appealing.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Melon Sorbet. &LR;  To preserve the fresh melon flavor, Thoresen
dissolves the sugar over heat in just enough melon puree to moisten
it, then stirs that puree back into the main base. She uses the
same proportion of 1 quart fruit puree to 1 cup sugar for most
summer fruit sorbets, although extra-sweet melons may need some
lime juice for balance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've monkeyed around with it, but with more or less sugar, it
doesn't freeze as nicely,'' she says. ``More sugar makes it syrupy;
less makes it icy.''
</P>
<P>
   With melon, strawberry, peach, nectarine and plum, she uses
straight sugar in her sorbets, believing that sugar syrup dilutes
the fruit flavor too much. With the more intense raspberries and
blackberries, she uses sugar syrup.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Santa Rosa Plum Galette with Vanilla Ice Cream.  &LR; ``If I was
stranded on an island with only one dessert, this would be the
one,'' Thoresen says, although in her dreams, it would arrive with
bitter almond ice cream. The dough is one she learned when Jacques
Pepin cooked for a week at Chez Panisse and used it for an apple
galette. ``We essentially abandoned all other dough recipes after
that,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Thoresen uses the same dough and method to make galettes of many
kinds _ apricot with cherry, peach, apple, pear, rhubarb. ``One
customer who comes in about once a week has two slices every
time,'' she says. ``She says she is not usually a dessert eater,
but these fruit tarts have been an epiphany.''

TIPS FOR BUYING &AMP; STORING FRUIT
</P>
<P>
   Here are some tips from pastry chef Mary Jo Thoresen for buying
and storing fruit for those perfect fruit desserts.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Buy the ripest fruit possible.  &LR; Fruit in its prime should
smell sweet and true to its nature. If the produce manager allows,
ask to taste the fruit before you buy. Also ask the produce manager
to help you pick the best of the bin.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Inspect fruit carefully.  &LR; Be sure there are no bruised,
withered or moldy spots. But resist the temptation to squeeze the
fruit in the market. Turn baskets of berries over to be sure there
is no mold on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Store fruit properly.  &LR; Spread out fruit on a parchment-lined
baking sheet, making sure there is space between each piece to
allow air to circulate. Stone fruit should be placed stem-end down
on the parchment and left at room temperature until it yields to
gentle pressure on the shoulders. Berries _ don't wash them, don't
cover them _ should be refrigerated.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Buy fruit later in the season.  &LR; Early-season fruit generally
isn't as full flavored as late-season fruit. It also is more
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   _  &UR; Don't be afraid to buy fruit in quantity when it is at its &LR; 
 &UR; best.  &LR; Freeze extra berries and turn other fruit into sweetened
fruit purees _ try the proportion of 1 quart of fruit puree to 1
cup of sugar, then freeze the puree.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; CHAMPAGNE GELEE WITH MIXED BERRIES
</P>
<P>
   A light and refreshing dessert for a hot summer night.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups good-quality nonvintage Champagne
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup cold water
</P>
<P>
   1 package unflavored gelatin
</P>
<P>
   11/2 cups mixed berries: strawberries, raspberries,
boysenberries, olallieberries, blueberries
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Pour the Champagne into a 1-quart glass loaf pan. Add the sugar
and stir occasionally until the sugar dissolves.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the cold water into a small saucepan and sprinkle the
gelatin over the water slowly and evenly so it will absorb without
clumps. Let sit for 5 minutes. Warm the gelatin mixture over low
heat just until the gelatin melts. Slowly pour the dissolved
gelatin into the Champagne, stirring constantly. Cover with plastic
wrap and refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Wash, hull and slice the strawberries, if using.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the gelee from the refrigerator and draw a knife through
it in a cross pattern just to break it up a bit. Spoon some gelee
into the bottom of a balloon wine glass or other wide-mouthed
glass, then place a layer of berries on top. Repeat until the glass
is 2/3 to 3/4 full. At this point you can cover each glass with
plastic and return it to the refrigerator until you are ready to
serve it.

PEACHES IN RED WINE RASPBERRY SYRUP
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 cups Beaujolais
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sugar, or more to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fresh raspberries + raspberries for garnish
</P>
<P>
   4 large unblemished freestone peaches
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Combine the wine, water and sugar in a nonreactive saucepan and
warm, stirring, until sugar dissolves.
</P>
<P>
   Put 1 cup raspberries in a glass or ceramic bowl and pour the
warmed wine mixture over them. Let macerate until cool, or
refrigerate overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Pass this mixture through a food mill or fine strainer to get
all the raspberry juice into the wine, leaving the seeds behind.
Taste for sweetness; add a little more sugar, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours before serving, cut the peaches in half and
carefully peel them, being careful to preserve their beautiful
shape. Slice each half thickly, yielding 4 to 5 slices per half.
Place the slices in the chilled syrup and refrigerate until just
before serving.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, divide the peaches among compote dishes and ladle
enough of the syrup into each dish to partially cover the peaches.
Garnish with a few fresh raspberries.

NECTARINES WITH BEAUMES DE VENISE SABAYON
</P>
<P>
   Muscat de Beaumes de Venise is a sweet wine from Southern
France. If you can't find it, substitute another sweet Muscat.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   7 egg yolks, preferably organic
</P>
<P>
   1 cup + 2 tablespoons Muscat de Beaumes de Venise
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 cup heavy cream, whipped to firm peaks
</P>
<P>
   4 ripe nectarines with unblemished skins
</P>
<P>
   Toasted sliced almonds for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Using an electric mixer, whip the egg yolks until very light and
lemon colored.
</P>
<P>
   While the yolks whip, combine the wine and sugar in a heavy
stainless-steel saucepan. Place over moderate heat. When the wine
comes to a boil, add it gradually to the yolks, whipping
constantly. Return the mixture to the pot and place over moderate
heat. Whisk furiously until the mixture begins to thicken and the
bubbles created become smaller. Do not overcook.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from heat and strain through a fine sieve into a large
stainless-steel bowl set over ice. Gently fold the sabayon to
hasten its cooling.
</P>
<P>
   When the sabayon is cool, fold in the whipped cream. Refrigerate
until ready to use. Sabayon may be made up to a day ahead.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, halve and slice the nectarines and arrange on dessert
plates. Spoon sabayon alongside the fruit and garnish with toasted
almonds.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8.

MELON SORBET
</P>
<P>
   Use any fragrant melons for this sorbet: cantaloupe, honeydew,
Charentais, Canary melons or whatever variety smells and tastes
best. Because melons vary greatly in size, this recipe is written
to accommodate any choice. Serve with butter cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   Melons, best available
</P>
<P>
   Sugar
</P>
<P>
   Lime juice (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Melon balls or strawberries for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Halve the melons and remove the seeds. Cut the halves into 4
lengthwise slices and remove the rind. Chop into pieces that will
fit in your food processor or blender. Puree in batches until
smooth. If it is not completely smooth, pass the puree through a
strainer.
</P>
<P>
   Measure the puree. For each cup of puree, measure out 1/4 cup
sugar (use slightly less if the melon is very sweet). Place the
sugar in a stainless-steel saucepan. Add enough melon puree to
moisten the sugar. Place over moderate heat just long enough to
melt the sugar. Test with your fingers; if you feel no grains of
sugar, it has melted. Pour this mixture back into the melon puree.
Chill thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Taste the mixture and add a few drops of lime juice if the puree
is too sweet. Freeze according to the directions for your ice-cream
maker.
</P>
<P>
   Serve in chilled glasses or bowls. Garnish with fresh melon
balls or strawberries. It's nice to use green-fleshed melon for
garnish if your sorbet is orange, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   Yield depends on size of melon used. One 4-pound melon yields
about 6 cups puree.
</P>
<P>
   Due to general nature of recipe, no nutritional analysis is
included.

<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; SANTA ROSA PLUM GALETTE
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was stranded on an island with only one dessert, this
would be the one,'` says Thoresen. Although she pairs warm wedges
of this homey tart with bitter almond ice cream, it goes equally
well with French vanilla.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   The Dough
</P>
<P>
   1 cup all-purpose flour
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   4 to 6 ounces cold unsalted butter (see note)
</P>
<P>
   Ice water
</P>
<P>
   The Filling
</P>
<P>
   8 to 10 firm-ripe Santa Rosa plums
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 tablespoons flour
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons sugar, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   To Finish
</P>
<P>
   Melted butter for brushing
</P>
<P>
   Sugar for sprinkling on crust
</P>
<P>
   French vanilla ice cream
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; To make the dough:  &LR; Combine the flour and salt in a mixing
bowl. Cut the butter into small pieces and add to the flour. Work
in the butter with a mixer or by hand until the pieces are the size
of tiny peas. Add ice water 1 tablespoon at a time, tossing and
mixing gently by hand until the dough is moist but not sticky. Wrap
the dough in plastic and flatten into a disk. Refrigerate at least
1 hour, but preferably overnight.
</P>
<P>
   Roll out the dough to a 12-inch-diameter circle on a floured
surface. Don't worry if it's not perfectly round; the tart is
beautiful no matter what shape it is. Transfer the dough to a
parchment-lined pizza pan or baking sheet. Cover with plastic and
refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To finish the galette:  &LR; Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Halve and
pit the plums. Cut each into 5 or 6 slices.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the dough from the refrigerator. Leaving a 2-inch border,
sprinkle the surface of the dough with 2 to 3 tablespoons flour and
1 tablespoon of the sugar. Place the plum slices on the dough. You
can arrange them artfully or place them helter-skelter; either way,
it will look lovely.
</P>
<P>
   Carefully draw up the dough from the sides and fold it over to
form the rim. Make sure there are no cracks where juices can run
out during baking.
</P>
<P>
   Brush the rim of the dough with melted butter and sprinkle
generously with sugar. Then sprinkle the plums with the remaining 4
tablespoons sugar, or more, depending on sweetness of plums.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until well-browned and bubbly, about 40 minutes, rotating
as needed so the tart browns evenly.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer to a cooling rack so the bottom crust doesn't get
soggy. Use a pastry brush to dab the plums with plum juice to glaze
them while still hot.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the galette warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; When we tested this recipe, we used 6 ounces of butter
to make the pastry. Although the finished crust was rich, flaky,
buttery and totally delicious, it was difficult to roll out and had
a tendency to tear. Using 4 ounces of butter produces dough that is
easier to work with, although it is not quite as rich.

 &HT;    STUDY CITES DRUG COVERAGE GAP FOR RURAL RESIDENTS
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Elderly rural Americans are more likely to need
prescription drugs and less likely to to obtain them than urban
Medicare beneficiaries, according to a recent study.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the administration's National Economic Council and
the Democratic Policy Council found that 28 percent of rural
elderly are in poor health, compared to 26 percent in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
   But 43 percent of rural elderly lack any prescription drug
coverage for an entire year, compared to 27 percent of urban
elderly who lack coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The study also noted that rural elderly are generally poorer
than their urban counterparts, but pay substantially more for
prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 percent of rural elderly have incomes below the federal
poverty level, compared to 16 percent for urban elderly. But rural
elderly pay an average of $375 a year in out-of-pocket costs for
prescriptions, compared to $300 for urban beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   The study was highlighted Tuesday by Sens. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.,
and Max Baucus, D-Mont., at a briefing for reporters on the eve of
House consideration of a Republican plan to offer an
insurance-based prescription drug plan for Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, the administration's chief economic adviser, used
the briefing to criticize the GOP plan and reiterate Clinton's
willingness to accept a tax cut for married couples in exchange for
a Medicare-based prescription drug benefit.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP plan is designed to encourage insurance companies to
offer a drug benefit by giving them subsidies, and by helping to
pay premiums for low-income beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Sperling called the GOP bill a ``false promise'' because it
would not require insurers to offer policies in rural communities
nor guarantee that policies would be affordable there if offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fundamentally would not fix the basic problem _ there are
gaps that exist right now in rural America,'' Sperling said.
</P>
<P>
   The study noted that rural elderly are slightly more likely to
purchase supplemental ``medigap'' policies offering prescription
drug coverage _ 13 percent for rural elderly, 11 percent for urban
_ but it noted that such policies increase in price as people get
older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medigap is such a poor option for seniors . ... I'm surprised
there is a market at all,'' Sperling said, noting that some elderly
pay about $2,000 a year for such coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Dorgan called the GOP plan ``an illusion'' because insurance
companies have expressed reluctance to provide the type of coverage
the plan envisions, particularly in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Baucus said offering competing insurance plans would make it
even more difficult for seniors to understand the complexities of
the health care system and warned that insurers would seek out only
the healthiest seniors to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Dorgan predicted a prescription drug plan closer to the one
Clinton has proposed _ offering a 50 percent subsidy for drug costs
up to $2,000 and full coverage for out-of-pocket spending in excess
of $4,000 _ would likely to part of a ``big puzzle'' of legislation
to be hammered out before the election.

 CHRON  
 Cook's Books: Recipes May Leave a Person Guessing   By David A. Steinberg 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; In my experience, there seems to be two basic
types of home cook: Type A cooks, who follow recipes to the letter,
and Type Zen cooks, who just feel their way along with whatever
impulse floats their boat.
<P>
   Type A cooks see the other type as undisciplined and lacking in
technique, while Type Zen cooks think that Type A folk need to
loosen up.
</P>
<P>
   But now there's a book that seeks to bridge both worlds by
promising to teach you how to cook without an instruction manual.
The title, ``How to Cook Without a Book,'' seems to be either a
contradiction in terms or a Zen koan.
</P>
<P>
   It is neither.
</P>
<P>
   The book appears to be written for busy people who want to cook
but just don't feel ``creative'' enough to whip something up from
whatever is in the house, or who don't have enough time to give to
everyday cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Anderson attempts to demystify the essentials of what goes
into basic, homey recipes that require either little preparation or
frequent use of the term ``from the freezer to the oven.'' The
French Laundry cookbook this ain't. I'm not saying it should be,
but on the other hand, there does seem to be something missing.
</P>
<P>
   While trying to bridge the work-a-day world with old-fashioned
``dinner on the table at 6'' cooking, Anderson relies too heavily
on semiprepared foods (such as salsa and various sauce
preparations), yet scrupulously avoids prepackaged foods that would
yield basically the same result.
</P>
<P>
   For example, she suggests using canned tomatoes plus various
additions for a pasta sauce that tastes like nothing more than a
doctored-up version of Prego. In another recipe, she substitutes
spaghetti for rice noodles in her version of pad Thai. That's a bit
too homey for me.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson uses the classic technique of cooking schools, in which
a ``master recipe'' is taught to learn the techniques involved and
then the variations are added to give character and individuality
to the final creation.
</P>
<P>
   One recipe that produced mixed results was Quick Ravioli. The
recipe wasn't quick and the dish _ although it tasted good _ didn't
particularly look or taste like ravioli. With the ravioli master
recipe, Anderson substitutes wonton wrappers for pasta sheets, and
the result is something between Peking &LR; Beijing ravioli and chow fun
noodles.
</P>
<P>
   While wonton wrappers are indeed a time-saver over making your
own pasta dough, the amount of time it took to stuff ravioli by
hand made this a fairly impractical dish for weeknights unless you
make the stuffing ahead of time.
</P>
<P>
   One cooking technique that I will definitely borrow is the way
Anderson roasts a chicken. Reminiscent of pressed chicken, she cuts
out the backbone of the bird and flattens it on a baking sheet (she
calls it a shallow roasting pan) and then rubs the seasonings under
the skin to flavor the meat.
</P>
<P>
   Roasting the chicken like this on high heat cuts cooking time
nearly in half, and the result is beautifully moist and flavorful
meat with all parts nicely done and crispy skin that is near
perfection.
</P>
<P>
   While some of Anderson's shortcuts, like this one, are quite
useful, the feeling of the book is almost patronizingly simplistic.
The little mnemonic-like rhyme at the beginning of each chapter,
which is supposed to help you remember the basic thrust of the
technique, is irritating and not very helpful.
</P>
<P>
   The other glaring pitfall is the confusing organization of the
recipes and inconsistent instructions.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the recipe at the end of the variation of the
roasted chicken calls for an addition of potatoes and tomatoes that
have been ``prepared'' prior to adding them to the roasting dish.
Unfortunately, the cook is neither told how to prepare them, nor
sent to instructions elsewhere in the book.
</P>
<P>
   Cooking times of recipe variations were also inconsistent, in
some cases stating a specific time in the master recipe, then
giving a range of cooking times in a subsequent variation.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the shortfalls, this is one of the most annoying
cookbooks I have encountered. Even though Anderson has some nifty
shortcuts, the simplistic tenor will bore most cooks with even a
modicum of experience, while the confusing and sometimes
contradictory instructions will frustrate a novice.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, any book by Marion Cunningham would do you better . . .
and without the rhyming.

EDITOR'S NOTE: This is the latest installment of a bi-weekly series
of Food Lovers' Walks that cover neighborhoods in San Francisco and
other Bay Area cities where a casual stroll turns up culinary
treasures. &HT;     
 Food Lovers' Walks: Chic Neighborhood Rises From Ashes  By Andy Lax  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Hayes Valley, formerly one of the city's rougher
neighborhoods, has become a chic center for fashion, style and
food.
<P>
   For years the shadow of the central freeway had separated the
east and west sides of Hayes Valley. The east was home to the new,
trendy businesses, while the west was plagued with crime. But after
the freeway was knocked down following the Loma Prieta Earthquake
in 1989, the neighborhood took off.
</P>
<P>
   At Hayes and Franklin, a large sign proclaims, ``Welcome to
Hayes Valley.'' That welcome is extended at  &UR; Nuts About You &LR; , an
anachronistic card and candy shop that offers a wide selection of
teas and coffee drinks. The store carries more than 30 varieties of
black licorice, ranging from salty Dutch to soft, chewy Australian.
</P>
<P>
   Just up the street is  &UR; Richard Hilkert, Bookseller, Ltd &LR; , which
resembles a cluttered personal library. Although the focus of the
store is on architecture and design, near the back is a slender
shelf and coffee table stacked with cookbooks. Owner Richard
Hilkert knows a gem when he sees it. Interspersed with the new,
popular titles are such culinary relics as ``Everyday Foods in War
Time,'' published in 1918. Sitting under a photograph of the late
M.F.K. Fischer (who used to visit the store) Hilkert is ready to
make suggestions or share his opinion on the development of Hayes
Valley, where he set up shop in 1981. ``We had an image problem,''
he says, likening Hayes Valley in those years to ``an early Grant
Avenue.''
</P>
<P>
   The close proximity of Hayes Valley to the opera, theater and
symphony has made securing a table for a preshow dinner something
of a challenge. During the day, however, tables are plentiful and
offer a welcome break from shopping.
</P>
<P>
   The menu at  &UR; Moishe's Pippic  &LR; would make a Jewish grandma proud
_ knishes, kishke, rugalach and deli sandwiches like the New Yorker
(corned beef, coleslaw and Russian dressing on rye), ranging from
$4.75 to $6.95. For a few dollars less you can opt for a hot dog
with a variety of condiments.
</P>
<P>
   If it's soul food you're hankering for, walk down the street to
 &UR; Powell's Place &LR;  for a real stick-to-your-ribs meal. Daily specials
range from BBQ beef ribs to smothered pork chops to award-winning
fried chicken, all served with sides like candied yams and corn
muffins oozing with butter. If that's not enough, order a wedge of
sweet potato pie, sit back, loosen your belt and marvel at what you
just ate for $10.
</P>
<P>
   The space previously occupied by Mad Magda's Russian Tea Room
now houses  &UR; Frjtz &LR; , with a menu of crepes, salads, sandwiches and
Belgian fries, with the most expensive item (a green salad with
smoked salmon, mangoes, macadamias, avocado and red onion) at
$6.75. The rear courtyard surrounded by flowering trees is a
perfect place to eat.
</P>
<P>
   If you're in a hurry,  &UR; Arlequin &LR;  offers salads, soups and
sandwiches to go. Like its parent restaurant,  &UR; Absinthe Brasserie &LR; 
 &UR; and Bar &LR; , the menu is French-inspired with offerings like a lentil
salad with roasted beets, and a sandwich of salami, grilled
asparagus and fontina cheese, all in the $5- to $6-range.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwich prices range from $5 to $6, while salads run from $2 to
$5.50. House-made ice creams and sorbets offer respite from the
summer heat.
</P>
<P>
   A quick sandwich for around $5 also can be found at  &UR; Parco &LR; 
 &UR; Coffee and Tea &LR; , this time with an Asian skew. Standards like
turkey and egg salad share the menu with udon noodles and edamame.
</P>
<P>
   For a more leisurely lunch, try Absinthe, with an appetizer of
ricotta dumplings and a Mediterranean salad of grilled prawns,
fennel, pickled salicornia and steamed potatoes in mustard
vinaigrette.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that your own table is as stylish as those of the
restaurants, Hayes Street has home furnishing stores and galleries
that combine the latest styles from around the world with antiques
revived in contemporary settings. That global array is the focus at
 &UR; Worldware &LR;  with an inventory from 48 countries _ Parisian
flatware, Venetian plates and Romanian glassware.
</P>
<P>
   The antiques at  &UR; F Dorian &LR;  offer a stark contrast to more modern
wares. Along with items like Japanese condiment holders, you can
find cocktail, wine and martini glasses to spruce up your bar. At
 &UR; Pomp Home &LR; , colorful coffee cups from Poland share the shelf with
Thai table settings and a wide variety of elegant chopsticks.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Buu &LR;  offers another round-the-world houseware tour, focusing on
German and Japanese products such as sleek espresso cups and
thermal carafes and modern tetsubin-style teapots, fashioned after
traditional cast-iron designs. A glass case in the middle of the
store displays art deco corkscrews and Japanese Brieto knives as
though they were fine  &LR; objets d'art &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   If you want to end the day with a glass of wine, slip into the
plush back room of &UR; Hayes and Vine &LR; . Reclining on the purple velvet
cushions is an ideal way to sample the wine flights, which change
weekly. If you prefer to take your wine with you, visit
 &UR; Amphora &LR;   &UR; Wine Merchant &LR; , which carries wines from a number of
small producers.
</P>
<P>
   Once the plates from lunch have been cleared, the perfect place
mats purchased and the final drops of wine drained from your glass,
there is only one thing left to do on a Hayes Valley tour: check
out the menus displayed outside the restaurants and make your plans
for dinner.

 Learning To Cook: Let the Guests Design Their Own Pasta  By Marion Cunningham  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; Pasta has been high on the list of America's
favorite foods for quite a few years. Quick and easy to fix and
hard to ruin, pasta can be prepared and on the table 30 minutes
after you come in the front door. In other words, it's ideal for
today's faster-busier lifestyle.
<P>
   However, the one fault with many pastas is that they are
smothered in sauce. Too much sauce destroys pasta's texture and
taste. But I have a solution and, I think, a very pleasant way of
serving pasta so each diner can create his favorite style.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the cook preparing everyone's dish of pasta, let each
diner prepare his own. Here's how to do it:
</P>
<P>
   _ Have a big pot of cooked pasta, in its cooking water, on the
stove. This can be done ahead of time. Pasta will stay hot in its
cooking water for 15 to 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If the water cools down, the pasta may be reheated. Simply bring
the water back to a boil, then turn off the heat. Don't drain the
pasta until just before serving. The past must be hot for this
trick to work.
</P>
<P>
   _ Have bowls of chopped ingredients on the table: garlic, fresh
chives, watercress, oregano and ripe tomatoes. You'll want a
separate bowl for each ingredient. Add a bowl of freshly grated
Parmesan or, even better, a chunk of Parmesan and a cheese grater,
a cruet of fine olive oil, and salt and pepper grinders.
</P>
<P>
   _ Provide your guests with heated pasta bowls and let each
person take what he wants from the vegetables, then top with the
hot pasta. The heat from the pasta will lightly wilt the herbs and
tomatoes, warming the ingredients just enough to release their
juices, flavors and aromas.
</P>
<P>
   _ A quick toss with a fork, and the custom-made pastas are ready
to garnish with a little olive oil and freshly grated cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with warm rolls or heated sourdough bread, and for
dessert, fresh fruit and cookies.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
PASTA TO PLEASE
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 large garlic cloves, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch chives, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch oregano (leaves only), chopped
</P>
<P>
   4 ripe tomatoes, cored and roughly chopped
</P>
<P>
   6 quarts water
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons salt + salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 pound linguine
</P>
<P>
   Olive oil, as needed
</P>
<P>
   1/2-pound chunk Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Pepper, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   You can chop the garlic, chives, oregano and tomatoes early the
day you plan to serve this. Put each chopped ingredient in a small
bowl. Shake a little cold water over the chives and oregano, cover
the dishes with plastic wrap and put in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the water and 2 tablespoons salt in a large pot. Place
over high heat and stir to dissolve the salt. When the water begins
to boil, add the linguine. Use a fork to stir and separate the
pasta strands so they don't stick together. Cook for 12 to 16
minutes (test at 12 minutes by spearing a strand or two with a fork
and tasting it. If the pasta is still firm, cook for a few minutes
longer, testing frequently).
</P>
<P>
   If you are not ready to serve the pasta, let it remain in its
cooking water. If the water cools before you can serve the pasta,
place the pot back over high heat. As soon as the water boils,
drain the pasta and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Have the small bowls of ingredients _ the garlic, chives,
oregano, tomatoes _ on the table. Also, place a small pitcher of
olive oil, the Parmesan and a cheese grater, plus salt and pepper
mills on the table.
</P>
<P>
   Let each diner add ingredients to his pasta bowl (if possible,
warm the bowls) before forking in the hot pasta. The heat of the
pasta will wilt and warm the ingredients, and the flavors and
juices will be released into the pasta.
</P>
<P>
   Pass the cheese and its grater, and the olive oil at the table.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4.

 Taster's Choice : English-Style Chips Lack Clear Winner 
 
By  Robin Davis 
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
 
SAN FRANCISCO _ In honor of the Independence Day, today's panel
tasted one of the lingering remnants of the English colonization:
malt vinegar, but in the form of salt and vinegar potato chips, or
``crisps'' as they're called across the ``pond.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The panel tasted eight brands, but there was no consensus on a
favorite. Opinions varied dramatically, which produced muddled
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tim's Cascade &LR;  (six ounces, $1.89 at Albertson's) received the
highest ranking, but only two panelists considered it their
favorite. Three liked the thickness and crunchiness, but one
thought it was too thick. Some liked the balance of flavor, but one
thought it tasted of bad oil. Three would buy it; two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lay's &LR;  (71/2 ounces, $1.99 at Safeway) came in second. One
panelist described it as ``the best,'' and another praised the
salty-tart flavor. But others thought the chips were too pallid and
oily and lacked vinegar flavor. Two would buy it, one might buy it,
and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Third place went to  &UR; Kettle &LR;  (five ounces, $1.69 at Whole
Foods). Two panelists liked the tartness but wanted more salt for
balance. Two others didn't care for the dark brown color, which
they thought lent a burnt flavor. Three might buy it; two would
not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Trader Joe's &LR;  (seven ounces, $1.39 at Trader Joe's) came in
fourth. Most of the panelists thought these tasted too strongly of
vinegar. Others disliked the dark brown color and slightly burnt
taste. But one panelist said she ``loved the crunch.'' One would
buy it, two might buy it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place went to  &UR; Cape Cod  &LR; (51/2 ounces, 99 cents at
Albertson's). One panelist thought the flavor was too mild, but
most of the others thought this chip tasted too strongly of
vinegar. Another also thought it was much too salty. Two panelists
commented on the oiliness; one characterized the chip as ``almost
chewy.'' Two might buy it; three would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Boulder &LR;  came in sixth (five ounces, $2.29 at Andronico's). Two
panelists objected to the sweet taste of these chips; others
thought they tasted stale (packages were opened minutes before the
tasting). However, some panelists liked the crunch. One would buy
it, one might buy it and three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists also tasted Terra and Pringles but they ranked too
low.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Marc Halperin,
culinary director, Center for Culinary Development; Patricia Hart,
food writer and consultant; Donna Katzl, chef-owner, Cafe For All
Seasons, San Francisco; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San

 Secrets Of Success: Mazzini's Simple Salad: Celery, cheese and 
 walnuts combine for ideal party fare  By Michael Bauer  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _  &LR; You would think this simple, sensational blend was
right out of Italy: marinated mozzarella, toasted walnuts and thin
slices of celery in a simple dressing studded with hot red pepper
flakes.
<P>
   The tangy cheese, crunchy nuts, and cooling celery create a
dynamic mix of flavors that's a perfect way to kick-start a dinner
party.
</P>
<P>
   The recipe has an Italian flair, which is no surprise since it
was created by Carol Field, the author of several impressive
Italian cookbooks including ``Italy in Small Bites.''
</P>
<P>
   Field is a consultant to Mazzini in Berkeley, which was opened
in 1998 by Jim and Laura Maser. The Masers also own Picante Cocina
Mexicana and are part owners of Cafe Fanny with Alice Waters.
However, the connections go even deeper. Laura Maser is Alice
Waters' sister.
</P>
<P>
   At Mazzini, which feels like an upscale trattoria with a comfy
bar and partly open kitchen, simplicity is the key. In the end, it
does feel just like Italy.

MARINATED MOZZARELLA, WALNUT &AMP; CELERY SALAD
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes
</P>
<P>
   20 grinds of black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 pound fresh mozzarella, cut into 1-inch cubes
</P>
<P>
   6 celery ribs, thinly sliced on the diagonal
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 ounces walnut pieces, toasted
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the olive oil in a small saute pan over low heat. Add the
garlic, red pepper flakes and black pepper. Cook for 5 minutes to
blend flavors. Let cool. Stir in the salt.
</P>
<P>

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A wavering front separating sultry air over the Southeast and
southern Plains from cooler and less humid conditions farther north
will be focus for abundant clouds and clusters of thunderstorms.
Late Wednesday and Thursday, repeated heavy showers will raise the
risk of local flooding from the Tennessee Valley to parts of the
Middle Atlantic states.
</P>
<P>
   Cooler air and lower humidity will spread from the Midwest to
the interior Northeast. A mixture of clouds and sun will cover most
of these regions as a jet stream disturbance passes overhead. A
broken area of showers will dampen parts of the Great Lakes and
northern Mississippi Valley, especially in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonable heat will persist in much of the Northwest.
Moisture lingering over the Southwest will fuel afternoon
thunderstorms in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: UNCOMMON EXTREMES
</P>
<P>
   Exposed to prevailing winds off the cool waters of the Pacific,
most locations along the immediate West Coast have an equable
climate. The large swings that often characterize daily and
interseasonal temperatures at most places across the nation are
uncommon. On Monday and Tuesday, the mercury soared to the
record-setting 80s at several coastal towns in Washington and
Oregon where temperatures are usually in the 50s and 60s for most
of the year. Wednesday, sea breezes will return to cool the
Northwest coast while a heat wave persists in the interior. &QL;

 &HT;    U.S. CONGRESS MOVES TO EASE CUBAN EMBARGO
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is poised to ease four decades of
sanctions against Cuba as early as this week, after House
Republicans reached agreement Tuesday over legislation that would
allow American farm goods to be sold to the struggling Caribbean
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would clear the way, immediately upon passage, for
U.S. farmers to begin annually exporting millions of dollars worth
of food to Cuba. It has been the target of a U.S. economic embargo
since communist revolutionary Fidel Castro consolidated control
over the tiny country, with the help of his Soviet patrons, in
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the change, led by Rep. George Nethercutt,
R-Wash., were reviewing the possibility of attaching the
implementing legislation to some broader measure expected to be
passed by both the House and Senate before lawmakers break for the
July 4 weekend.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton
supports the main thrust of the measure. Clinton has reservations,
however, about a provision that would prevent future presidents
from restricting U.S. food or medicine exports as part of punitive
sanctions against other nations.
</P>
<P>
   That provision, Lockhart told reporters, threatens to tie
presidents' hands in the formulation of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In theory, we don't have a problem if aid goes directly to the
Cuban people for the benefit of the Cuban people,'' Lockhart told
reporters at the White House. ``But the President also needs
</P>
<P>
   the flexibility, as the steward of our foreign policy, to
implement the policy. And we oppose anything that restricts that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said, though, that lifting the U.S. embargo on food
exports was not a first step toward an overall easing of 40 years
of sanctions against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Political repression and human rights violations under Castro,
said Lockhart, still call for sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President has made clear we can provide aid, whether it be
food or medicine, to the people, but we don't believe it's time to
provide any kind of aid that helps the Cuban government,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nethercutt provisions are formally called the Trade
Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement portion of the $14.4
billion agriculture appropriations bill for 2001. That bill _ one
of 13 spending measures the Congress seeks to pass before the end
of the current fiscal year on Sept. 30 _ has been held up since May
amid negotiations over the proposed trade sanctions changes.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the Nethercutt provisions terminate existing
sanctions, and prohibit future options, that restrict the export of
U.S. farm products and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba is the main country affected. The U.S. State Department
opened farm exports to Iran, Sudan and Libya _ countries the U.S.
regards as official supporters of terrorism _ as the result of an
April 1999 White House directive. U.S. exports of medicine to Cuba
have been permitted since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agreed the shift in Cuba policy would be largely
symbolic and result in only a small amount of sales at first.
Extensive prohibitions against U.S.-Cuban commerce would remain in
place, as would restrictions on U.S. investment, banking and
tourism in Cuba. Imports into the United States of Cuban cigars,
for example, and other Cuban products would remain forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a concession to the powerful Cuban-American lobby, House
Republicans required that Cuba pay in hard cash _ American dollars
_ for any purchases the country makes from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, such purchases are aided by a system of financing
from American banks, credits to individual countries and loans
backed by the U.S. government to help facilitate overseas trade.
</P>
<P>
   Castro opponents, such as Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., who
was born in Cuba, said the financing restrictions would make it
difficult for Cuba to increase its purchase of U.S. goods in any
appreciable way.
</P>
<P>
   He also cast the legislation as a step toward tightening the
economic noose around Cuba . The legislation agreed to by House
Republicans would strip the White House of its authority to ease
restrictions on any American wanting to travel to Cuba. The House
measure would require instead that any such loosening first receive
Congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz-Balart hailed that provision as a victory for Castro's
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closing off Clinton's tourism option for Castro is our most
important achievement in years,'' Diaz-Balart said in a prepared
statement. ``We are extremely pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba gave a tepid greeting to the proposal, saying it was
''symbolic'' and left most existing U.S. sanctions in place.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, Nethercutt and his Congressional colleagues were
reviewing a number of options for securing passage of the measure.
House leaders were weighing whether to keep the bill as part of the
agriculture bill or to attach it as an amendment to some other
legislative vehicle _ the supplemental budget for emergency
spending has been mentioned in the Senate _ considered certain to
pass.

&HT;     ARMY MAKES PUSH FOR MINORITY RECRUITS, BEGINS NEW CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Army Secretary Louis Caldera announced Tuesday a
major recruiting drive to boost the service's sagging ranks by
embarking on a $380 million advertising campaign, geared in large
part toward attracting minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera also said the Army was dropping the ad agency that
helped popularize the venerable ``Be All That You Can Be'' slogan.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera said the Army has hired a new advertising agency _ Leo
Burnett Worldwide Inc., based in Chicago _ to produce commercials
and advertisements for print and broadcast media.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett will work with two minority-owned partners: Cartel
Creativo, of San Antonio, which specializes in Hispanic-American
advertising, and Images USA, of Atlanta, which specializes in
marketing to African Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Presently, about 30 percent of Army recruits are African
American and 8 percent are Hispanic American. While the Army will
target both groups, Caldera said the Hispanic community is
``potentially a growing market'' for the Army.
</P>
<P>
   The Army is having difficulty getting recruits. As of June, its
recruiting rate will put the service about 3,600 enlistees shy of
its goal of 80,000 recruits for the year, Caldera said. Last year
was the worst for Army recruiting in nearly two decades _ the
service ended up short 6,300 recruits short of its target of 74,500
new soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The other military services have faired better. The Navy last
year exceeded its recruiting goal of 52,500 enlistees by 100
recruits, while the Marine Corps met its target of 33,700 new
troops. The Air Force was 1,700 short of its goal of 33,800. All
told, the Pentagon needs about 200,000 new recruits each year for
the active duty forces.
</P>
<P>
   A Pentagon report to Congress this year said that recruiting
problems were caused by ``a robust job market, coupled with an
increased propensity among high school graduates to go on to
college.''
</P>
<P>
   The contract between the Army and Leo Burnett is structured to
give the company additional financial rewards if the recruiting
goals are met. Some of the firm's other clients include McDonalds,
Coca-Cola, Walt Disney and Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   Young &AMP; Rubicam Inc. of New York, which has held the advertising
account since 1987, opted not to compete for the contract, Caldera
said.
</P>
<P>
   Young &AMP; Rubicam took over the Army's advertising in 1987 after
the New York agency N. W. Ayer devised the ``Be All That You Can
Be'' jingle, which has been the cornerstone of recruitment efforts
since 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera has made it known that he thinks the slogan is
``dated,'' although he has resisted discarding it all together
because of its popularity. The slogan has been de-emphasized in
recent Army ads.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Wolf, Leo Burnett's chief executive officer, told the
Pentagon news conference that no decision has been made on whether

 &HT;    U.S. CONGRESS MOVES TO EASE CUBAN EMBARGO
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is poised to ease four decades of
sanctions against Cuba as early as this week, after House
Republicans reached agreement Tuesday over legislation that would
allow American farm goods to be sold to the struggling Caribbean
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would clear the way, immediately upon passage, for
U.S. farmers to begin annually exporting millions of dollars worth
of food to Cuba. It has been the target of a U.S. economic embargo
since communist revolutionary Fidel Castro consolidated control
over the tiny country, with the help of his Soviet patrons, in
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the change, led by Rep. George Nethercutt,
R-Wash., were reviewing the possibility of attaching the
implementing legislation to some broader measure expected to be
passed by both the House and Senate before lawmakers break for the
July 4 weekend.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton
supports the main thrust of the measure. Clinton has reservations,
however, about a provision that would prevent future presidents
from restricting U.S. food or medicine exports as part of punitive
sanctions against other nations.
</P>
<P>
   That provision, Lockhart told reporters, threatens to tie
presidents' hands in the formulation of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In theory, we don't have a problem if aid goes directly to the
Cuban people for the benefit of the Cuban people,'' Lockhart told
reporters at the White House. ``But the President also needs
</P>
<P>
   the flexibility, as the steward of our foreign policy, to
implement the policy. And we oppose anything that restricts that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said, though, that lifting the U.S. embargo on food
exports was not a first step toward an overall easing of 40 years
of sanctions against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Political repression and human rights violations under Castro,
said Lockhart, still call for sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President has made clear we can provide aid, whether it be
food or medicine, to the people, but we don't believe it's time to
provide any kind of aid that helps the Cuban government,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nethercutt provisions are formally called the Trade
Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement portion of the $14.4
billion agriculture appropriations bill for 2001. That bill _ one
of 13 spending measures the Congress seeks to pass before the end
of the current fiscal year on Sept. 30 _ has been held up since May
amid negotiations over the proposed trade sanctions changes.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the Nethercutt provisions terminate existing
sanctions, and prohibit future options, that restrict the export of
U.S. farm products and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba is the main country affected. The U.S. State Department
opened farm exports to Iran, Sudan and Libya _ countries the U.S.
regards as official supporters of terrorism _ as the result of an
April 1999 White House directive. U.S. exports of medicine to Cuba
have been permitted since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agreed the shift in Cuba policy would be largely
symbolic and result in only a small amount of sales at first.
Extensive prohibitions against U.S.-Cuban commerce would remain in
place, as would restrictions on U.S. investment, banking and
tourism in Cuba. Imports into the United States of Cuban cigars,
for example, and other Cuban products would remain forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a concession to the powerful Cuban-American lobby, House
Republicans required that Cuba pay in hard cash _ American dollars
_ for any purchases the country makes from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, such purchases are aided by a system of financing
from American banks, credits to individual countries and loans
backed by the U.S. government to help facilitate overseas trade.
</P>
<P>
   Castro opponents, such as Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., who
was born in Cuba, said the financing restrictions would make it
difficult for Cuba to increase its purchase of U.S. goods in any
appreciable way.
</P>
<P>
   He also cast the legislation as a step toward tightening the
economic noose around Cuba . The legislation agreed to by House
Republicans would strip the White House of its authority to ease
restrictionson any American wanting to travel to Cuba. The House
measure would require instead that any such loosening first receive
Congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz-Balart hailed that provision as a victory for Castro's
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closing off Clinton's tourism option for Castro is our most
important achievement in years,'' Diaz-Balart said in a prepared
statement. ``We are extremely pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba gave a tepid greeting to the proposal, saying it was
''symbolic'' and left most existing U.S. sanctions in place.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, Nethercutt and his Congressional colleagues were
reviewing a number of options for securing passage of the measure.
House leaders were weighing whether to keep the bill as part of the
agriculture bill or to attach it as an amendment to some other
legislative vehicle _ the supplemental budget for emergency
spending has been mentioned in the Senate _ considered certain to
pass.

   CUBA-U.S. (Washington) _ House Republican leaders agreed Tuesday
to end 40 years of trade sanctions on food and medicine to Cuba, in
a compromise that carried great political significance but may be
of only symbolic economic value, at least in the short term. By
Lizette Alvarez.

<P>
   WORLDCOM-SPRINT (Undated) _ The Justice Department sought to
curb the headlong consolidation of the telecommunications industry
on Tuesday by moving to block WorldCom Inc.'s proposed $115 billion
acquisition of the Sprint Corporation. In seeking an injunction
against the deal in federal court, the Justice Department cited
concerns that the combined company would stifle competition on the
Internet and in the long-distance telephone industry. By Seth
Schiesel and David Leonhardt.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-AFRICA-AIDS (Undated) _ At least half of all 15-year-olds in
the African countries worst affected by AIDS will die of the
disease even if the rates drop substantially in the next few years,
the United Nations reported Tuesday. And if infection rates remain
high, the odds are that more than two-thirds of 15-year-olds will
die from AIDS in countries like Botswana, according to projections
from Unaids, a joint U.N.'s program in Geneva. By Lawrence K.
Altman. 1,300 words.

   FDA-OVER-THE-COUNTER (Washington) _ Spurred by two
pharmaceutical companies that want to take their
cholesterol-lowering medications over the counter, the FDA is
considering whether many more medicines _ from antibiotics to birth
control pills _ should be made available without a doctor's
prescription. Beginning with public hearings on Wednesday and
Thursday, the drug agency will begin a re-examination of the way it
regulates over-the-counter drugs, the first such review in nearly
three decades. The last one, in 1972, created a new system for
approving over-the-counter drugs that enabled more than 600 drugs
to switch from prescription to nonprescription status. By Sheryl
Gay Stolberg. 1,500 words.

proposals, a look at the intense lobbying effort against the
Clinton plan. By John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   INDONESIA-UNREST (Jakarta, Indonesia) _ A terrifying surge of
communal violence, apparently fueled by anti-government agitators
in Jakarta, is tearing apart the remote and beautiful islands of
Maluku, once known as the Spice Islands, raising fears of
destabilization throughout Indonesia's ailing archipelago. More
than 200 people have reportedly been killed in the past week in
village massacres and in street fighting in the small city of
Ambon, pushing the death toll during the last 18 months to more
than 2,500. By Seth Mydans. 1,400 words.

   SCOTUS-MIRANDA-ASSESS (Washington) _ Timing, in constitutional
law no less than in life or love, can mean everything, and when it
came to timing, the opponents of the Miranda decision who finally
managed to push the Supreme Court into revisiting the case after 34
years turned out to have been spectacularly unlucky. A news

CLAPTON AND KING MAKE MAGIC

<P>
   The defining visual moment on the new album by guitarists B.B.
King and Eric Clapton is a black-and-white photograph from the
1960s. In it, the two sit with crossed legs on matching Fender
amps, presumably trading licks with the aplomb afforded masters, of
the instrument.
</P>
<P>
   King, ever the gentleman-blues herder in dark suit and ankle
boots, and Clapton _ in his mid-1960s, Cream-era Afro and jeans _
couldn't have come to the blues as more polar opposites.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there they are: Sitting in marked contrast but playing in
shared devotion. Though it has taken 30-plus years for it to
happen, such a meeting seems to have whetted their appetites to
record an album together.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the album, ``Riding With the King,'' is a reality, its
defining musical moments could be any of eight cuts on the 12-song
disc. That's enough to make it a success by any standard. Simply
put: Plug this sucker in, turn the lights down and turn your living
room into a smokey blues club.
</P>
<P>
   The best songs here range from slow, growling blues (``Three
O'Clock Blues,'' ``When My Heart Beats Like a Hammer'') and uptempo
house-rockers (``Days of Old'') to unique hybrids (``Marry You'')
that flawlessly marry the commercially adept Clapton and the
soulful King.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marry You,'' for example, is a smoky cool synthesis of King's
reverential approach and Clapton's contemporary pop-blues sound.
The same could be said of ``Help the Poor,'' though this time the
pairing results in a vintage, 1950s sound that could have sparked a
Screamin' Jay Hawkins record.
</P>
<P>
   The strength of ``Riding With The King'' is King's unrivaled
blues vocalizing, which runs from sweet as honey to raw and
growling. The 72-year-old Riley King received his nickname _ B.B.
for ``Blues Boy'' _ while working as a Memphis disc jockey in the
1950s. On this disc, he provides five classic songs and sounds
particularly energized to be playing with one of his most devoted
disciples.
</P>
<P>
   On two seven-minute-plus, slow-blues workouts, King and Clapton
trade signature guitar licks that could have come straight from
that 1960s photograph.
</P>
<P>
   If anything threatens to mar this blues lovefest, it's Clapton's
vocals, which trade off with King's on 10 of the 12 cuts and all
too often sound thin and blown out of the water when paired with
the master.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the songs, one is a flop _ Johnny Mercer's ``Come Rain or
Come Shine,'' with strings that make it a parody. One is
unnecessary _ an acoustic retooling of Big Bill Broonzy's ``Key to
the Highway,'' which Clapton did much better on Derek and the
Dominos' ``Layla'' album.
</P>
<P>
   Two others are a tossup: a slow take on the Sam &AMP; Dave hit
``Hold On I'm Coming,'' and the lead-off, title cut, which is a
self-conscious, weak composition to start the album.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, though, ``Riding With the King'' melts Mentor
and Student together in a satisfying set that, despite the few
flaws, is worth the wait.

   The Al Gore campaign denounced new Republican hearings into 1996
Democratic fund-raising. Gore spokesman Chris Lehane charged Sen.
Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) of ``engaging in McCarthy-like tactics''and
said the Republican Party had turned Congress into a
``scandal-industrial complex''with George W. Bush as its ``CEO.''
The Bush camp, meanwhile, blamed Gore for high gasoline prices.
Said a Bush press release: ``Mr. Gore, who has been a part of the
anti-American-oil-production policies, wants voters to think
falsely of Governor Bush as a ``big oil'' man. What about Mr.
Gore's ``big oil'' interests?'' That last reference was to Gore
family stock holdings in Occidental Oil.
</P>
<P>
   COULD USE SOME TELEPROMPTER TECHNOLOGY, TOO
</P>
<P>
   Squinting into a punishing Philadelphia sun today with his back
to natural-gas pipelines and smokeless stacks of Trigen, a
cleaner-burning power plant, Al Gore delivered what his campaign
billed as a major address on energy policy: a call for $75 billion
in tax incentives for fuel-efficient technologies. His TelePrompTer
malfunctioned and was removed just before Gore took the stage to
the tune of Steve Winwood's ``Higher Love.'' Often criticized as a
halting speaker, Gore has recently begun to use the machine for
daily policy speeches in these weeks leading up to his crucial
address at the convention in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONALITY OVER POLITICS, PART I
</P>
<P>
   Battling over personality rather than policies, GOP Rep. Merrill
Cook struggled to overcome allegations of erratic behavior and win
his party's nomination today for a third term in Utah. Cook is
considered to be one of the most vulnerable House members in the
country. Two years ago, Cook was briefly banned from state GOP
headquarters after a foul-mouthed tirade days before the November
election. Soon after winning his second term, he fired chief of
staff Janet Jenson, who accused him of delusional behavior. Cook's
primary opponent is millionaire computer company founder Derek
Smith.
</P>
<P>
   PERSONALITY OVER POLITICS, PART II
</P>
<P>
   Voters in South Carolina today were deciding between an
estranged husband and wife vying for a state legislative seat.
Domestic discord led to a bitter race between two-term Republican
state Rep. Shirley Hinson and her estranged husband, retired school
principal Jimmy Hinson. The election was steeped in the details of
their troubled marriage, including allegations of death threats and
infidelity. Mrs. Hinson said her husband was simply seeking
revenge; he said he could do a better job. The winner is assured of
the seat because there is no Democratic opposition.
</P>
<P>
   JUST PERSONAL _ NO POLITICS INVOLVED
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Thomas of California wrote an open letter to
constituents denying any conflict of interest after the Bakersfield
Californian reported he had an ``intensely personal'' relationship
with a health care lobbyist, Deborah Steelman. The 11-term
Republican is head of the subcommittee governing health care and a
key player in the Medicare prescription drug debate. Thomas, who is
married, didn't deny the relationship. But he said he has ``never
let my public decisions be influenced by any factor other than what
I thought was best and right on your behalf.'' Thomas won nearly 80
percent of the vote in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH PULLING AWAY IN THE BACKSTRETCH
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is widening his lead over Al Gore in polling
among likely voters with a little more than four months to go, a
new survey suggests. Bush racked up a 52-39 percent lead in a new
CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll. The same poll (5 percentage point margin
of error) taken the week of June 5 showed Bush ahead 48-44 percent.
It was 49-42 for Bush in the same poll late last month.
</P>
<P>
   CHECKS KEEP COMING IN
</P>
<P>
   Big money continues to roll into the Republican Party. New
Federal Election Commission reports show that in May the party and
its committees raised $12.2 million in soft money. That brought the
party's fund-raising total for the 2000 election to $106 million.
The Democratic soft-money totals have not yet arrived at the FEC,
but figures that include some of May's fund-raising has the
Democratic soft-money total at $86.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   SQUEEZING DOLLARS OUT OF WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats are pursuing more than women's votes this year;
they're after their pocketbooks as well. From informal coffees to
major fund-raising dinners with President Clinton, the party is
targeting the nation's women who have been rising to more powerful
jobs but still give less than one-quarter of political donations.
``That's certainly a way to bring in new money.'' said Janice
Griffin, a Democratic lobbyist. ``And we think it's a new pool of
money.'' But the number of female donors is growing slowly. A study
last year found that 23 percent of contributors to congressional
campaigns in 1996 were women, up slightly from 17 percent in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   FIRST THE MONEY, THEN THE REWARD
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, campaigning to become majority
whip if Democrats win control of the House, said she's raised more
than $1 million to help Democratic candidates win seats this
November. That puts Pelosi well ahead of her closest rival for the
No. 3 leadership post in the House, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland,
who has raised $460,000 for Democratic candidates. The Democrats
must take six more seats to regain control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   BEING BLACK AND A REPUBLICAN
</P>
<P>
   Joan Johnson, who jumped into the race for Rick Lazio's Long
Island House seat when he decided to challenge Hillary Clinton for
the Senate, is insulted when people ask why she's a Republican.
``This is a question that's never asked of a white person. It says
to me that in America, the majority race thinks that blacks are
assigned to one party, and that's an insult,'' she says. ``Because
people can get off the boat from China, Vietnam or any place and be
anything they want to be. But if I'm black in America, I'm supposed
to be a Democrat.'' So why, then? ``Because I believe that many of
the principles of the Republican Party empower our people.''
Johnson, 66, is town clerk of Islip.
</P>
<P>
   DIFFERENT KIND OF VACATION FUN
</P>
<P>
   School's out, so Chelsea Clinton made her debut on the campaign
trail with her mother, New York Senate candidate Hillary Clinton,
and said she expects to be on the stump ``on and off'' this summer.
``You'll be seeing some of me,'' said the 20-year-old Stanford
student outside New York City Hall. Her mother said it is entirely
Chelsea's choice how big a role she takes. At this point, it's
unclear whether she'll make speeches.
</P>
<P>
   CHILDREN, NOT CORPORATE WELFARE
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Nader made his first appearance as the Green Party's
presidential nominee surrounded by children at a Los Angeles
housing project, where he blasted the two major party candidates
for ignoring the growth in child poverty amid the booming economy.
Nader said greater spending on education, a higher minimum wage and
expanded child care are needed to combat child poverty. He accused
politicians of failing to use the benefits of a growing economy to
invest in programs for children, spending it instead on ``corporate
welfare'' such as corporate tax cuts and subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   WEARING THE FOREIGN POLICY HAT
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore told Iraqi opposition leaders in a Washington meeting
that Saddam Hussein stands in the way of Middle East peace and
``must be removed from power.'' Gore was showcasing his foreign
policy responsibilities as vice president to representatives of
forces trying to topple the Iraqi president _ experience his
campaign says makes him better prepared to be president than George
W. Bush. Immediately afterward, Gore shifted gears for talks and an
official dinner with Armenian President Robert Kocharyan.
</P>
<P>
   THIRD PARTIES SIGNING UP IN ILLINOIS
</P>
<P>
   Third-party presidential hopefuls Pat Buchanan and Ralph Nader
filed petitions for a spot on the Illinois ballot. Buchanan, who
hopes to win the Reform Party nod, filed his petition personally.
He said he had collected more than 67,000 signatures from
supporters; only 25,000 were needed. The Green Party filed
petitions to place consumer activist Nader on the ballot, and the
Libertarian Party filed to reserve a spot for its yet-to-be
determined nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ALL DEPENDS ON THE AUDIENCE
</P>
<P>
   To help the Democrats pick up one of the six seats they need to
regain control of the House, Denver Mayor Wellington Webb sent out
a fund-raising letter on behalf of Colorado businessman Ken Toltz,
the Democrat challenging Republican Rep. Thomas Tancredo. But
Webb's letter, which characterized Tancredo as ``a right-wing
extremist'' and said ``this race could decide the majority in
Congress,'' has been turned against Toltz. Tancredo mailed the same
letter to Republican loyalists and raised $50,000 with it.

 (For release Thursday, June 29)  
(EDS: Since Sunday, June 4, and continuing for six weeks, The New
York Times has been publishing a series of articles, ``How Race Is
Lived in America.'' The series is the outcome of a yearlong effort
by a team of Times reporters to capture some of the voices of
ordinary people and some of the troubling issues that Americans
continue to face. These stories, two or three each week, will be
approximately 6,000 words. The News Service will move each story in
advance, and an abridged version will also move, at approximately
3,000 words. They will move in the ``a'' news category and will
carry a slug of the form BC-RACE-SLUG-NYT. Because the articles are

   AKRON, Ohio _ Swept up in the rhythmic chaos of New York, Carl
Chancellor and Bob Dyer would have surely been spotted as tourists
that bright May weekend in 1994. There they were, snapping pictures
at the Statue of Liberty, savoring Jamaican food at a trendy
restaurant, clinking beer bottles and wine glasses in heady toasts
back at their hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But more than simply tourists, they were colleagues out on the
town celebrating. In the long months that had led them to New York,
Chancellor and Dyer had been part of a team of reporters for the
Akron Beacon Journal that had explored the racial attitudes of this
city of 215,000 people. The series earned the paper journalism's
big award, the Pulitzer Prize. The two had gone to New York to
bring the medal home.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Akron, there were Champagne showers and congratulatory
speeches for a staff that had united behind the series and gloried
in having been a healing force in the city, organizing and
promoting projects to bring the races together. The Beacon Journal
also tried to lead by example. Shortly after the series ended, it
introduced a new lineup of columnists reflecting ``the perfect
demographic,'' as Dyer put it. They included a black woman and a
white woman as well as Chancellor, who is black, and Dyer, who is
white.
</P>
<P>
   The Beacon Journal, it seemed, had become a proud model of
racial enlightenment, and the men were at the top of their careers.
Which made it all the more startling when te jubilation began to
fade.
</P>
<P>
   The two columnists came to be viewed almost as counterpoints on
race, starting with some explosive columns that divided many of
their colleagues and angered readers. In an especially polarizing
episode last year, the columnists fell out over a single word _
niggardly.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor, 47, was stopped cold by a news broadcast on which
someone was defending a white District of Columbia official who had
come under fire for using the word niggardly in a budget meeting
with a black colleague.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor felt his temperature rising when the white face on
the television screen seemed to suggest that any black person who
took offense at the word obviously didn't know what it meant. He
pounded out a column telling readers that he understood why the
debate over niggardly was generating national attention.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that white people toss the word around too freely,
knowing it means stingy but also knowing that it reminds blacks of
a far more hurtful word.
</P>
<P>
   ``The use of the word niggardly was calculated,'' he wrote. ``It
was a sophomoric, smart-alecky and cowardly way to deliver an
insult through the back door.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dyer could not swallow what his friend had written. In a
rebuttal in the paper's Sunday magazine, Dyer wrote: ``To defend
the firing of a man who used a word that somebody misunderstood is
to defend ignorance,'' noting that niggardly had an origin
different from that of the word it was being compared with.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor and Dyer had gotten to know each other fairly well
over the 15 years they had worked together. Before there were lawns
to tend and children to raise, they would meet after work on the
basketball court, maybe share a beer.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor will not go so far as to say that he and Dyer were
ever friends. ``I guess we tried to stay away from some of the
harder subjects or the more politically controversial subjects,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that unspoken agreement was fractured by the ``niggardly''
debate; at the height of it the men were barely speaking. And the
rift extended beyond them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the buzz was all around the newsroom that he was
writing it,'' Chancellor said of Dyer, ``and people would come by
patting him on the back, massaging him, kind of reading over his
shoulder and cheering him on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black folks in the newsroom were upset, and so they called
me at home and told me: `Oh, you should see what is going on here,
everybody is cheering Bob Dyer on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Before the newspaper published Dyer's response, the editors
allowed Chancellor to read it and write a rebuttal to the rebuttal
published the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I say that I'm offended by the word `niggardly' being used
in my presence, my objection may make no sense to you, but I have a
right to those feelings,'' Chancellor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, for example, you are standing on my toes,'' he continued,
``it is completely up to me to determine if my foot is hurting and
to what extent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beacon Journal's editor, Janet C. Leach, who is white, now
says it was a mistake to let the columnists slug it out in print.
Even so, she stands by her decision to let Chancellor throw the
last punch. ``Bob was attacking Carl's opinion,'' Leach said, ``so
Carl was allowed to defend his opinion. Although no more of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The columnists have since called a truce. ``We were both hot at
each other a little bit,'' Chancellor said, ``but then it blew
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the men occasionally wonder whether confronting racially
sensitive issues has hurt their careers. And many among the 157
people on the news staff _ 15 percent of whom are black and 4
percent other minorities _ say that although the city's racial
climate may have improved because of the series, seven years later,
the newspaper itself has shown little progress.
</P>
<P>
   A few reporters who worked on the series still socialize, and
some editors say it made them more attuned to potentially offensive
articles, photographs and headlines.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the staff seems resigned to the notion that
though blacks and whites may act polite toward one another, they
are still divided by mistrust and misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   This is the place that just a few years ago seemed overcome with
race religion. Troubled by the state of race relations, the Beacon
Journal had gone further than most newspapers to investigate the
gap between blacks and whites and to understand why it had not
closed. It found mistrust and misperceptions, frustrations and
tensions; it even looked inward, discovering much the same in its
own newsroom. It had found, it seemed, a way to talk about race.
And yet even here, in a place where men and women make a living
seeking answers to questions and using words well, communication
can break down. And race still seeps back in.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A RACE REPORT CARD
</P>
<P>
   When Chancellor and Dyer think of the race series, ``A Question
of Color,'' they recall more than career-enhancing accolades. They
remember the months they sat behind a one-way mirror and listened
to panels of citizens talk about race. White women admitted that
they still crossed the street to avoid black men. Black fathers
said they still did not want their daughters marrying white boys.
When blacks and whites were thrown together, they mostly smiled
politely and talked about the need to get along.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor and Dyer shaped those conversations into front-page
articles that introduced the race series in February 1993 with what
the paper described in a note to its readers as ``a separate, but
equal, focus on our differences.'' Dyer's article appeared under
the word ``Whites'' in bold letters and Chancellor's under the word
``Blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   In producing the project, the paper eventually committed more
than two-dozen reporters, photographers, graphics artists and
editors to a yearlong series of articles _ 30 in all _ that would
hold race up to the light and look at it from every angle, through
personal relations to housing, education, economics and crime
throughout the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   But the newspaper not only looked at race in its own back yard;
it also examined itself. For the final article, Dyer wrote about
race relations among his co-workers and their perceptions of how
race affected the paper's crime coverage. The article revealed that
the journalists who had written Akron's racial ``report card'' were
as confused and divided by race as the people whose words and
images they had filtered into print.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all get along, but there are racists in the
newsroom,'' a white journalist was quoted as saying. ``I'm talking
about people at parties who have a little too much to drink and
suddenly start talking about `niggers.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Dyer, reporting on his colleagues made the race story almost
personal. ``I always thought, even well before that series, that
people in the newsroom considered themselves enlightened, which was
sort of debunked when we did the focus group,'' he said recently.
``You know, we were like any other part of society. We didn't have
a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   A TYPICAL NEWSROOM
</P>
<P>
   The Beacon Journal newsroom hardly seems like a place where race
would be an issue. Even when there is conflict, Chancellor said,
``the real divisions in the newsroom aren't always race-based.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As a small newsroom, I think a lot of it is petty jealousy,
just individual personality conflicts,'' Chancellor said. ``And I
guess it's the daily stress of working on deadline and people
blowing up at each other because it's just the nature of the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Months can pass without Chancellor or Dyer writing about race.
The subject is not often on the table when editors decide what will
go on the front page. Nor is it a daily topic when co-workers meet
over vending-machine coffee in the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   In one respect, the Beacon Journal, which is owned by Knight
Ridder, is even in the forefront of racial progress. Its publisher,
John L. Dotson Jr., is black, and was part of a pioneering
generation of black journalists who covered the Detrit race riots
of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   And as in most newsrooms, the paper's editors struggle earnestly
with questions of racial sensitivity. For instance, they debated
whether they would publish a photograph of a black man washing a
white man's feet during a church service, fearinf it would be
suggestive of black servitude. (The editors decided they would not
use such a picture and instead published one of a white man washing
a black man's feet.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in this environment, race still slips back into the
room. It is there when reporters and editors, keeping score,
immediately notice the color of a new employee's skin. It is there
when a mid-level black editor perceives her demotion as
racially-motivated. It is there when a white reporter wonders
whether political correctness instead of news judgment elevated one
obituary, that of a black civil rights leader in Akron, to the
front page and relegated another, that of a white internationally
known plastics-industry inventor, to the cover of the local news
section.
</P>
<P>
   And it was there one day when the editor, Leach, picked up an
anonymous memo that had landed on her desk. ``It made me sick,''
she said. The note criticized her hiring of a black journalist,
calling the person incompetent, an affirmative action mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Ask almost anyone on the Beacon Journal staff about the
seemingly contradictory images of the place and they will say that
the newsroom culture simply reflects the fragility of racial
harmony in all segments of society.
</P>
<P>
   A COLUMN MAKES WAVES
</P>
<P>
   Once, Dyer was pulled over on a dark highway after edging in and
out of his lane while trying to pass a truck. It struck him, he
said, that he had experienced something comparable to racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I resented the fact that I was, you know, sort of randomly
pulled over for no good reason,'' Dyer said. ``I mean, it's not as
if people like me never encounter situations where you go, `What
the hell is going on?'''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, at a restaurant with his family in 1990, Dyer
thought the service was terrible. When a black family a few tables
away got the same treatment, he said, he wondered whether they
would attribute it to discrimination and wrote a column about
seeing race where it may not be.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that bigotry is a figment of the imagination, Dyer
wrote. But, he added: ``This white guy keeps getting hammered, too,
day after day after day. So don't take it personally. There's
plenty of rudeness and incompetence to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of his readers and colleagues, though, that column was
unremarkable compared to one he wrote in two parts in 1995 during
Black History Month. He said it generated more response than
anything he had written in more than 20 years. One call came from
the publisher, who summoned Dyer to explain what he meant when he
wrote this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you some black history: For the past 15 years, a
race that accounts for only 12 percent of this country's population
has caused more than half its problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The column went on to say that ``guilt-ridden white people have
turned us all into contortionists, looking for new ways to twist
the truth to make blacks look better.'' It described Afrocentrism
as ``the scholarly equivalent of flying saucers.''
</P>
<P>
   Explosive words, to be sure, but Dyer says he was misread. The
column, he said, was meant to be an uncensored expression of an
internal debate with his conscience. It was meant to show the
conflicted feelings that many whites have about blacks but are
loath to openly express in a time of political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he had exaggerated some points for the sake of argument.
But Dyer was certain that even his critics would give him credit
for asking, ``If things are so equal, care to trade places with an
African American?'' His well-meaning conscience also got the last
say, reminding him that ``things won't improve unless you pay more
attention to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his intentions, his words drew little sympathy from
some colleagues. ``Bob is a racist without even knowing it,'' said
Yuvonne Bruce, a black assistant features editor, who worked on the
race series.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer, who says he gets along with many of his black colleagues,
contends that white people risk being slapped with ugly labels when
they speak honestly about race.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor says Dyer is not a racist, just naive about the
pervasiveness and pain of bigotry. How could Bob Dyer know? Unlike
Chancellor, he has never had trouble trying to interview fans at
Cleveland Indians baseball games because stadium security thought
his media credentials might be fake. He has never known the anger
that boils up in black men who feel under siege.
</P>
<P>
   IMAGE PROBLEMS
</P>
<P>
   As different as they are, there is also a sameness between
Chancellor and Dyer. Both live in upper-middle-class suburban
neighborhoods and say they are pleased that their children have a
more racially diverse group of friends than they do.
</P>
<P>
   But Chancellor says he knows the double standards. A white man
is confident, a black man is cocky. A white man has taste, a black
man is flashy. And a white columnist can never write too white,
Chancellor says, but if you are black, you learn quickly that your
subjects and your sources had better not be too black too often.
</P>
<P>
   So he found white people on welfare to write about. And if he
found a reason to write about somebody who just happened to be
black, he said, ``I went overboard to not mention his race or
downplay it because I was afraid that the readers would miss my
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the newsroom suggest that his self-restraint did
not go far enough for some editors. Last fall, Chancellor lost his
column and was reassigned to a general news beat. He found himself
covering Ground Hog Day.
</P>
<P>
   The paper's editor, Leach, said the reassignment had nothing to
do with Chancellor's writing about race but rather with his
productivity. She said he had been asked to do more reporting for
his columns and contribute news articles as well. When he declined,
the column was discontinued, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor confirms Leach's account of what happened but has
gone back and forth in his mind about whether the newspaper's
demands were meant to force him to give up the column. Many of his
black colleagues are far less willing to give the management the
benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   They say Chancellor was no less productive than any other
columnist and that the editors were simply punishing him for some
of his views, a charge the editors deny. ``I think that management
did not like Carl's style,'' said Melanie Payne, a black feature
writer.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce, the black assistant features editor, said she was shocked
when she opened her newspaper and discovered that the column was
gone. ``I felt strongly that we were losing a strong black voice.''
</P>
<P>
   In protest, she circulated a petition among only the black staff
members in support of Chancellor. Charlene Nevada, a white editor
on the metro desk, said she is not sure whether she would have
signed it or not, but said, ``It would have been nice to be
asked.''
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, Dotson, is no stranger to the complexities of
race relations in the workplace. His decades of experience taught
him to keep his thoughts and feelings closely guarded to protect
himself from all sorts of attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So when asked recently about race relations at The Beacon
Journal, he was initially stone-faced and defensive, wondering
aloud about how much he should say. When he finally did respond
open up, what he revealed was not so much about the newsroom as
about the pressures on a black executive in a largely white
industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came along,'' Dotson said, ``I would get up in the
morning and I would put on this armor and go to work.'' Today it is
still his first line of defense, the steely gaze, the tight smile,
the terse response. He slips into that posture as easily as he does
his crisp white shirts and banker-blue suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It protects me against all of the assaults that I think I
undergo,'' Dotson said. ``They are not racial all the time. Some of
it is racial. Mostly it is not revealing my inner thoughts because
I don't want to make a misstep.''
</P>
<P>
   His caution may be one reason staff members have different
readings of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of funny how a lot of people in the
newsroom, white people in the newsroom, think he bends over
backwards to appease and please the black community and black
reporters in the newsroom,'' Chancellor said of Dotson. ``When I
think if you polled the black people in the newsroom, they'd
probably think that it's the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   LOSING HOPE
</P>
<P>
   For now, Chancellor has made peace with his lower-profile role
at The Beacon Journal. Though still a general assignment reporter,
he has worked on in-depth projects that he cares about and that
Leach says she enthusiastically supports.
</P>
<P>
   He and Dyer say there are no hard feelings lingering between
them and that they have grown to respect each other's honesty. The
men even talk about someday getting back to the basketball court.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Dyer's black colleagues still do not speak to him. And
though he still writes a Sunday magazine column, he questions
whether his views have denied him other opportunities at the Beacon
Journal, and whether it would be easier to get ahead if he were not
a white male.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor says he knows about being misunderstood. It is a
burden he believes he and Dyer share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the general newsroom perception might be that I'm
pretty militant and I'm the angry black man, or something like
that,'' he said, dismissing the notion with a roll of the eyes.
``Name-calling is something I'm used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyer takes it harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fewer people would think I was racist if I kept my mouth
shut,'' he said. Though tempted to do just that he will not.
Remaining silent would mean he had lost all hope of seeing race
relations improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a race problem,'' he said, ``it is my problem,
too.''

THE UNINSURED AND THE SURPLUS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, and Governor George
W. Bush are busy hatching plans to spend a projected surplus, which
may not exist in 10 years, on long-term programs that will generate
short-term political gain. In this time of prosperity, they ought
to focus instead on solutions to a limited number of major problems
and make sure there is money to pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   One ought to be the long-festering problem of providing health
insurance coverage for all Americans. More than 44 million (16.3
percent of the population) are uninsured, according to 1998 Census
Bureau figures, the latest available. Massachusetts has a 10.3
percent rate, but, unlike many other states, it makes a special
effort to place the uninsured into government health programs.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Gore nor Bush makes mention of their plight in their
campaigns, even though Bush's home state, Texas, has the highest
percentage of the uninsured, 24.5 percent. Hispanic-Americans and
young people are helping to fuel an economic boom there, yet they
are disportionately without health insurance. Gore's home state,
Tennesee, has a 13 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, both parties are eagerly anticipating massive
budget surpluses during the next decade. The Republicans would use
them for huge tax cuts. Clinton and Gore would safeguard Social
Security and Medicare and add a significant drug benefit for the
elderly. Covering the uninsured ought to be on the agenda as well.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Representative Pete Stark of California and
Republican Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, tried to
start a bipartisan dialogue last year on the uninsured. ``We think
Congress should create a new refundable tax credit to enable all
Americans to buy decent health coverage,'' they wrote. Nothing has
come of their plan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and the Republicans are treating the surpluses as though
they were set in stone. They may be far less than now projected,
and it would be unwise to make the financing of new or old programs
depend solely on future budget windfalls.
</P>
<P>
   When Stark and Armey wrote their article a year ago, the Census
Bureau reported that 43 million were uninsured. The latest figure _
44.3 million _ shows that prosperity is not enough by itself to
guarantee that all Americans will be protected against the
financial consequences of illness.

BEIJING BOOMERANG? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During her visit to Beijing last week, Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright and her Chinese interlocutors said US-China
relations are finally recovering from the deep chill that followed
the inadvertent American bombing of the Chinese embassy in
Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   To foster this spirit of renewed amiability, the two sides
highlighted their exchanges about the recent groundbreaking summit
between the leaders of North and South Korea. What the officials
did not emphasize was a crucial source of discord _ China's
persisting proliferation of missile know-how and missile components
to Pakistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   This is a very serious matter, threatening not only relations
between the United States and China but also geopolitical stability
in a large part of the world. Paradoxically, continued Chinese
peddling of missiles to Iran and Pakistan is almost certain to have
a boomerang effect against China.
</P>
<P>
   The more India feels forced into an arms race with Pakistan in
nuclear weapons and missile delivery systems, the more pressure
there will be on China to divert great sums to modernize and
enlarge China's nuclear arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Beijing's feckless supplying of guidance systems for
Iranian missiles and China's help for the Iranians in their missile
test flights only stoke the fears of American defense specialists
who are considering the need for an antimissile defense against
ballistic missiles from rogue states.
</P>
<P>
   If one day it becomes technologically feasible, an American
missile shield would nullify completely China's small deterrent
force of some two dozen ICBMs. Also, an American missile defense
might protect Taiwan against the missiles Beijing has assembled
across the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   Until this week, Senator Fred Thompson had been holding up the
Senate's debate on Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China by
linking it to a China Nonproliferation Act he had introduced.
Wisely, Republican leaders in the Senate delinked the two by
promising to debate Thompson's sanctions bill as ``free-standing''
legislation during the week of July 10.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson has good reason to seek a means of compelling China to
cease transferring missiles and missile technology to Iran and
Pakistan. But Thompson's effort to legislate sanctions against
Chinese companies and China's government is not the right
prescription _ at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese leaders are much more likely to respond to arguments and
threats that affect China's national security. They do not want
Taiwan to have certain advanced weapons; they do not want India,
their regional rival, to gain a qualitative edge over China in
military technology; and they certainly do not want to see Japan
become a military giant again, much less a nuclear power.
</P>
<P>
   US officials have been journeying to Beijing to make the US case
against China's export of missile technology and components to Iran
and Pakistan. For now, this is the proper way to dissuade the
Chinese rulers. They should be made to understand that the security
they are threatening is their own.

ATT TO OPEN NETWORKS TO ONLINE PROVIDERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A planned November ballot question that would require
``open access'' to high-speed cable Internet access in
Massachusetts _ and was expected to trigger a $10 million
advertising blitz _ was dropped Tuesday after open access
proponents reached a compromise with AT&AMP;T, the measure's leading
foe.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T earlier this month took over MediaOne Group to become the
state's dominant provider of high-speed residential Internet access
over cable systems. Tuesday it agreed in principle to open up its
Bay State networks to providers such as America OnLine and
Shore.Net by mid-2002.
</P>
<P>
   In return, a group of open access proponents headed by Boston
Net venture capitalist J. Christopher Grace agreed to abandon their
proposed November initiative petition mandating open access across
the state, which had been expected to ignite an epic summerlong
TV-ad war between AOL, AT&AMP;T, and other deep-pocketed Net giants.
</P>
<P>
   What impact the deal has on Massachusetts Internet users will
depend on whether AT&AMP;T can actually come to terms with Net
providers such as Shore.Net, HarvardNet, AOL and MindSpring to let
those service providers resell access to their portals over
$40-a-month high-speed cable connections now affiliated with
RoadRunner.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal works out as promised, the more than 130,000 Bay
State homeowners who now have RoadRunner service from AT&AMP;T/MediaOne
would be able to sign up with another ISP _ and get access to its
array of services _ while still enjoying the 1.5-megabit-per-second
download speeds of cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very gratified that these agreements have been worked
out,'' said Grace. ``Our mission has been accomplished without the
need to proceed all the way to the ballot box.''
</P>
<P>
   Open access advocates had portrayed their cause as an effort to
ensure AT&AMP;T does not use its control over high-speed access to
dominate what users can see on the World Wide Web, and to allow
ISPs the same access to the publicly sanctioned cable monopolies as
phone companies get to Bell Atlantic lines.
</P>
<P>
   But AT&AMP;T and some sympathetic state and federal regulators said
a government mandate for open access, rather than freely negotiated
deals in the marketplace, would chill investment in cable franchise
upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's past business dealings with AOL, to which he sold a
small company in 1996, and ownership of AOL stock had exposed him
to charges he was carrying water in the ballot fight for AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Facing potentially huge defections among its 20 million mostly
dial-up customers to cable and DSL services up to 50 times faster,
AOL had been clamoring for access to cable modem services. But then
in January AOL announced a $175 billion bid to take over Time
Warner _ meaning it would own those cable modem services and have
to share with rivals.
</P>
<P>
   AOL never formally endorsed the Massachusetts ballot question,
but was widely seen in the industry as losing its heart for the
battle once it made its move on Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, what looked last year like an accelerating bandwagon
for ``open access'' laws and local ordinances has stalled,
especially after last week's ruling by a federal appeals court
overturning a Portland, Oregon, bylaw requiring open access.
</P>
<P>
   Four Massachusetts communities that tried this spring to impose
open access requirements as a condition of transferring MediaOne
franchises to AT&AMP;T were rebuffed by the state Department of
Telecommunications and Energy, which said they had no legal
authority to do so.
</P>
<P>
   And Federal Communications Commission chairman William E.
Kennard has repeatedly expressed skepticism over whether open
access laws are necessary or would do more good than harm.
</P>
<P>
   Under a memorandum of agreement signed by Grace and AT&AMP;T general
counsel James W. Cicconi, AT&AMP;T agreed to begin technical trials of
open access in one to three Bay State communities by November 2001
and implement an ISP choice policy in its franchises with Net
service by July 2002.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has already agreed to conduct similar trials in Colorado to
investigate how easily it can configure its systems to allow access
to 5 or 10 or more internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T spokesman Richard D. Jenkinson said officials there
concluded that rather than pouring millions of dollars into TV and
newspaper ads opposing the ballot question, ``These dollars would
be better spent upgrading and facilitating the rollout of broadband
services. We wanted to get this off the table and move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkinson said the agreement ``is very clear that we will not
discriminate'' against non-AT&AMP;T-affiliated Net service providers in
offering them wholesale access through AT&AMP;T cable systems to
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   But he acknowledged that ``the devil's in the details no matter
which way you go'' in terms of AT&AMP;T actually reaching deals with
ISPs to use its broadband Net systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that consumers will have this choice a lot
faster than if we had had the government telling us what to do,''
Jenkinson said _ or if open access had been mandated by a ballot
question that surely would have faced years of litigation.
</P>
<P>
   US Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massaachusetts Democrat
and ranking member on the House telecommunications subcommittee,
praised Grace and his coalition for achieving ``the best voluntary
open access agreement to date anywhere in the country.'' Markey
called open access key to opening ``all telecommunications markets
to competition, innovation and customer choice.''
</P>
<P>
   When its pending acquisition of Cablevision franchises in
Boston, Brookline, Framingham and 36 other suburbs is complete,
AT&AMP;T will control cable franchises in 212 of the 351 Bay State
cities and towns, although currently fewer than two-thirds of those
offer high-speed Net access. AT&AMP;T has 155,000 RoadRunner customers
in Massachusetts and southern New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Grace's group also reached an open access commitment with Time
Warner, which swapped most of its Massachusetts franchises to
MediaOne two years ago but still has franchises in 5 Massachusetts
communities that are slated to get RoadRunner service.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T had had an agreement in principle to take over Charter
Communications' 53 Worcester-area franchises as part of a swap of
US franchises. But some industry analysts think that deal is dead
because AT&AMP;T did not want to give up MediaOne franchises in Los
Angeles to get the Worcester County franchises.
</P>
<P>
   The only other major cable provider in the state is Adelphia
Communications, which has franchises in 36 cities and towns, four
of which it has outfitted so far for cable modem service with about
a dozen more coming on line this year.

EVEN TEXTBOOKS DON'T GET GENOME DESCRIPTION RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Confused about the exact meaning behind this week's reports on
the human genome project? Don't bother consulting a biology
textbook to clear things up. It won't help.
</P>
<P>
   According to a new study of 10 widely-used current high school
biology textbooks, not a single one of them is acceptable overall.
``At their best, the textbooks are a collection of missed
opportunities,'' according to Jo Ellen Roseman, director of the
study, which was carried out for the nonprofit American Association
for the Advancement of Science, publishers of the journal Science.
</P>
<P>
   The textbooks are so bad, the study's authors say, that the best
advice they can offer to schools faced with a decision about buying
new biology books is this: Don't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our advice to school districts if they're about to buy biology
books is not to,'' said George Nelson, director of the AAAS's
``Project 2061'' aimed at fostering better science and math
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead, spend the money on professional development,'' Nelson
said, to help teachers supplement existing textbooks and add
activities that will help students understand fundamental concepts
such as natural selection and how a cell works. The books uniformly
fail to do this, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They present the content in a disconnected way,'' Nelson said,
and they ``camouflage the important ideas with details and
trivia.'' It is as though, he said, a textbook on cars explained
details of carburetors, fuel injectors and universal joints,
instead of stressing that a car can provide transportation because
power is produced by the engine and conveyed to the wheels through
a transmission.
</P>
<P>
   The 24 educators and biologists who conducted the study spent an
average of 400 hours on each book, evaluating how they handled four
different areas of biology _ cell structure and function, matter
and energy transformations, the molecular basis of heredity, and
natural selection and evolution.
</P>
<P>
   Their evaluations were condensed into four sets of 19 scores for
each book, and a detailed analysis will be published in a few
months.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the books focus too much on the details and pay
scant attention to the overall concepts that unify these details
into an understandable picture, Roseman said.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of the books got any scores of ``excellent'' for any of
the 19 areas there were graded on. And of the 190 total grades
assigned to the 10 books, an overwhelming 167 _ or 88 percent _
were the lowest grade, ``poor'', equivalent to an F.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do pretty uniformly flunk,'' Roseman said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   One of the glaring failings of the books, Roseman and Nelson
said, was that they fail to consider recent research into students'
ideas and misconceptions about biology, or about how learning works
most effectively.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in discussing evolution, one book says that a
species ``has become adapted,'' without making clear that
adaptation has nothing to do with individual animals adapting to
their environments; rather, the species adapts over many
generations. Biologists have understood that for well over a
century, but students commonly misunderstand the concept.
</P>
<P>
   The report suggests that the failings of the books have nothing
to do with the much-publicized political wrangling in some states
over the teaching of evolution. In fact, of the four areas of
biology that were analyzed, it was ``evolution and natural
selection'' in which the textbooks actually achieved their best
scores.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Bowden, chief of the office for science and math programs
for Baltimore public schools, said the new study points out
``significant flaws'' in the available textbooks, despite years of
widespread attempts to promote better science education. ``I'm
frustrated that 15 years after the call for reform, we still don't
have acceptable materials,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Alberts, president of the National Academy of Sciences and
a cell biologist, commented that in today's society, ``every
citizen needs a basic understanding of the major concepts of
biology.'' But the new study shows, its authors say, that biology
textbooks are not conveying even enough information to allow
students to understand the key concepts in a newspaper story on
biology.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of things like the human genome project, we don't
think the books do a good job of enabling students to read the
newspaper, to participate in our society, or to understand how to
make good decisions,'' Roseman of the AAAS said.
</P>
<P>
   She said that good textbook writing involves an intensive
process of testing and rewriting to find out what really works,
such as trying out different analogies to see which ones help
clarify student understanding. ``Textbook companies really don't do
that kind of research and development,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can be very helpful to publishers,'' she added,
``if they'll listen.''

 By FENELLA SAUNDERS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Trying to find something on the Internet is a lot like rummaging
through countless cardboard boxes in a dark attic. Even if the
search is eventually successful, it almost always turns up too much
junk. Worse, no search is ever comprehensive.
 &HT;    The dark attic of the Internet is only infiltrated as far as the
very limited capabilities of a particular search engine. Yahoo's
directory, for example, is merely an index of selected sites
cataloged by anonymous editors.
 &HT;    Other popular indexers, such as Excite, Lycos and Alta Vista,
send spindly bits of software known as spiders meandering from Web
site to Web site, sucking up bits of text from each page they
encounter and making a list of the keywords they find. This patchy
list _ not the Web itself _ is what a search engine actually
searches.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, search engines are having a tough time keeping
up with the exponential growth of the Net, which already boasts
more than 5 million Web sites and about 1.5 billion total pages of
information.
 &HT;    Experts estimate that the amount of information on the Net is
expanding by 2 million pages a day and that the best search engines
cover no more than 16 percent of those pages, down sharply from 34
percent in 1997. Spiders take months to finish one incomplete sweep
of the Web, during which time tens of millions of pages have
appeared, changed or disappeared.
 &HT;    So is it hopeless? Some Web engineers are trying to compensate
by developing swifter, more efficient spiders. Others look for ways
to transform the very nature of the search process by making it
more human.
 &HT;    Fast Search and Transfer (FAST), a new company with headquarters
in Oslo, Norway, has created spiders on steroids. FAST's programs
can index 80 million pages a day _ twice as many as spiders
dispatched by conventional search engines _ and may be able to
index all of the Web by early next year.
 &HT;    Instead of collecting data from spiders in one big list of
keywords the way other search sites do, FAST divides the
information into several hundred more manageable chunks and scans
all of them simultaneously, performing more than 600 searches per
second.
 &HT;    But brute force doesn't make the job of sorting through all that
information any easier. Marc Krellenstein, chief technology officer
of Northern Light in Cambridge, Mass., believes finesse is
ultimately more important than strength. His spiders do not have
the sheer muscle of FAST, and he could care less.
 &HT;    ``It may only be a quarter or a third of the Web that we've
indexed, but it's a better part of it in terms of its quality,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Northern Light classifies Web pages according to various
criteria, including a custom list of 25,000 subject areas. A team
of real, live human librarians spot-checks the classifications.
When someone does a search, the engine organizes the results into
folders, each with a subject title.
 &HT;    Both FAST and Northern Light still depend primarily on random
searches by dumb spiders, so the next step is to give spiders the
ability to recognize connections between different Web sites.
 &HT;    Reka Albert, Albert-Lazlo Barabasi and Hawoong Jeong of Notre
Dame are studying how the so-called six-degrees-of-separation
phenomenon relates to the Internet. In the 1960s, Yale social
psychologist Stanley Milgram observed that two complete strangers
are likely to be connected by a network of six or fewer
acquaintances.
 &HT;    The Notre Dame researchers have proven that the Internet is a
small world too. They did a statistical analysis of hyperlink
connections and discovered that the average number of clicks needed
to get between two randomly chosen pages on the World Wide Web is
19. Even if the Web expands to 10 times its present size, that
average will only increase to 21 clicks.
 &HT;    The upshot is that people could quickly reach any page on the
Web if only they knew the right place to start and how to navigate.
Spiders programmed to recognize degrees-of-separation patterns
might be an answer.
 &HT;    ``If something goes in intelligently and can see what links it
is following, it doesn't have to index everything,'' Albert says.
 &HT;    Such clever spiders are already in the works. Sridhar
Rajagopalan and his colleagues at IBM's Almaden Research Center in
San Jose have designed a prototype search engine called CLEVER,
which uses spiders endowed with a dose of humanlike intelligence.
They seek out hubs _ mini-index sites with a large collection of
hyperlinks on a single subject _ and authorities _ pages that a
large number of other Web sites put on their lists of hyperlinks.
 &HT;    CLEVER scores each page based on the quality of the pages it
points to and the quality of those that point to it, which in turn
affects the scores of all those linked pages.
 &HT;    By repeating this circular process, the search engine quickly
locates the best hubs and authorities. Instead of relying on the
judgment of editors at index sites such as Yahoo or America Online,
CLEVER gathers the opinions of those who really matter _ the
millions of people who have created Web pages and added links to
their favorite sites.
 &HT;    Rajagopalan considers that an advance over the current Web
chaos. ``We're giving people access to the collective wisdom of the
Web,'' he says.
 &HT;    A group led by Bernardo Huberman and Lada Adamic of the Internet
Ecologies Group at Xerox PARC is pursuing a related approach using
data from Google, one of the most sophisticated of the current
search engines.
 &HT;    Natalie Glance of Xerox Research Center Europe in Meylan,
France, hopes to add to the collective wisdom by fostering more of
a sense of personal connection on-line.
 &HT;    ``There are possibly millions of people doing the same search as
you, so how can we bring in the power of the community to help?''
Her answer: a software program that acts as a community search
assistant by cataloging queries made by many people looking for the
same kind of information.
 &HT;    For example, a generic search for digital cameras might generate
a list of cameras other people are considering and pinpoint the
popular models.
 &HT;    Glance has also created an automated process, called Knowledge
Pump, which would make it possible for people to submit comments
about Web sites and receive recommendations based on past
preferences.
 &HT;    One surefire way to foster more community spirit is to make the
search process less forbidding. That advance means doing away with
endless, incomprehensible lists of text.
 &HT;    WebTheme, a cybergraphics program developed by Jim Thomas and
his colleagues at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in
Richland, Wash., displays search results as a glowing galaxy, in
which each point of light represents an individual Web page and
star clusters denote related topics. WebTheme can also represent
data as a topographical map on which peaks show the largest
subjects.
 &HT;    Some Web visionaries imagine a day when intelligent spiders will
weave together connections between related bits of the Web,
creating threads that become something meaningful in themselves _ a
cybertapestry. When many people weigh in on a topic, a process
called group filtering occurs, which yields predictions that tend
to be extremely accurate.
 &HT;    Robert Lucky, an electrical engineer and corporate vice
president of Telcordia Technologies in Morristown, N.J., compares
the phenomenon to the national point spread in football pools,
which often produce uncannily accurate predictions of game scores.
 &HT;    ``Somehow, this process of everybody contributing a guess
settles out to something that is statistically accurate,'' he says.
 &HT;    Lucky is confident a similar process will make searching the
Internet more fruitful.
 &HT;    ``A lot of information in the world isn't stuff written down in
books; it's nuances in people's heads. If you put them all
together, you can form something better than any individual
opinion. As they say, nobody is as smart as everybody.''

 UNDER T.REX'S TOES  
 &HT;    Stephen Hasiotis was clambering around near Lake Powell, Utah,
in 1996 when he spied striking white structures jutting out of the
purple clay.
 &HT;    In the years since, he and his colleague Robert Wellner have
uncovered 100 more of the formations and identified them as
fossilized burrows dug by some of our mammalian ancestors 150
million years ago.
 &HT;    Back then, mammals had to compete against much larger dinosaurs.
 &HT;    ``If you were on the ground, you could be eaten or squashed. The
trees probably weren't very safe either. So, our best bet was
probably in the ground,'' says Hasiotis, a biogeologist at Indiana
State University.
 &HT;    The burrows have complex forms similar to today's mammal
hideouts. Each has several openings, spiral ramps, and three or
four chambers that may have served as living room, pantry, birthing
room and bathroom.
 &HT;    Based on the burrows' shapes, Hasiotis suspects the animals
looked like prairie dogs but with longer tails and extended snouts
for hunting insects.
 &HT;    So far, the researchers haven't found any fossils of the mammals
themselves, but Hasiotis plans to hunt for them this summer. To
uncover bones or teeth, he'll use hydrochloric acid to dissolve the
calcium carbonate deposits that have filled the once-empty burrows.
 &HT;    Soon, he predicts, we'll be looking at the actual remains of the
timid diggers who eventually took over from the dinosaurs.
 &HT;    
 HOMO INTOXICATUS  
 &HT;    Getting sloshed on a Saturday night may seem a uniquely human
tradition, but not if physiologist Robert Dudley is to be believed.
 &HT;    Dudley, a biologist at the University of Texas at Austin, claims
the taste for alcohol runs deep in animal evolution and is shared
with our close primate relatives: chimps, gorillas, and orangutans,
which have a known weakness for overripe fruit.
 &HT;    Ripe or rotting rain-forest fruits contain alcohol
concentrations as high as 5 percent, Dudley says. The odor attracts
birds, bats, butterflies and elephants.
 &HT;    Chimps and gorillas _ from which our hominid ancestors split
between 5 million and 7 million years ago _ will roam for miles
through tangled trees and creepers in search of fermenting fruit.
Sugar and alcohol provide primates with precious calories, and the
fruit in turn spreads its seeds far and wide.
 &HT;    Genes for alcohol addiction may have persisted in the human line
for the same reason that those for fat accumulation have, according
to Dudley's theory.
 &HT;    Modest amounts of alcohol are known to decrease heart disease
risk and may lengthen life. Animals predisposed to a little nip
would be better survivors, more likely to pass their DNA to the
next generation. That genetic heritage may no longer be helpful now
that alcohol, like high-fat food, is available on every corner.
 &HT;    ``Alcoholism is not just another addiction,'' Dudley says. ``It
is a by-product of our ancestral nutritional physiology. Once we
better understand the mechanism, we'll have a better shot at a
cure.
 &HT;    -----
 FRESH-SQUEEZED  
 &HT;    The blandness of canned orange juice is an unfortunate side
effect of the high heat and chemical preservatives needed to
prevent food poisoning. Now microbiologist Martin Cole of Food
Science Australia and others have developed a way to kill germs
without killing flavor.
 &HT;    Cole applies pressures of up to 100,000 pounds per square inch
to wipe out disease-causing bacteria _ including E. coli,
Salmonella, and Listeria _ in fruits, juices, fish and other foods.
 &HT;    The smothering pressure ruptures the outer membranes of bacteria
and breaks apart crucial proteins. The process also unravels animal
proteins, making raw meat look pale and cooked.
 &HT;    ``But people are looking at using the process to extend the
shelf life of meats that are already cooked and sliced,'' Cole
says.
 &HT;    Because of their rigid walls, plant cells suffer little damage
under intense pressure. Fruits maintain their texture, shape, and
taste, and juices taste fresh-squeezed after compression.
 &HT;    Flow International, a manufacturer in Kent, Wash., is readying a
commercial version of the technology. Pressure-preserved strawberry
jam, now on sale in Japan, proves the gastronomic benefits.
 &HT;    ``When you eat the jam, it is just like eating fresh
strawberries,'' Cole says.
 &HT;    -----
 ROBOT WATCH: THE BUCKSHOT BRIGADE  
 &HT;    A group of robots now roaming the University of Minnesota campus
can come to the rescue nearly as fast as a speeding bullet.
 &HT;    Richard Voyles and his colleagues at the university devised two
miniature rovers that can be shot en masse out of grenade
launchers.
 &HT;    One of them, called a Scout, is a wheeled cylinder that rolls
along like a soda can but has a spring-loaded ``foot'' to fling it
up stairs or over small obstacles.
 &HT;    A second rover, the TerminatorBot, has arms that unfold so they
can drag the rover along or pick up objects _ ideal for exploring
loose wreckage for survivors after an earthquake, Voyles believes.

 POET OF THE PILL  
 &HT;    Working at Syntex, a private company in Mexico City, chemist
Carl Djerassi created norethindrone, a synthetic form of the
hormone progesterone, in 1951.
 &HT;    Soon after, norethindrone became an active ingredient in an oral
contraceptive _ famously known as ``the pill.''
 &HT;    In the 1980s, after years of biochemical research at Stanford
University, Djerassi switched gears and began writing about
scientific issues in fictional settings. He has published five
novels, including ``Cantor's Dilemma'' and ``Menachem's Seed.''
 &HT;    The first installment in a planned trilogy of plays, ``An
Immaculate Misconception,'' was broadcast on May 6 and 7 on the BBC
World Service and will soon be available on video from GlobalStage.
 &HT;    Josie Glausiusz talked to Djerassi about his dual life.
 &HT;     Q:  Why do you write fiction?
 &HT;     A:  I am trying to smuggle important scientific ideas out to
the general public. The vast majority of legislators haven't got
the foggiest idea about science or technology, and yet many of the
decisions they make are based on these things.
 &HT;     Q:  What are the key ideas in ``An Immaculate Misconception''?
 &HT;     A:  It deals with the ethical dilemmas we face as sex and
reproduction become increasingly separate. With in vitro
fertilization you can analyze the embryo and screen for all kinds
of diseases _ such as Down's syndrome or sickle-cell anemia _
before you put it back into the woman. But this is an expensive
procedure, and the only people who can afford it are affluent
people in affluent countries. We're creating another gulf between
the haves and the have-nots.
 &HT;     Q:  What will be the impact of a split between sex and
reproduction?
 &HT;     A:  It will change the power relationship between men and
women. Sexual reproduction was overwhelmingly in favor of the man,
who ran the show. But this reduces a man to what he really is: the
donor of a single sperm. That sperm a woman can now get without
sexual intercourse.
 &HT;     Q:  How will contraception change in the new century?
 &HT;     A:  I think that practically nothing will happen. I am
extremely dubious that we will have a male pill in the next 10 or
20 years, because the pharmaceutical industry is not interested. A
contraceptive vaccine is of least interest because there is no
money in it. The better such a vaccine is, the fewer times you use
it.
 &HT;     Q:  What about mifepristone (RU-486), the abortion pill now
available in some European countries?
 &HT;     A:  Scientifically it's one of the few, perhaps the only, real
major advances beyond the pill. Right now, nearly 50 million women
in the world have an abortion each year, and I think it behooves us
to give women various choices as to how to have an abortion, just
as we give people choices on what kind of contraception to use.
 &HT;     Q:  What is your greatest love?
 &HT;     A:  Curiosity. That's probably what keeps me young and active,
always wanting to get into new areas. That's why I want to become a
playwright. There aren't too many people who start writing plays at
age 75.

 &HT;    Justice Department files suit to halt Sprint-WorldCom deal
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - A reinvigorated U.S. Justice Department has taken up
Sherman's antitrust march to the scene of a mega-merger again, this
time moving to thwart WorldCom's $129 billion purchase of Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   Flush from its legal victory over Microsoft, the department
filed suit Tuesday to block the WorldCom merger, arguing that the
massive deal combining the two companies would undercut efforts to
spur competition, especially in long-distance service and transport
of Internet data.
</P>
<P>
   ``If WorldCom were allowed to acquire Sprint, large and small
businesses and millions of individual consumers would have to pay
higher prices and accept lower service quality and less
innovation,'' said Assistant Attorney General Joel Klein.
</P>
<P>
   The department is wielding powers provided by the 1890 Sherman
Act, named for Ohio Sen. John Sherman, younger brother of the Civil
War general who burned Atlanta. The law is meant to protect
consumers and companies alike by blocking corporate domination of
markets and is not often invoked, said Benjamin Wolff, a specialist
in telecommunications law and a partner in the Portland, Ore.,
office of Davis Wright Tremaine. ``Justice is looking at reduced
competition in the market place, the effect of the merger. The
number of times you see them actually raise an issue is
infinitesimal.''
</P>
<P>
   Within moments of the Justice Department suit, WorldCom withdrew
its merger filing with the European Commission. A revised filing is
possible, but the commission's antitrust chief said that ``only
under exceptional circumstances'' could the companies modify plans
to make the merger acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts expect the apparent collapse of the deal to mean
that someone _ presumably more acceptable to regulators _ will make
a bid for Sprint. The failed deal also raises the specter of a
big-ticket bid for WorldCom. Among ambitious outsiders with cash to
spare are Deutsche Telekom, France Telecom and Japan's NTT.
</P>
<P>
   But many eyes also turned to BellSouth, the Atlanta-based
regional telecom company that in October offered $100 billion in an
eleventh-hour effort to buy Sprint. While falling short, the bid
proved BellSouth's willingness to gamble and its desire to grow.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then. BellSouth looks a bit different now.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the company has announced creation of a tracking
stock that will value its surging Latin American investments.
BellSouth also announced plans to deliver digital television via
satellite throughout the Southeast. Most tellingly, BellSouth's
nascent joint venture with SBC Communications will create a nearly
national wireless company, virtually eliminating the need to bid
for Sprint's wireless unit.
</P>
<P>
   Still, BellSouth could be interested in some other pieces of
Sprint.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Sprint's long-distance business would give
BellSouth _ or any company _ instant muscle in the national market.
But BellSouth is not expected to have federal approval to offer
long-distance for months, so such a deal could be stymied by
regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Sprint is also a sizeable carrier of high-speed data, the
Internet ``backbone'' that is considered crucial to competing
globally _ and something that BellSouth lacks. Sprint too has
national presence as a provider of telecom services, while
BellSouth is a regional player.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the industry has been moving toward a world of much
bigger companies that offer a range of services to clients around
the world. The regulatory roadblock to WorldCom-Sprint probably
does not mean an end to the trend _ only a signal that regulators
will accept only so much concentration of market power in any
market.
</P>
<P>
   Together, WorldCom _ which previously swallowed MCI _ and Sprint
have about 27 percent of the residential long-distance market. That
is half of AT&AMP;T's share, but it would mean the market would have
just two big competitors. And WorldCom and Sprint have greater than
30 percent of international long-distance.
</P>
<P>
   The picture is in some ways more imposing in Internet backbone
service, where WorldCom leads with 37 percent of the market and
Sprint is second with 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In the four years since passage of the Telecommunications Act,
federal regulators have permitted a string of ever-larger mergers.
No large combination had been rejected, although a few _ like an
AT&AMP;T-SBC Communications marriage _ have been headed off when they
were still under discussion. Yet regulators have grown increasingly
willing to set conditions and restrictions, but had shown no sign
of just where the line of unacceptability lay _ until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We finally got an answer to the question, how big is too
big?'' said Jeffrey Kagan, Atlanta-based telecom analyst. ``Long
term there will be several global telecom supercarriers who are
going to be measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars. Short
term however is apparently a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   And short-term, the name Sherman can still bring some heat to
bear..

 By FENELLA SAUNDERS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Trying to find something on the Internet is a lot like rummaging
through countless cardboard boxes in a dark attic. Even if the
search is eventually successful, it almost always turns up too much
junk. Worse, no search is ever comprehensive.
 &HT;    The dark attic of the Internet is only infiltrated as far as the
very limited capabilities of a particular search engine. Yahoo's
directory, for example, is merely an index of selected sites
cataloged by anonymous editors.
 &HT;    Other popular indexers, such as Excite, Lycos and Alta Vista,
send spindly bits of software known as spiders meandering from Web
site to Web site, sucking up bits of text from each page they
encounter and making a list of the keywords they find. This patchy
list _ not the Web itself _ is what a search engine actually
searches.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, search engines are having a tough time keeping
up with the exponential growth of the Net, which already boasts
more than 5 million Web sites and about 1.5 billion total pages of
information.
 &HT;    Experts estimate that the amount of information on the Net is
expanding by 2 million pages a day and that the best search engines
cover no more than 16 percent of those pages, down sharply from 34
percent in 1997. Spiders take months to finish one incomplete sweep
of the Web, during which time tens of millions of pages have
appeared, changed or disappeared.
 &HT;    So is it hopeless? Some Web engineers are trying to compensate
by developing swifter, more efficient spiders. Others look for ways
to transform the very nature of the search process by making it
more human.
 &HT;    Fast Search and Transfer (FAST), a new company with headquarters
in Oslo, Norway, has created spiders on steroids. FAST's programs
can index 80 million pages a day _ twice as many as spiders
dispatched by conventional search engines _ and may be able to
index all of the Web by early next year.
 &HT;    Instead of collecting data from spiders in one big list of
keywords the way other search sites do, FAST divides the
information into several hundred more manageable chunks and scans
all of them simultaneously, performing more than 600 searches per
second.
 &HT;    But brute force doesn't make the job of sorting through all that
information any easier. Marc Krellenstein, chief technology officer
of Northern Light in Cambridge, Mass., believes finesse is
ultimately more important than strength. His spiders do not have
the sheer muscle of FAST, and he could care less.
 &HT;    ``It may only be a quarter or a third of the Web that we've
indexed, but it's a better part of it in terms of its quality,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Northern Light classifies Web pages according to various
criteria, including a custom list of 25,000 subject areas. A team
of real, live human librarians spot-checks the classifications.
When someone does a search, the engine organizes the results into
folders, each with a subject title.
 &HT;    Both FAST and Northern Light still depend primarily on random
searches by dumb spiders, so the next step is to give spiders the
ability to recognize connections between different Web sites.
 &HT;    Reka Albert, Albert-Lazlo Barabasi and Hawoong Jeong of Notre
Dame are studying how the so-called six-degrees-of-separation
phenomenon relates to the Internet. In the 1960s, Yale social
psychologist Stanley Milgram observed that two complete strangers
are likely to be connected by a network of six or fewer
acquaintances.
 &HT;    The Notre Dame researchers have proven that the Internet is a
small world too. They did a statistical analysis of hyperlink
connections and discovered that the average number of clicks needed
to get between two randomly chosen pages on the World Wide Web is
19. Even if the Web expands to 10 times its present size, that
average will only increase to 21 clicks.
 &HT;    The upshot is that people could quickly reach any page on the
Web if only they knew the right place to start and how to navigate.
Spiders programmed to recognize degrees-of-separation patterns
might be an answer.
 &HT;    ``If something goes in intelligently and can see what links it
is following, it doesn't have to index everything,'' Albert says.
 &HT;    Such clever spiders are already in the works. Sridhar
Rajagopalan and his colleagues at IBM's Almaden Research Center in
San Jose have designed a prototype search engine called CLEVER,
which uses spiders endowed with a dose of humanlike intelligence.
They seek out hubs _ mini-index sites with a large collection of
hyperlinks on a single subject _ and authorities _ pages that a
large number of other Web sites put on their lists of hyperlinks.
 &HT;    CLEVER scores each page based on the quality of the pages it
points to and the quality of those that point to it, which in turn
affects the scores of all those linked pages.
 &HT;    By repeating this circular process, the search engine quickly
locates the best hubs and authorities. Instead of relying on the
judgment of editors at index sites such as Yahoo or America Online,
CLEVER gathers the opinions of those who really matter _ the
millions of people who have created Web pages and added links to
their favorite sites.
 &HT;    Rajagopalan considers that an advance over the current Web
chaos. ``We're giving people access to the collective wisdom of the
Web,'' he says.
 &HT;    A group led by Bernardo Huberman and Lada Adamic of the Internet
Ecologies Group at Xerox PARC is pursuing a related approach using
data from Google, one of the most sophisticated of the current
search engines.
 &HT;    Natalie Glance of Xerox Research Center Europe in Meylan,
France, hopes to add to the collective wisdom by fostering more of
a sense of personal connection on-line.
 &HT;    ``There are possibly millions of people doing the same search as
you, so how can we bring in the power of the community to help?''
Her answer: a software program that acts as a community search
assistant by cataloging queries made by many people looking for the
same kind of information.
 &HT;    For example, a generic search for digital cameras might generate
a list of cameras other people are considering and pinpoint the
popular models.
 &HT;    Glance has also created an automated process, called Knowledge
Pump, which would make it possible for people to submit comments
about Web sites and receive recommendations based on past
preferences.
 &HT;    One surefire way to foster more community spirit is to make the
search process less forbidding. That advance means doing away with
endless, incomprehensible lists of text.
 &HT;    WebTheme, a cybergraphics program developed by Jim Thomas and
his colleagues at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in
Richland, Wash., displays search results as a glowing galaxy, in
which each point of light represents an individual Web page and
star clusters denote related topics. WebTheme can also represent
data as a topographical map on which peaks show the largest
subjects.
 &HT;    Some Web visionaries imagine a day when intelligent spiders will
weave together connections between related bits of the Web,
creating threads that become something meaningful in themselves _ a
cybertapestry. When many people weigh in on a topic, a process
called group filtering occurs, which yields predictions that tend
to be extremely accurate.
 &HT;    Robert Lucky, an electrical engineer and corporate vice
president of Telcordia Technologies in Morristown, N.J., compares
the phenomenon to the national point spread in football pools,
which often produce uncannily accurate predictions of game scores.
 &HT;    ``Somehow, this process of everybody contributing a guess
settles out to something that is statistically accurate,'' he says.
 &HT;    Lucky is confident a similar process will make searching the
Internet more fruitful.
 &HT;    ``A lot of information in the world isn't stuff written down in
books; it's nuances in people's heads. If you put them all
together, you can form something better than any individual
opinion. As they say, nobody is as smart as everybody.''

 &HT;    
 UNDER T.REX'S TOES  
 &HT;    Stephen Hasiotis was clambering around near Lake Powell, Utah,
in 1996 when he spied striking white structures jutting out of the
purple clay.
 &HT;    In the years since, he and his colleague Robert Wellner have
uncovered 100 more of the formations and identified them as
fossilized burrows dug by some of our mammalian ancestors 150
million years ago.
 &HT;    Back then, mammals had to compete against much larger dinosaurs.
 &HT;    ``If you were on the ground, you could be eaten or squashed. The
trees probably weren't very safe either. So, our best bet was
probably in the ground,'' says Hasiotis, a biogeologist at Indiana
State University.
 &HT;    The burrows have complex forms similar to today's mammal
hideouts. Each has several openings, spiral ramps, and three or
four chambers that may have served as living room, pantry, birthing
room and bathroom.
 &HT;    Based on the burrows' shapes, Hasiotis suspects the animals
looked like prairie dogs but with longer tails and extended snouts
for hunting insects.
 &HT;    So far, the researchers haven't found any fossils of the mammals
themselves, but Hasiotis plans to hunt for them this summer. To
uncover bones or teeth, he'll use hydrochloric acid to dissolve the
calcium carbonate deposits that have filled the once-empty burrows.
 &HT;    Soon, he predicts, we'll be looking at the actual remains of the
timid diggers who eventually took over from the dinosaurs.
 &HT;    
 HOMO INTOXICATUS  
 &HT;    Getting sloshed on a Saturday night may seem a uniquely human
tradition, but not if physiologist Robert Dudley is to be believed.
 &HT;    Dudley, a biologist at the University of Texas at Austin, claims
the taste for alcohol runs deep in animal evolution and is shared
with our close primate relatives: chimps, gorillas, and orangutans,
which have a known weakness for overripe fruit.
 &HT;    Ripe or rotting rain-forest fruits contain alcohol
concentrations as high as 5 percent, Dudley says. The odor attracts
birds, bats, butterflies and elephants.
 &HT;    Chimps and gorillas _ from which our hominid ancestors split
between 5 million and 7 million years ago _ will roam for miles
through tangled trees and creepers in search of fermenting fruit.
Sugar and alcohol provide primates with precious calories, and the
fruit in turn spreads its seeds far and wide.
 &HT;    Genes for alcohol addiction may have persisted in the human line
for the same reason that those for fat accumulation have, according
to Dudley's theory.
 &HT;    Modest amounts of alcohol are known to decrease heart disease
risk and may lengthen life. Animals predisposed to a little nip
would be better survivors, more likely to pass their DNA to the
next generation. That genetic heritage may no longer be helpful now
that alcohol, like high-fat food, is available on every corner.
 &HT;    ``Alcoholism is not just another addiction,'' Dudley says. ``It
is a by-product of our ancestral nutritional physiology. Once we
better understand the mechanism, we'll have a better shot at a
cure.
 &HT;    -----
 FRESH-SQUEEZED  
 &HT;    The blandness of canned orange juice is an unfortunate side
effect of the high heat and chemical preservatives needed to
prevent food poisoning. Now microbiologist Martin Cole of Food
Science Australia and others have developed a way to kill germs
without killing flavor.
 &HT;    Cole applies pressures of up to 100,000 pounds per square inch
to wipe out disease-causing bacteria _ including E. coli,
Salmonella, and Listeria _ in fruits, juices, fish and other foods.
 &HT;    The smothering pressure ruptures the outer membranes of bacteria
and breaks apart crucial proteins. The process also unravels animal
proteins, making raw meat look pale and cooked.
 &HT;    ``But people are looking at using the process to extend the
shelf life of meats that are already cooked and sliced,'' Cole
says.
 &HT;    Because of their rigid walls, plant cells suffer little damage
under intense pressure. Fruits maintain their texture, shape, and
taste, and juices taste fresh-squeezed after compression.
 &HT;    Flow International, a manufacturer in Kent, Wash., is readying a
commercial version of the technology. Pressure-preserved strawberry
jam, now on sale in Japan, proves the gastronomic benefits.
 &HT;    ``When you eat the jam, it is just like eating fresh
strawberries,'' Cole says.
 &HT;    -----
 ROBOT WATCH: THE BUCKSHOT BRIGADE  
 &HT;    A group of robots now roaming the University of Minnesota campus
can come to the rescue nearly as fast as a speeding bullet.
 &HT;    Richard Voyles and his colleagues at the university devised two
miniature rovers that can be shot en masse out of grenade
launchers.
 &HT;    One of them, called a Scout, is a wheeled cylinder that rolls
along like a soda can but has a spring-loaded ``foot'' to fling it
up stairs or over small obstacles.
 &HT;    A second rover, the TerminatorBot, has arms that unfold so they
can drag the rover along or pick up objects _ ideal for exploring
loose wreckage for survivors after an earthquake, Voyles believes.
 &HT;    -----
 POET OF THE PILL  
 &HT;    Working at Syntex, a private company in Mexico City, chemist
Carl Djerassi created norethindrone, a synthetic form of the
hormone progesterone, in 1951.
 &HT;    Soon after, norethindrone became an active ingredient in an oral
contraceptive _ famously known as ``the pill.''
 &HT;    In the 1980s, after years of biochemical research at Stanford
University, Djerassi switched gears and began writing about
scientific issues in fictional settings. He has published five
novels, including ``Cantor's Dilemma'' and ``Menachem's Seed.''
 &HT;    The first installment in a planned trilogy of plays, ``An
Immaculate Misconception,'' was broadcast on May 6 and 7 on the BBC
World Service and will soon be available on video from GlobalStage.
 &HT;    Josie Glausiusz talked to Djerassi about his dual life.
 &HT;     Q:  Why do you write fiction?
 &HT;     A:  I am trying to smuggle important scientific ideas out to
the general public. The vast majority of legislators haven't got
the foggiest idea about science or technology, and yet many of the
decisions they make are based on these things.
 &HT;     Q:  What are the key ideas in ``An Immaculate Misconception''?
 &HT;     A:  It deals with the ethical dilemmas we face as sex and
reproduction become increasingly separate. With in vitro
fertilization you can analyze the embryo and screen for all kinds
of diseases _ such as Down's syndrome or sickle-cell anemia _
before you put it back into the woman. But this is an expensive
procedure, and the only people who can afford it are affluent
people in affluent countries. We're creating another gulf between
the haves and the have-nots.
 &HT;     Q:  What will be the impact of a split between sex and
reproduction?
 &HT;     A:  It will change the power relationship between men and
women. Sexual reproduction was overwhelmingly in favor of the man,
who ran the show. But this reduces a man to what he really is: the
donor of a single sperm. That sperm a woman can now get without
sexual intercourse.
 &HT;     Q:  How will contraception change in the new century?
 &HT;     A:  I think that practically nothing will happen. I am
extremely dubious that we will have a male pill in the next 10 or
20 years, because the pharmaceutical industry is not interested. A
contraceptive vaccine is of least interest because there is no
money in it. The better such a vaccine is, the fewer times you use
it.
 &HT;     Q:  What about mifepristone (RU-486), the abortion pill now
available in some European countries?
 &HT;     A:  Scientifically it's one of the few, perhaps the only, real
major advances beyond the pill. Right now, nearly 50 million women
in the world have an abortion each year, and I think it behooves us
to give women various choices as to how to have an abortion, just
as we give people choices on what kind of contraception to use.
 &HT;     Q:  What is your greatest love?
 &HT;     A:  Curiosity. That's probably what keeps me young and active,
always wanting to get into new areas. That's why I want to become a
playwright. There aren't too many people who start writing plays at
age 75.

 By FENELLA SAUNDERS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Trying to find something on the Internet is a lot like rummaging
through countless cardboard boxes in a dark attic. Even if the
search is eventually successful, it almost always turns up too much
junk. Worse, no search is ever comprehensive.
 &HT;    The dark attic of the Internet is only infiltrated as far as the
very limited capabilities of a particular search engine. Yahoo's
directory, for example, is merely an index of selected sites
cataloged by anonymous editors.
 &HT;    Other popular indexers, such as Excite, Lycos and Alta Vista,
send spindly bits of software known as spiders meandering from Web
site to Web site, sucking up bits of text from each page they
encounter and making a list of the keywords they find. This patchy
list _ not the Web itself _ is what a search engine actually
searches.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, search engines are having a tough time keeping
up with the exponential growth of the Net, which already boasts
more than 5 million Web sites and about 1.5 billion total pages of
information.
 &HT;    Experts estimate that the amount of information on the Net is
expanding by 2 million pages a day and that the best search engines
cover no more than 16 percent of those pages, down sharply from 34
percent in 1997. Spiders take months to finish one incomplete sweep
of the Web, during which time tens of millions of pages have
appeared, changed or disappeared.
 &HT;    So is it hopeless? Some Web engineers are trying to compensate
by developing swifter, more efficient spiders. Others look for ways
to transform the very nature of the search process by making it
more human.
 &HT;    Fast Search and Transfer (FAST), a new company with headquarters
in Oslo, Norway, has created spiders on steroids. FAST's programs
can index 80 million pages a day _ twice as many as spiders
dispatched by conventional search engines _ and may be able to
index all of the Web by early next year.
 &HT;    Instead of collecting data from spiders in one big list of
keywords the way other search sites do, FAST divides the
information into several hundred more manageable chunks and scans
all of them simultaneously, performing more than 600 searches per
second.
 &HT;    But brute force doesn't make the job of sorting through all that
information any easier. Marc Krellenstein, chief technology officer
of Northern Light in Cambridge, Mass., believes finesse is
ultimately more important than strength. His spiders do not have
the sheer muscle of FAST, and he could care less.
 &HT;    ``It may only be a quarter or a third of the Web that we've
indexed, but it's a better part of it in terms of its quality,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Northern Light classifies Web pages according to various
criteria, including a custom list of 25,000 subject areas. A team
of real, live human librarians spot-checks the classifications.
When someone does a search, the engine organizes the results into
folders, each with a subject title.
 &HT;    Both FAST and Northern Light still depend primarily on random
searches by dumb spiders, so the next step is to give spiders the
ability to recognize connections between different Web sites.
 &HT;    Reka Albert, Albert-Lazlo Barabasi and Hawoong Jeong of Notre
Dame are studying how the so-called six-degrees-of-separation
phenomenon relates to the Internet. In the 1960s, Yale social
psychologist Stanley Milgram observed that two complete strangers
are likely to be connected by a network of six or fewer
acquaintances.
 &HT;    The Notre Dame researchers have proven that the Internet is a
small world too. They did a statistical analysis of hyperlink
connections and discovered that the average number of clicks needed
to get between two randomly chosen pages on the World Wide Web is
19. Even if the Web expands to 10 times its present size, that
average will only increase to 21 clicks.
 &HT;    The upshot is that people could quickly reach any page on the
Web if only they knew the right place to start and how to navigate.
Spiders programmed to recognize degrees-of-separation patterns
might be an answer.
 &HT;    ``If something goes in intelligently and can see what links it
is following, it doesn't have to index everything,'' Albert says.
 &HT;    Such clever spiders are already in the works. Sridhar
Rajagopalan and his colleagues at IBM's Almaden Research Center in
San Jose have designed a prototype search engine called CLEVER,
which uses spiders endowed with a dose of humanlike intelligence.
They seek out hubs _ mini-index sites with a large collection of
hyperlinks on a single subject _ and authorities _ pages that a
large number of other Web sites put on their lists of hyperlinks.
 &HT;    CLEVER scores each page based on the quality of the pages it
points to and the quality of those that point to it, which in turn
affects the scores of all those linked pages.
 &HT;    By repeating this circular process, the search engine quickly
locates the best hubs and authorities. Instead of relying on the
judgment of editors at index sites such as Yahoo or America Online,
CLEVER gathers the opinions of those who really matter _ the
millions of people who have created Web pages and added links to
their favorite sites.
 &HT;    Rajagopalan considers that an advance over the current Web
chaos. ``We're giving people access to the collective wisdom of the
Web,'' he says.
 &HT;    A group led by Bernardo Huberman and Lada Adamic of the Internet
Ecologies Group at Xerox PARC is pursuing a related approach using
data from Google, one of the most sophisticated of the current
search engines.
 &HT;    Natalie Glance of Xerox Research Center Europe in Meylan,
France, hopes to add to the collective wisdom by fostering more of
a sense of personal connection on-line.
 &HT;    ``There are possibly millions of people doing the same search as
you, so how can we bring in the power of the community to help?''
Her answer: a software program that acts as a community search
assistant by cataloging queries made by many people looking for the
same kind of information.
 &HT;    For example, a generic search for digital cameras might generate
a list of cameras other people are considering and pinpoint the
popular models.
 &HT;    Glance has also created an automated process, called Knowledge
Pump, which would make it possible for people to submit comments
about Web sites and receive recommendations based on past
preferences.
 &HT;    One surefire way to foster more community spirit is to make the
search process less forbidding. That advance means doing away with
endless, incomprehensible lists of text.
 &HT;    WebTheme, a cybergraphics program developed by Jim Thomas and
his colleagues at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in
Richland, Wash., displays search results as a glowing galaxy, in
which each point of light represents an individual Web page and
star clusters denote related topics. WebTheme can also represent
data as a topographical map on which peaks show the largest
subjects.
 &HT;    Some Web visionaries imagine a day when intelligent spiders will
weave together connections between related bits of the Web,
creating threads that become something meaningful in themselves _ a
cybertapestry. When many people weigh in on a topic, a process
called group filtering occurs, which yields predictions that tend
to be extremely accurate.
 &HT;    Robert Lucky, an electrical engineer and corporate vice
president of Telcordia Technologies in Morristown, N.J., compares
the phenomenon to the national point spread in football pools,
which often produce uncannily accurate predictions of game scores.
 &HT;    ``Somehow, this process of everybody contributing a guess
settles out to something that is statistically accurate,'' he says.
 &HT;    Lucky is confident a similar process will make searching the
Internet more fruitful.
 &HT;    ``A lot of information in the world isn't stuff written down in
books; it's nuances in people's heads. If you put them all
together, you can form something better than any individual
opinion. As they say, nobody is as smart as everybody.''

 By THE EDITORS OF DISCOVER MAGAZINE 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 UNDER T.REX'S TOES  
 &HT;    Stephen Hasiotis was clambering around near Lake Powell, Utah,
in 1996 when he spied striking white structures jutting out of the
purple clay.
 &HT;    In the years since, he and his colleague Robert Wellner have
uncovered 100 more of the formations and identified them as
fossilized burrows dug by some of our mammalian ancestors 150
million years ago.
 &HT;    Back then, mammals had to compete against much larger dinosaurs.
 &HT;    ``If you were on the ground, you could be eaten or squashed. The
trees probably weren't very safe either. So, our best bet was
probably in the ground,'' says Hasiotis, a biogeologist at Indiana
State University.
 &HT;    The burrows have complex forms similar to today's mammal
hideouts. Each has several openings, spiral ramps, and three or
four chambers that may have served as living room, pantry, birthing
room and bathroom.
 &HT;    Based on the burrows' shapes, Hasiotis suspects the animals
looked like prairie dogs but with longer tails and extended snouts
for hunting insects.
 &HT;    So far, the researchers haven't found any fossils of the mammals
themselves, but Hasiotis plans to hunt for them this summer. To
uncover bones or teeth, he'll use hydrochloric acid to dissolve the
calcium carbonate deposits that have filled the once-empty burrows.
 &HT;    Soon, he predicts, we'll be looking at the actual remains of the
timid diggers who eventually took over from the dinosaurs.
 &HT;    
 HOMO INTOXICATUS  
 &HT;    Getting sloshed on a Saturday night may seem a uniquely human
tradition, but not if physiologist Robert Dudley is to be believed.
 &HT;    Dudley, a biologist at the University of Texas at Austin, claims
the taste for alcohol runs deep in animal evolution and is shared
with our close primate relatives: chimps, gorillas, and orangutans,
which have a known weakness for overripe fruit.
 &HT;    Ripe or rotting rain-forest fruits contain alcohol
concentrations as high as 5 percent, Dudley says. The odor attracts
birds, bats, butterflies and elephants.
 &HT;    Chimps and gorillas _ from which our hominid ancestors split
between 5 million and 7 million years ago _ will roam for miles
through tangled trees and creepers in search of fermenting fruit.
Sugar and alcohol provide primates with precious calories, and the
fruit in turn spreads its seeds far and wide.
 &HT;    Genes for alcohol addiction may have persisted in the human line
for the same reason that those for fat accumulation have, according
to Dudley's theory.
 &HT;    Modest amounts of alcohol are known to decrease heart disease
risk and may lengthen life. Animals predisposed to a little nip
would be better survivors, more likely to pass their DNA to the
next generation. That genetic heritage may no longer be helpful now
that alcohol, like high-fat food, is available on every corner.
 &HT;    ``Alcoholism is not just another addiction,'' Dudley says. ``It
is a by-product of our ancestral nutritional physiology. Once we
better understand the mechanism, we'll have a better shot at a
cure.
 &HT;    -----
 FRESH-SQUEEZED  
 &HT;    The blandness of canned orange juice is an unfortunate side
effect of the high heat and chemical preservatives needed to
prevent food poisoning. Now microbiologist Martin Cole of Food
Science Australia and others have developed a way to kill germs
without killing flavor.
 &HT;    Cole applies pressures of up to 100,000 pounds per square inch
to wipe out disease-causing bacteria _ including E. coli,
Salmonella, and Listeria _ in fruits, juices, fish and other foods.
 &HT;    The smothering pressure ruptures the outer membranes of bacteria
and breaks apart crucial proteins. The process also unravels animal
proteins, making raw meat look pale and cooked.
 &HT;    ``But people are looking at using the process to extend the
shelf life of meats that are already cooked and sliced,'' Cole
says.
 &HT;    Because of their rigid walls, plant cells suffer little damage
under intense pressure. Fruits maintain their texture, shape, and
taste, and juices taste fresh-squeezed after compression.
 &HT;    Flow International, a manufacturer in Kent, Wash., is readying a
commercial version of the technology. Pressure-preserved strawberry
jam, now on sale in Japan, proves the gastronomic benefits.
 &HT;    ``When you eat the jam, it is just like eating fresh
strawberries,'' Cole says.
 &HT;    -----
 ROBOT WATCH: THE BUCKSHOT BRIGADE  
 &HT;    A group of robots now roaming the University of Minnesota campus
can come to the rescue nearly as fast as a speeding bullet.
 &HT;    Richard Voyles and his colleagues at the university devised two
miniature rovers that can be shot en masse out of grenade
launchers.
 &HT;    One of them, called a Scout, is a wheeled cylinder that rolls
along like a soda can but has a spring-loaded ``foot'' to fling it
up stairs or over small obstacles.
 &HT;    A second rover, the TerminatorBot, has arms that unfold so they
can drag the rover along or pick up objects _ ideal for exploring
loose wreckage for survivors after an earthquake, Voyles believes.
 &HT;    -----
 POET OF THE PILL  
 &HT;    Working at Syntex, a private company in Mexico City, chemist
Carl Djerassi created norethindrone, a synthetic form of the
hormone progesterone, in 1951.
 &HT;    Soon after, norethindrone became an active ingredient in an oral
contraceptive _ famously known as ``the pill.''
 &HT;    In the 1980s, after years of biochemical research at Stanford
University, Djerassi switched gears and began writing about
scientific issues in fictional settings. He has published five
novels, including ``Cantor's Dilemma'' and ``Menachem's Seed.''
 &HT;    The first installment in a planned trilogy of plays, ``An
Immaculate Misconception,'' was broadcast on May 6 and 7 on the BBC
World Service and will soon be available on video from GlobalStage.
 &HT;    Josie Glausiusz talked to Djerassi about his dual life.
 &HT;     Q:  Why do you write fiction?
 &HT;     A:  I am trying to smuggle important scientific ideas out to
the general public. The vast majority of legislators haven't got
the foggiest idea about science or technology, and yet many of the
decisions they make are based on these things.
 &HT;     Q:  What are the key ideas in ``An Immaculate Misconception''?
 &HT;     A:  It deals with the ethical dilemmas we face as sex and
reproduction become increasingly separate. With in vitro
fertilization you can analyze the embryo and screen for all kinds
of diseases _ such as Down's syndrome or sickle-cell anemia _
before you put it back into the woman. But this is an expensive
procedure, and the only people who can afford it are affluent
people in affluent countries. We're creating another gulf between
the haves and the have-nots.
 &HT;     Q:  What will be the impact of a split between sex and
reproduction?
 &HT;     A:  It will change the power relationship between men and
women. Sexual reproduction was overwhelmingly in favor of the man,
who ran the show. But this reduces a man to what he really is: the
donor of a single sperm. That sperm a woman can now get without
sexual intercourse.
 &HT;     Q:  How will contraception change in the new century?
 &HT;     A:  I think that practically nothing will happen. I am
extremely dubious that we will have a male pill in the next 10 or
20 years, because the pharmaceutical industry is not interested. A
contraceptive vaccine is of least interest because there is no
money in it. The better such a vaccine is, the fewer times you use
it.
 &HT;     Q:  What about mifepristone (RU-486), the abortion pill now
available in some European countries?
 &HT;     A:  Scientifically it's one of the few, perhaps the only, real
major advances beyond the pill. Right now, nearly 50 million women
in the world have an abortion each year, and I think it behooves us
to give women various choices as to how to have an abortion, just
as we give people choices on what kind of contraception to use.
 &HT;     Q:  What is your greatest love?
 &HT;     A:  Curiosity. That's probably what keeps me young and active,
always wanting to get into new areas. That's why I want to become a
playwright. There aren't too many people who start writing plays at
age 75.

   AKRON, Ohio _ Swept up in the rhythmic chaos of New York, Carl
Chancellor and Bob Dyer would have surely been spotted as tourists
that bright May weekend in 1994. There they were, snapping pictures
at the Statue of Liberty, savoring Jamaican food at a trendy
restaurant, clinking beer bottles and wine glasses in heady toasts
back at their hotel.
</P>
<P>
   But more than simply tourists, they were colleagues out on the
town celebrating. In the long months that had led them to New York,
Chancellor and Dyer had been part of a team of reporters for The
Akron Beacon Journal that had explored the racial attitudes of this
city of 215,000 people. The series earned the paper journalism's
big award, the Pulitzer Prize. The two had gone to New York to
bring the medal home.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Akron, there were Champagne showers and congratulatory
speeches for a staff that had united behind the series and gloried
in having been a healing force in the city, organizing and
promoting projects to bring the races together. The Beacon Journal
also tried to lead by example. Shortly after the series ended, it
introduced a new lineup of columnists reflecting ``the perfect
demographic,'' as Dyer put it. They included a black woman and a
white woman as well as Chancellor, who is black, and Dyer, who is
white.
</P>
<P>
   The Beacon Journal, it seemed, had become a proud model of
racial enlightenment, and the men were at the top of their careers.
Which made it all the more startling when the jubilation began to
fade. _
</P>
<P>
   The two columnists came to be viewed almost as counterpoints on
race, starting with some explosive columns that divided many of
their colleagues and angered readers. In an especially polarizing
episode last year, the columnists fell out over a single word _
niggardly.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor, who is 47, had been sipping coffee in his living
room and channel surfing through the morning news shows when a
voice stopped him cold. Someone was defending a white District of
Columbia official who had come under fire for using the word
niggardly in a budget meeting with a black colleague. Chancellor
said he felt his temperature rising when the white face looking
back at him through the television screen suggested that any black
person who took offense at the word obviously didn't know what it
meant.
</P>
<P>
   When he reached the newsroom that morning, Chancellor was still
angry. So he pounded out a column telling readers that he
understood why the debate over niggardly was generating national
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Years earlier, he wrote, a Beacon Journal colleague had said
during a union meeting that management was being niggardly with
salary increases. Chancellor recalled thinking then that white
people toss the word around too freely, knowing it means stingy but
also knowing that it reminds blacks of a far more hurtful word.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both cases, the incident in D.C. and my personal
experience, the use of the word niggardly was calculated,'' he
wrote. ``It was a sophomoric, smart-alecky and cowardly way to
deliver an insult through the back door.''
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad topic for readers to chew on, Chancellor thought. One
of them was Dyer, and he could not swallow what his friend had
written.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reaction I had to this column was, like, `What?
You've got to be kidding,' and it was very widespread among people
of my color,''' said Dyer, 48. ``So part of me said, `Let's get
equal time here.'''
</P>
<P>
   He did, in a rebuttal in the paper's Sunday magazine. ``To
defend the firing of a man who used a word that somebody
misunderstood is to defend ignorance,'' Dyer wrote, noting that
niggardly had an origin different from that of the word it was
being compared with. ``Today, apparently, if you say `two plus two
equals four' and somebody among the oppressed masses sincerely
believes the answer is five, the person who said `four' is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyer hit the send key on his computer and called Chancellor to
let him know what was coming. He considered Chancellor a friend,
after all.
</P>
<P>
   As office relationships go, the men had gotten to know each
other fairly well over the 15 years they had worked together.
Before there were lawns to tend and children to raise, they would
meet after work on the basketball court, maybe share a beer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were covering baseball games and stuff, and just
during lulls, we might talk about our families and our dreams and
aspirations,'' Chancellor recalled. But he will not go so far as to
say that he and Dyer were ever friends. ``I guess we tried to stay
away from some of the harder subjects or the more politically
controversial subjects,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But that unspoken agreement was fractured by the ``niggardly''
debate; at the height of it the men were barely speaking. And the
rift extended beyond them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess the buzz was all around the newsroom that he was
writing it,'' Chancellor said of Dyer, ``and people would come by
patting him on the back, massaging him, kind of reading over his
shoulder and cheering him on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The black folks in the newsroom were upset, and so they called
me at home and told me: `Oh, you should see what is going on here,
everybody is cheering Bob Dyer on.'''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor was not about to let Dyer dismiss his point of view
in print. So before Dyer's response was published, Chancellor read
it and, in an unusual decision, his editors let him write a
rebuttal to the rebuttal and published it the same day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I have been taken to the woodshed not only by my
readers, who have called and written by the score, but also by some
of my colleagues,'' Chancellor wrote in the latest column.

<HEADLINE>
HOUSE OK'S US TRADE IN FOOD, MEDICINES, WITH CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders agreed Tuesday to allow
the sale of US-grown food and medicines to Cuba, signalling the
first substantial relaxing of 38-year-old sanctions against the
island nation's Communist government.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which was shepherded by House Speaker J. Dennis
Hastert, an Illinois Republican, represents a small opening in
practical terms, but it represented a historic moment in opening
US-Cuban business again.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal, which is set to be slipped into a conference
committee proceeding that would not allow for any debate or vote,
also included a setback for those favoring open relations: It
blocks future tourism to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   It would essentially make law the status quo: allowing cultural
and education exchanges, as well as restricted family-to-family
visits, but no other travel. That takes the matter out of the hands
of the Clinton administration, which had been widely expected to
loosen restrictions on tourism with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for opening up food and medicine sales didn't arise
so much from political factors, although the Elian Gonzalez custody
case appears over the last several months to have greatly hurt the
pro-sanctions Cuban-American lobby. Rather, the push came from
economic interests, namely farmers who want another market to sell
their wheat, soy, rice and powdered milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic development because it is the result of the
changing views toward Cuba, particularly of Midwestern
conservatives, who are now more interested in selling grain than in
beating Castro over the head,'' said Alfred Padula, professor
emeritus at the University of South Maine, who began analyzing
Cuban issues for the State Department in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise, which included imput from two Cuban-American
representatives from South Florida as well as farm-state lawmakers,
calls for cash-only sales and won't allow for US government credits
or American bank loans to subsidize the agriculture sales, which is
a common practice.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Ileana Ross-Lehtinen, a Miami Republican, said
the legislation would ``make it as difficult as possible'' for such
sales to take place.
</P>
<P>
   The provision also included a strong anti-sanctions message,
prohibiting the president from using food and medicine in future
embargoes without Congress' approval.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also could open sales to other countries with which the
US has imposed embargoes, including Iran, Libya, North Korea and
Sudan. One exemption would be Iraq, because the United Nations has
imposed the sanctions, with the US as the strongest backer.
</P>
<P>
   The use of food and medicine in sanctions has come under
increasing attack from US allies and United Nations leaders,
including Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has called repeatedly
this year for the use of ``smart sanctions'' rather than
broad-based ones. Such sanctions would target specific leaders,
rather than nations, imposing travel restrictions and freezing bank
accounts, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The White House reacted cautiously to the agreement, which is
now expected to be attached to the conference committee
deliberations on either the military-construction bill or the
agricultural appropriations legislation. Once those measures come
out of committee, the entire package will be considered in a
yes-or-no vote, with no amendments allowed. It then would go to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not opposed to allowing things like food and medicine
to go to Cuba as long as it is for the benefit for the people, not
the benefit of the Castro government,'' said White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart said if a provision is included to restrict the
president's ability to manage embargoes, ``those are concerns we
will have to try to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba favors lifting the food and medicine embargo because it
would help improve nutrition to many people and make available many
new prescription drugs, which are currently unavailable because
they are made by US companies.
</P>
<P>
   The food-and-medicine portion of the deal would generate only an
estimated $25 million to $45 million in the first year, said John
S. Kavulich II, president of the US-Cuba Trade and Economic
Council, which provides information on Cuba for American
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Cuba spent an estimated $750 million on bulk food
commodities, but almost all of that was done with foreign
government credit. Kavulich said that even though the US sales at
first may seem small, he projects the sale to grow over the years.
In any case, he said, the sales would have a major impact to some
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a family farmer in Iowa, now sells to Cuba, say, $800,000 a
year and that is an 8 percent increase of annual revenues to the
farmer, which nets a $1,000 extra in profit, well, that might be
the difference between sending a child to state college and a local
college,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Padula said that the symbolism of the deal is most
important, especially if the US Supreme Court releases Elian
Gonzalez to the custody of his father and the two return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means there could really be a double blow for the exiles,
and to a certain extent that means the diminishing of the power of
the Cuban exile community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the exiles' power still was apparent with the freezing of
the travel restrictions, said Representative James P. McGovern, a
Massachusetts Democrat who was angry after learning that the
measure may not come up for House debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are making some progress in food and medicine, it
seems to be going in the wrong direction when it comes to relaxing
travel restrictions,'' McGovern said. ``We need to be encouraging
more exchanges. More people-to-people dialogue is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony here is that these (Cuban-American representatives)
have the nerve to get up and talk on the floor and about democracy
and we don't have the right to practice democracy on the House
floor by allowing a vote on this.''

 AKRON, Ohio: latest column.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He did not mention him by name, but he knew Dyer would get the
message. ``If I say that I'm offended by the word `niggardly' being
used in my presence, my objection may make no sense to you, but I
have a right to those feelings,'' Chancellor wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, for example, you are standing on my toes,'' he continued,
``it is completely up to me to determine if my foot is hurting and
to what extent.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beacon Journal's editor, Janet C. Leach, who is white, now
says it was a mistake to let the columnists slug it out in print.
``I don't recall getting involved with this until Carl wrote his
rebuttal, and then I was like, `Oh, why are we even bothering our
readers with this?'''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, she stands by her decision to let Chancellor throw the
last punch. ``Bob was attacking Carl's opinion,'' Leach said, ``so
Carl was allowed to defend his opinion. Although no more of this.''
</P>
<P>
   The columnists have since called a truce. ``We were both hot at
each other a little bit,'' Chancellor said, ``but then it blew
over.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the men occasionally wonder whether confronting racially
sensitive issues has hurt their careers. And many among the 157
people on the news staff _ 15 percent of whom are black and 4
percent other minorities _ say that although the city's racial
climate may have improved because of the series, seven years later,
the newspaper itself has shown little progress.
</P>
<P>
   A few reporters who worked on the series still socialize, and
some editors say it made them more attuned to potentially offensive
articles, photographs and headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was made more aware of some of the stresses and strains that
affect black people and how what I might do or say could impact
that,'' said David Hertz, a white editor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some of the staff seems resigned to the notion that
though blacks and whites may act polite toward one another, they
are still divided by mistrust and misunderstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Bolden, the Beacon Journal's metro editor, who is white,
summed up the sentiment: ``I will never again say things are
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a place that just a few years ago was overcome with race
religion. Troubled by the state of race relations, the Beacon
Journal had gone further than most newspapers to investigate the
gap between blacks and whites and to understand why it had not
closed. It found mistrust and misperceptions, frustrations and
tensions; it even looked inward, discovering much the same in its
own newsroom. It had found, it seemed, a way to talk about race.
And yet even here, in a place where men and women make a living
seeking answers to questions and using words well, communication
can break down. And race still seeps back in.
</P>
<P>
   A RACE REPORT CARD
</P>
<P>
   Walk into the third-floor newsroom and it is obvious that the
race project, ``A Question of Color,'' remains a source of great
pride to the Beacon Journal, a scrappy member of the Knight Ridder
chain with a daily circulation of 140,000. Against a wall the
Pulitzer medallion, for public service _ the fourth Pulitzer in the
paper's 162-year history _ shines under a spotlight in a plexiglass
case surrounded by reproductions of the articles in the series.
</P>
<P>
   For Chancellor and Dyer, the work reflected in that display is a
reminder of more than the career-enhancing accolades and the
weekend in New York. They remember the months they sat behind a
one-way mirror and listened to panels of citizens talk about race.
White women admitted that they still crossed the street to avoid
black men. Black fathers said they still did not want their
daughters marrying white boys. When blacks and whites were thrown
together, they mostly smiled politely and talked about the need to
get along.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor and Dyer shaped those conversations into front-page
articles that introduced the race series in February 1993 with what
the paper described as ``a separate, but equal, focus on our
differences.'' Dyer's article appeared under the word ``Whites'' in
bold letters and Chancellor's under the word ``Blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to race, the Beacon Journal told readers, ``Whites
are tired of hearing about it. Blacks wish it would go away. All
seem powerless to move it.'' But what was behind the divide, the
paper asked, and why did it persist?
</P>
<P>
   Long before the newspaper sought the answers, those questions
had nagged at David Hertz. It was 1992 and there was unrest in Los
Angeles after the acquittal of four white police officers in the
roadside beating of Rodney King, a black motorist. What troubled
Hertz was that though many people had been disturbed by the
incident, blacks had reacted more angrily than whites, and not just
in Los Angeles but 2,000 miles away in Akron.
</P>
<P>
   So with his bosses' approval, Hertz, then an editor on the night
metro desk, gathered a group of colleagues, Chancellor among them,
to discuss how race factored into their work and private lives.
Hertz told how in middle school black kids had pushed him around
just for being white. A black reporter broke into tears recalling
the pain of realizing as a young girl that her skin color made her
different from a beloved white playmate.
</P>
<P>
   But where to go from there? ``It occurred to me that we needed
to do more than a reaction piece'' to the unrest in Los Angeles,
recalled Hertz, who is now the paper's business editor.
</P>
<P>
   His bosses agreed and conceived the race project, eventually
committing more than two dozen reporters, photographers, graphics
artists and editors to a yearlong series of articles _ 30 in all.
The goal was to hold race up to the light and look at it from every
angle, through personal relations to housing, education, economics
and crime throughout the metropolitan area. As the work proceeded,
however, and a troublesome picture of race relations emerged, the
editors decided on a more activist role for the paper.
</P>
<P>
   It helped create multiracial partnerships among local community
groups to foster unity and understanding. It also called on
individuals to get involved. And they did:
</P>
<P>
   More than 20,000 readers accepted a New Year's resolution
challenge made by the paper to commit to racial healing and allowed
their names to be published.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds joined in the first of annual ``Race/Walk for Unity.''
</P>
<P>
   Through ``town meetings'' on race, organized by the paper,
hundreds of others stepped out of the safety of their familiar
circles and spoke up. Some who had never shared so much as a cup of
tea or a beer with a person of another race even formed interracial
friendships.
</P>
<P>
   Churches began holding integrated services, which continue
today. Recently, in a joint service, black congregants from one
church and whites from another washed one another's feet in a
ceremony that drew from the Last Supper.

 AKRON, Ohio: Last Supper.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And the newspaper started ``The Coming Together Project,'' now a
nonprofit agency that coordinates racial-unity programs in and
around Akron, a recovering Rust Belt town that is 25 percent black.
This month, the Knight Foundation, which offers grants to
educational and cultural programs and which is not affiliated with
the newspaper chain, gave the project $350,000. The newspaper
itself has given $300,000 to the project over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The Beacon Journal's effort to engage the city and its suburbs
in a discussion of race was applauded by the Pulitzer judges, at
Columbia University, when they gave the newspaper the prize. And so
encouraging was the social progress attributed to the project that
the White House selected Akron as the setting for President
Clinton's first ``town hall meeting'' on race, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the newspaper not only looked at race in its own back yard;
it also examined itself. For the final article, Dyer wrote about
race relations among his co-workers and their perceptions of how
race affected the paper's crime coverage. The article revealed that
the journalists who had written Akron's racial ``report card'' were
as confused and divided by race as the people whose words and
images they had filtered into print.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we all get along, but there are racists in the
newsroom,'' a white journalist was quoted as saying. ``I'm talking
about people at parties who have a little too much to drink and
suddenly start talking about `niggers.'''
</P>
<P>
   For Dyer, reporting on his colleagues made the race story almost
personal. ``I always thought, even well before that series, that
people in the newsroom considered themselves enlightened, which was
sort of debunked when we did the focus group,'' he said recently.
``You know, we were like any other part of society. We didn't have
a clue.''
</P>
<P>
   A TYPICAL NEWSROOM
</P>
<P>
   It was a slow February afternoon in the newsroom, and boredom
had set in. Suddenly a rubber band whizzed by the head of Reginald
Fields, a black reporter. Laughter broke out behind a computer
screen a few desks away. Moments later, a white editor, Mitch
McKenney, joined in, firing off another rubber band. It was all in
fun, a spontaneous show of camaraderie.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Melanie Payne, a black reporter, was stricken with a
rare heart condition. A steady stream of colleagues, black and
white, went to her bedside.
</P>
<P>
   And five months ago, when the newspaper's art director, Terence
Oliver, who is black, returned from a church missionary trip to
Africa and told the editor, Leach, how deeply the experience had
moved him, she had him write about it for the cover of the local
news section.
</P>
<P>
   On any given day. the Beacon Journal newsroom hardly seems like
a place where race would be an issue. Even when there is conflict,
Chancellor said, ``the real divisions in the newsroom aren't always
race-based.'' Indeed, reporters and editors say that a recent wave
of staff reassignments, budget cuts and defections to the rival
Plain Dealer, in Cleveland, have done more to hurt morale than any
racial tension.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a small newsroom, I think a lot of it is petty jealousy,
just individual personality conflicts,'' Chancellor said. ``And I
guess it's the daily stress of working on deadline and people
blowing up at each other because it's just the nature of the
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Months can pass without Chancellor or Dyer writing about race.
The subject is not often on the table when editors decide what will
go on the front page. Nor is it a daily topic when co-workers meet
over vending-machine coffee in the cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   In one respect, the Beacon Journal is even in the forefront of
racial progress. It has a black publisher, John L. Dotson Jr., who,
as part of a pioneering generation of black journalists, covered
the Detroit race riots in the 1960s and worked for The Philadelphia
Inquirer and Newsweek. Editors there, like those in most newsrooms,
struggle earnestly with questions of racial sensitivity. They
debated, for example, whether they would publish a photograph of a
black man washing a white man's feet during the church service,
fearing it would be suggestive of black servitude. (The editors
decided not to use such a picture and instead published one of a
white man washing a black man's feet.)
</P>
<P>
   Yet even in this environment, race still slips back into the
room. It is there when reporters and editors, keeping score,
immediately notice the color of a new employee's skin. It is there
when a mid-level black editor perceives her demotion as racially
motivated. It is there when a white reporter wonders whether
political correctness instead of news judgment elevated one
obituary, that of a black civil rights leader in Akron, to the
front page and relegated another, that of an internationally known
white plastics-industry inventor, to the cover of the local news
section.
</P>
<P>
   And it was there one day when the editor, Leach, picked up an
anonymous memo that had landed on her desk. ``It made me sick,''
she said. The note criticized her hiring of a black journalist,
calling the person incompetent, an affirmative action mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Color-coded scorecards and friendly rubber-band wars. Ask almost
anyone on the Beacon Journal staff about the seemingly
contradictory images of the place and they will say that the
newsroom culture simply reflects the fragility of racial harmony in
all segments of society.
</P>
<P>
   ``You go into a school and you'll see a bunch of black people
sitting in a corner and a bunch of white people sitting in a
corner,'' Dyer said. ``I mean, you've got to really make an effort
to go out and reach across.''
</P>
<P>
   And you have to be even bolder to speak up about race at work.
Is it worth the risk? Dyer has a mortgage to pay, a new swimming
pool and two young daughters to put through college one day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to the newsroom,'' he said, ``and you're 32 or 34, and
you've learned that if you're black and want to succeed or you're
white and you want to succeed, you can say this but you probably
shouldn't go there, and you ought to just back off.''
</P>
<P>
   TWO SONS OF TWO CLEVELANDS
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bruce Dyer and Carl Clifton Chancellor were introduced to
the world less than a year apart, wrapped in blankets in the same
nursery of University Hospitals of Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   While they started out in the same place, Carl and Bob went home
to different worlds in an era of whites-only country clubs and the
first rumblings of black civil unrest.
</P>
<P>
   Their early years influenced the men as journalists. ``You have
two educated men with two educated egos that see things very
differently because they were raised very differently,'' said
Sheila Williams, who has lived with Chancellor for 13 years and is
the mother of his youngest son.

 AKRON, Ohio: youngest son.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dyer, the son of an electrical engineer and an amateur figure
skater, grew up in a suburban part of mostly rural Geauga County,
outside Cleveland, where in some pockets the Amish outnumbered the
blacks. There he learned about doing unto others as you would have
them do unto you; about doing a job right the first time, even if
it was just washing your father's car. Race was not a frequent
topic at the Dyer dinner table.
</P>
<P>
   There were a few blacks at young Bob's school and some who
worked at the country club, where he occasionally dined with his
grandfather. But he remembers noticing the all-you-can-eat shrimp
more than the help. Far away there were civil rights marches,
boycotts, dogs turned on protesters _ events he saw only out of the
corner of his eye, on television.
</P>
<P>
   But if the boy with the pale peach complexion saw race mainly in
the media, the one with the apple-butter skin saw it in his own
reflection. There was no ignoring race for young Carl Chancellor.
It was in countless church sermons about better days ahead. It was
at his grandmother's kitchen table, where civil rights leaders
could count on a hot meal after a protest rally. And it was at a
park in Florida, where he was turned away at the whites-only
entrance to the glass-bottom-boat ride. (He recalled being one of
only a handful of passengers on the blacks' boat, while whites
crowded into a boat that looked full enough to capsize.)
</P>
<P>
   Home for the Chancellors was Cedar Estates, a fancy name for a
place that was anything but. Their apartment in that Cleveland
public housing development was all they could afford while Carl's
mother tended to her growing family and his father washed trucks at
the electric company to pay his way through law school.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Carl Eugene Chancellor, graduated less than a year
after young Carl's birth, and the family was soon on a trajectory
from penny pinching to prosperity. Hired by the electric company's
legal department, he promptly moved his family to a better
neighborhood on the city's edge. The houses were modest, and every
day, it seemed, a moving van rolled in to pack up another white
family, but to the Chancellors it felt like sweet suburbia
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Chancellor taught by example, and in time it all made
sense to Carl: the fine food, the parties with his father's
accomplished black friends _ a doctor, an architect, other lawyers
_ and even his father's insistence that Carl pass up a chance to
attend a prestigious East-Coast boarding school to remain in a
public school where the principal and the teachers looked like him.
Black did not mean inferior. That is what his father was trying to
say.
</P>
<P>
   So young Carl did not find it nearly as interesting as some
grownups that his father kept getting promoted and had a white
secretary. And his only observation about his family's dining at
the Four Seasons restaurant during vacations to New York was that
``my father would always get mad at my little brother because no
matter what restaurant we went to, he always ordered a hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   In middle age, Chancellor is content with the black man he has
become. He is 5 foot 10, with a handsome, closely cropped beard and
wavy salt-and-pepper hair. He favors tailored slacks, black
turtlenecks and Italian leather shoes.
</P>
<P>
   A soccer dad, Dyer fits comfortably in his skin, too. He is 6
foot 2 with an easy smile, a thick mustache and a full head of dark
brown hair. He prefers khakis, cotton sports shirts and loafers.
</P>
<P>
   As different as they are, there is also a sameness about them.
Both live in upper-middle-class suburban neighborhoods and say they
are pleased that their children have a more racially diverse group
of friends than they do. The women in their lives describe them in
similar terms, as caring but opinionated and ``macho'' too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we share a lot of values,'' Chancellor said. Factor in
race, however, and they can be worlds apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carl can't understand what it is to be a white male in America
any more than Bob can understand what it is to be a black male in
America,'' his companion, Williams, said.
</P>
<P>
   Once, Dyer was pulled over on a dark highway after edging in and
out of his lane while trying to pass a truck. It struck him, he
said, that he had experienced something comparable to racial
profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I resented the fact that I was, you know, sort of randomly
pulled over for no good reason,'' Dyer said. ``I mean, it's not as
if people like me never encounter situations where you go, `What
the hell is going on?'''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, at a restaurant with his family in 1990, Dyer
thought the service was terrible. When a black family a few tables
away got the same treatment, he said, he wondered whether they
would attribute it to discrimination and wrote a column about
seeing race where it may not be.
</P>
<P>
   It is not that bigotry is a figment of the imagination, Dyer
wrote. But, he added: ``This white guy keeps getting hammered, too,
day after day after day. So don't take it personally. There's
plenty of rudeness and incompetence to go around.''
</P>
<P>
   For many of his readers and colleagues, though, that column was
unremarkable compared to one he wrote in two parts in 1995 during
Black History Month. He said it generated more response than
anything he had written in more than 20 years. One call came from
the publisher, who summoned Dyer to explain what he meant when he
wrote this:
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you some black history: For the past 15 years, a
race that accounts for only 12 percent of this country's population
has caused more than half its problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The column went on to say that ``guilt-ridden white people have
turned us all into contortionists, looking for new ways to twist
the truth to make blacks look better.'' It described Afrocentrism
as ``the scholarly equivalent of flying saucers.''
</P>
<P>
   Explosive words, to be sure, but Dyer says he was misread. The
column, he said, was meant to be an uncensored expression of an
internal debate with his conscience. It was meant to show the
conflicted feelings that many whites have about blacks but are
loath to openly express in a time of political correctness.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, he had exaggerated some points for the sake of argument.
But Dyer was certain that even his critics would give him credit
for asking, ``If things are so equal, care to trade places with an
African American?'' His well-meaning conscience also got the last
say, reminding him that ``things won't improve unless you pay more
attention to me.''

 AKRON, Ohio: to me.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dyer said he had assumed that coming in the wake of the race
project and the good will it engendered, the column was timed just
right. ``I thought maybe now, since we seemed to be acknowledging
that we have problems, and we can talk about problems, maybe it's
time to push it harder,'' he said. But he had been wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his intentions, his words drew little sympathy from
some colleagues. ``Bob is a racist without even knowing it,'' said
Yuvonne Bruce, a black assistant features editor, who worked on the
race series.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer, who says he gets along with many of his black colleagues,
contends that white people risk being slapped with ugly labels when
they speak honestly about race.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor says Dyer is not a racist, just naive about the
pervasiveness and pain of bigotry. How could Bob Dyer know? Unlike
Chancellor, he has never had trouble trying to interview fans at
Cleveland Indians baseball games because stadium security thought
his media credentials might be fake. He has never known the anger
that boils up in black men who feel under siege.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor felt that anger when four white New York City police
officers were acquitted in the shooting death of an unarmed African
immigrant, Amadou Diallo. The verdict, in February, was fresh in
his memory a few days later when he noticed a white police officer
driving behind him in a movie theater parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking: If he does say something to me, I think I will
go off,'' Chancellor recalled. ``I guess I just came to a decision.
If he says anything about me, about anything, I'm just going to go
off right then and there.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the officer was not trailing him but driving
to meet another officer up ahead in a parked patrol car.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor laughs about the moment now. Life can be funny that
way. Just like the boy he once was, he still sees race all around
him.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Dyer still believes that people focus on it too much.
</P>
<P>
   IMAGE PROBLEMS
</P>
<P>
   Carl Chancellor says he knows the double standards. A white man
is confident, a black man is cocky. A white man has taste, a black
man is flashy. And a white columnist can never write too white,
Chancellor says, but if you are black, you learn quickly that your
subjects and your sources had better not be too black too often.
</P>
<P>
   So he found white people on welfare to write about. And if he
found a reason to write about somebody who just happened to be
black, he said, ``I went overboard to not mention his race or
downplay it because I was afraid that the readers would miss my
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the newsroom suggest that his self-restraint did
not go far enough for some editors. Last fall, Chancellor lost his
column and was reassigned to a general news beat. He found himself
covering Groundhog Day.
</P>
<P>
   The paper's editor, Leach, said the reassignment had nothing to
do with Chancellor's writing about race but rather with his
productivity. She said he had been asked to do more reporting for
his columns and contribute news articles as well. When he declined,
the column was discontinued, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor confirms Leach's account of what happened but has
gone back and forth in his mind about whether the newspaper's
demands were meant to force him to give up the column. Many of his
black colleagues are far less willing to give the management the
benefit of the doubt.
</P>
<P>
   They say Chancellor was no less productive than any other
columnist and that his editors were simply punishing him for some
of his views, a charge the editors deny. ``I think that management
did not like Carl's style,'' said Melanie Payne, a black feature
writer.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce, the black assistant features editor, said she was shocked
when she opened her newspaper and discovered that the column was
gone. ``I felt strongly that we were losing a strong black voice,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In protest, she circulated a petition in support of Chancellor,
but among only the black staff members. Charlene Nevada, a white
editor on the metro desk, said she was not sure whether she would
have signed it or not. ``But it would have been nice to be asked,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The protest surprised Leach because the journalists went over
her head and took their ``statement from the minorities,'' as Bruce
described it, directly to her boss.
</P>
<P>
   Her boss, the publisher, Dotson, is no stranger to the
complexities of race relations in the workplace. His decades of
experience taught him to keep his thoughts and feelings closely
guarded to protect himself from all sorts of attacks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So when asked recently about race relations at the Beacon
Journal, he was initially stone-faced and defensive, wondering
aloud about how much he should say. When he finally did open up,
what he revealed was not so much about the newsroom as about the
pressures on a black executive in a largely white industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came along,'' he said, in slow, measured tones, ``I
would get up in the morning and I would put on this armor and go to
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Today it is still his first line of defense, the steely gaze,
the tight smile, the terse response. He slips into that posture as
easily as he does his crisp white shirts and banker-blue suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It protects me against all of the assaults that I think I
undergo,'' Dotson said. ``They are not racial all the time. Some of
it is racial. Mostly it is not revealing my inner thoughts because
I don't want to make a misstep.''
</P>
<P>
   His caution may be one reason staff members have different
readings of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's kind of funny how a lot of people in the
newsroom, white people in the newsroom, think he bends over
backwards to appease and please the black community and black
reporters in the newsroom,'' Chancellor said of Dotson. ``When I
think if you polled the black people in the newsroom, they'd
probably think that it's the other way around.''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what some blacks in the newsroom concluded after
Dotson responded to the petition in support of Chancellor by
backing the editor's decision to reassign him and later endorsing
her choice of a white man as a replacement.

 AKRON, Ohio: a replacement.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To some blacks, the decision sent the wrong message about racial
diversity. ``I don't think we have anybody leading us who cares,''
Bruce said.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than indifference, Dotson's actions reflect a desire
to stay out of day-to-day newsroom affairs, he said. ``I try to let
the editors run the newsroom,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When he sees fit, though, he does not hesitate to use his power
to promote fairness and diversity. Dotson banned publication of the
Cleveland Indians' logo, a caricature of an Indian chief, because
it offended some readers. He also persuaded a civic group to change
the date of an event that the newspaper was supporting after an
editor complained that it fell on a Jewish holiday. And he has
hired a black general manager who is widely believed to be his heir
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   Differences in perceptions about how race affects Dotson as
publisher extends to the upper echelons as well.
</P>
<P>
   Since Leach joined the paper in March 1998, becoming the first
woman to hold the title of editor there, she has spoken of carrying
a burden that Dotson does not. Addressing community groups about
her efforts to improve news coverage, she said, someone inevitably
accuses her of turning the publication into the ``Ladies' Home
Journal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens every time,'' Leach said, ``I don't think they ever
ask John Dotson about being a black publisher because it would be
politically incorrect.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Dotson said, adding: ``I just don't talk about it. I
mean, when I appointed Jan as editor, one of the questions to me
was what are people going to say, the Beacon Journal having a black
publisher and now a woman editor,'' Dotson said. ``I mean, that's
from within the newspaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Dotson also gets regular calls from a reader who points of
instances of the newspaper's appearing to pander to blacks.
``That's America,'' Dotson said. ``What am I supposed to do about
that?''
</P>
<P>
   THE PRICE OF CANDOR
</P>
<P>
   For now, Chancellor has made peace with his lower-profile role
at the Beacon Journal. Though still a general assignment reporter,
he has worked on in-depth projects that he cares about and that
Leach says she enthusiastically supports.
</P>
<P>
   He and Dyer say there are no hard feelings lingering between
them and that they have grown to respect each other's honesty. The
men even talk about someday getting back to the basketball court.
(They still lie about who has the better jump shot.)
</P>
<P>
   These days, Chancellor spends his spare time writing a novel
about a newsroom and a book of short stories, ``Soul Songs,'' about
coming of age in the '60s. The Beacon Journal, he said, will not be
his last stop, and he does not spend much time thinking about the
race project or the column he lost.
</P>
<P>
   As for Dyer, he still writes a magazine column every Sunday, but
occasionally questions whether his views have hurt his chances for
other opportunities at the Beacon Journal, and whether it would be
easier to get ahead if he were not a white male.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make it clear that I don't know in this case, that
it's just total speculation, but the thought had crossed my mind,''
Dyer said.
</P>
<P>
   He has grown more reluctant to write about race anymore. He
knows he is on safer ground when writing about highway sound
barriers or the local Soapbox Derby. His admirers say he can be
witty and touching, whether writing a ``letter to heaven'' to his
mother or a ``happy anniversary'' column praising his wife as
intelligent, loyal and ``perfectly comfortable with people of
different backgrounds, incomes and colors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes he's writing what he believes is right, sometimes
he's just writing what he feels,'' his wife, Becky, said.
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes he still offends even when he's not trying to be
provocative. Readers and colleagues were sharply critical of one
column, meant to be humorous, in which he suggested new mascots for
local schools. For a mostly black high school, he offered the name
``Crackheads''_ a jab at a member of its basketball team who had
been arrested on a drug charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not like that one at all,'' said Dotson, who
characterized Dyer's columns as generally too sarcastic and
negative.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Miller Roane, a black reporter, confronted Dyer about
the column. ``I told him, `You just missed it; this is not
funny,''' she said. She has concluded that Dyer's column speaks to
``cry-baby white boys.''
</P>
<P>
   Such reactions leave Dyer shaking his head. He argues that the
mascot column poked fun at lots of institutions, that he did not
single out the black school for ridicule. And he said he was
frustrated that people did not remember all the things he has
written to improve race relations. What about the column advocating
the hiring of a black news anchor at a local television station? Or
the one denouncing harassment of an interracial couple?
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor says he knows about being misunderstood, too. It is a
burden he believes he and Dyer share.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the general newsroom perception might be that I'm
pretty militant and I'm the angry black man, or something like
that,'' he said, dismissing the notion with a roll of the eyes.
``Name-calling is something I'm used to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dyer takes it harder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fewer people would think I was racist if I kept my mouth
shut,'' he said. Though tempted to do just that, he will not.
Remaining silent would mean he had lost all hope of seeing race
relations improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a race problem,'' he said, ``it is my problem,
too.''

   MEXICO CITY _ Authorities have promised that Mexico's
presidential election this Sunday will be the cleanest in history.
But recent events suggest that at least some hard-liners in the
governing party still believe that electoral chicanery can help
them triumph.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, a member of the governing party in the state of
Puebla offered to pay cash to an election official for credentials
that would empower him to help supervise the local balloting. In
Yucatan, party members visited citizens randomly selected by
computer to be poll watchers to discourage them from serving.
</P>
<P>
   And in a Mexico City suburb, members of the governing party,
known as the PRI, were discovered posing as officials from the
federal agency organizing the vote, leading a bogus training
session on polling place procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a systematic effort in many places by PRI members
to create conditions that will allow them to control polling
places,'' said Alfredo Figueroa, a law professor who is a member of
the election agency's governing council in Puebla, the state east
of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   President Ernesto Zedillo, the head of Mexico's electoral agency
and a string of other authorities have dismissed all chances that
fraud could determine the presidential winner, pointing to
safeguards that include transparent ballot boxes and curtained
voting booths. Their case was strengthened when opposition parties
reported last week that party representatives would observe
balloting at all 113,000 polling places.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition candidates, several members of the agency's
national governing board and prominent intellectuals are worried
that in an extremely close election the governing party, with its
rich tradition of vote fraud, may revert to its abiding tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old power is resisting change,'' Humberto Musacchio, the
editor of a Mexican encyclopedia, wrote in a recent newspaper
column. ``Many officials in our state and local electoral agencies
are PRI members who very probably think in old ways and are ready
to act in the old style.''
</P>
<P>
   Final opinion polls last week showed the leading presidential
candidates, Francisco Labastida Ochoa of the PRI, formally known as
the Institutional Revolutionary Party, and Vicente Fox Quesada of
the center-right National Action Party finishing the campaign in a
dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of dirty votes won't be immense,'' Musacchio added
in an interview. ``But in an election like this, fraud could
determine the outcome.''
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Almada, a senior PRI official, said in an interview that
his party had shown its democratic commitment in years of elections
in which opposition parties had won control of 11 state
governments, the Chamber of Deputies and hundreds of towns. He
ridiculed the suggestion that the party could be preparing to steal
votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to win legally,'' he said. ``We want this
election to be legitimate.''
</P>
<P>
   But skepticism persists. In a recent speech, Jorge Castaneda, an
author who is a Fox adviser and a commentator on Televisa, the
largest television network, outlined one fraud possibility: the
party might use bribes or other methods to intervene in an election
day Televisa exit poll, he said, thereby preparing public opinion
for a Labastida victory that PRI poll workers would obtain through
fraud in subsequent hours in rural precincts. Televisa reacted by
dismissing Castaneda as a commentator.
</P>
<P>
   Since its founding in 1929, the governing party has won 13
consecutive presidential votes, overwhelming many weak opponents
without recourse to fraud. But in many local elections and in
presidential contests in 1929, 1940, 1952 and 1988, the party
resorted to fraud, historians have concluded.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   To give the system new credibility after the turbulent 1988
balloting, President-elect Carlos Salinas created a new agency, the
Federal Electoral Institute. Controlled during its first years by
the Interior Ministry, it later came under the control of a
nine-member citizens board that has in turn appointed citizen
councils to oversee local offices in 32 states and 300
congressional districts.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has spent billions of dollars to compile a reliable list
of eligible voters, to issue 60 million photographic voting
credentials, and to carry out other reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet frauds still happen. In November, a tribunal accepted
opposition arguments that PRI officials had won a mayoral election
in the capital of Hidalgo state, just north of Mexico City, by
surreptitiously annulling 38 ballots cast in favor of Fox's party.
The court overturned the result.
</P>
<P>
   In the PRI's own Nov. 7 presidential primary, a photographer
caught dramatic images of a top party election official, revolver
drawn, stealing ballot boxes in Puebla.
</P>
<P>
   Before this year's election, experts considered that an element
of the electoral system still vulnerable to manipulation was the
army of polling place officials whose one-day duties include
supervising the vote and counting the ballots. The institute has
dedicated enormous resources to recruiting and training half a
million of these volunteers, selected by computer at random.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Yet in half a dozen states, citizens designated for poll duty
have reported that PRI members have systematically discouraged them
from serving. In five towns in Yucatan State, for instance, PRI
members went door to door visiting citizens selected for polling
duty to argue that the work was dull and not obligatory, said
Patricia McCarthy, one of the institute's councilors in that
southeast state.
</P>
<P>
   In the capital of Puebla, similar visits were so numerous that
councilors circulated a report warning that PRI members were
carrying out a campaign to advise poll workers against reporting
for duty.
</P>
<P>
   In three states, PRI members have been discovered posing as
officials of the Electoral Institute to organize training sessions
for polling place workers.
</P>
<P>
   On April 6 in a Mexico City suburb, for instance, electoral
officials went to a storefront office in response to a citizen's
complaint and were greeted by people who introduced themselves as
trainers for the institute but who were later discovered to be PRI
members, lecturing a group of citizens seated at tables. The
institute officials filed a criminal complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Other difficulties arose in the designation by computer of the
volunteer officials who are to serve as presidents, secretaries and
vote-counters at the polling places.
</P>
<P>
   In some districts of Tabasco, Veracruz and Puebla states, as
many as one in every three polling place officials were mistakenly
designated. And subsequent investigations showed that the
institute's own officials, who acquired their loyalties when the
PRI was in control and fraud was frequent, had been feeding the
computers false information that confused the selection process.
</P>
<P>
   One result was that some blind and mentally retarded people were
chosen to preside over vote-counting, and in other cases barely
literate peasants were assigned to head precincts while university
professors were sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   Similar irregularities occurred in Tepeaca, the seat of an
election district in Puebla. As in all 300 congressional districts,
a council of local citizens oversees the election preparations.
Several of the councilors complained that their efforts had been
undercut by a staff of federal bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
   Maria del Carmen Jean, a dentist who is a councilor in the
Tepeaca district, said that she and associates discovered 307
errors in the designation of thousands of polling officials.
Whether those resulted from incompetence or bad faith is not clear,
but the bureaucrat responsible, a former PRI councilman in Tepeaca,
ordered subordinates to hide the errors, she and other councilors
said. That would have led to election day mayhem, so Jean and two
other councilors worked for days to reappoint and train the correct
poll watchers.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere grew tense after men requested to buy packets of
ballots and election credentials this spring, Jean said. The man
who made the first offer, for credentials, was identified in an
official report as a prominent local PRI member. Officials said
they believed the men who on two occasions offered cash for packets
of ballots were also PRI members.
</P>
<P>
   After officials spurned the bribe offers, Jean said, there were
attempts to scare them when automobile drivers on five occasions
ran election trainers into the ditch.
</P>
<P>
   But the councilors, who have been surviving on pizzas and Coke
as they work seven days a week to arrange honest balloting,
shrugged off that intimidation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let the people's vote count,'' said Dulce Maria Juarez, a
councilor who is a professional photographer.

HOUSE OK'S US TRADE IN FOOD, MEDICINES, WITH CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders agreed Tuesday to allow
the sale of US-grown food and medicines to Cuba, signalling the
first substantial relaxing of 38-year-old sanctions against the
island nation's Communist government.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which was shepherded by House Speaker J. Dennis
Hastert, an Illinois Republican, represents a small opening in
practical terms, but it represented a historic moment in opening
US-Cuban business again.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal, which is set to be slipped into a conference
committee proceeding that would not allow for any debate or vote,
also included a setback for those favoring open relations: It
blocks future tourism to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   It would essentially make law the status quo: allowing cultural
and education exchanges, as well as restricted family-to-family
visits, but no other travel. That takes the matter out of the hands
of the Clinton administration, which had been widely expected to
loosen restrictions on tourism with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for opening up food and medicine sales didn't arise
so much from political factors, although the Elian Gonzalez custody
case appears over the last several months to have greatly hurt the
pro-sanctions Cuban-American lobby. Rather, the push came from
economic interests, namely farmers who want another market to sell
their wheat, soy, rice and powdered milk.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a historic development because it is the result of the
changing views toward Cuba, particularly of Midwestern
conservatives, who are now more interested in selling grain than in
beating Castro over the head,'' said Alfred Padula, professor
emeritus at the University of South Maine, who began analyzing
Cuban issues for the State Department in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   The compromise, which included imput from two Cuban-American
representatives from South Florida as well as farm-state lawmakers,
calls for cash-only sales and won't allow for US government credits
or American bank loans to subsidize the agriculture sales, which is
a common practice.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Ileana Ross-Lehtinen, a Miami Republican, said
the legislation would ``make it as difficult as possible'' for such
sales to take place.
</P>
<P>
   The provision also included a strong anti-sanctions message,
prohibiting the president from using food and medicine in future
embargoes without Congress' approval.
</P>
<P>
   The deal also could open sales to other countries with which the
US has imposed embargoes, including Iran, Libya, North Korea and
Sudan. One exemption would be Iraq, because the United Nations has
imposed the sanctions, with the US as the strongest backer.
</P>
<P>
   The use of food and medicine in sanctions has come under
increasing attack from US allies and United Nations leaders,
including Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who has called repeatedly
this year for the use of ``smart sanctions'' rather than
broad-based ones. Such sanctions would target specific leaders,
rather than nations, imposing travel restrictions and freezing bank
accounts, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   The White House reacted cautiously to the agreement, which is
now expected to be attached to the conference committee
deliberations on either the military-construction bill or the
agricultural appropriations legislation. Once those measures come
out of committee, the entire package will be considered in a
yes-or-no vote, with no amendments allowed. It then would go to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not opposed to allowing things like food and medicine
to go to Cuba as long as it is for the benefit for the people, not
the benefit of the Castro government,'' said White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   But Lockhart said if a provision is included to restrict the
president's ability to manage embargoes, ``those are concerns we
will have to try to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba favors lifting the food and medicine embargo because it
would help improve nutrition to many people and make available many
new prescription drugs, which are currently unavailable because
they are made by US companies.
</P>
<P>
   The food-and-medicine portion of the deal would generate only an
estimated $25 million to $45 million in the first year, said John
S. Kavulich II, president of the US-Cuba Trade and Economic
Council, which provides information on Cuba for American
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Cuba spent an estimated $750 million on bulk food
commodities, but almost all of that was done with foreign
government credit. Kavulich said that even though the US sales at
first may seem small, he projects the sale to grow over the years.
In any case, he said, the sales would have a major impact to some
farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a family farmer in Iowa, now sells to Cuba, say, $800,000 a
year and that is an 8 percent increase of annual revenues to the
farmer, which nets a $1,000 extra in profit, well, that might be
the difference between sending a child to state college and a local
college,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Padula said that the symbolism of the deal is most
important, especially if the US Supreme Court releases Elian
Gonzalez to the custody of his father and the two return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means there could really be a double blow for the exiles,
and to a certain extent that means the diminishing of the power of
the Cuban exile community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the exiles' power still was apparent with the freezing of
the travel restrictions, said Representative James P. McGovern, a
Massachusetts Democrat who was angry after learning that the
measure may not come up for House debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we are making some progress in food and medicine, it
seems to be going in the wrong direction when it comes to relaxing
travel restrictions,'' McGovern said. ``We need to be encouraging
more exchanges. More people-to-people dialogue is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The irony here is that these (Cuban-American representatives)
have the nerve to get up and talk on the floor and about democracy
and we don't have the right to practice democracy on the House
floor by allowing a vote on this.''

FRENCH POLICE SEIZE ACCUSED TERRORIST LINKED TO BIN LADEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Police here have detained an accused terrorist who is
linked to the network of Osama bin Laden and to an Islamic
fundamentalist cell in Canada that plotted to bomb U.S. buildings,
an investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Abdelssalem Boulanouar, a 34-year-old Frenchman of
Algerian origin, was arrested when he arrived on Saturday after
being deported from the Philippines, where he had served a
six-month sentence for possession of explosives, according to an
investigator who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   He is believed to have close ties to Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian
arrested in December at the border with Canada with bomb material
in his car. Ressam, whose trial is to begin in July in Washington
state, is accused of plotting to blow up U.S. buildings and faces
up to 130 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are part of a group led by Fateh Kamel, an Algerian
veteran of the Afghan war against the Soviet Union, that kept
apartments in both France and Montreal, the investigator said.
Three years ago, they raised money through armed robberies in
northern France and planned to bomb a meeting of the Group of 7
industrialized nations. French police learned their names from
personal phone books found in raids, but much of the group
scattered.
</P>
<P>
   Boulanouar apparently went to the Philippines, where he has
links to the Moro Islamic Liberation Front, which is fighting to
create an Islamic state there and is thought to be behind a spate
of bombings. Bin Laden, the Saudi-born millionaire suspected of
masterminding the 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, is thought to pay for the training camps used by the Moro
Front and its rival, the Abu Sayyaf group. The latter is now
holding about 20 foreign hostages.
</P>
<P>
   Under French law, proof that Boulanouar was a member of a
terrorist cell, even as a logistics specialist, could be enough to
jail him for 10 years, the source said. The French police do not
believe he is a suspect in the Kenya and Tanzania bombings or in
the plot to bomb U.S. buildings, said the investigator, who keeps
in contact with FBI anti-terrorist agents.

 By FENELLA SAUNDERS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Trying to find something on the Internet is a lot like rummaging
through countless cardboard boxes in a dark attic. Even if the
search is eventually successful, it almost always turns up too much
junk. Worse, no search is ever comprehensive.
 &HT;    The dark attic of the Internet is only infiltrated as far as the
very limited capabilities of a particular search engine. Yahoo's
directory, for example, is merely an index of selected sites
cataloged by anonymous editors.
 &HT;    Other popular indexers, such as Excite, Lycos and Alta Vista,
send spindly bits of software known as spiders meandering from Web
site to Web site, sucking up bits of text from each page they
encounter and making a list of the keywords they find. This patchy
list _ not the Web itself _ is what a search engine actually
searches.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, search engines are having a tough time keeping
up with the exponential growth of the Net, which already boasts
more than 5 million Web sites and about 1.5 billion total pages of
information.
 &HT;    Experts estimate that the amount of information on the Net is
expanding by 2 million pages a day and that the best search engines
cover no more than 16 percent of those pages, down sharply from 34
percent in 1997. Spiders take months to finish one incomplete sweep
of the Web, during which time tens of millions of pages have
appeared, changed or disappeared.
 &HT;    So is it hopeless? Some Web engineers are trying to compensate
by developing swifter, more efficient spiders. Others look for ways
to transform the very nature of the search process by making it
more human.
 &HT;    Fast Search and Transfer (FAST), a new company with headquarters
in Oslo, Norway, has created spiders on steroids. FAST's programs
can index 80 million pages a day _ twice as many as spiders
dispatched by conventional search engines _ and may be able to
index all of the Web by early next year.
 &HT;    Instead of collecting data from spiders in one big list of
keywords the way other search sites do, FAST divides the
information into several hundred more manageable chunks and scans
all of them simultaneously, performing more than 600 searches per
second.
 &HT;    But brute force doesn't make the job of sorting through all that
information any easier. Marc Krellenstein, chief technology officer
of Northern Light in Cambridge, Mass., believes finesse is
ultimately more important than strength. His spiders do not have
the sheer muscle of FAST, and he could care less.
 &HT;    ``It may only be a quarter or a third of the Web that we've
indexed, but it's a better part of it in terms of its quality,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Northern Light classifies Web pages according to various
criteria, including a custom list of 25,000 subject areas. A team
of real, live human librarians spot-checks the classifications.
When someone does a search, the engine organizes the results into
folders, each with a subject title.
 &HT;    Both FAST and Northern Light still depend primarily on random
searches by dumb spiders, so the next step is to give spiders the
ability to recognize connections between different Web sites.
 &HT;    Reka Albert, Albert-Lazlo Barabasi and Hawoong Jeong of Notre
Dame are studying how the so-called six-degrees-of-separation
phenomenon relates to the Internet. In the 1960s, Yale social
psychologist Stanley Milgram observed that two complete strangers
are likely to be connected by a network of six or fewer
acquaintances.
 &HT;    The Notre Dame researchers have proven that the Internet is a
small world too. They did a statistical analysis of hyperlink
connections and discovered that the average number of clicks needed
to get between two randomly chosen pages on the World Wide Web is
19. Even if the Web expands to 10 times its present size, that
average will only increase to 21 clicks.
 &HT;    The upshot is that people could quickly reach any page on the
Web if only they knew the right place to start and how to navigate.
Spiders programmed to recognize degrees-of-separation patterns
might be an answer.
 &HT;    ``If something goes in intelligently and can see what links it
is following, it doesn't have to index everything,'' Albert says.
 &HT;    Such clever spiders are already in the works. Sridhar
Rajagopalan and his colleagues at IBM's Almaden Research Center in
San Jose have designed a prototype search engine called CLEVER,
which uses spiders endowed with a dose of humanlike intelligence.
They seek out hubs _ mini-index sites with a large collection of
hyperlinks on a single subject _ and authorities _ pages that a
large number of other Web sites put on their lists of hyperlinks.
 &HT;    CLEVER scores each page based on the quality of the pages it
points to and the quality of those that point to it, which in turn
affects the scores of all those linked pages.
 &HT;    By repeating this circular process, the search engine quickly
locates the best hubs and authorities. Instead of relying on the
judgment of editors at index sites such as Yahoo or America Online,
CLEVER gathers the opinions of those who really matter _ the
millions of people who have created Web pages and added links to
their favorite sites.
 &HT;    Rajagopalan considers that an advance over the current Web
chaos. ``We're giving people access to the collective wisdom of the
Web,'' he says.
 &HT;    A group led by Bernardo Huberman and Lada Adamic of the Internet
Ecologies Group at Xerox PARC is pursuing a related approach using
data from Google, one of the most sophisticated of the current
search engines.
 &HT;    Natalie Glance of Xerox Research Center Europe in Meylan,
France, hopes to add to the collective wisdom by fostering more of
a sense of personal connection on-line.
 &HT;    ``There are possibly millions of people doing the same search as
you, so how can we bring in the power of the community to help?''
Her answer: a software program that acts as a community search
assistant by cataloging queries made by many people looking for the
same kind of information.
 &HT;    For example, a generic search for digital cameras might generate
a list of cameras other people are considering and pinpoint the
popular models.
 &HT;    Glance has also created an automated process, called Knowledge
Pump, which would make it possible for people to submit comments
about Web sites and receive recommendations based on past
preferences.
 &HT;    One surefire way to foster more community spirit is to make the
search process less forbidding. That advance means doing away with
endless, incomprehensible lists of text.
 &HT;    WebTheme, a cybergraphics program developed by Jim Thomas and
his colleagues at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in
Richland, Wash., displays search results as a glowing galaxy, in
which each point of light represents an individual Web page and
star clusters denote related topics. WebTheme can also represent
data as a topographical map on which peaks show the largest
subjects.
 &HT;    Some Web visionaries imagine a day when intelligent spiders will
weave together connections between related bits of the Web,
creating threads that become something meaningful in themselves _ a
cybertapestry. When many people weigh in on a topic, a process
called group filtering occurs, which yields predictions that tend
to be extremely accurate.
 &HT;    Robert Lucky, an electrical engineer and corporate vice
president of Telcordia Technologies in Morristown, N.J., compares
the phenomenon to the national point spread in football pools,
which often produce uncannily accurate predictions of game scores.
 &HT;    ``Somehow, this process of everybody contributing a guess
settles out to something that is statistically accurate,'' he says.
 &HT;    Lucky is confident a similar process will make searching the
Internet more fruitful.
 &HT;    ``A lot of information in the world isn't stuff written down in
books; it's nuances in people's heads. If you put them all
together, you can form something better than any individual
opinion. As they say, nobody is as smart as everybody.''

 &HT;    
 UNDER T.REX'S TOES  
 &HT;    Stephen Hasiotis was clambering around near Lake Powell, Utah,
in 1996 when he spied striking white structures jutting out of the
purple clay.
 &HT;    In the years since, he and his colleague Robert Wellner have
uncovered 100 more of the formations and identified them as
fossilized burrows dug by some of our mammalian ancestors 150
million years ago.
 &HT;    Back then, mammals had to compete against much larger dinosaurs.
 &HT;    ``If you were on the ground, you could be eaten or squashed. The
trees probably weren't very safe either. So, our best bet was
probably in the ground,'' says Hasiotis, a biogeologist at Indiana
State University.
 &HT;    The burrows have complex forms similar to today's mammal
hideouts. Each has several openings, spiral ramps, and three or
four chambers that may have served as living room, pantry, birthing
room and bathroom.
 &HT;    Based on the burrows' shapes, Hasiotis suspects the animals
looked like prairie dogs but with longer tails and extended snouts
for hunting insects.
 &HT;    So far, the researchers haven't found any fossils of the mammals
themselves, but Hasiotis plans to hunt for them this summer. To
uncover bones or teeth, he'll use hydrochloric acid to dissolve the
calcium carbonate deposits that have filled the once-empty burrows.
 &HT;    Soon, he predicts, we'll be looking at the actual remains of the
timid diggers who eventually took over from the dinosaurs.
 &HT;    
 HOMO INTOXICATUS  
 &HT;    Getting sloshed on a Saturday night may seem a uniquely human
tradition, but not if physiologist Robert Dudley is to be believed.
 &HT;    Dudley, a biologist at the University of Texas at Austin, claims
the taste for alcohol runs deep in animal evolution and is shared
with our close primate relatives: chimps, gorillas, and orangutans,
which have a known weakness for overripe fruit.
 &HT;    Ripe or rotting rain-forest fruits contain alcohol
concentrations as high as 5 percent, Dudley says. The odor attracts
birds, bats, butterflies and elephants.
 &HT;    Chimps and gorillas _ from which our hominid ancestors split
between 5 million and 7 million years ago _ will roam for miles
through tangled trees and creepers in search of fermenting fruit.
Sugar and alcohol provide primates with precious calories, and the
fruit in turn spreads its seeds far and wide.
 &HT;    Genes for alcohol addiction may have persisted in the human line
for the same reason that those for fat accumulation have, according
to Dudley's theory.
 &HT;    Modest amounts of alcohol are known to decrease heart disease
risk and may lengthen life. Animals predisposed to a little nip
would be better survivors, more likely to pass their DNA to the
next generation. That genetic heritage may no longer be helpful now
that alcohol, like high-fat food, is available on every corner.
 &HT;    ``Alcoholism is not just another addiction,'' Dudley says. ``It
is a by-product of our ancestral nutritional physiology. Once we
better understand the mechanism, we'll have a better shot at a
cure.

 FRESH-SQUEEZED  
 &HT;    The blandness of canned orange juice is an unfortunate side
effect of the high heat and chemical preservatives needed to
prevent food poisoning. Now microbiologist Martin Cole of Food
Science Australia and others have developed a way to kill germs
without killing flavor.
 &HT;    Cole applies pressures of up to 100,000 pounds per square inch
to wipe out disease-causing bacteria _ including E. coli,
Salmonella, and Listeria _ in fruits, juices, fish and other foods.
 &HT;    The smothering pressure ruptures the outer membranes of bacteria
and breaks apart crucial proteins. The process also unravels animal
proteins, making raw meat look pale and cooked.
 &HT;    ``But people are looking at using the process to extend the
shelf life of meats that are already cooked and sliced,'' Cole
says.
 &HT;    Because of their rigid walls, plant cells suffer little damage
under intense pressure. Fruits maintain their texture, shape, and
taste, and juices taste fresh-squeezed after compression.
 &HT;    Flow International, a manufacturer in Kent, Wash., is readying a
commercial version of the technology. Pressure-preserved strawberry
jam, now on sale in Japan, proves the gastronomic benefits.
 &HT;    ``When you eat the jam, it is just like eating fresh
strawberries,'' Cole says.

 ROBOT WATCH: THE BUCKSHOT BRIGADE  
 &HT;    A group of robots now roaming the University of Minnesota campus
can come to the rescue nearly as fast as a speeding bullet.
 &HT;    Richard Voyles and his colleagues at the university devised two
miniature rovers that can be shot en masse out of grenade
launchers.
 &HT;    One of them, called a Scout, is a wheeled cylinder that rolls
along like a soda can but has a spring-loaded ``foot'' to fling it
up stairs or over small obstacles.
 &HT;    A second rover, the TerminatorBot, has arms that unfold so they
can drag the rover along or pick up objects _ ideal for exploring
loose wreckage for survivors after an earthquake, Voyles believes.

 POET OF THE PILL  
 &HT;    Working at Syntex, a private company in Mexico City, chemist
Carl Djerassi created norethindrone, a synthetic form of the
hormone progesterone, in 1951.
 &HT;    Soon after, norethindrone became an active ingredient in an oral
contraceptive _ famously known as ``the pill.''
 &HT;    In the 1980s, after years of biochemical research at Stanford
University, Djerassi switched gears and began writing about
scientific issues in fictional settings. He has published five
novels, including ``Cantor's Dilemma'' and ``Menachem's Seed.''
 &HT;    The first installment in a planned trilogy of plays, ``An
Immaculate Misconception,'' was broadcast on May 6 and 7 on the BBC
World Service and will soon be available on video from GlobalStage.
 &HT;    Josie Glausiusz talked to Djerassi about his dual life.
 &HT;     Q:  Why do you write fiction?
 &HT;     A:  I am trying to smuggle important scientific ideas out to
the general public. The vast majority of legislators haven't got
the foggiest idea about science or technology, and yet many of the
decisions they make are based on these things.
 &HT;     Q:  What are the key ideas in ``An Immaculate Misconception''?
 &HT;     A:  It deals with the ethical dilemmas we face as sex and
reproduction become increasingly separate. With in vitro
fertilization you can analyze the embryo and screen for all kinds
of diseases _ such as Down's syndrome or sickle-cell anemia _
before you put it back into the woman. But this is an expensive
procedure, and the only people who can afford it are affluent
people in affluent countries. We're creating another gulf between
the haves and the have-nots.
 &HT;     Q:  What will be the impact of a split between sex and
reproduction?
 &HT;     A:  It will change the power relationship between men and
women. Sexual reproduction was overwhelmingly in favor of the man,
who ran the show. But this reduces a man to what he really is: the
donor of a single sperm. That sperm a woman can now get without
sexual intercourse.
 &HT;     Q:  How will contraception change in the new century?
 &HT;     A:  I think that practically nothing will happen. I am
extremely dubious that we will have a male pill in the next 10 or
20 years, because the pharmaceutical industry is not interested. A
contraceptive vaccine is of least interest because there is no
money in it. The better such a vaccine is, the fewer times you use
it.
 &HT;     Q:  What about mifepristone (RU-486), the abortion pill now
available in some European countries?
 &HT;     A:  Scientifically it's one of the few, perhaps the only, real
major advances beyond the pill. Right now, nearly 50 million women
in the world have an abortion each year, and I think it behooves us
to give women various choices as to how to have an abortion, just
as we give people choices on what kind of contraception to use.
 &HT;     Q:  What is your greatest love?
 &HT;     A:  Curiosity. That's probably what keeps me young and active,
always wanting to get into new areas. That's why I want to become a
playwright. There aren't too many people who start writing plays at
age 75.

 By FENELLA SAUNDERS 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Trying to find something on the Internet is a lot like rummaging
through countless cardboard boxes in a dark attic. Even if the
search is eventually successful, it almost always turns up too much
junk. Worse, no search is ever comprehensive.
 &HT;    The dark attic of the Internet is only infiltrated as far as the
very limited capabilities of a particular search engine. Yahoo's
directory, for example, is merely an index of selected sites
cataloged by anonymous editors.
 &HT;    Other popular indexers, such as Excite, Lycos and Alta Vista,
send spindly bits of software known as spiders meandering from Web
site to Web site, sucking up bits of text from each page they
encounter and making a list of the keywords they find. This patchy
list _ not the Web itself _ is what a search engine actually
searches.
 &HT;    Not surprisingly, search engines are having a tough time keeping
up with the exponential growth of the Net, which already boasts
more than 5 million Web sites and about 1.5 billion total pages of
information.
 &HT;    Experts estimate that the amount of information on the Net is
expanding by 2 million pages a day and that the best search engines
cover no more than 16 percent of those pages, down sharply from 34
percent in 1997. Spiders take months to finish one incomplete sweep
of the Web, during which time tens of millions of pages have
appeared, changed or disappeared.
 &HT;    So is it hopeless? Some Web engineers are trying to compensate
by developing swifter, more efficient spiders. Others look for ways
to transform the very nature of the search process by making it
more human.
 &HT;    Fast Search and Transfer (FAST), a new company with headquarters
in Oslo, Norway, has created spiders on steroids. FAST's programs
can index 80 million pages a day _ twice as many as spiders
dispatched by conventional search engines _ and may be able to
index all of the Web by early next year.
 &HT;    Instead of collecting data from spiders in one big list of
keywords the way other search sites do, FAST divides the
information into several hundred more manageable chunks and scans
all of them simultaneously, performing more than 600 searches per
second.
 &HT;    But brute force doesn't make the job of sorting through all that
information any easier. Marc Krellenstein, chief technology officer
of Northern Light in Cambridge, Mass., believes finesse is
ultimately more important than strength. His spiders do not have
the sheer muscle of FAST, and he could care less.
 &HT;    ``It may only be a quarter or a third of the Web that we've
indexed, but it's a better part of it in terms of its quality,'' he
says.
 &HT;    Northern Light classifies Web pages according to various
criteria, including a custom list of 25,000 subject areas. A team
of real, live human librarians spot-checks the classifications.
When someone does a search, the engine organizes the results into
folders, each with a subject title.
 &HT;    Both FAST and Northern Light still depend primarily on random
searches by dumb spiders, so the next step is to give spiders the
ability to recognize connections between different Web sites.
 &HT;    Reka Albert, Albert-Lazlo Barabasi and Hawoong Jeong of Notre
Dame are studying how the so-called six-degrees-of-separation
phenomenon relates to the Internet. In the 1960s, Yale social
psychologist Stanley Milgram observed that two complete strangers
are likely to be connected by a network of six or fewer
acquaintances.
 &HT;    The Notre Dame researchers have proven that the Internet is a
small world too. They did a statistical analysis of hyperlink
connections and discovered that the average number of clicks needed
to get between two randomly chosen pages on the World Wide Web is
19. Even if the Web expands to 10 times its present size, that
average will only increase to 21 clicks.
 &HT;    The upshot is that people could quickly reach any page on the
Web if only they knew the right place to start and how to navigate.
Spiders programmed to recognize degrees-of-separation patterns
might be an answer.
 &HT;    ``If something goes in intelligently and can see what links it
is following, it doesn't have to index everything,'' Albert says.
 &HT;    Such clever spiders are already in the works. Sridhar
Rajagopalan and his colleagues at IBM's Almaden Research Center in
San Jose have designed a prototype search engine called CLEVER,
which uses spiders endowed with a dose of humanlike intelligence.
They seek out hubs _ mini-index sites with a large collection of
hyperlinks on a single subject _ and authorities _ pages that a
large number of other Web sites put on their lists of hyperlinks.
 &HT;    CLEVER scores each page based on the quality of the pages it
points to and the quality of those that point to it, which in turn
affects the scores of all those linked pages.
 &HT;    By repeating this circular process, the search engine quickly
locates the best hubs and authorities. Instead of relying on the
judgment of editors at index sites such as Yahoo or America Online,
CLEVER gathers the opinions of those who really matter _ the
millions of people who have created Web pages and added links to
their favorite sites.
 &HT;    Rajagopalan considers that an advance over the current Web
chaos. ``We're giving people access to the collective wisdom of the
Web,'' he says.
 &HT;    A group led by Bernardo Huberman and Lada Adamic of the Internet
Ecologies Group at Xerox PARC is pursuing a related approach using
data from Google, one of the most sophisticated of the current
search engines.
 &HT;    Natalie Glance of Xerox Research Center Europe in Meylan,
France, hopes to add to the collective wisdom by fostering more of
a sense of personal connection on-line.
 &HT;    ``There are possibly millions of people doing the same search as
you, so how can we bring in the power of the community to help?''
Her answer: a software program that acts as a community search
assistant by cataloging queries made by many people looking for the
same kind of information.
 &HT;    For example, a generic search for digital cameras might generate
a list of cameras other people are considering and pinpoint the
popular models.
 &HT;    Glance has also created an automated process, called Knowledge
Pump, which would make it possible for people to submit comments
about Web sites and receive recommendations based on past
preferences.
 &HT;    One surefire way to foster more community spirit is to make the
search process less forbidding. That advance means doing away with
endless, incomprehensible lists of text.
 &HT;    WebTheme, a cybergraphics program developed by Jim Thomas and
his colleagues at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in
Richland, Wash., displays search results as a glowing galaxy, in
which each point of light represents an individual Web page and
star clusters denote related topics. WebTheme can also represent
data as a topographical map on which peaks show the largest
subjects.
 &HT;    Some Web visionaries imagine a day when intelligent spiders will
weave together connections between related bits of the Web,
creating threads that become something meaningful in themselves _ a
cybertapestry. When many people weigh in on a topic, a process
called group filtering occurs, which yields predictions that tend
to be extremely accurate.
 &HT;    Robert Lucky, an electrical engineer and corporate vice
president of Telcordia Technologies in Morristown, N.J., compares
the phenomenon to the national point spread in football pools,
which often produce uncannily accurate predictions of game scores.
 &HT;    ``Somehow, this process of everybody contributing a guess
settles out to something that is statistically accurate,'' he says.
 &HT;    Lucky is confident a similar process will make searching the
Internet more fruitful.
 &HT;    ``A lot of information in the world isn't stuff written down in
books; it's nuances in people's heads. If you put them all
together, you can form something better than any individual
opinion. As they say, nobody is as smart as everybody.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    
 UNDER T.REX'S TOES  
 &HT;    Stephen Hasiotis was clambering around near Lake Powell, Utah,
in 1996 when he spied striking white structures jutting out of the
purple clay.
 &HT;    In the years since, he and his colleague Robert Wellner have
uncovered 100 more of the formations and identified them as
fossilized burrows dug by some of our mammalian ancestors 150
million years ago.
 &HT;    Back then, mammals had to compete against much larger dinosaurs.
 &HT;    ``If you were on the ground, you could be eaten or squashed. The
trees probably weren't very safe either. So, our best bet was
probably in the ground,'' says Hasiotis, a biogeologist at Indiana
State University.
 &HT;    The burrows have complex forms similar to today's mammal
hideouts. Each has several openings, spiral ramps, and three or
four chambers that may have served as living room, pantry, birthing
room and bathroom.
 &HT;    Based on the burrows' shapes, Hasiotis suspects the animals
looked like prairie dogs but with longer tails and extended snouts
for hunting insects.
 &HT;    So far, the researchers haven't found any fossils of the mammals
themselves, but Hasiotis plans to hunt for them this summer. To
uncover bones or teeth, he'll use hydrochloric acid to dissolve the
calcium carbonate deposits that have filled the once-empty burrows.
 &HT;    Soon, he predicts, we'll be looking at the actual remains of the
timid diggers who eventually took over from the dinosaurs.
 &HT;    
 HOMO INTOXICATUS  
 &HT;    Getting sloshed on a Saturday night may seem a uniquely human
tradition, but not if physiologist Robert Dudley is to be believed.
 &HT;    Dudley, a biologist at the University of Texas at Austin, claims
the taste for alcohol runs deep in animal evolution and is shared
with our close primate relatives: chimps, gorillas, and orangutans,
which have a known weakness for overripe fruit.
 &HT;    Ripe or rotting rain-forest fruits contain alcohol
concentrations as high as 5 percent, Dudley says. The odor attracts
birds, bats, butterflies and elephants.
 &HT;    Chimps and gorillas _ from which our hominid ancestors split
between 5 million and 7 million years ago _ will roam for miles
through tangled trees and creepers in search of fermenting fruit.
Sugar and alcohol provide primates with precious calories, and the
fruit in turn spreads its seeds far and wide.
 &HT;    Genes for alcohol addiction may have persisted in the human line
for the same reason that those for fat accumulation have, according
to Dudley's theory.

risk and may lengthen life. Animals predisposed to a little nip

next generation. That genetic heritage may no longer be helpful now

better understand the mechanism, we'll have a better shot at a

<P>
   Even though the democratic forces lost _ and may have had the
election stolen from them, at that _ the result of this week's
voting in Zimbabwe represents some of the best news from
sub-Saharan Africa in recent memory. What it has shown, as the
Movement for Democratic Change came close to winning a
parliamentary majority in the face of violence and intimidation, is
the strength of the popular desire for a fair and decent
government.
</P>
<P>
   This was an election that President Robert Mugabe and his ruling
party were committed to winning at any cost. Some opposition party
candidates were killed. The so-called war veterans _ men who were
little more than bands of thugs loyal to Mugabe _ were deployed to
make a show of force and to help curry the votes of impoverished
farmers through an attempted expropriation of white-owned land.
Moreover, U.N. officials were prevented from acting as monitors.
European Union observers have refused to certify the vote as free
and fair, blaming the government and its security forces for the
widespread irregularities.
</P>
<P>
   Even under these circumstances, the opposition party won handily
in the cities and made powerful inroads in rural areas, which have
been Mugabe's base of support since independence. Much of the
credit for this moral victory goes to the civil society groups that
trained 24,000 local poll watchers.
</P>
<P>
   This election in Zimbabwe is a salutary reminder that the
situation in sub-Saharan Africa, though desperate, is not hopeless.
All across the continent, the desire for reform continues to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe itself has exemplified both the promise and tragedy of
post-colonial Africa. Mugabe has been gradually transformed from an
idealistic guerrilla commander fighting for an end to British rule
into a tyrant.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the deep wounds from colonialism, both Zimbabweans
and foreigners have been reluctant to face the truth about him, and
he has been a master at turning attention away from his own
destructive conduct by harking back to the evils of colonial days.
As the president of the opposition party, Morgan Tsvangirai, has
put it, Mugabe specialized in the ``unethical use of legitimacy of
the past in order to rationalize the plundering of the present.''
</P>
<P>
   By now, Mugabe's indifference to the welfare of his citizens has
been matched only by his willingness to shed blood or provoke
political crises.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after he came to power, he used troops trained by North
Korea to unleash a campaign of terror in the province of
Matabeleland that some human rights activists have described as
genocidal. More recently, he has embroiled his country in a war in
the Democratic Republic of the Congo that benefits business and
mining interests linked to him and his close associates. At home,
he has presided over the ruination of the economy and the
evisceration of basic services from public health to road
maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the fact that Mugabe has managed, however
tenuously, to hold onto power means that the next few months will
be dangerous. Before the election, the opposition activists worried
that, as one put it, ``we will need a landslide victory to handle
Mugabe and his thugs.''
</P>
<P>
   They didn't get one, or, at least, if they did, voting
irregularities make the question of how people really voted all but
moot. What is clear is that the people of Zimbabwe have done their
part to try to rid themselves of Mugabe. Now the question is
whether the rest of the world will help them or abandon them to a
dictatorial government's determination to stay entrenched, as we
did the Chinese students in Tiananmen Square.

MIRANDA, IN THEORY AND IN PRACTICE

 By SCOTT TUROW    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ I was delighted by the Supreme Court's decision on
Monday to uphold Miranda, the 34-year-old constitutional mandate
that requires the police to advise anyone arrested of the right to
remain silent. Miranda retains an almost sacramental value; it is a
vivid emblem of central ideas about the law. But the truth is that
by now, Miranda has little practical impact on the interaction
between suspects and cops.
</P>
<P>
   To whatever degree Miranda ever impeded law enforcement, its
effect abated a long time time ago. I have been practicing criminal
law for nearly 22 years now, eight years as a federal prosecutor
and 14 years in private practice. In that time, I have been
involved in exactly one case where the result was changed after a
confession was declared inadmissible under Miranda, and that matter
involved a juvenile who, in addition to not being told his rights,
did not enjoy the benefit of a number of other safeguards applied
in Illinois to the questioning of minors.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is my experience idiosyncratic. After a couple of hours of
computer research, I could not find a single reported decision in
Illinois in the last 12 months in which a confession was suppressed
or a conviction reversed because of a Miranda violation.
</P>
<P>
   To a great extent, as the court recognized on Monday in
Dickerson vs. United States, courts and cops have accommodated
themselves to the rule. The more conservative justices who ascended
to the Supreme Court after the Warren years have narrowed the
decision's grand mandate, refining, for example, what amounts to
interrogation for Miranda purposes, or sometimes allowing
subsequent statements to be admitted even if a defendant initially
claimed his Miranda rights.
</P>
<P>
   As for the police, the court is right when it says that law
enforcement practices have adjusted to Miranda's strictures. As a
prosecutor, I never noted that federal agents much resented
Miranda, even though some, like those in the Internal Revenue
Service, were required to give warning when simply questioning
someone.
</P>
<P>
   In eight years, I never had a statement excluded from evidence
because of the Miranda rule. The agents accepted the standard and
often applied it skillfully. I remember a veteran FBI agent
dispensing the Miranda warnings to a suspect before we took him
before a grand jury, a practice required by the Justice Department.
As one of my colleagues commented, the warning sounded so
avuncular, you just about expected the agent to put his arm around
the prospective defendant's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the federal agents with whom I worked were most often
investigating white-collar crime, while most of the objections to
Miranda have come from urban police, whose confrontations with
suspects are often far more spontaneous. They are frequently faced
with sorting out on the fly whether they intend to let a suspect
go, which determines whether the Miranda warnings are required.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, I've talked to enough people arrested in
Chicago who said they were not read their rights during their
initial interrogation that I wonder if some cops have reached a
different accommodation with Miranda.
</P>
<P>
   While I resent these kinds of tactics, I don't think many of
these defendants, if given the Miranda warnings, would have shut up
or asked for a lawyer. As the Supreme Court noted, Miranda by now
is part of our national culture, well understood by anyone who has
ever watched TV. Confronted with an accusation, most people can't
resist the impulse to explain, probably fearing that remaining
silent would make them look guilty.
</P>
<P>
   So if Miranda makes little difference in the daily world of law
enforcement, why is it so heartening to see it still standing?
Because Miranda is an expression of some fundamental concepts about
the law we all should hold dear. One is equality before the law.
Miranda, in essence, says that despite the vast disparities in
education and income in our society, everyone in a confrontation
with the state will possess the same critical knowledge about how
the system works.
</P>
<P>
   Second, the fact that some cops resent giving warnings has
always been evidence in my mind of their value. Miranda's
requirements are, in the most stereotypical police view, the
intrusive work of nosy outsiders from the world of the law, people
sitting in the serene comfort of their cushy offices and judicial
chambers, telling the police how to handle things on the dangerous
streets.
</P>
<P>
   But cops should recognize that no matter how noisy their
protests, or how much they chafe, they are always going to be
subject to civilian authority. Catching bad guys is important, but
it is not the only thing this society values; we also care about
certain minimal standards of decency in the government's treatment
of citizens and limits on the authority of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The requirement to recite Miranda is an important reminder to
the police that the war on lawlessness is always subject to the
guidance of the law. This week's decision, by a court that is not
perceived as particularly hostile to law enforcement, is a needed
reaffirmation of that message.

 &HT;    Turner Broadcasting to spend $1.2 billion on construction
 &HT;    By Tony Wilbert
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - Turner Broadcasting System left little doubt Tuesday
that it is in Atlanta to stay.
</P>
<P>
   The news-and-entertainment subsidiary of Time Warner said it
will spend $1.2 billion on construction projects downtown and in
Midtown during the next five years to accommodate a projected 63
percent increase in local employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The project is gigantic for little old Turner Broadcasting,''
said Terence McGuirk, chairman and chief executive. ``When you come
to CNN Center in the future, you're going to be very impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The plans call for adding a 25-story, 600,000-square-foot office
tower atop the parking garage at Techwood Drive and Marietta Street
and a 24-story hotel tower that will adjoin the existing Omni Hotel
at CNN Center. The 593-room hotel expansion will be developed in
partnership with Omni Hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The $140 million office building, Turner Tower, ``will
accommodate employees temporarily relocated from CNN Center to
Centennial Tower,'' according to TBS.
</P>
<P>
   At its Techwood Campus at Techwood and 10th Street, Turner said
it will construct two buildings in addition to the pair it has
under construction. Buildings C and D will house additional
facilities for future networks and business units of Turner
Entertainment Group. Building D will be completed in early 2003 at
a cost of $45 million. At a cost of $95 million, Building C will be
finished in early 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``Could you get a better hat trick than that?'' said Ken
Bleakly, president of COPA Inc., a nonprofit group that promotes
development around Centennial Olympic Park. ``That looks like a
tremendous project and really validates all we've been trying to do
around the park.''
</P>
<P>
   The project will be one of the largest capital investments ever
in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's fun to build things, and it's fun to grow,'' McGuirk
said. ``We're going to be here for a very long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner has 6,000 employees in metro Atlanta and expects to add
3,800 during the next five years. The projects announced Tuesday
should erase any concern that Time Warner's merger with America
Online would jeopardize TBS jobs in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turner has not forgotten where it got its start _ right here
in Atlanta,'' Gov. Roy Barnes said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell applauded Time Warner Vice Chairman
Ted Turner: ``His commitment to downtown has been unwavering.''

TWO NATIONAL ANTHEMS, TWO AMERICAN VOICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 2) 
 By JODY ROSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In October 1938, Irving Berlin came home to New York from the
London premiere of his latest musical film, ``Alexander's Ragtime
Band,'' determined to write a ``peace song'' _ an anthem to soothe
an American public weary from the Depression years and unnerved by
the specter of Europe on the brink of war.
</P>
<P>
   For over a quarter of a century, Berlin had been the country's
leading songwriter, a pop poet laureate with an unwavering feel for
the vagaries of mass taste. He had spent the better part of the
1930s at work in the Hollywood fairy-tale factory, feeding public
desire for buoyant escapism with little masterpieces of tuneful,
elegant insouciance: ``Isn't This a Lovely Day?,'' ``Top Hat, White
Tie and Tails,'' ``I've Got My Love to Keep Me Warm.'' But by the
autumn of 1938, history had caught up with pop culture's bon
vivants in evening clothes. Millions of Americans were still
unemployed and destitute; Hitler was menacing Europe, Spain was
rent by civil war, and suddenly, the spectacle of Fred Astaire
twirling through a penthouse with a cocktail shaker felt decadent
and unseemly.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin set out to write a song that was the antithesis of '30s
cosmopolitan cool _ an earnest, spirit-boosting anthem for troubled
times. He made several unsuccessful passes at the project before he
remembered a number he had abandoned two decades earlier: a bit of
purplish patriotic verse, set to a rousing tune originally written
in 1918 for his World War I-themed revue, ``Yip Yip Yaphank.''
Berlin dragged out the old song, tinkered with a few lines,
adjusted a musical phrase and gave it to Kate Smith, the radio star
whose wholesome image and fervent vocal style were a perfect match
for the song's rostrum-pounding sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   Smith introduced ``God Bless America'' on her radio show on
Armistice Day, Nov. 11, 1938. It was an instant sensation. Within
weeks, the song was ubiquitous: crackling across radio airwaves,
sung in churches, schools and ballparks, widely championed as a
replacement for Francis Scott Key's ungainly ``The Star-Spangled
Banner.'' In a war-era pop culture filled with mawkish and
bellicose patriotism, ``God Bless America'' stood out: more of a
benediction than a rally-round-the-flag fight song, it both
registered Americans' anxiety and provided a sense of reassurance
and communal uplift. It was, in a hit-making career that spanned
six decades, perhaps the greatest single example of Berlin's
populist largesse. ``A good song embodies the feelings of the
mob,'' he once said. ``And a songwriter is not much more than a
mirror which reflects those feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   But not every American took solace in the skyward-striving
strains of ``God Bless America.'' In the winter of 1940, Woody
Guthrie was bedeviled by the song: everywhere he went, Kate Smith's
belting seemed to follow him; the more he heard the song, the
angrier he got.
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie may have been the only other major American songwriter
as prolific as Berlin; in almost every other way, he was Berlin's
opposite. While Berlin spent the Great Depression writing tunes for
Broadway shows and Hollywood musicals, living in a plush Manhattan
apartment and camping out in Beverly Hills hotel suites, Guthrie
lived as a hobo, crisscrossing the West in railroad cars, working
odd jobs, churning out wry, politically pointed folk songs on an
acoustic guitar that bore the legend ``This Machine Kills
Fascists.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1940, Guthrie had landed in New York, where on Feb. 23, in a
fleabag Midtown Manhattan hotel, he pulled out his guitar and,
using a tune lifted from the Baptist hymn ``Oh My Lovin' Brother,''
composed a six-verse song. Guthrie's Great Depression miseries had
radicalized his politics, and in ``God Bless America'' he heard
just the kind of uncritical jingoism he despised. This new song was
Guthrie's answer: a patriotic epic, which, like Berlin's, used
pastoral imagery to evoke an America of mystical grandeur.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the mountains/ To the prairies/ To the oceans, white with
foam,'' Berlin wrote. ``God bless America, my home sweet home.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When the sun come shining, then I was strolling/ In the wheat
fields waving, and the dust clouds rolling/ The voice was chanting
as the fog was lifting:/ God blessed America for me,'' went
Guthrie's rejoinder.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Guthrie's hand-written lyric sheet still bears its
original title: ``God Blessed America.'' But the world knows the
song by the title Guthrie used when he recorded a revised version
in 1945: ``This Land Is Your Land.''
</P>
<P>
   This call and response between revered troubadours is one of the
most piquant episodes in American pop music _ a tale whose mix of
mid-century politics and national myth-making and whose turbulent
backdrop of Depression and world war could fuel a semester's worth
of American studies seminars.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But the story of ``God Bless America'' and ``This Land Is Your
Land'' resonates most forcefully today not as a class battle
between the Broadway millionaire and the Popular Front minstrel,
not even as a clash of conflicting ideas about patriotism, but as a
parable about musical populism. Pitting Tin Pan Alley's greatest
dream-weaver against the archetypal renegade balladeer, pitting
urban pop sophistication and music industry muscle against homespun
folk, the Berlin-Guthrie skirmish is emblematic of a question that
continues to roil a music culture obsessed with authenticity: who
speaks in the true musical voice of the American people?
</P>
<P>
   In the rock era, that question has been answered with an
emphatic endorsement of Guthrie and the gritty tradition he
represents. Berlin's Tin Pan Alley ethos _ that ardent dedication
to ``the mob'' _ is regarded in the rock world as a false populism:
lowest-common-denominator music that plies the people with the spun
sugar they want. The theory of populism that prevails in American
music culture today, dominating its iconography and mythologies,
coloring its criticism and historiography, exalts Guthrie and his
rock heirs for giving the people something more profound: a
liberating blast of the truth that they need.
</P>
<P>
   Though Guthrie's catalog remains a source of inspiration for
innumerable songwriters, it is his image as a rogue cultural
critic, armed with a guitar and his hard-won folk wisdom, which has
most deeply marked rock culture. In Guthrie, rock recognizes a
spiritual ancestor to its contrarians, misfits and provocateurs: a
prototype not just for folkie protest singers, but for all musical
rebels who refuse to compromise, from hip-swiveling Elvis Presley
running roughshod over sexual proprieties to punk rock agitators to
hard-boiled gangsta rappers.
</P>
<P>
   Rock culture has also absorbed Guthrie's anti-pop animus. A
self-declared singer of ``peoples ballads,'' Guthrie loathed Tin
Pan Alley music _ its grandiose production values, cloying
sentiments and ``sissy-voiced'' crooners. His aversion to ``God
Bless America'' was as much aesthetic as political: to Guthrie,
Berlin's song was a supreme example of Tin Pan Alley's empty
artifice and bloated emotionalism. In place of schmaltz, Guthrie
offered grit and unflinching realism; at the bottom of the sheet on
which he had scrawled the lyrics to ``This Land Is Your Land,''
Guthrie noted: ``All you can write is what you see.''
</P>
<P>
   That commitment to realism is alive in a rock culture that makes
strenuous efforts to distinguish itself from the corrupting
commercialism of pop; in the perennial hip-hop vow to ``keep it
real''; in the spectacle of rock bands like Nirvana and Pearl Jam
bewailing their chart-topping success; in the purist politics that
dominate music scenes like indie rock and techno, in which bands
jockey for underground credibility amid recriminations about
``selling out.'' Rock critics, in particular, have imbibed the
anti-capitalist/social realist thrust of the Guthrie-led folk
movement, often favoring even banal iconoclasm to well-made
commercial pop, ignoring the fact the rebels they lionize are
themselves professional musicians _ as Guthrie was before them.
</P>
<P>
   This rock populism has, in many ways, served the music well. For
almost 50 years, rock, in all its incarnations, has remained
remarkably trenchant and politically potent music, reinvigorating
itself, time and again, with fresh sounds and new voices from the
cultural fringe.
</P>
<P>
   But rock populism is problematic when projected back into
musical history. The official history describes the genre's rise as
a victory of rugged, rustic folk culture over Tin Pan Alley's
high-toned treacle. It was, the story goes, a triumph of the heroic
proletarians who are enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame:
folk singers (Guthrie and Leadbelly), cowboy balladeers (Jimmie
Rodgers and Hank Williams), blues legends (Robert Johnson, Bessie
Smith and Ma Rainey). Though rock 'n' roll has traveled far from
that musical promised land of dust bowls, deltas, Appalachian
valleys and hilltop churches, it has preserved its indomitable
spirit and broadcast its down-home verities to the world.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   This is a lovely story, and there is truth in it; but like most
polemical narratives, rock's myth of origins ignores inconvenient
historical facts: the music's debts to Tin Pan Alley pop. Those
debts exist, and not just in obvious places like the highly crafted
music of the Brill Building and the Motown song-mills. Rock's
power, which _ from Elvis to Bob Dylan to Lauryn Hill _ is so
reliant on the magnetism of superstar performers, could not have
existed were it not for the vaudevillians and crooners who
pioneered that role: Al Jolson, Sophie Tucker, Bing Crosby, Frank
Sinatra. And were it not for George M. Cohan, Jerome Kern, George
Gershwin and, of course, Berlin, rock 'n' roll would simply not
have had a pop-culture flag to capture in the first place. As the
critic Gary Giddins has written: ``To the extent that our lives are
measured in song, we live in the Irving Berlin Era.''
</P>
<P>
   By rock's own criteria, Berlin's populist credentials would seem
to be impeccable. A self-taught musician who never learned musical
notation and could play piano only in the key of F sharp, Berlin
registers with the rock mythology that glorifies ragged garage
bands over slick professionals. There can hardly be a more genuine
working-class hero than the dirt-poor Lower East Side street urchin
who left home and school at 13 and plunged into the Bowery
demimonde, sleeping in flophouses and tenement vestibules, scraping
a living as a song plugger, sometime street busker and, eventually,
singing waiter in a Chinatown brothel and opium den.
</P>
<P>
   But if Berlin's low-born pedigree is unassailable, and his
journey a picaresque that makes Guthrie's hard-knock rambling look
genteel, his crowd-pleasing songs and unembarrassed aspirations
unmask him as the bourgeois that rock culture abhors. Lushly
melodic, unapologetically romantic, mixing slangy colloquialism and
bursts of wit aimed at higher brows, classic Tin Pan Alley pop was
music made for a broad middle-class mainstream of white adults _ an
audience that turned to music not for unvarnished truth, but an
enchanting reflection of its fondest desires and most cherished
illusions.
</P>
<P>
   If the song standards of that pre-civil rights, pre-feminist
epoch strike us today as blithely ethnocentric, it should be
remembered that they were the result of a social struggle in many
ways as significant as those that have inflected rock's history.
Tin Pan Alley was dominated in both its creative and business
spheres by Jews, and the music it gave to the world was the music
of assimilation, a distinctly New World concoction: the result of a
people's terrific striving for social acceptance and a piece of the
American pie. ``God Bless America'' _ that hymn of gratitude
composed by the man born Israel Baline, who arrived at Ellis Island
in 1893 as a 5-year-old refugee from the pogrom-scourged shtetl of
Tyumen in Siberia _ is a milestone of Jewish-American acculturation
matched perhaps only by another Berlin magnum opus, ``White
Christmas'': a symbol of the way in which the Jews who wrote songs
and founded movie studios reinvented American popular culture in
their own image.
</P>
<P>
   Rock culture wants no part of this story of middle-class
arrivistes: it looks past Tin Pan Alley to other ancestors with
more hard-bitten images and more colorful struggles. These days,
those forebears aren't just haunting the pages of rock histories:
they're hip. Spurred by the 1997 rerelease of the seminal
``Anthology of American Folk Music'' _ a collection of recordings
from the '20s and '30s, compiled in 1958 by the musicologist Harry
Smith _ ``primitive'' roots music is hotter than it has been in
decades. This time it isn't just folk aficionados worshipping
Smith's mountain string bands, Piedmont bluesmen and Bible
chanters. The techno star Moby's hit album ``Play'' is filled with
samples from old spirituals, blues and field hollers. At Other
Music, the NoHo temple of record collector chic, shoppers who
jostle to buy the latest drum 'n' bass imports and the new Belle
and Sebastian album can take home ``Prayers From Hell: White Gospel
and Sinners Blues, 1927 to 1940'' and ``American Yodeling: 1911 To
1946,'' and have made the just-released fourth volume of Harry
Smith's anthology one of the store's top sellers. The music's
street credibility is mirrored by the mystique conferred upon it by
rocks mandarins: the critic Greil Marcus has romanticized the
anthology as ``an occult document,'' the mysterious sound of ``the
old, weird America.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a parallel body of recordings in Tin Pan Alley pop _
musical artifacts of an America that is just as old and weird, yet
today is all but forgotten. Those songs, preserved on cylinder
recordings and 78-r.p.m. records, date from the period that
preceded the heyday of the smooth Broadway and Hollywood song
standard: the rambunctious heights of vaudeville, before, during
and just after the First World War. They are the urban equivalent
of the songs found on Harry Smith's anthology: long-lost songs by
long-dead singers, dizzying in their variety and disorientingly
bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's output from the period is representative of that
music's eclecticism: a madcap mix of ethnic parody songs, dance
numbers, syrupy ``high-class'' ballads, ersatz rags, rakish novelty
tunes. The titles alone evoke the freewheeling optimism of an
America being transformed by its big cities, loosening morals, new
immigrants and new machines: ``Keep Away From the Fellow Who Owns
an Automobile,'' ``Jake! Jake! The Yiddisher Ball-Player,'' ``I Was
Aviating Around,'' ``My Wife's Gone to the Country (Hurrah! Hurrah!
Hurrah!),'' ``The Elevator Man Going Up, Going Up, Going Up, Going
Up!''
</P>
<P>
   In these oddball songs, we hear not only pop music being
invented as a mass medium, but a new nation being born: it is
melting-pot music, the sound of a polyglot America emerging from
its Victorian past and striding jauntily into the century it would
claim as its own. This clarion call of modernity was perceived,
quite rightly, as a threat to the cultural dominion of the
Anglo-American middle-class. Tin Pan Alley pop packed as much
anti-establishment menace as the most outre rebel rock: with
unabashed anti-immigrant bias, newspaper pundits thundered about
the threat to public morality posed by the ``suggestive'' lyrics
and manic ragtime-influenced rhythms emerging from New York's
Jewish-run song factories. Some of the first folk music revivals
date from this period, sponsored not by righteous lefties but by
wealthy nativists seeking to bolster the indigenous culture
imperiled by the toxic spread of ``Hebrew Broadway jazz.''
</P>
<P>
   You won't find recordings of those vaudeville tunes at Other
Music. No D.J.s have layered breakbeats over samples from Jolson
78's; no independent record label has released a smartly packaged
compilation of ``Primitive Pop.'' While a new generation of
hipsters learn to treat the songs of Blind Willie Johnson and the
Carter Family as holy writ, vaudeville-era pop, expunged from
American music's official history, languishes in music libraries
and on the shelves of obscure collectors, condemned to the most
inglorious of pop culture oblivions: it is nostalgia music, the
secret joy of a few crackpot old-timers.
</P>
<P>
   The blame for this historiographical mess cannot be ascribed
solely to rock culture: there has been plenty of provincialism to
go around. In the 1950s, when rock 'n' roll dislodged Tin Pan Alley
pop from cultural center stage, the shrillest rhetoric came from
the older generation. In 1958, Frank Sinatra called rock 'n' roll
``the most brutal, ugly, desperate, vicious form of expression it
has been my misfortune to hear.'' Berlin, in a fit of petulance,
tried to stop radio stations from playing Elvis Presley's recording
of ``White Christmas.'' There is more than a hint of tin-eared
snobbery in today's champions of pop song standards: lurking behind
their paeans to the ``golden age of popular song'' is the
assumption that melodic sophistication and lyrical wit disappeared
from pop music the day rock 'n' roll blazed in, riding a wave of
African-American rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   It is pleasant to think that, in the year 2000, we might get
past all this _ that we'll leave the old resentments and
misapprehensions behind with the old century, and hear that
century's music afresh. It's time to pitch a musical big tent: time
to scold the lover of a Gershwin tune who can't hear the beauty in
James Brown, in the Notorious B.I.G., in Lucinda Williams; time to
celebrate the common tradition that links ``The Yankee Doodle Boy''
and ``Hellhound on My Trail'' and ``Stardust'' and ``Respect'' and
``Smells Like Teen Spirit'' and ``Nuthin' but a G Thang'' and ``God
Bless America'' and ``This Land Is Your Land.''
</P>
<P>
   As we approach the first Independence Day of the new millennium,
those two great national anthems of the American century are a
reminder that, despite decades-long attempts to reduce it to genre
myths and freight it with false politics, American pop music won't
be tamed. It is, like our fondest hopes for the country that
produced it, an improbably eclectic, wildly democratic thing: one
grand, raffish, indivisible musical tradition, made for you and me.

THE ELECTRIFYING, THREATENING POWER OF `STRANGE MUSIC' 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 2) 
(David Margolick, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair, is the
author of ``Strange Fruit: Billie Holiday, Cafe Society and an
Early Cry for Civil Rights.'') 
 By DAVID MARGOLICK    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his song ``What's Really Going On (Strange Fruit),'' released
earlier this year, the rhythm-and-blues singer Dwayne Wiggins
alludes to an ordeal that has become all too familiar to many
blacks. As Wiggins sat chatting with a friend in front of a club in
Oakland, Calif., not long ago, a policeman approached him and,
without provocation, yanked him out of his car, placed him in a
choke hold and ordered him to spit out whatever was in his mouth.
The policeman thought it was drugs. In fact, it was Evian.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the lyrics to ``What's Really Going On,'' a cry of pain
and a plea for understanding, come directly from Wiggins, who was
nominated for a Grammy as a member of Tony, Toni, Tone in 1994. But
as his story unfolds, a chorus chimes in insistently in the
background, repeating a familiar refrain from another songwriter
and another singer in another era. ``Southern trees bear strange
fruit,'' the chorus chants rhythmically, again and again and again.
``Blood on the leaves. Blood on the roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins' theme _ the police practice of racial profiling, or
focusing on suspects strictly because they are black _ could not be
more topical; President Clinton assailed the policy only a few
months ago. But to punctuate his story, to give it some historic
context and bite, Wiggins reaches back to words written more than
60 years ago by a Jewish schoolteacher in the Bronx named Abel
Meeropol, words prompted by a ghastly photograph of a lynching.
These same words electrified audiences when Billie Holiday
introduced them at Cafe Society, New York's first integrated
nightclub, in 1939, then sang them three times nightly, then put
them out on a record. They have reverberated ever since; and for
all the changes in American racial attitudes since those bleak
days, the days before Jackie Robinson, Rosa Parks and the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr., they have never lost their power. ``Strange
Fruit'' is not only one of our first protest songs, but perhaps our
most potent and most durable.
</P>
<P>
   Southern trees bear a strange fruit,
</P>
<P>
   Blood on the leaves and blood at the root,
</P>
<P>
   Black body swinging in the Southern breeze,
</P>
<P>
   Strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.
</P>
<P>
   Few songs stir souls or give goose bumps, at least for very
long. Those that do are usually explicitly political, like the
``Marseillaise'' or the ``Horst Wessel Lied'' or the
``Internationale''; others, like ``Blowin' in the Wind'' or ``This
Land Is Your Land'' or ``If I Had a Hammer,'' seem to capture the
spirit of an age. Neither national anthem nor jazz nor pop nor
folk, ``Strange Fruit'' falls into a category all its own. Though
others songs, like ``Black and Blue'' or ``Supper Time,'' might vie
for the title, it can claim to be the first civil rights protest
song _ even, as the record producer Ahmet Ertegun has put it, ``the
beginning of the civil rights movement.'' ``Strange Fruit'' may not
have been on the soundtrack as the Freedom Riders boarded buses or
college students registered black Mississippians or marchers
marched from Selma to Montgomery; ``We Shall Overcome,'' more
optimistic and upbeat, better fit the zeitgeist. But it was the
song which, by confronting racial injustice in the starkest
possible terms at a time when it simply hadn't penetrated popular
culture, inspired many to march in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, many people think that Holiday herself wrote
``Strange Fruit'' or had it written for her _ a myth fostered by
Holiday herself and exacerbated by the egregiously unreliable film
``Lady Sings the Blues,'' which depicts Holiday happening upon a
lynching, then magically hatching the lyrics for the song. In fact,
Meeropol _ known professionally as Lewis Allan and more famous,
perhaps, for adopting the two orphaned sons of Ethel and Julius
Rosenberg _ first published ``Strange Fruit'' as a poem in 1937, in
the magazine of the New York teachers' union. Initially set to
music by Meeropol himself, the song was performed in left-wing
circles _ for instance, at rallies for the Loyalists during the
Spanish Civil War _ before it found its way to Holiday; others,
including Holiday, may have later tinkered with the music.
</P>
<P>
   All of 23 years old when she first sang it, Holiday, who had
never tackled anything remotely political before, quickly made it
one of her signature songs, and her renditions took on additional
power and pathos as her own life spun increasingly out of control.
Unlike so many other protest songs, which have come to sound shrill
or quaint or dated over time, ``Strange Fruit'' has survived
because of its expansive metaphorical possibilities. The strange
fruit of which Meeropol wrote no longer hangs from the poplar
trees; in fact, lynchings had almost entirely disappeared from the
American landscape by the time he composed the song. But with
visions of James Byrd Jr. (dragged from the back of a pickup truck
in Jasper, Texas), Amadou Diallo, Patrick Dorismond, Abner Louima
and other blacks killed or maimed by whites in a shocking fashion
freshly in our minds _ along with the grisly murder of Matthew
Shepard, a gay college student in Wyoming _ what ``Strange Fruit''
evokes doesn't seem like ``only yesterday''; it seems like today
and, unfortunately, tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   That surely helps explain the large number of blacks attending
``Without Sanctuary,'' an exhibition of lynching photographs at the
New-York Historical Society. James Allen of Atlanta, who put the
collection together, points out that everyone who wants to use
these photographs, whether in a documentary or an article or a
movie, from Jonathan Demme to the rawest college freshman, wants to
call his project ``Strange Fruit.'' ``It's at the core of
everything when it comes to lynching,'' he said of the song.
</P>
<P>
   It also helps explain why, after many years in which versions of
``Strange Fruit'' by Billie Holiday, Josh White and Nina Simone
were the only ones around, the song has been picked up by a host of
performers, including Siouxsie and the Banshees, UB40, Abbey
Lincoln, Dee Dee Bridgewater and Cassandra Wilson. With few
exceptions _ Sting being perhaps the most notable _ only blacks
have tackled the song; they often do so with reservations, both
because of the painfulness of the subject and the lengthy shadow
that Holiday herself still casts over it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Wiggins said he knew the phrase ``strange fruit'' _ ``It was
always something we just said in the 'hood,'' he recalled _ but
didn't think he actually knew the song until his run-in with the
police. Only then did he realize that the song, all of it, had
somehow worked its way into his subconscious. ``When it came to a
hook, when it came to writing things down, I just thought, `This
thing is like `Strange Fruit,''' he said. ``They're not hanging us
by ropes but they're cutting off everything else around us.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastoral scene of the gallant South,
</P>
<P>
   The bulging eyes and the twisted mouth,
</P>
<P>
   Scent of magnolia sweet and fresh,
</P>
<P>
   And the sudden smell of burning flesh!
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 years later, the experience of hearing Billie
Holiday sing ``Strange Fruit,'' particularly on the original 1939
Commodore recording (readily available on CD) remains startling.
Meeropol later said that when he first sang her the song, she
appeared unmoved, even uncomprehending: The only thing she asked
him was what the word ``pastoral'' meant. Listening to her, though,
she sounds utterly confident, convinced and convincing. She is grim
and purposeful, yet still with a lovely lightness to her voice, and
with none of the cracks and scratches that were to appear only a
few years later. Her overt editorializing is minimal; there is no
weepiness, nor histrionics. Her elocution is superb, with but a
hint of a Southern accent; her tone is languorous but unflinching,
raw yet somehow smooth, youthful yet somehow worldly. The
prevailing sentiment is not grief or defeat but cockiness and
contempt, detectable as she spits out her sarcastic references to
Southern gallantry and the sweetly scented magnolias. Some, like
Paul Robeson, thought ``Strange Fruit'' defeatist, and so it might
have seemed in her later, more poignant performances of it; in its
original incarnation, though, it was a call to arms.
</P>
<P>
   For people like Steven Bright of the Southern Center for Human
Rights in Atlanta, who plays ``Strange Fruit'' to his law students
each year at Emory, Harvard and Yale, it still is. For Bright, who
litigates capital cases throughout the South, the death penalty is,
in its arbitrariness and terror and disproportionate impact on
poor, uneducated blacks, ``the first cousin of lynching.'' And
``Strange Fruit'' is not just some historic curiosity. ``It just
hits like a sledgehammer,'' he said of the song. Leon Litwack, the
Pulitzer Prize-winning historian of African-American life after the
Civil War at the University of California at Berkeley, also plays
it in his classes. ``The song unnerves us because it depicts
unspeakable atrocities meted out by people very much like
ourselves, and justified in the name of Christianity and a belief
system that defines one group of human beings as less human than
another,'' he said. ``I should say defines, because it's really not
past tense. The whole notion that being black by itself incurs
risks in our society _ that's not a matter of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Collecting information for my book, I spoke to dozens of people
who heard Billie Holiday sing the song, either in person or on
record, and were forever changed by the experience. Lena Horne, who
as a young girl touring with her mother in a tent show was spirited
away from a Florida town where a lynching had just occurred, was
one such witness. ``Nobody could say the words even as Holiday
did,'' she recently told Sara Fishko of WNYC in New York. ``It
wasn't about singing. It was about feeling things artfully in your
soul. I sang it for many days in my life until I was able to
understand it was part of our country's problem as well as it was
mine. I don't mean I sang it out loud. I just sang it in myself, in
my heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is a fruit for the crows to pluck,
</P>
<P>
   For the rain to gather, for the wind to suck,
</P>
<P>
   For the sun to rot, for a tree to drop,
</P>
<P>
   Here is a strange and bitter crop.
</P>
<P>
   So unusual, so potent, so threatening was ``Strange Fruit'' that
for years it existed in a kind of artistic quarantine: Rarely
played on the radio, hard to find in record stores, difficult to
perform in all but the most politically congenial locales.
Holiday's normal label, Columbia, refused to record it, forcing her
to go to the far more obscure Commodore (owned by Milt Gabler,
Billy Crystal's uncle); even progressive disk jockeys were
reluctant to put it on their play lists. Rarely would Holiday
perform it down South. In the 1950s, a Miami nightclub owner
ordered her to desist after it prompted a walkout by indignant
white patrons; Holiday herself said she was once run out of Mobile,
Ala., for performing it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it can be sung anywhere with disconcerting, and perhaps
misleading, ease. Francine Reed, who sings regularly with Lyle
Lovett, offered up her own rendition of ``Strange Fruit'' when I
signed books in Atlanta in May, to an entirely appreciative
audience. When Cassandra Wilson, who recorded ``Strange Fruit'' on
her Grammy Award-winning album ``New Moon Daughter'' in 1996,
performed in Atlanta around the same time, she was surprised by how
many people shouted out requests for the song. Its popularity, she
theorized, reflected a growing willingness among both blacks and
whites to face their respective pasts. ``We know deep inside that
it's an issue we have to confront,'' she said. (Still, the song is
not to everyone's taste: When United Airlines selected ``New Moon
Daughter'' for its in-flight entertainment, it excised ``Strange
Fruit'' from the album.)
</P>
<P>
   That ``Strange Fruit'' still packs an extraordinary punch became
apparent at my book party in New York, held at the site of the
original Cafe Society in Greenwich Village. (The space is now used
by the Axis Theater Company.) We tried to stage the song just as
Barney Josephson, the left-wing former shoe salesman who owned Cafe
Society, had originally decreed _ the better, he said, to make
people ``get their insides burned with it.'' Now as then,
everything stopped and all the lights went down, save for a
pinpoint on the performer, a young black woman named Melissa
Walker. An eerie silence had followed Holiday's first performance
of ``Strange Fruit'' in this very place, she later recalled; no one
had known quite how to react. Now, for the first time in 60 years,
the sounds of ``Strange Fruit'' once again filled the room, and
when Walker completed her task, singing of that ``strange and
bitter crop,'' another awkward interval uncannily ensued.

   How many songs have silenced so many rooms for so long?

 &HT;    `Patriot' long on jingoism, and just plain long
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mel Gibson single-handedly wins the American Revolution, among
other historical revisions in ``The Patriot.'' As cliched as it is
long (very), the latest from Roland Emmerich takes the jingoistic
spirit of his ``Independence Day'' and amps it to a feverish,
flag-waving pitch. The movie is beautiful on the eye and crafted
with great care. But it relies on oversimplification, cheap
sentiment and a villain so two-dimensionally nasty even Satan
wouldn't claim him.
</P>
<P>
   It will be an enormous hit.
</P>
<P>
   Think of ``Braveheart'' in knee breeches (though that was the
far better movie). As in that Oscar-winner, Gibson is battling evil
Brits. He can't be very welcome in London these days.
</P>
<P>
   He plays Benjamin Martin, loosely based on the historic ``Swamp
Fox,'' Francis Marion (only with Marion's alleged ickier traits,
like racism and rape, expunged). Single father of seven, he's a
stern South Carolina farmer who initially resists his neighbors'
talk of raising arms against the British. It's 1776.
</P>
<P>
   A hero of the French and Indian War, Martin changes his pacifist
ideals after his home is engulfed one night in a skirmish between
Brits and Yanks. The scene fills the dusky farmyard with flashes of
gunpowder and scurrying figures. There's a spooky, mesmerizing
grandeur to this scene, and it's one of the very few in the movie
that ends too soon.
</P>
<P>
   Converting his house into a makeshift clinic for the wounded,
Martin the next day encounters the movie's uber-cad, British Col.
Tavington (Jason Isaacs), whose ruthless sneer is matched only by
his butchery of Americans _ soldiers, women, even children.
</P>
<P>
   Watch out, Tav, 'cause the Revolution just got personal.
</P>
<P>
   A virtual one-man Brit-buster, Martin begins a campaign against
the enemy, starting with one of the movie's most riveting, morally
complex scenes. He arms two of his young sons, barely taller than
the rifles he hands them, and ambushes a company of British
soldiers in the woods. The carnage thrills one boy, traumatizes the
other; he shrinks from this newly revealed, bloodthirsty version of
his father.
</P>
<P>
   The script flirts with, then abandons, its most interesting
idea: that Martin's skills as a killer and strategist threaten to
lose him the love of the family he's trying to save. His soul might
be lost as well. His youngest girl refuses even to speak to him
(but in typical fashion, that conflict is resolved in a teary burst
of sentiment).
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Gibson is very good, a convincing man of action
with a dangerous streak. But his role gets more cartoonish as the
movie continues to stack the deck. Bad things happen to Martin's
family and friends, in order to justify his vengeance, and to make
us feel safe about rooting for his vigilante bloodlust. ``The
Patriot'' is less ``Braveheart'' than a revenge fantasy in costume.
Think of Charles Bronson with a ponytail, and you're on the right
track.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay saddles Martin with a dark secret, letting Gibson
deliver a somber monologue much like Robert Shaw's USS Indianapolis
speech from ``Jaws.'' We also watch him handle some slapstick with
a chair, a bit meant to make Martin goofy and endearing. And
there's not one but two tepid romances to appeal to couples
watching the flick on a date night.
</P>
<P>
   Like the movie he's in, Martin's character is cobbled together
from time-tested, profitable bits and pieces. You can almost hear
the committee of Screenwriting 101 script docs, shouting
instructions to writer Robert Rodat, who stuffs the film with
elements designed to please as many demographics as possible.
</P>
<P>
   This is a reconstructed South where the black figures are noble
freedmen or slaves who so love the little blond children they tend,
they don't seem to have much interest in liberty. The exception is
a token slave fighting with the militia to secure his freedom; he
exists mainly to widen audience appeal. The women characters exist
only to hector the men into action, or, in the case of Joely
Richardson as Gibson's comely sister-in-law, to gaze at the star
longingly with her blond hair back-lit like honey.
</P>
<P>
   The battle scenes are undeniably rousing. Emmerich enjoys the
tight confusion of conflict, the point-of-view shots as a
cannonball rips off a solder's head. And there's a courteously
tense battle of wills between Martin and Gen. Cornwallis (Tom
Wilkinson, in a slow-burn performance) as the soldier negotiates
the release of his captured fellow militiamen. The scene ends with
a zinger of a punchline, though it makes you wonder how this
rag-tag band of fighters has the resources and time to manufacture
the objects used in their prank. (Don't worry, I won't give it
away.)
</P>
<P>
   Breathtaking scenes
</P>
<P>
   What makes the script's tired manipulations even more
frustrating is the great care that's been brought to the movie's
visuals. Cinematographer Caleb Deschanel (``Anna and the King'')
shoots many scenes at magic hour, the golden times of sunset and
sunrise; some of his images, such as the endless lines of soldiers
advancing on each other in the sunlight, are breathtaking. (The
film was shot on location, in South Carolina.) Another asset is
Australian actor Heath Ledger as Martin's headstrong son Gabriel,
blending thoughtfulness and idealism (and covering the teen
audience demo).
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ``The Patriot'' packages history like a luxe
consumer product, reducing the Revolution to mano-a-mano melodrama
less complicated than a Batman movie. Did I mention that it will be
a hit?
</P>
<P>
   ``The Patriot''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C +
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mel Gibson, Heath Ledger, Jason Isaacs. Rated R for
strong war violence.2 hours, 44 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: A rousing but depressingly heavy-handed retelling
of the American Revolution.
</P>

 &HT;    `Survivor' mania: Some sequels we would like to see
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Your lawn is on life support, it costs a month's mortgage to
fill up your gas tank, the dot.coms (and your portfolio) are
self-destructing.
</P>
<P>
   But how will you remember the summer of 2000?
</P>
<P>
   As the summer of ``Survivor.'' The CBS
pseudo-sort-of-not-really-reality show has a hammerlock on the
nation's limited attention span as we tune in in ever-increasing
millions at 8 p.m. Wednesdays to see the scrappy little teams of
castaways whack yet another of their own (last week's edition was
the No. 1 show in the nation).
</P>
<P>
   Consider it ``The Sopranos'' without the ziti.
</P>
<P>
   Age discrimination, roasted rat, hanky-panky, sour grapes,
tribal councils, silly challenges _ what a bizarre recipe for a
runaway hit. Whatever happened to the tried-and-true old formulas
for breakout television, like giving Regis Philbin a trivia show?
</P>
<P>
   CBS already is planning ``Survivor II: The Australian Outback''
for early next year. But what's unclear is whether ``Survivor'' is
a show that can roll on endlessly with minor tweaking, much like
``60 Minutes,'' or whether it's one of those fads we briefly
embrace and then toss aside, like the hula hoop, Rubik's Cube or
Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe what CBS needs to do is up the ante for the next round of
``Survivor.'' Maybe it needs to take unsolicited advice from TV
columnists. Or maybe not. Here are some suggestions anyway.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Celebrity Survivor'' _ The best week ever of ``Who Wants to
Be a Millionaire'' was when the celebrities played during the May
sweeps period. ``Celebrity Survivor'' would have some logistical
problems, but the money it would make would overcome all obstacles.
Guarantee the celebs $10 mill apiece for charity; CBS would still
make money like Minute Maid makes orange juice.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, of course, is to bypass B-list celebs (sorry, Craig
Kilborn) and go big. And controversial. And sexy. And
confrontational. And egotistical. And a mix. Like this:
</P>
<P>
   The guys: Pete Rose, Ted Turner, Eminem, Slobodan Milosevic,
Johnnie Cochran, Jerry Seinfeld, Tom Green and Snoop Dogg.
</P>
<P>
   The gals: Marisleysis Gonzalez, Ellen DeGeneres, Christiane
Amanpour, Kathie Lee Gifford, Jennifer Lopez, Julia Child, Sarah
Michelle Gellar and Rosie O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Presidential Survivor'' _ Every four years, more people
repeat the cliche ``Is this any way to pick a president?'' than
actually vote. ``Presidential Survivor'' at least gives us a new
approach.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 version, Al Gore, George W. Bush and Pat Buchanan
are all sent to a deserted island. Tempting as it may be to just
leave them there and not even bother making a TV show, each
candidate is instead given a team to whip into shape. Can Gore's
group make a bonfire? Can Bush's bunch catch a fish? Can Buchanan
stop sputtering when he finds out his team is all recent
immigrants?
</P>
<P>
   When it's over, America votes via 900 number. It's up to CBS to
work through the inevitable nitpickers who say it's
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Suburban Survivor'' _ Sixteen hardy souls are set up in
homes in Alpharetta. Each is given three young children, two of
whom have swimming lessons at different pools at exactly the same
time; a baby sitter who's as trustworthy as a Bill Clinton
deposition; a major, road-hoggin' sport-utility vehicle with
one-sixteenth of a tank of gas left; and a magnificent, lush lawn
that must be maintained with a single garden hose amid neighbors on
the lookout for watering violators.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Nicotine Survivor'' _ You want to see folks acting like
eight wet cats in a burlap sack? You want to see people put forth
absurd effort to win a single challenge? This version would be the
same ``Survivor'' as the current one, except everyone on the island
is a pack-a-day smoker marooned without cigarettes. All of the
challenges are for cartons of Marlboros and Zippo lighters.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``NRA Survivor'' _ ``Survivor'' originally was a Swedish TV
show called ``Expedition Robinson.'' If we're going to take these
shows and Americanize them, let's do it right. Arm all the
participants to the teeth. ``Survivor'' would stay No. 1 _ with a
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Survivor''

 &HT;    Little known facts about the army
 &HT;    By Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QR;  The red shield: Dates from 1896 and serves as the trademark
for the army's social services. It represents ``a fight on the
spiritual battlefield which must last as long as life itself.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Salvation Army flag is the only flag, other than the U.S.
flag, to have flown on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The red kettle: The Christmas kettle debuted in San Francisco
in 1891 in the guise of a crab pot. A depression had thrown many
out of work, including hundreds of seamen and longshoremen. The
campaign proved so successful that by 1900 it was imitated
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Uniforms: The uniform identifies its wearer as a member
(soldier) of the army who is available and approachable by anyone
in need. The original uniforms were modeled on the British army.
The uniform consists of navy blue serge woolen pants or skirt, a
navy blue serge tunic, white cotton shirt or blouse, and tie (there
are several choices). Made exclusively by and for Salvation Army
soldiers, they cost about $300. They are worn to work and to
official or service functions. In warmer countries, the uniforms
tend to be lighter, including tan, beige and white. In the early
days, women wore high collars and bonnets and skirts down to the
ankles; now skirts are several inches below the knees. Bonnets went
out in the 1970s, replaced by caps (left).
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Strike up the band: Around 1884 a young Salvation Army woman
conducting open-air services in Salisbury, England, had to cope
with tomatoes and rocks thrown by unappreciative onlookers. Taking
pity, a non-Salvationist man and his three sons brought their brass
instruments, surrounded her and accompanied her as she sang hymns.
Soon the idea spread to army street meetings elsewhere. Bands would
perform religious songs set to secular tunes, among them ``Marching
to Georgia.'' The army now has the largest catalog of sacred
instrumental music in the world, with 10,000 titles of brass band
music, many symphonic in scope. There are about 2,500 Salvation
Army brass bands worldwide. Some are very good, but, says Lt. Col.
Tom Jones of national headquarters in Alexandria, Va.,``In all
candor, we also have some of the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Rose Bowl Parade: Since the 1920s, a Salvation Army brass band
from Southern California has marched in the Rose Bowl Parade. It
always performs ``Onward, Christian Soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Famous composers: John Philip Sousa wrote ``The Salvation Army
March'' in 1930. British composer Ralph Vaughan Williams wrote
``Prelude on Three Welsh Hymn Tunes'' for the army in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Recordings: Bands have made hundreds of recordings. After July
10, call 1-800-786-7372 for a catalog. Or visit the army store,
1424 N.E. Expressway, 9 a.m.-4 p.m. weekdays. Or go to
www.musosmedia.com/au/salvatio.htm.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Stars: Philip Smith (left), the New York Philharmonic's
principal trumpeter, also performs every Sunday in his army church
in Montclair, N.J.; Charles Baker, principal trombonist of the New
Jersey Symphony; and Mark Ridenour, assistant principal trumpeter
of the Chicago Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Dallas Cowboys running back Emmitt Smith (right) learned to
play at an army community center in Florida. Basketball star ``Dr.
J'' Julius Erving learned basketball at a Salvation Army camp.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Movies: Actors Clark Gable, Cary Grant, Frank Sinatra, Marlon
Brando, Mae West and Joan Crawford have appeared in movies with
army characters. The best known is the 1955 film version of the
Broadway musical ``Guys and Dolls.'' Brando has a romance with a
female officer (Jean Simmons), modeled on a real New York crusader,
Rheba Crawford, the ``Angel of Broadway.''

 &HT;    Salvation Army ventures into new territory with conference and
parade in Atlanta
 &HT;    By Gayle White and Derrick Henry
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Some 136 years after a certain Northern army left
Atlanta charred, the city is under invasion again. But the only
blaze this bunch hopes to ignite is the flame of the Holy Spirit.
</P>
<P>
   About the time Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman and his troops were
marching through Georgia, Gen. William Booth and his wife,
Catherine, were marshaling forces to attack sin in London. Booth's
brigades became the Salvation Army, now 1 million strong in 107
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Today more than 20,000 soldiers and officers of Booth's army are
gathering at the Georgia World Congress Center and Philips Arena
for the first International Congress of the Salvation Army to be
held outside headquarters in Great Britain. On Friday, they will
march down Peachtree Street beginning at noon.
</P>
<P>
   Already military sounds are wafting through the city. In the CNN
Center at noon on Tuesday, the Hendon Band of London, one of the
army's premier brass bands, played to a lunchtime crowd. Other army
bands will play there at noon today and Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're excellent, just excellent,'' said Earl Blauer
of Hays, Kan., who is in town with his wife, Roann, attending a
computer convention for educators. Blauer knows his music. He's a
former high school band director.
</P>
<P>
   The performers make their way through the old hymn ``This Is My
Story'' with a bit of a Latin beat, raise the rafters with the
``William Tell Overture'' and move into another number named for
some people a bit less famous than William Tell _ outside Salvation
Army circles, that is. It's called ``The Gowans and Larson
Overture, Too,'' and it's made up of some of the greatest hits of
the 10 musicals written by the army's present leader, Gen. John
Gowans, and his second-in-command, John Larson.
</P>
<P>
   Gowans writes the lyrics, Larson the tunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's Sullivan. I'm definitely Gilbert,'' said Gowans. Gowans
was at the Marriott Marquis Tuesday afternoon, giving a speech on
behalf of the metro Atlanta army. His talk focused on the women of
the army, and he quoted founder Booth, who reportedly said, ``Some
of my best men are women.''
</P>
<P>
   The congress in Atlanta gives army personnel a chance to
celebrate and to refocus on the basics of their faith, Gowans said.
And just pulling off the meeting is a ``miracle,'' he said. The
army in wealthier parts of the world helps subsidize or completely
fund the travel of people from impoverished areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good investment,'' said the general. ``If the
Salvationists go home with a clearer idea of what they're doing and
a better idea of how to do it, the whole world benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Out on the streets of Atlanta and in its hotel lobbies, the
world was already mingling. Female Indian Salvationists in navy
saris with white blouses underneath stand at the top of an
escalator at the Marriott Marquis near other Salvationist women
with the Western version of the uniform _ navy skirts a few inches
below the knee with their white blouses.
</P>
<P>
   In the same hotel, Lt. Col. Amos Makina, 52, is stylishly
dressed in full regalia in his country's tan Army outfit. Makina,
who is heading a contingent of 150 Salvationists from Zimbabwe,
grew up in a non-Christian family, but went to live with his uncle,
a soldier of the Salvation Army, when he was 12. He was drawn in by
the music, he says. Now, he's executive chaplain of 50 Territorial
Songsters from Africa who will perform at various congress events.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone in uniform is a Salvationist.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is this Salvation Army?'' asks Lt. Yozo Matkovich,
walking downtown with half a dozen white-uniformed men. Matkovich
is a Croatian naval officer who has been in Athens, Ga., for
training.
</P>
<P>
   Out in Centennial Olympic Park, Gary Noland from Warren, Mich.,
kept an eye on some friends' children playing in the fountain and
served as an unofficial, informal greeting committee for other
Salvationists headed through the park on their way to register for
the congress.
</P>
<P>
   In shorts and a purple T-shirt with sleeves rolled up, he
presented a contrast to Lt. Klilliqui Sackie and David Bainda of
Liberia, in dark pants, dark shoes and white shirts with the
epaullets of the army on their shoulders. As an officer, or ordaine
a good ministry there.''
</P>
<P>
   The congress is also a family affair for Capt. Hildegard Anthun
Orsnes of Bergen, Norway. She's here with her husband, two
children, her father, mother and mother-in-law. But social worker
Orsnes, 38, treats the whole army as kinfolks.
</P>
<P>
   Every few seconds, she greets someone in German, French,
Norwegian, English or French Creole (she served seven years in the
Caribbean).
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, you really experience the Salvation Army as an
international organization,'' she says. ``Whether you are from a
tiny church in Haiti or a big place like Atlanta, this feels like
family.''
</P>

BRAZIL'S MEDIA ANTICIPATE DEREGULATION, EYEING INVESTMENT,
EXPANSION 
</HEADLINE>
   By JENNIFER L. RICH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAO PAULO, Brazil _ Brazil's Congress is scheduled to vote
Wednesday on a constitutional amendment that would allow foreigners
to invest in the country's media companies, ending a prohibition
that has lasted for 66 years.
</P>
<P>
   If the amendment is passed, Brazil's media companies may be one
step closer to the financing they need to keep up with
technological advances that are revolutionizing print and broadcast
businesses elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are investments that will make the growth and
development of the whole industry possible,'' said Paulo Machado de
Carvalho Neto, vice president of the Brazilian Association of Radio
and Television Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, which has been circulating in Congress for the
last two years, has broad-based support.
</P>
<P>
   It would allow foreigners to own up to 30 percent of radio and
television stations, newspaper and magazine publishers. Opposition
groups, including unions and leftist parties that are normally
against foreign investment in important Brazilian industries, have
been largely mollified by the relatively low investment that will
be permitted and a clause that prevents foreigners from assuming
any control over editorial content.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the amendment would let Brazilian companies for the first
time own 30 percent of radio and television stations and 100
percent of publishing houses. The current wording of the
constitution allows only Brazilian-born private citizens to own
media outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's media regulations date to 1934, when post-World War I
nationalism spurred the government to enact laws that would protect
the country from what was then considered undue influence by
foreign powers. A succession of military leaders kept the
legislation in place through the 1970s and 1980s. By the time
Brazil's government and economy started loosening controls on
business in the 1990s, privately owned media businesses were
already hampered by high lending rates and large debts, with
nowhere to turn except to other wealthy individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Since media groups are all privately owned, the exact
indebtedness of the industry is unknown, but the information that
has found its way into the market suggests deep-seated financial
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, companies have a high level of indebtedness,
outstanding debts with the government and with the social security
system,'' said Haroldo de Britto, an economist at Goes &AMP;
Consultores, a consulting firm in Brasilia. ``In some cases, they
are almost buried.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there was some concern about whether Congress would
have enough members on the floor this week to vote on the amendment
winter recess looms, there was little doubt that it would
eventually be passed. Media companies are already starting to
navigate through a breach in the law by selling off interests in
their online publishing ventures.
</P>
<P>
   Organizacoes Globo, the leading Brazilian media company,
recently sold a 30 percent stake in its online news portal
Globo.com to Telecom Italia for $810 million, while Universo
Online, an internet news and entertainment portal owned by
publishing companies Folha Group and Editora Abril, is planning an
initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially betting that the amendment will pass, the country's
media giants are preparing for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Editora Abril, which publishes more than 200 magazines,
including the world's fourth-largest news weekly, Veja, already
audits its finances as if it were a public company in preparation
for the opening of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Globo, which, along with the Folha Group, started the country's
second national business newspaper, Valor Economico, earlier this
year with an initial investment of $50 million, has already
announced that it is actively seeking foreign partners to bring
content and capital to the publication. Globo also has plans to
launch an initial public offering as early as next year.
</P>
<P>
   The country's smaller media outlets are likely to gain the most
from changes in the law. Brazil has more than 3,000 radio stations,
most of them independent and suffering from a shortage of funding.
With the help of the new legislation, the radio stations are
expected to consolidate into chains that would have stronger
financial potential to improve technology and offer wider coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen this development in the United States and
elsewhere,'' said Machado de Carvalho Neto of the broadcasters
association. ``If you begin to value the industry, it winds up
creating a positive situation for the businesses, the investors,
and principally, the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Smaller television networks, which see advertising revenue and
credit availability suffer under the shadow of the TV Globo empire,
will also gain more access to capital.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need technological know-how to be able to accompany the
process of digitalization that will reach us in three or four
years,'' said Flavio Cavalcante Jr., director at SBT Television,
one of the major national network channels. ``This demands a huge
amount of resources. We want to have the option to form a
partnership with an international company at some time in the
future.''

   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ Desperate for jobs and fed up with
state-sanctioned violence, the people of Zimbabwe voted in a new
democratic era in last weekend's parliamentary election, breaking
President Robert Mugabe's 20-year lock on power with a clear demand
for more accountable government, election results showed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Zimbabwe African National Union (Patriotic Front), which
ruled virtually unopposed since independence in 1980, lost nearly
half of its elected seats and saw its senior ranks plundered. More
than 10 ministers and deputy ministers, half of whom formed
Mugabe's innermost circle, were tossed out.
</P>
<P>
   The party won 62 seats, just five more than the 57 taken by an
upstart opposition movement formed only nine months ago. A tiny
third party captured one seat.
</P>
<P>
   In a stark measure of the change that has taken place, Mugabe's
party held 147 of 150 seats in the previous parliament. Now, even
with its cushion of 30 unelected seats, the ruling party no longer
holds a two-thirds majority. For the first time, Mugabe will not be
able to amend the constitution without bipartisan support.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of serious politics _ serious democratic
politics _ in this country,'' said Washington Sansole, a former
High Court judge. ``The message to the ruling party is, `Your time
is up.' The young generations do not accept the status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Movement for Democratic Change planned to contest
the results in at least 20 districts where, it alleged, severe
political violence prevented its candidates from campaigning
freely. But political analysts expressed hope that the roughly
balanced outcome would dampen prospects for post-election violence
from either side.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the nation Tuesday night, Mugabe made no reference to
the results, observing only that ``our next parliament is certainly
destined to prove very lively.''
</P>
<P>
   On a continent marred by decades of stolen elections, military
coups d'etat, and autocratic rule, Zimbabwe's election posted a
rare triumph of the ballot box over brutality. A new generation,
removed from their parent's struggle against colonialism, defied
widespread violence and voiced its anger over corruption and
economic mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   The election was marred by four months of intimidation as
pro-government thugs invaded white-owned farms and beat black
farmworkers they suspected of supporting the opposition. At least
30 people died in the violence. Every candidate from the rival
party faced attack; one fled the country for safety, others were
hospitalized. The European Union's election monitoring team
concluded the elections could not be free and fair, given the
pre-ballot atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   But the two days of voting proceeded smoothly. Nearly 65 percent
of the 5 million registered voters cast ballots. And international
observers cited few serious flaws in the counting process.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Poland after the results were announced Tuesday, UN
Secretary General Kofi Annan praised the Zimbabwean people for
their calm. ``I think the election in Zimbabwe was very closely
fought,'' he said in Warsaw. ``The people have spoken. We must
accept their will and I rejoice with them.''
</P>
<P>
   In London, British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook urged Mugabe to
discuss with the opposition ``how, in light of this vote, they can
work together for the people of Zimbabwe.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign was Zimbabwe's first real contest between competing
ideals. Mugabe exploited the racially imbalanced issue of land
ownership, the crux of the 1970s bush war against colonialism.
Roughly 4,500 white farmers own most of the best agricultural land,
while much of the black majority subsists on scrappy communal
plots. The president lashed out at the British government _
Zimbabwe's former colonial power _ for failing to finance land
reform, and encouraged veterans of the liberation war to invade
white-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,300 farms were raided, but neither land nor race
appeared to swing voters. All but one white opposition candidate,
most of whom ran in urban districts, won seats, including a white
farmer in a rural district near the border with Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition, meanwhile, focused on the economy, railing
against corruption and Zimbabwe's misery index _ inflation,
unemployment, and interest rates all soar above 50 percent. The
party also tapped discontent over Mugabe's military adventures in
Congo, where for nearly two years he has been spending millions of
dollars every month to maintain 11,000 troops in defense of
President Laurent Kabila. That initiative, economists say, has
drained foreign exchange reserves in Zimbabwe, precipitating acute
fuel shortages across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition swept the urban vote, where better educated
voters were isolated from the farm attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But violence almost certainly prevented the ruling party from
losing more seats than it did, political analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The election offered some surprises. Opposition leader Morgan
Tsvangirai, the fiery trade-unionist, lost in his attempt to win a
seat in parliament. Brushing off the defeat, he said his ability to
campaign throughout the district was frustrated by violence, and
that in any event he remained leader of the party and would now
concentrate on the 2002 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, eight of the opposition's 10 women candidates
emerged victorious.
</P>
<P>
   In a sharp rebuke of the ruling party, Justice Minister Emmerson
Mnangagwa, the man often tipped to be Mugabe's eventual successor,
was trounced. Chenjerai Hunzvi, the controversial leader of the war
veterans who masterminded the farm violence ahead of the elections,
won his district.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the ruling party's losses, Hunzvi called Tuesday for
internal reforms. ``Clearly there is a revolution taking place. The
party has to rejuvenate. To meet the challenge we need an overhaul
from the grassroots to the top,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond establishing the first two-party legislature in
Zimbabwe's history, the election immediately set up a fierce battle
for the presidency in two years. The opposition does not have
enough seats to impeach Mugabe. But the simple vote split _ 51
percent for the ruling party, 48 percent for the opposition _ has
shown that the president is vulnerable, and could set off a panic
inside the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the night opposition supporters erupted into
spontaneous celebrations, dancing in the streets of Harare and
tooting car horns with each set of updated results. When newspapers
hit the streets Tuesday morning, huge crowds swarmed to read the
news.
</P>
<P>
   But by midday, the mood in the capital, a new stronghold of the
opposition, had sobered. People wanted better. ``I'm not happy. My
party didn't have enough time to campaign because of the
violence,'' said Golden Ndlovu, an opposition supporter, looking up
from his checkers board in Freedom Square. ``Soldiers in Congo?
What for? The people are suffering, but Mugabe doesn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sort of happy,'' said Richard Musware, a mechanic. ``We
now have an opposition in the country. The ruling party should wake
up and change the way it is running things.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two parties now settle into the unfamiliar task of
sharing power, those comments reveal the new expectations they will
face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any country that goes through a nationalist struggle goes
through a battle between the liberation loyalties and governance,''
said Strive Masiyiwe, a prominent young businessman who has fought
actively against government corruption. ``Mugabe was kept in power
by what he achieved during the liberation struggle. Now, the basis
of power will be performance.''

 &HT;    Reno stands by her role in Gore investigation
 &HT;    By Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Tuesday once again
defended her handling of the Justice Department's campaign finance
investigation of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Reno appeared before a Senate subcommittee to face largely
skeptical questions from Republican Senators who called on her to
name an outside prosecutor in the department's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Reno refused to say whether she would make such an appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do things based on polls. I do things based on the
law,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's Democratic members, led by Sen. Robert Torricelli
(D-N.J.) defended both Reno and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president may have made some mistakes of judgment,''
Torricelli said. ``I do not believe he made mistakes of law.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's hearing came as a new CNN/USA Today/Gallup of
560 likely voters found Gore trailing Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
52 to 39 percent. A similar CNN poll taken earlier this month
showed Bush leading 48 to 44 percent. The poll's margin of error
was five percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under the now expired independent counsel statute, Reno twice
refused to recommend an independent counsel to investigate alleged
abuses of the Clinton-Gore campaign fund-raising tactics in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is considering another staff recommendation to appoint a
special counsel, this time under internal Justice Department
procedures. Gore's truthfulness in the earlier investigations is
one of the legal issues under review.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate subcommittee was chaired by Sen. Arlen Specter
(R-Pa.), who first disclosed the pending recommendation before Reno
at a news conference last week.
</P>
<P>
   Specter's disclosure prompted Gore to release a 123-page
transcript of an interview conducted April 18 by the head of the
Justice Department's campaign finance task force.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Chris Lehane, Gore's campaign spokesman, released a
caustic statement criticizing Specter for ``McCarthy-like''
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane accused Specter and his Republican allies of turning
Congress ``into a scandal industrial complex designed to
manufacture and create partisan scandals and inflict political
damage on the vice president a mere four months before voters go to
the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Specter reacted angrily to the comments during the committee,
saying he planned to take them up personally with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Specter urged Reno to name an outside counsel to lay the
campaign finance scandal to rest, but even he conceded that it was
probably too late to do so now.
</P>
<P>
   Specter said it was unrealistic to assume that an outside
prosecutor could be put in place before the Democratic National
Convention in August, much less conclude an investigation before
the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that the only alternative America has at this point
in this election is to leave it to the political process,'' Specter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno declined to say why Justice investigators waited until
April 18 to quiz the vice president about the two most
controversial aspects of the fund-raising scandals, the White House
coffees and a fund-raiser attended by Gore at a Buddhist temple in
California in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was interviewed four times before, but never about the
White House coffees, which were attended by Democratic donors, or
the temple fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't discuss the timing because I think that would be
inconsistent with my duties,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno repeatedly urged senators not to jump to conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell me I'm wrong,'' she said. ``But I will have
greater confidence in your telling me I'm wrong when you have all
the facts.''

LAW BARRING GENETIC DISCRIMINATION NOW SEEN AS NEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Activists, legislators and biotech organizations are urging
rapid action to protect the genetic privacy of individuals and to
ban discrimination based on genes, noting that such legislation has
stalled in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The renewed calls for legislation came in the wake of Monday's
announcement that the human genetic blueprint has been nearly
completed, clearing the way for medical tests that could one day
predict future health and illness.
</P>
<P>
   ``This science holds tremendous promise, but many Americans will
refuse to take genetic tests unless they are assured their
information will remain private,'' said Representative Louise
Slaughter, a New York Democrat who has for two years tried to get a
privacy safeguard bill through Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure health insurance companies and employers
won't drop people because they might, or might not, get sick at
some point in the future,'' said Slaughter, whose current genetic
privacy bill, co-sponsored by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, and three
other senators remains bottled up in a Republican-controlled
committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't even answer our letters,'' complained Slaughter in
an interview Tuesday, referring to the House Commerce Committee
Chairman, Virginia Representative Thomas J. Bliley, Jr. ``He says
he's never heard of anyone being discriminated against'' on genetic
grounds, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty states have not passed a genetic privacy bill.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, ``we were on the cutting edge of this issue
when I started working on it four years ago,'' said Representative
Jay Kaufman, a state Democrat who sponsored two current bills, one
involving privacy of genetic information and the other banning
discrimination on the basis of one's genetic makeup.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Meanwhile, ``30 other states have passed us by and already
have'' genetic privacy laws, Kauffman said. ``I find it hard to
understand and very disappointing,'' he added, but noted that some
of the other states' laws are not as comprehensive as the ones
being sought here.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Several bills are pending in the Massachusetts House Committee
on Science and Technology and the Ways and Means Committee, dealing
both with privacy of genetic information and discrimination.
Representative Arthur Broadhurst said it might be possible to pass
a scaled-down bill dealing only with discrimination in health and
disability insurance and employment.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said in an interview, there are concerns about moving
too hastily on genetic privacy legislation because ``we want to
make sure we don't hinder further research'' by medical scientists
who want access to banks of genetic and health data, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Dr. Francis Collins, the leader of the international
team that has mapped most of the DNA information that governs how
the body is built and operates, said, ``Health Insurance companies
should never be able to discriminate against someone based on their
genetic profile. . .we should vigorously strive to protect genetic
confidentiality.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, well-documented cases of genetic discrimination
haven't yet emerged in large numbers. Still, the potential for such
discrimination, as genetic science begins to uncover more and more
DNA sequences predictive of disease, is well-recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates say that already, people are refusing genetic testing
or even health care for genetic conditions because they're afraid
the information will go in their medical records and be used
against them.
</P>
<P>
   The plight of Terri Seargent, a Wilmington, N.C., woman who
believes she was discriminated against, may be a precursor of cases
to come.
</P>
<P>
   Until she was diagnosed with a genetic disease needing treatment
with an expensive drug, Seargent was getting excellent reviews in
her job.
</P>
<P>
   But when her self-insured employer glimpsed her medical bills of
nearly $4,000 a month, that changed. ``I was called into the office
and told my services were no longer needed,'' said Seargent, who
lives in Wilmington, Del.
</P>
<P>
   The 46-year-old clerical worker, battling the lung disease that
killed her brother, has filed a complaint with the Equal Employment
Opportunity Commission under the Americans with Disabilities Act.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between furthering genetic research and protecting
privacy is reflected in the position of the Biotechnology Industry
Organization, which says, `` We urge Congress to pass comprehensive
confidentiality legislation that protects patients, while
facilitating the positive uses of medical information for treating
patients and continuing the
</P>
<P>
   breakthrough scientific achievements that are taking medicine''
into a new era.

world would give researchers a way to manipulate and interpret
scientific findings and aid in the understanding of human diseases.

what we eat. But everyone is always trying to lose weight. Newsweek
moans this week that our kids are too fat. People magazine has just

FOR SINGERS, A NEW AMERICAN WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 2) 
 By ANNE MIDGETTE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The book is called ``Kein' Angst, Baby!'' (``Don't Worry,
Kid!''), and it has a voluptuous Valkyrie sizzling on the cover.
Written for opera singers by opera singers and first published in
1992 by the New York Opera Newsletter, it is a guide to auditioning
in Germany. American singers long regarded the German audition tour
as a useful _ indeed, essential _ career move, and this book helped
the uninitiated negotiate everything from writing a letter to a
German agent to dealing with German telephones and money matters.
</P>
<P>
   But things have changed. International telephoning and banking
have been facilitated by calling cards and automated tellers.
German theaters are not hiring singers as they used to. And both of
the authors of ``Kein' Angst, Baby!,'' Dorothy Maddison and Gail
Sullivan, are back, training in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hegemony of the American singer in Germany is over,'' said
Peter Russell, the director of the Young Artist Development Program
at the Metropolitan Opera.
</P>
<P>
   There are no official statistics on the numbers of American
singers who used to go to Germany for the fall audition season. But
in the mid-1980s it was reported to have been a couple of thousand.
</P>
<P>
   The promise of steady work was a powerful lure. More opera is
performed in the German-speaking world on any given night than in
the entire rest of the world. The former West Germany had more than
80 opera houses, supported by state subsidies. Each employed its
own singers, who received year-round salaries (with an extra
month's pay as a Christmas bonus), four to six weeks of vacation
and full benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In America, by contrast, work was and is irregular. ``In the
States, most of the companies still do four productions a year, and
they do that production four times,'' said Pamela Rosenberg, the
artistic director of the Stuttgart Opera, who is to become the
general manager of the San Francisco Opera next year. In Germany,
most houses adopted the repertory system, playing a different work
from one night to the next, like the Met. But the average German
house has a far longer season than the Met, with its seven and a
half months, the longest season of any opera house in America. No
company in the United States can give a singer a full-time job.
</P>
<P>
   German theater directors, moreover, have a decided prejudice in
favor of American-trained singers, who arrive with a level of stage
experience that most German conservatories don't offer. ``The
training is absolutely better,'' said Klaus Schulz, director of the
Stadttheater am Gaertnerplatz in Munich, who makes regular trips to
America to scout new talent.
</P>
<P>
   And the results of this preference are still in evidence.
``Every German opera house still has about 50 percent Americans,''
Rosenberg said. ``They'd have to shut every house in Germany if
Americans didn't come.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the picture has gradually been changing. In the 1960s, ``If
you could speak some German and sing all right, you could probably
get a job,'' said Frederic Mayer, a retired tenor. But by the 1980s
it was a lot harder to get a foot in the door.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer sang in the ensemble at Gaertnerplatz for more than 30
years. He was also choir director at the English-speaking Church of
the Ascension in Munich, which used to be an unofficial meeting
place for auditioning singers. (It is recommended in ``Kein' Angst,
Baby!'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I see quite a few kids coming through and auditioning, but not
masses, the way we used to in the '80s,'' Mayer said. ``Where we
used to get 15 or 20 new singers every year, I probably see 3.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of reasons for the falloff in young
Americans. One is the opening of the former Soviet Union in the
early 1990s, which released a huge wave of eager young singers from
Eastern Europe who were willing to work for a lot less money than
anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first five years, one could get the East bloc singers
strikingly cheap,'' said Schulz of the Gaertnerplatz. Even today,
the Vienna State Opera has been known to alternate a highly paid
superstar soprano in the same role with a young Eastern European
singer who receives a mere fraction of the better-known singer's
salary.
</P>
<P>
   At the entry level, the pay may not be as much an issue.
``Americans will also sing for not much money,'' said Inge
Tennigkeit, an opera agent in Dusseldorf. ``They'll also sing in
small theaters.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is no question that the Eastern Europeans have
changed the playing field. ``I hear fewer Americans, because I can
only hear 25 or 30 people, maximum, at each audition,'' said
Karl-Erich Haase of Munich's venerable Stoll agency, who, as all
the agents used to do in the 1980s, holds auditions once a week.
``You can only hear so many. And there are more Eastern Europeans
now. The middle level of American singer has fewer chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is German reunification. As the once wealthy nation
stretched its resources to cover the costs of five impoverished new
states, cultural subsidies suffered, and the budgets of opera
houses _ along with those of museums, theaters and dance companies
_ were frozen or slashed. A few smaller opera houses had to close.
The effects have extended even to such major houses as those in
Frankfurt and Hamburg, which have reduced their numbers of
performances appreciably.
</P>
<P>
   With tighter budgets has come a tendency not to replace singers
who retire or move to another house. In lieu of the year-round
contracts that used to be the norm, theaters have been offering
more and more part-time contracts and guest stints. From 1990 to
1997, the number of singers employed in German ensembles fell by
about 20 percent. People who have ensemble jobs have tended to keep
them, so there are fewer jobs free for incoming singers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as Germany tightens its belt, the American opera
scene is expanding as never before: another reason fewer singers
are crossing the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 114 professional opera companies registered with the
service organization Opera America, Mark Scorca, the group's
president, reports, half have started since 1970. And 70 companies
have some sort of training program. In the three years since its
inception, Opera America's singer services program has grown
threefold, to more than 1,300 members. ``I think it's much easier
for American singers to make careers without going to Europe,''
said Diana Hossack, who directs singer services.

</P>
<P>
   Russell, of the Met's young artist program, elaborated: ``What I
find frightening is that there are now so many different
opportunities for young American singers in the States that a lot
of us are vying for the best singers.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no rules about how to launch a singing career, and
there have always been singers who have built fine careers at home.
Amy Burton, a soprano who often appears at the New York City Opera,
started out singing in regional companies around America.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some years I was traveling 10 months a year,'' she said. ``I
was still in the phase of, `I can't believe they're paying me to
sing: I'm having such a good time.' I was learning an amazing
amount of repertoire.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, she sang in Europe but not on a full-time basis and not
in Germany. ``I did consider a contract somewhere, and that was
never very appealing to me,'' she said. ``I didn't want to live in
Germany, for one thing.'' What she has created instead, she added,
is ``not only an American career but one of the most New York-based
careers that I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Elzinga, a bass-baritone from California, has also started
out along a peripatetic American-based path. ``I'm hardly ever at
home,'' he said from a hotel room in Portland, Ore., during a
recent run of ``The Mikado,'' before flying to New York for an
acclaimed appearance with the Eos Chamber Orchestra in Peter
Maxwell Davies' ``Eight Songs for a Mad King.'' Elzinga is spending
three months at the Glimmerglass Opera, in Cooperstown, N.Y., this
summer, after a season that carried him from Arizona to Alberta.
</P>
<P>
   This kind of nomadic life is fine for some; for others, it is
enough to drive them away. ``I was really sick of being a secretary
and then flying out to the Fort Lauderdale Opera for $600 and doing
the rehearsal period for nothing,'' said Susan Davis Holmes, a
soprano. ``Or the Bronx Opera for $350 for three months' work,
hoping someone would see me from the New York City Opera. The
pitiful thing was that people envied my career. I just couldn't
handle the traveling and being uprooted all the time, and the
uncertainty and no money. I said: `I'll go to Germany, and I'll go
twice. I'll go into debt. If I don't get a job somewhere, I'm
quitting.'''
</P>
<P>
   But there are still jobs in Germany, and Holmes got one. She
spent four years in the ensemble of the small theater in Pforzheim,
which she describes as ``a factory.'' A notorious risk of the
German ensemble system is that singers work so much they wear out
their voices; then the theater discards them. ``Once you're in a
small house for longer than two years,'' Holmes said, ``people
start not taking you seriously anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But she landed an ensemble contract at a larger house, in
Freiburg, and she has started making more prestigious guest
appearances at theaters like the Stuttgart Opera: a textbook
example of a young singer climbing the ensemble ladder. ``I have no
interest in going back to the States,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some young singers in the American opera loop do better
financially than Holmes did in the tough New York market. While
some American houses offer more prestige than pay _ Glimmerglass,
the Opera Theater of St. Louis or the Virginia Opera, for example _
others are well financed, even in relatively unexpected places like
Salt Lake City, New Orleans and Tulsa, Okla.
</P>
<P>
   ``At a lot of regional houses, I expect to make somewhere
between $1,000 and $3,000'' per performance, Elzinga said.
</P>
<P>
   Both fees and opinions vary. ``You can't make a good living
singing only in America,'' said Richard Harrell, the director of
the San Francisco Opera Center. ``The fees just aren't high
enough.'' At the same time, Rosenberg, struggling to hire singers
in Stuttgart, is shocked to learn that the Tulsa Opera, in a
production of ``Aida,'' offers its Amneris $6,000 a night. ``We pay
much less than they pay in the States,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And she labors under another disadvantage, because a change in
German laws has driven taxes, even for foreign artists, so high
that given a comparable choice they prefer to sing elsewhere.
``It's tougher for us to get a certain level of American singers to
commit,'' she said. In recent months, the strong dollar has only
contributed to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Elzinga said that when he recently auditioned for London agents
who might represent him in Europe, he was told that German fees had
declined. ``You have less money to take home. But there are still
really important houses and artists there if you can survive on
what they pay you.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, plenty of people would still recommend a stint in
Germany. ``I say to every American singer that they should get
themselves over here and get a house position,'' Rosenberg said.
``You will do a role 20 or 30 times. You will be working at your
profession much more.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Harrell, based in San Francisco, emphasizes that opera ``is
essentially a European art form performed in European languages.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for someone who's going to make a career of it
to go and spend some time there,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans getting jobs in Germany now seem to be coming in
at a higher level of professionalism. ``Many Americans come over
with managers now,'' said Haase of the Stoll agency. ``It's easier
for me when I simply talk to an agent and he brings me 10 good
people.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least one agent feels that the overall level of Americans
has declined drastically. ``First, not so many Americans are
coming,'' Tennigkeit said. ``Second, they're not as well trained.
The singers present themselves well, but in terms of pure vocal
technique, they don't compare to those 10 years ago. The difference
is absolutely blatant. Today, they're often the ones who have sung
for a couple of years in America, and it didn't work over there, so
they thought they'd try it in Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   In America, by contrast, Harrell, who hears some 600 entry-level
singers a year, says that ``the people I'm hearing are getting
better: better trained, more high-quality singers.'' Even allowing
for personal tastes, one could infer, from these contrasting
opinions, that young American talent today is more likely to
audition for the San Francisco program than for a German agent.
</P>
<P>
   For those who do find work in the German-speaking world, it is
an open question exactly what that contract translates into in
terms of a larger career. Elzinga spent seven months at the Vienna
Volksoper doing major roles: Escamillo in ``Carmen,'' Figaro in
``Le Nozze fi Figaro,'' Mephistopheles in ``Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it would lead to something, but it didn't,'' Elzinga
said. ``I know a woman who worked in Germany for a long time who
said it was quite a struggle to come back. She'd been out of the
loop. If you're at the important but not star level in Europe and
you want to break into the States, it's hard.''

ADVERTISING: AD SPENDING FORECAST SIGNALS CONTINUING BOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A leading forecaster of advertising spending has
raised his estimates for 2000, citing economic conditions that are
more robust than he expected as well as strong spending so far this
year by marketers in major categories from automobiles to computers
to drugs.
</P>
<P>
   And in a sign that the sustained boom on Madison Avenue shows
little likelihood of slowing down _ dot-coms or not-coms _ a
preliminary prognostication for 2001 was similarly upbeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think these good trends will continue,'' said Robert Coen,
senior vice president and forecasting director at Universal McCann,
who presented his predictions Tuesday at the University Club in
Manhattan. ``There is continued strong demand for media time and
space.''
</P>
<P>
   Ad spending is considered a sensitive barometer of the economy,
particularly the willingness of consumers to continue shopping as
enthusiastically as they have. Though the Conference Board reported
Tuesday that consumer confidence fell this month from a record in
May, the data for the second quarter was the second best ever. That
suggested the consumer spending spree is unlikely to slow
significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are legs to the story'' of continued sustained ad
spending growth, said Karen Ficker, a managing director at ING
Barings in New York who attended Coen's presentation.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the categories cited by Coen, which also included
alcoholic beverages, brokers and mutual funds, restaurants and
resorts, Ficker said she expected big increases in ad spending in
``emerging categories'' like wireless and hand-held devices that
``are going to need to brand themselves to differentiate
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In his presentation, which Coen makes twice a year, he predicted
that ad spending this year in the United States would total a
record $235.6 billion, up 9.4 percent from a revised figure of
$215.3 billion spent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 figure represented an increase of 6.8 percent from the
$201.6 billion spent in 1998 _ ``very good for an odd-numbered
year,'' Coen said, without the stimulative effects of elections and
the Olympics, which are of course adding to the projected increases
for 2000, along with special campaigns with millennium themes.
</P>
<P>
   An increase of 9.4 percent for 2000 would be the largest in
percentage terms since 1984 _ also a year of Olympics and elections
_ when ad spending climbed 15.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The estimate Tuesday marked the second time that Coen, who has
been following ad spending trends since 1948, had raised his
forecast for 2000. His first prediction, made in June 1999, was for
an increase of 7.5 percent, to $230 billion. Six months later, he
revised his outlook to an increase of 8.3 percent to $232 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economic expectations are considerably brighter for 2000
than they were in December,'' Coen said, primarily because numerous
advertisers ``are posting phenomenal increases'' in ad spending.
</P>
<P>
   National ad spending this year is now expected to rise 11.1
percent, to $141.9 billion, compared with Coen's estimate in
December of 9.1 percent to $139.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Local ad spending, however, is now expected to rise 7 percent,
to $93.8 billion, rather than 7.1 percent, to $93.9 billion. Coen
attributed the slight decrease in his estimate to ``a weak
performance in retail'' advertising in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   If Coen's latest estimates for 2000 prove right, ad spending as
a percentage of gross domestic product would reach a record 2.4
percent, compared with 2.33 percent in 1999 and 2.3 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   That pleased another analyst attending the presentation, Leland
Westerfield from PaineWebber in New York, who has theorized that ad
spending may be breaking out from historic norms. Until now,
Westerfield said, when ad spending reached or exceeded 2.3 percent
of gross domestic product, it would then grow more slowly than
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one else who can bring 50-plus years of economic
observations to his forecasts,'' Westerfield said, ``which provides
a large measure of credibility when Bob says advertising can
outpace GDP growth.''
</P>
<P>
   If advertisers cooperate with Coen's initial estimate for 2001 _
$251 billion, an increase of 6.5 percent from his adjusted forecast
for 2000 _ ad spending next year would amount to 2.42 percent of
projected gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to ad spending abroad, Coen was also optimistic, citing
expected gains in several countries that account for about
two-thirds of all spending outside the United States, among them
Canada, France, Germany and Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Spending overseas should total $229.2 billion for 2000, Coen
said, an increase of 7.2 percent from a final total of $213.8
billion for 1999, which has been adjusted downward from earlier
estimates of $216.3 billion. The revised total for 1999 marked a
gain of 4.2 percent from $205.2 billion spent abroad in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   For 2000, then, Coen's worldwide total estimate is $464.8
billion, up 8.3 percent from his final figure of $429.1 billion for
1999. That would be the biggest one-year percentage increase since
1995, when worldwide ad spending rose 11.5 percent. The final 1999
figure represented an increase of 5.5 percent from the $205.2
billion spent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead to 2001, Coen said that ad spending abroad would
reach $247 billion, up 7.8 percent from his revised forecast for
2000; that would also be the biggest one-year percentage increase
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   So Coen's worldwide total estimate for 2001 is $498 billion, an
increase of 7.1 percent from his projected total for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't quite juggle those percentages to get to $500
billion, half a trillion,'' Coen said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   One member of the audience at the presentation suggested with a
smile that if Coen was ``worried about getting to $500 billion,''
he should raise his estimate for online ad spending in 2000 of $3.4
billion, up 75 percent from 1999. (Actually, Coen had; the figure
he projected in December was $3.2 billion.)
</P>
<P>
   As for dot-com spending in the traditional media, which may
decline if more e-commerce companies close or conserve cash to
remain afloat, Coen was sanguine.
</P>
<P>
   ``If two of these companies lose their ability to buy
traditional media,'' he said, ``10 more can fly in to replace
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Universal McCann, where Coen works, is the media services
division of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising. That agency is
part of the McCann-Erickson World Group, owned by the Interpublic
Group of Companies.

BILL RICHARDSON'S BAD CAREER MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Slate commentary)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (The following ``separate buy'' article from SLATE, the premier
online magazine of politics and culture, is available from the New
York Times Syndicate. Please contact syndicate sales representative
DEBRA WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
</P>
<P>
   (David Plotz is Slate's Washington bureau chief)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY DAVID PLOTZ &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy, the Bermuda Triangle of Cabinet
agencies, could soon claim another victim. The Case of the Missing
Hard Disks has doomed Secretary Bill Richardson's aspiration to be
Al Gore's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Republican senators are demanding Richardson's resignation.
George W. Bush is turning the nuclear bumbling into a campaign
issue. The Senate Armed Services Committee summoned Richardson for
a spanking. Democratic senators ripped him. Republicans suggested
that an independent agency, not DOE, should supervise nuclear
weapons and security. Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.V., vowed that the
Senate would never support Richardson again.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., growled, ``You have lost what
credibility you had left on Capitol Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   During his days as an international troubleshooter, Richardson
liked being called ``007,'' but not even James Bond could escape
from the torture chamber Richardson is in now.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's response to the Los Alamos fiasco has been
energetic shirking. He brags shrilly about other nuclear-security
improvements: ``In two years I have done more on security than has
been done in the past 20 years.'' He whines that he doesn't deserve
blame, and he passes the buck onto careless Los Alamos scientists
and their anti-security culture.
</P>
<P>
   Usually the best-natured of pols, Richardson is displaying an
uncharacteristic lack of grace. It's easy to understand why. He is
surely regretting one of the worst career moves in recent
Washington history: his 1998 promotion from U.N. ambassador to
energy secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Running DOE is like herding rattlesnakes. Each of its
responsibilities is worse than the next: holding down gas prices,
bullying OPEC, building nuclear weapons, protecting secrets about
those weapons, disposing of waste from those weapons, apologizing
to all the employees made sick by those weapons, etc. The job
requires vast technical knowledge, an ability to navigate a
labyrinthine bureaucracy, high tolerance for the whimsical behavior
of scientists, and a heavy interest in hands-on management.
</P>
<P>
   But it does not much concern Richardson's supreme talent:
personal politics. In the United States today, only Bill Clinton is
a better natural politician. As a congressional candidate,
Richardson set the Guinness World Record for most handshakes in a
day _ nearly 8,500. He held more than 2,000 town meetings during
his 14-year congressional career.
</P>
<P>
   Retail politics and human contact thrill him: ``He just comes at
you and wears you down with charm and with humor,'' says David
Nemtzow, president of the Alliance to Save Energy. Nemtzow
describes hosting a fund-raiser for 400 people. Richardson arrived
just off a plane from Turkey, sleep-deprived, and promised, ``I'm
not going home until I meet everyone in this room.'' He made good
on his promise.
</P>
<P>
   The energy secretary credits his ease to a bicultural
upbringing. Born in California in 1947, he grew up in Mexico City
with a Mexican socialite mother and American banker father. He
prepped at a tony school in Massachusetts, and he always moved
easily between the Anglo and Latino worlds. Though he had no
connection to New Mexico, Richardson carpetbagged there because of
its Anglo-Latin ethnic stew.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, he was elected to the U.S. House from the most diverse
district in the nation: 44 percent Anglo, 34 percent Hispanic, and
20 percent Indian. He jokes that he was the perfect candidate
because: ``I have an Anglo surname, I speak Spanish, and I look
Indian.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson thrived on Capitol Hill. He became House Democrats'
chief deputy whip, a job that suited his love of glad-handing and
strong-arming. Clinton passed over Richardson for the Cabinet in
1992, but the president and the congressman, each recognizing a
kindred spirit, became fast friends. Soon Clinton deputized
Richardson to act as an unofficial U.S. negotiator with thugs and
monsters.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'90s, Richardson freed a U.S. helicopter pilot downed
over North Korea, a pair of Americans who inadvertently crossed
into Iraq, an American jailed in Bangladesh, and three aid workers
held hostage in Sudan, among others. He was dispatched to butter up
Serbia's Slobodan Milosevic, Haiti's military dictators, and
Burma's tyrants.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson courted the despots with the same rumpled,
hail-fellow-well-met manner that won him friends at home. He played
up his friendship with the president, flattered the
hostage-holders, listened to them graciously, ate their food, told
self-deprecating jokes, and cajoled them with promises of good
press and American sympathy. He was magic.
</P>
<P>
   Sudanese rebel Kerubino Kwanyin Bol was intransigent till
Richardson asked to visit Kerubino's child, who was dying of
measles. That request melted the warlord, who dropped his ransom
demand from $2.5 million to a few jeeps and some rice. Richardson's
missions won him three Nobel Peace Prize nominations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Richardson brought his retail style to the United
Nations. He worked the cafeteria, shaking every hand he could find.
He admiringly called Kofi Annan ``a political animal'' and pegged
Laurent Kabila, with whom he negotiated Congo's peace agreement, as
``a street-smart Chicago ward heeler.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's career, in short, testifies to the power of the
schmooze. Unlike Clinton, he doesn't marry schmoozing to wonkery.
He is weak on policy, often skipping complicated discussions for a
cigar and a party. He has no great beliefs, which may be why he
didn't mind flattering despots. In Richardson's world, personal
relationships may trump principles, and friendships may supersede
treaties. Clinton exploited this during his Monica Lewinsky
troubles. Click here to see how.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson had excellent careerist reasons to take the Energy
job: DOE has a huge presence in New Mexico. Energy secretary,
unlike U.N. ambassador, is a real Cabinet post with real authority.
And it positioned him perfectly for veep: a personable Hispanic
with legislative, international, and executive experience.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Richardson eluded the Energy Curse that had
tarnished the careers of Hazel O'Leary, Federico Pena, and almost
everyone else who'd been secretary. Arriving in the midst of the
Wen Ho Lee scandal, he calmed Congress by tightening security. He
launched a pilot project to dispose of nuclear weapon waste,
something his predecessors could never manage.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, his in-your-face diplomacy persuaded OPEC to boost
oil production, which halted hikes in U.S. gas prices (though
Richardson does not seem to have any short-term fix for the current
gas price spike).
</P>
<P>
   But the Los Alamos farce is showing why political savvy alone is
limited as a governing strategy. Richardson's charm does not reach
the folks deep in the bowels of Energy. DOE's nuclear scientists,
who are more interested in the free flow of information than in new
regs, have been indifferent to his action plans and security
upgrades. A secretary with intense knowledge of the labs and a deep
interest in security policy _ a wonk or maybe a bully _ might have
dug and bitched and harassed his employees till he knew the labs
were clean. But that's not Richardson.
</P>
<P>
   According to Richardson's testimony last Wednesday, June 21, the
FBI has turned up no evidence of espionage involving the hard
drives. That is good news for the United States, but perhaps bad
news for Richardson, since the alternative to espionage is
something much more humiliating: incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   The huge lag between the drives' disappearance and Richardson's
hearing about it, the shoddy record-keeping in the security vault,
the rediscovery of the drives behind a copying machine,
Richardson's persistent ignorance about what was going on at Los
Alamos _ all this make the secretary look like a sap.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson happily played the shambling, self-deprecating genial
fellow when he was lobbying for the release of hostages. But he is
discovering, painfully, that there is a difference between playing
the fool and being the fool.

   CUBA-U.S. (Washington) _ House Republican leaders agree to end
40 years of sanctions on sales of food to Cuba, in a compromise
that carries great political significance but may be of only
symbolic economic value. The deal would in principle allow U.S.
farmers and agricultural corporations to sell their goods directly
to Cuba for the first time since 1961. The agreement also echoes
existing policy allowing the sale of medicine and medical products
to Cuba. But Cuban-American lawmakers succeeded in placing severe
restrictions on the bill. By Lizette Alvarez. (Eds.: an early

Wednesday and Thursday, the drug agency will begin a re-examination

</P>
<P>
   &UR; BY STEVE CHAPMAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Between the time a presidential candidate clinches his party's
nomination and the moment he stands before the convention to kick
off the general election campaign, he must make a daunting
decision: choose someone to serve as his running mate and, in case
of victory, his vice president.
</P>
<P>
   During this interval, the presidential candidates contemplate
and the political strategists and pundits argue the advantages and
disadvantages of the prospects _ weighing elements of geography,
ideology, personal history, ethnicity, religion, campaign skills,
and personal compatibility.
</P>
<P>
   It's one of the most fascinating and suspenseful questions of
the entire campaign _ and, from a political standpoint, one of the
least important.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because for all the ink and air time devoted to the
selection, it's not likely to have any detectable bearing on the
outcome of the race _not this year, and not any year. Given that
the vice president can become president at any moment _ as 13 vice
presidents have done _ you would think Americans would place
considerable importance on his or her fitness for the top job. An
ill-considered No. 2 could become a disastrous chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   But the truth is that for better or worse, voters don't make
their decision on that criterion, and they never have. For most
Americans, casting a ballot on the basis of the vice-presidential
nominee is like choosing a spouse based on the attractiveness of
the in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   It's widely assumed that a poor choice can torpedo a campaign.
When George Bush picked Dan Quayle in August 1988, Bush trailed
Michael Dukakis in the polls by anywhere from seven to 14 points.
Quayle was a disaster from the start when he was swept into a
controversy over his Vietnam-era service in the Indiana National
Guard, a furor that immediately revealed him to be a vacant boob
for whom the term ``deer in the headlights'' was coined. Things
only got worse.
</P>
<P>
   In his debate with Dukakis running mate Lloyd Bentsen, Quayle
dared to claim that he was just as experienced as John Kennedy was
when he ran for president. Bentsen shot back one of the most
devastating rejoinders in campaign history: ``I knew Jack Kennedy.
Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine. Senator, you're no Jack
Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen, a Senate veteran, was experienced and articulate, with
a distinguished record in World War II. Next to him, Quayle was
hopelessly outdone by any measure _ except one. Bush and Quayle won
54 percent of the popular vote and 426 of the 538 electoral votes.
Bentsen couldn't even carry his home state of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Quayle was the worst GOP running mate since Richard Nixon chose
Spiro Agnew, who also made the leap from complete unknown to
national laughingstock practically overnight. His 1968 campaign
performance was a catalog of gaffes, from calling a reporter a
``fat Jap'' to saying, ``If you've seen one city slum, you've seen
them all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats exploited the opening for all it was worth,
running one brutally effective ad with Agnew's visage accompanied
by the sound of a man laughing uproariously. Meanwhile, Edmund
Muskie quickly proved so impressive as Hubert Humphrey's sidekick
that he was soon hailed as a future president. The
vice-presidential competition was a slam-dunk triumph for the
Democrats. The election, however, was not.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of other history confirms the essential irrelevance of
running mates. Franklin Roosevelt won with three different ones.
Tom Dewey lost in 1944 and 1948 with two different ones, as did
Adlai Stevenson in 1952 and 1956.
</P>
<P>
   George McGovern didn't help his cause when he had to drop Tom
Eagleton from the 1972 Democratic ticket after it was learned he
had been treated for depression, but McGovern couldn't have won
with Thomas Jefferson on the ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bob Dole caught hell in 1976 for denouncing ``Democrat
wars,'' factors such as the pardon of Richard Nixon, the defeat in
Vietnam, and the bumpy economy were what really cost Gerald Ford
the election. In 1996, sunny and loquacious Jack Kemp was
everyone's idea of the perfect running mate for the laconic,
prickly Bob Dole, but Kemp had no discernible impact.
</P>
<P>
   In Gallup Polls taken every four years asking if the selection
of a particular running mate or a type of running mate (a black,
for example, or a woman) would make the respondent more or less
likely to vote for either ticket, the invariable consensus choice
is that it ``doesn't make much difference.'' Even in 1988, 64
percent of voters said that about Quayle. Only 5 percent of those
who voted for Dukakis gave Quayle as an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Barone, co-editor of The Almanac of American Politics,
says the closest a running mate has come to deciding an election
was 1960, when Lyndon Johnson helped secure Texas by a bare 46,000
votes in an extremely close election. But even if the Democrats had
lost there, John Kennedy still would have won with nine electoral
votes to spare.
</P>
<P>
   From the early days of the republic, presidential nominees have
generally tried to balance the ticket by choosing someone different
from themselves in regional origin, philosophy, religion, and the
like.
</P>
<P>
   Ignoring the usual imperatives in 1992, Bill Clinton chose a
fellow moderate, Southern, Protestant baby boomer. Though Gore
probably deserves credit for bringing Tennessee into the Democratic
column, that made no difference in the outcome, and even two guys
from Dixie could carry only five of 12 Southern states in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect any of the prospects being mentioned to make a
difference this year. Gray Davis or Dianne Feinstein might nail
down California _ running mates do tend to help in their home
states _ but Gore shouldn't need special help to win there.
</P>
<P>
   As for energizing women, neither Feinstein nor any other female
is likely to do that, any more than the only previous female
choice, Geraldine Ferraro, did in 1984: She and Walter Mondale got
the same percentage of the women's vote (45) that Carter and
Mondale had gotten four years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson was talked about as a way to
capture Hispanics _ at least until news emerged of nuclear weapons
security lapses on his watch _ but even a flawless Hispanic
probably wouldn't have the slightest effect on the outcome. Bush
will win Texas regardless, and Florida should be his unless his
campaign implodes. In Illinois, one of the few really competitive
states with many Hispanics, they have a powerful habit of voting
Democratic already.
</P>
<P>
   The Illinoisans available, such as Sen. Dick Durbin or Gore
campaign manager Bill Daley, have local name recognition lower than
that of the Cubs' backup catcher. Gov. Tom Ridge would help more in
Pennsylvania, but he runs the risk of driving anti-abortion
Republicans into the arms of Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is supposed to be able to deliver hordes of
reform-minded independents to Bush, but there is no reason to think
his appeal is transferable. Whatever McCain does, they're likely to
split between Bush, Gore, Buchanan, and even Ralph Nader (why do
you think they're called independents?).
</P>
<P>
   Though imaginative observers can spin out all sorts of elaborate
theories how this or that running mate could be the key to the Oval
Office, the Election Day reality never seems to live up to the
predictions.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe this year is different. This year, you see, there's
the tantalizing Colin Powell scenario. It goes like this: Bush
makes him the first black to run on a major party's national
ticket, millions of black voters are so enthralled by the chance to
put one of their own in the nation's second-highest office that
they abandon their traditional party allegiance, turning the tide
in one crucial state after another and delivering Bush a stunning
victory. Could it happen?
</P>
<P>
   Naahh.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - The first time Carla Savannah applied for
Medicaid she was pregnant. She got a lecture, but no health
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son's now 1 and I'm still not covered,'' said Savannah, 18,
of Austin. ``I just have bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite three or four tries, Savannah has not successfully
navigated the complex Medicaid system, dominated by poor women and
children entitled by federal law to health care. Although Medicaid
is intended as a safety net for the state's most vulnerable
residents, the poorest children in Texas have the hardest time
getting covered.
</P>
<P>
   Texas maintains some of the nation's most stringent Medicaid
rules. The restrictions are in sharp contrast to Texas' new
Children's Health Insurance Program, which serves the working poor
whose incomes generally are higher than Medicaid families.
</P>
<P>
   ``The very poor have to jump through the most hoops to get their
kids insured,'' said Lisa McGiffert, a senior policy analyst at
Consumers Union, a non-profit product testing and consumer
information organization. ``It's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   A fourth of the state's population _ 4.8 million, including 1.4
million children _ don't have health insurance, numbers attracting
national attention as Gov. George W. Bush runs for president.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' numbers are being driven by its large share of low-income
families, its young population and its concentration of workers in
businesses that don't provide health insurance. The state's
Medicaid rules also are a problem, advocates of the uninsured said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has come to a head. It is clear to us we have a draconian
Medicaid system that puts artificial barriers up to people trying
to access health care,'' said state Rep. Garnet Coleman, a Houston
Democrat serving on a state panel examining health care access,
Medicaid rules and other insurance issues in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Ribbon Task Force on the Uninsured, made up of Coleman,
other lawmakers and Bush representatives, expects to make
recommendations to the Legislature next year. It is looking into
easing Medicaid restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Texas requires parents to appear in person at Medicaid offices
to enroll and to return every six months to remain covered. They
must provide detailed documentation of their assets, not counting
their homes or personal property. In general, families are limited
to $2,000 in resources. If their car is valued above $4,650, the
excess counts toward the resource limit.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, parents or guardians can apply for CHIP, launched
May 1, over the phone or by mail. No assets test or face-to-face
interviews are required. Plus, children are guaranteed coverage for
a year, even if their parents' finances improve.
</P>
<P>
   State officials at the Health and Human Services Commission say
they have launched an aggressive campaign, known as the TexCare
Partnership, to sign up more uninsured children. The commission
oversees Medicaid, CHIP and Texas Healthy Kids Corp., a non-profit
corporation that targets children not eligible for Medicaid or
CHIP.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Healthy Kids expects about 95 percent of the 11,000
children it's been serving to transfer to CHIP. That will leave the
corporation with about 550 children. The corporation's board voted
Tuesday to continue providing coverage at least until June 30,
2001, but to also match children with private carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Since the corporation was created in 1997, 19 insurance carriers
have created specific programs to serve children. But cost is an
issue, and some parents could have trouble covering their children,
advocates of the uninsured said.
</P>
<P>
   CHIP enrollments, meanwhile, continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   By Saturday, the state expects to have 28,312 children covered
by Children's Health Insurance Program, said Jason Cooke, state
CHIP director. Texas hopes to have 320,000 children enrolled by
Aug. 31, 2001. In all, 500,000 children are believed to be
eligible. The program is expected to cost about $400 million in the
current two-year budget cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jones, a spokesman for Bush, said the state has taken steps
to improve outreach to families with uninsured children. For
example, Bush signed legislation last year requiring social service
agencies to notify families, formerly on welfare, that their
children still might qualify for Medicaid, Jones said. He was
unaware of other actions Bush might be planning.
</P>
<P>
   Savannah, who is unemployed and has several thousand dollars in
medical bills, has applied for Medicaid and CHIP. She's already
been told she doesn't qualify for the latter program because she
has no income, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now she's waiting to hear from Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just 18, and there's some stuff I don't understand,'' she
said. ``If I don't get it this time, I guess I'll just give up.''
</P>
<P>
   Roseanna Szilak, executive director of People's Community Clinic
in Austin, said too many families do just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes all sorts of legwork, and if one small thing is
missing, it's back to square one,'' Szilak said. ``It's no wonder
parents are discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Savannah, uninsured patients in Travis and Williamson
counties seek treatment at health centers such as the People's
Community Clinic. Or, they use a hospital emergency room where the
care is expensive and, ultimately, passed on to others in the form
of higher insurance premiums and medical fees.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by the state comptroller's office said providing
health care to uninsured patients costs $4.7 billion a year in
Texas. The money comes from taxpayers, medical providers and
charities.
</P>
<P>
   It would be cheaper and more efficient to cover people with
Medicaid and CHIP, Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Office of
Civil Rights is looking into how Texas operates its Medicaid
program because of a steep drop in recipients, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' Medicaid program, estimated to cost $3.6 billion over the
current two-year budget period, covers fewer children today than it
did five years ago _ 1 million compared with 1.2 million in 1995.
An estimated 600,000 children, now uninsured, are eligible for
Medicaid, said Charles Stuart, a spokesman for the Texas Health and
Human Services Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Medicaid used to be provided automatically to families on
welfare. But many families that went off public assistance also
lost Medicaid, including some who are still be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Easing Medicaid rules would be one way to get more uninsured
children signed up, advocates said. Texas, Montana and Arkansas are
the only states that have not taken steps to simplify Medicaid
eligibility, said Anne Dunkelberg, senior policy analyst at the
Center for Public Policy Priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Bush administration officials could change the rules. So could
the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   But Texas has resisted. Medicaid carries a stigma left from the
days when it was tied to welfare, advocates for the uninsured said.
``Policymakers have shamed people who need help, and it's horrible
that it's tied to access for health care,'' McGiffert said.
</P>
<P>
   State officials also fear being inundated by people seeking
coverage, Dunkelberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Budget officials estimated the cost of scrapping the
face-to-face interviews and assets test at $1.4 billion because of
anticipated new enrollments. Texas would be on the line for about
$600 million of that, with the rest coming from the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said he is optimistic the state will ease its Medicaid
rules. He is talking with the governor's office, but has found the
staff more cautious because of the presidential race, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working diligently to do this without a change in
legislation,'' Coleman said. ``Why wait? Those kids are not going
away, and their health problems are not going away.''

DEFINING TWO ROLES:   DIVA AND SOUL SURVIVOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, July 2)  
 By DAVID A. KEEPS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a teen-ager living in the suburbs of Detroit in 1964, the
royals of AM radio were alarmingly obvious: the Beatles were the
imported kings of rock 'n' roll and Aretha was the native Queen of
Soul. Then along came the pop princess Diana and her ladies in
waiting, the Supremes. With a voice as pure and sweet as an ebony
virgin locked in an ivory tower _ and the glamour and vanity to
match _ Diana Ross led the Motown trio to the top of the charts 10
times in less than three years. In 1967 she became the headliner,
and three years later, Diana Ross and the Supremes made their
farewell appearance at the Frontier in Las Vegas, singing their
final No. 1 hit. It was an end-of-the-affair, gospel-styled swan
song filled with regret and hope and titled ``Someday We'll Be
Together.'' No one, least of all Diana Ross, suspected that
``someday'' would ever come to pass.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has. With a few minor caveats: never mind that the Diana
Ross and the Supremes tour, which comes to Madison Square Garden on
Thursday and Jones Beach on Saturday, does not feature the founding
members Florence Ballard (who died, pretty much destitute, in 1967)
and Mary Wilson. Forget that Ross never even sang with the
latter-day Supremes Lynda Laurence (1971-73) and Scherrie Payne
(1973-76). Ignore the obvious irony of a show titled ``Return to
Love''; in the 30 years since Ross left the most successful female
vocal group in history, it has become clear that there was no love
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly why Ross, a savvy multimillionaire performer and
television and film producer, has decided that now is the time to
relive the glories of her first 10 years in show business is
anyone's guess. With no new record to promote, this would appear to
be more of an upscale golden-oldies show for baby boomers than a
response to the kind of nostalgic zeitgeist that precipitated the
disco and new wave revivals of the last decade. It would also
appear to be one serious case of superstar hubris: at prices of up
to $250, ticket sales have been less than robust.
</P>
<P>
   Possessed of a pure pop instrument _ a girlish voice with crisp
enunciation that is equally suited to the task of telegraphing joy
and heartache, often within a single song _ Ross has reached out
and touched generations. She has also tried the public's patience
with an ego befitting the term diva long before it became a
fashionable, if overused, sobriquet for songstresses ranging from
Whitney Houston to Faith Hill. Long before Bruce Springsteen
punched in at the hit factory, Ross grandly declared herself the
Boss, taking the name from the title of her 1979 hit. ``Many people
view ambition as a negative quality in an individual,'' she has
said. ``It's just my life force, who I am. I cannot stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago at a party following the Grammy Awards, I had an
audience with Miss Ross. I had my photograph taken with her and,
afterward, asked what records she had been listening to lately.
``What is this?'' she snapped imperiously. ``An interview?'' It was
her way of saying that if it was, it was now over.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the answer to my question seems clear enough. In the last
few years, a new soul sisterhood of girl groups has taken center
stage alongside R-and-B-loving boy bands like 'N Sync and teen
sirens like Britney Spears. Some of these female combos, like TLC,
who trade in street-smart rap and cautionary ballads like
``Waterfalls,'' have been evolving since the early '90s. Others,
including Destiny's Child, 702 and the TLC protegees Blaque, have
recently climbed the charts. Their songs update the Supremes' sonic
blend of uptempo percussion and smartly deployed harmonies while
transforming the Supremes' once-timely advice for the lovelorn into
a modern message of female self-sufficiency. Perhaps Ross believes
that her time, a time of almost-quaint, yearning love songs, has
come again.
</P>
<P>
   Four decades ago, Diane Ernestine Ross was no different from any
member of Destiny's Child or even from Christina Aguilera. A young
sparrow who longed to be an international songbird, Diane sang
hymns in the church, Etta James tunes in front of her bedroom
mirror and rhythm-and-blues on the stoops of the Brewster housing
projects in Detroit. Back then there were no market strategists,
fashion stylists, video directors or music television channels to
speed her passage.
</P>
<P>
   There was, however, a local recording impresario named Berry
Gordy, who was melding the exuberance of gospel and the raunch of
ghetto blues with the smooth production values of pop to create a
new hybrid of rhythm-and-blues called soul.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Gordy had a dream. His
fledgling label, Motown, pronounced itself ``the sound of young
America'' _ a statement of both empowerment and assimilation _ and
the company's stock-in-trade was impeccably dressed harmony groups
that could transcend the marginalization of R-and-B music and claim
their rightful place in the pop charts.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Ross began her career in 1959 with the Primettes, a group
founded by Florence Ballard, whose roof-raising vocals made her an
ideal lead singer. after signing them and renaming them the
Supremes in 1961 and releasing six consecutive flops in the next
two years, Gordy began to have second thoughts. The Shirelles, a
quartet from Passaic, N.J., had already become the first black
female group to reach No. 1 with the wrenching ballad ``Will You
Love Me Tomorrow?'' A few years later, in New York, Brill Building
composers (including Carole King) and studio wizards like Phil
Spector were shaping a new sound. Most of these girl groups,
teen-ager puppets molded into disposable, interchangeable pop
entities, were about to be washed away in the flood of the British
Invasion that began in 1964. The Supremes, Gordy determined, would
not suffer that fate.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Diane Ross had rechristened herself Diana, goddess of
the hunt. Promoted as the star of the group, her high-pitched coo
of innocence and burgeoning sexuality was the icing on a string of
five consecutive No. 1 hits (including ``Baby Love'' and ``Stop in
the Name of Love'') in 1964 and 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Gordy was quick to capitalize on the Diana charm, casting her
and the Supremes as a sort of prom queen and court complete with
couture gowns, etiquette lessons (taught in Motown's ``artist
development'' finishing school) and empire-building aspirations.
Within three years, the Supremes had their faces plastered on a
signature line of baked goods (The Supremes White Bread) and
recorded an album of British Invasion tunes and a collection of
country-and-western, tribute LP's to Sam Cooke and Rodgers &AMP; Hart
and a version of the Broadway hit ``Funny Girl.'' They appeared at
the Copa in New York, and performed a moving rendition of
``Somewhere'' on the ``Tonight Show'' the day after King's
assassination.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the Supremes, Ross channeled the spirit of the
jazz giant Billie Holiday, winning a 1971 Academy Award nomination
for her screen debut in ``Lady Sings the Blues.'' But her acting
career slowed down with the camp classic ``Mahogany'' (the story of
a ghetto girl gone high fashion, for which Ross designed her own
costumes) and the film version of the Broadway hit ``The Wiz.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite these film flops and a reputation for exasperating,
embarrassing behavior (she once berated her sound crew in front of
800,000 concertgoers in Central Park), Ross, 56, has endured,
navigating the changing currents of pop music with ease. Working
with the best songwriters and producers, she has scored hits with
schmaltzy soundtrack ballads (``Do You Know Where You're Going
To,'' 1975), post-disco gay anthems (``I'm Coming Out,'' 1980) and
Euro-disco workouts (``Take Me Higher,'' 1995).
</P>
<P>
   This April, she became the first recording artist to be honored
with a tribute concert broadcast as part of VH1's indefatigable
``Divas'' franchise. As an excuse to introduce the new Supremes
(complete with six male dancers) and thus promote the current tour,
it was rather transparent, but as is usually the case with legends,
there was a compelling back story. In the last year, Ross has
outdone herself: one week she was all over the tabloids for
hassling a security guard who patted her down at Heathrow Airport
in London, the next week she was feeling rapper L'il Kim's breast
at an awards show.
</P>
<P>
   Ross' turn on ``VH1 Divas 2000'' was equally baffling. Her voice
was ragged, she flubbed and flattened notes or didn't even try to
reach her trademark high ones, rendering pop classics into a
shorthand that approached improvisational jazz. She strutted and
staggered, giggled and poked a little fun at Mariah Carey's
miniskirts, shook the fringed hem of her own dress, watching it
like a girl fascinated by the rustle of her first crinoline and
showered the audience with a stream of ``Thank-you's'' and ``I love
you's.'' It was a riveting, unpredictable performance, filled with
bravura, like watching an aged figure skater go for a triple toe
loop and manage to land it.
</P>
<P>
   It defines the magic behind the madness of the diva complex. For
just when her narcissism (the gowns! the hair! the nails!)
threatens to bring the curtain down, Diana Ross cuts loose with a
fragile trill that soars like a wounded bird.
</P>
<P>
   We are, to paraphrase one of the Supremes' superb hits, back in
her arms again, so satisfied.

</P>
<P>
   In the first three months of this season, players have continued
to jack long balls out of Houston's home-run-friendly Enron Field
at a record pace, provoking yet another chapter in the ongoing saga
of complaint about the newly ``insane'' offensive numbers put up in
the ``watered down'' world of Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint is entirely fair: Home runs can't be as meaningful
as they once were if Steve Finley is on pace to hit more in a
season than Reggie Jackson ever did.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also irrelevant. Baseball history, even as the purists
who complain about today's cheapened offensive statistics construct
it, is little more than a record of inflated achievement. Insane
numbers don't threaten the integrity of baseball's historical
accomplishments. They constitute it.
</P>
<P>
   A textbook example of the complaint appears in Paul C. Weiler's
recent book ``Leveling the Playing Field.'' After noting that ``the
biggest reason for the resurgence of interest in baseball in the
late 1990s was the phenomenal number of home runs being hit,''
Weiler reminds us that the number wasn't so ``phenomenal'' as it
seemed to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows,'' he explains, ``how close Sosa came to
McGwire in 1998 (with 66 homers) and how close both came again in
1999 (with 65 and 63, respectively). What few fans realize, though,
is that neither McGwire nor Sosa came close to breaking Babe Ruth's
true home run record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose we were to do the same kind of adjustment for home run
inflation that we regularly do for economic inflation, for example,
to calculate the real rise of the Dow Jones Index from the 1920s to
the 1990s. In order for a McGwire or a Sosa (or Ken Griffey Jr.) to
break Ruth's real home run record from the 1920s, he now has to hit
more than 150, not just 60, home runs over the season.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a remarkable mixture of elitism and populism in this
sequence _ elitism in Weiler's commitment to chastising the fans
producing baseball's ``recent resurgence'' for misunderstanding the
meaning of the ``phenomenal number of home runs'' they enjoy;
populism in using the same argument to celebrate the ``real'' and
``true'' achievements of an icon from a previous period of
``resurgence of interest in baseball'': ``It should now be clear
why Babe Ruth was our greatest athlete in any sport in the past
century.''
</P>
<P>
   But the elitism and the populism in this claim are less far
apart than they might seem. Harvard professor Weiler doesn't hold
his own judgments to the same standard he imposes on the masses.
He's a fan of Ruth in exactly the same way that they are fans of
Sosa and McGwire. For Ruth's true home run record, at least
according to the ``economic inflation'' model Weiler provides,
wasn't 60 but 54.
</P>
<P>
   In 1920, Ruth hit 54 of the 369 home runs in the American
League, roughly 15 percent. When he hit 60 in 1927, the league hit
439; his portion had dropped to roughly 14 percent. Indeed,
measured in terms of his distance from the competition, Ruth's real
record was 29, the number he hit in 1919 when his closest
competitor managed only 10 (his closest competitors hit 19 in 1920
and 47 in 1927). However you slice it, Ruth's 60 is no more real a
home run mark than McGwire's 70.
</P>
<P>
   By the standard Weiler invokes, almost none of baseball's
landmark achievements are real. Statistics shape our understanding
of baseball history more than they shape our understanding of the
histories of other sports, but the statistics on which baseball
historians generally rely look more like iconic numbers than like
meaningful data.
</P>
<P>
   Take what is almost always adduced as the greatest single year
any pitcher has had in the modern era: Bob Gibson's 1968 season
with a record of 22-9 (including 13 shutouts in 34 starts) and an
ERA of 1.12. It's the 1.12 ERA that gets people's attention, and
rightly so; only one other pitcher in the postwar era, and I mean
post-WWI era, has even broken 1.50 _ Walter Johnson with a 1.49 in
1919. But Gibson's performance came during a period of pitching
inflation even greater than today's hitting inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the overall National League ERA was only 2.99. In terms
of the averages established by his peers, Gibson had a great year,
one of the six greatest ever. In the 1990s, Greg Maddux had two
consecutive years in which he outperformed the National League by
an even greater margin. He just didn't have a 1.12 ERA. That
pitching numbers were ``watered down'' in 1968 doesn't compromise
the legacy of Gibson's achievement. It instead made his achievement
and its legacy possible.
</P>
<P>
   And so when you hear that today's players are overrated, just
remind yourself that being overrated is the best way to be highly
rated in baseball history. Over time we forget about the
circumstances that account for the statistical extremes we
celebrate. We hear about the insane offensive performances of this
season, but what about the insane offensive performances that this
era's stars are trying to eclipse? Hack Wilson's single-season
record of 190 RBIs is a good example.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930 the National League enjoyed one of the greatest
offensive years in baseball history: The average batting average
for non-pitchers was .312. The year saw three of the 10 highest RBI
totals in baseball history, four of the top 13, and six of the top
32. Do we hold that against Wilson? No. We hold it against people
like Rocky Colavito, who might well be in the Hall of Fame instead
of Wilson if he had been fortunate enough to play in an era when
105 RBIs couldn't win an MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rantings of Weiler and his ilk, baseball's
meaningless home runs aren't hit during seasons in which home runs
are a regular, even excessive, occurrence. They're hit during
seasons in which they are all too rare. They don't happen when
McGwire hits 70, or Ruth 60; they happen when Ruth hits 29 or
McCovey 36. That a home run mark is statistically meaningful is no
guarantee that it will ultimately be thought to possess historical
importance, and that one is statistically insignificant is no
strike against its assuming canonical status.
</P>
<P>
   The fans (and the fan in Weiler) already understand this point
better than the pundits (and the professor in Weiler). And that's
why they're flocking to ballparks like Enron Field, where what
might be cheap today will be classic tomorrow.

`DAYDREAM BELIEVERS': FAKERS WHO REALIZE THAT THEY'RE THE REAL
THING 
</HEADLINE>
  (Broadcast notes at end of review. Time, channel are for New York
area. Check local listings.) 
 By DAVID DeWITT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scene prompts amused, head-shaking, eye-blinking wonder: The
Beatles, the Fab Four themselves, sharing heart-to-hearts with the
Monkees, the Prefab Four, about the perils of fame and the burdens
of talent.
</P>
<P>
   That actually happened. The inventive American entertainment
machine sculptured four strangers into a band that parodied the
Beatles but ultimately shared their pop universe. ``Daydream
Believers: The Monkees Story,'' a smart and cheerful movie on VH1
Wednesday night, dramatizes the wildly improbable ride of this
manufactured band.
</P>
<P>
   The Monkees were conceived in 1965 as a gimmick: Take the madcap
style of the Beatles' film ``A Hard Day's Night,'' adapt it for
television and mix in talents like the filmmakers Bob Rafelson and
Paul Mazursky, all designed to tap into the nation's Beatlemania.
``You give me a free hand,'' the pop impresario Don Kirshner says
in the film, ``and I'll have 'em outselling the Beatles in six
months.''
</P>
<P>
   Who would have expected this idea to yield chart-topping hits, a
movie written by Jack Nicholson and audiences with the Beatles? Not
even the Monkees themselves. At first they seem delighted just to
have jobs. Yet ``Daydream Believers'' makes clear how this puppet
group gained its own life, thanks to the unlikely chemistry of its
members.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Nesmith (Jeff Geddis) and Peter Tork (L.B. Fisher) are
budding musicians; Micky Dolenz (Aaron Lohr) and Davy Jones (George
Stanchev) are workmanlike actors. All four need an opportunity and
respond to the open casting call for a proposed television comedy
titled ``The Monkees.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Daydream Believers'' makes the series the brainchild of a
somewhat composite character, Van Foreman (Colin Ferguson in an
intelligent performance), using the musical guidance of Kirshner
(Wallace Langham, who makes the role far more biting than Paul
Shaffer's familiar ``Saturday Night Live'' caricature). Kirshner is
promised total creative control of the Monkees' sound, well before
the band members are cast.
</P>
<P>
   That control doesn't sit well with Mike, who chafes at
Kirshner's use of studio musicians for the band's songs. ``Daydream
Believers'' portrays Mike as arrogant but somewhat innocent in his
belief that the Monkees can transcend the marketing forces that
made them.
</P>
<P>
   And in their desire for respect as a band, the Monkees seem to
dismiss a large part of their success: Their Emmy Award-winning
comic ensemble and the appealing personalities it offered, all
based on the performers themselves and bearing their real names. By
movie's end, with their television series canceled, the Monkees
seem to appreciate what they achieved, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daydream Believers'' has cast the Monkees with look-alikes
(aside from Lohr's Micky) who give subtle honesty to what could
have been rote performances. Fisher makes the intriguing Peter both
sweet and compellingly earnest; Geddis captures Mike's style with
relaxed clarity; and Lohr makes a likable individual of Micky, the
television show's broadest talent but the television film's least
developed Monkee.
</P>
<P>
   Stanchev's Davy is the center of this story. He clearly portrays
Davy's growing isolation from the other Monkees, who embrace the
rock 'n' roll life while he struggles to remain an actor though he
has become a phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The film's strong acting and thematic focus trump its sometimes
sketchy and formulaic dialogue. Nonetheless, the boldest moment of
``Daydream Believers'' is the script's: An opening scene in which a
contemporary man tries to sell a laptop-obsessed executive on the
``cutting edge'' idea of a show about a band, a scene that segues
into the series' 1965 pitch. The scene's apparent aim is to
introduce the Monkees to an audience familiar with today's
Backstreet Boys and similar manufactured acts.
</P>
<P>
   There's a big difference, however, between then and now. Can
anyone imagine the Backstreet Boys as stars of a weekly comedy
series? The Monkees may not have been the Beatles, but as
``Daydream'' seems to believe, they honestly earned their places in
pop history.

late 1990s was the phenomenal number of home runs being hit,''
Weiler reminds us that the number wasn't so ``phenomenal'' as it
seemed to the masses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows,'' he explains, ``how close Sosa came to
McGwire in 1998 (with 66 homers) and how close both came again in
1999 (with 65 and 63, respectively). What few fans realize, though,
is that neither McGwire nor Sosa came close to breaking Babe Ruth's
true home run record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose we were to do the same kind of adjustment for home run
inflation that we regularly do for economic inflation, for example,
to calculate the real rise of the Dow Jones Index from the 1920s to
the 1990s. In order for a McGwire or a Sosa (or Ken Griffey Jr.) to
break Ruth's real home run record from the 1920s, he now has to hit
more than 150, not just 60, home runs over the season.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a remarkable mixture of elitism and populism in this
sequence _ elitism in Weiler's commitment to chastising the fans
producing baseball's ``recent resurgence'' for misunderstanding the
meaning of the ``phenomenal number of home runs'' they enjoy;
populism in using the same argument to celebrate the ``real'' and
``true'' achievements of an icon from a previous period of
``resurgence of interest in baseball'': ``It should now be clear
why Babe Ruth was our greatest athlete in any sport in the past
century.''
</P>
<P>
   But the elitism and the populism in this claim are less far
apart than they might seem. Harvard professor Weiler doesn't hold
his own judgments to the same standard he imposes on the masses.
He's a fan of Ruth in exactly the same way that they are fans of
Sosa and McGwire. For Ruth's true home run record, at least
according to the ``economic inflation'' model Weiler provides,
wasn't 60 but 54.
</P>
<P>
   In 1920, Ruth hit 54 of the 369 home runs in the American
League, roughly 15 percent. When he hit 60 in 1927, the league hit
439; his portion had dropped to roughly 14 percent. Indeed,
measured in terms of his distance from the competition, Ruth's real
record was 29, the number he hit in 1919 when his closest
competitor managed only 10 (his closest competitors hit 19 in 1920
and 47 in 1927). However you slice it, Ruth's 60 is no more real a
home run mark than McGwire's 70.
</P>
<P>
   By the standard Weiler invokes, almost none of baseball's
landmark achievements are real. Statistics shape our understanding
of baseball history more than they shape our understanding of the
histories of other sports, but the statistics on which baseball
historians generally rely look more like iconic numbers than like
meaningful data.
</P>
<P>
   Take what is almost always adduced as the greatest single year
any pitcher has had in the modern era: Bob Gibson's 1968 season
with a record of 22-9 (including 13 shutouts in 34 starts) and an
ERA of 1.12. It's the 1.12 ERA that gets people's attention, and
rightly so; only one other pitcher in the postwar era, and I mean
post-WWI era, has even broken 1.50 _ Walter Johnson with a 1.49 in
1919. But Gibson's performance came during a period of pitching
inflation even greater than today's hitting inflation.
</P>
<P>
   In 1968, the overall National League ERA was only 2.99. In terms
of the averages established by his peers, Gibson had a great year,
one of the six greatest ever. In the 1990s, Greg Maddux had two
consecutive years in which he outperformed the National League by
an even greater margin. He just didn't have a 1.12 ERA. That
pitching numbers were ``watered down'' in 1968 doesn't compromise
the legacy of Gibson's achievement. It instead made his achievement
and its legacy possible.
</P>
<P>
   And so when you hear that today's players are overrated, just
remind yourself that being overrated is the best way to be highly
rated in baseball history. Over time we forget about the
circumstances that account for the statistical extremes we
celebrate. We hear about the insane offensive performances of this
season, but what about the insane offensive performances that this
era's stars are trying to eclipse? Hack Wilson's single-season
record of 190 RBIs is a good example.
</P>
<P>
   In 1930 the National League enjoyed one of the greatest
offensive years in baseball history: The average batting average
for non-pitchers was .312. The year saw three of the 10 highest RBI
totals in baseball history, four of the top 13, and six of the top
32. Do we hold that against Wilson? No. We hold it against people
like Rocky Colavito, who might well be in the Hall of Fame instead
of Wilson if he had been fortunate enough to play in an era when
105 RBIs couldn't win an MVP.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rantings of Weiler and his ilk, baseball's
meaningless home runs aren't hit during seasons in which home runs
are a regular, even excessive, occurrence. They're hit during
seasons in which they are all too rare. They don't happen when
McGwire hits 70, or Ruth 60; they happen when Ruth hits 29 or
McCovey 36. That a home run mark is statistically meaningful is no
guarantee that it will ultimately be thought to possess historical
importance, and that one is statistically insignificant is no
strike against its assuming canonical status.
</P>
<P>
   The fans (and the fan in Weiler) already understand this point
better than the pundits (and the professor in Weiler). And that's
why they're flocking to ballparks like Enron Field, where what
might be cheap today will be classic tomorrow.

ANALYSIS: COURT USED MIRANDA RULING TO REAFFIRM CONSTITUTIONAL
ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By LINDA GREENHOUSE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Timing, in constitutional law no less than in life
or love, can mean everything, and when it came to timing, the
opponents of the Miranda decision who finally managed to push the
Supreme Court into revisiting the case after 34 years turned out to
have been spectacularly unlucky.
</P>
<P>
   There might well have been a period, sometime in the past three
decades, when the court would have overturned Miranda, a bitterly
fought 5-4 decision that had appeared ever since to have an ever
more fragile hold on the court's loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the bad fortune of the ruling's opponents to finally
get the justices' attention at the very moment when the court's
interest in protecting its constitutional turf against
congressional incursions is at a peak unmatched in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   At issue in the case decided Monday was a 1968 law by which
Congress sought to overturn Miranda by replacing the familiar
warnings with the case-by-case test of a confession's
``voluntariness'' that the Miranda decision found constitutionally
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   The notion that Congress would tell the court what the
Constitution does or does not mean undoubtedly would have offended
the court when the law was passed. By this year, when the court got
its first chance to rule on the law, the idea was anathema, and a
much more conservative group of justices than the members of the
Warren court who had struggled over the confession issue 34 years
ago struck down the law and reaffirmed Miranda by a 7-2 vote.
</P>
<P>
   In a real sense, the surprisingly lopsided decision this week
said more about the court itself than about Miranda or about
defendants' rights in general.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's power, pure power,'' said Leon Friedman, a constitutional
law professor at Hofstra Law School. ``The court is telling
Congress: You can't overturn our good decisions, and you can't
overturn our bad decisions. You can't overturn our decisions _
period.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the precedents Chief Justice William Rehnquist cited in
his unadorned 14-page opinion was quite telling: City of Boerne vs.
Flores, the 1997 decision that overturned the Religious Freedom
Restoration Act. Congress had passed that law in 1993 to give more
official protection to religious practice than the court had said,
in a decision three years earlier, the First Amendment's Free
Exercise Clause provided for. ``The power to interpret the
Constitution in a case or controversy remains in the judiciary,''
Justice Anthony Kennedy wrote for the court in the Boerne case.
</P>
<P>
   In that instance, Congress was being more protective than the
court of individual rights, while in the anti-Miranda statute,
known as Section 3501, it was less protective. The outcome was the
same. ``Congress may not legislatively supersede our decisions
interpreting and applying the Constitution,'' Rehnquist said on
Monday in the Miranda case, United States vs. Dickerson.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a month earlier, in his opinion for the court striking
down the civil damages provision of the Violence Against Women Act
on the ground that Congress had exceeded its constitutional
authority, Rehnquist reached back to Chief Justice John Marshall's
declaration in Marbury vs. Madison in 1803 for the ultimate
statement of judicial supremacy: ``It is emphatically the province
and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in the context of the other recent cases, however,
Rehnquist's opinion for the court on Monday was notable because it
placed him so strikingly against type. He joined the court six
years after Miranda was decided and even as a very junior associate
justice quickly became one of the decision's most outspoken
critics.
</P>
<P>
   He has never been known for changing his mind, and there is no
reason to think that he has changed his basic view of the decision.
What quite clearly gave him pause was not some newfound affection
for Miranda, but the possible consequences to the court of
overturning it at this point, after dozens of decisions had applied
Miranda to state-court convictions and to state prisoners' federal
petitions for habeas corpus.
</P>
<P>
   As the chief justice noted in his opinion, the only possible
source of the court's authority to apply Miranda came from the
decision's status as a direct interpretation of the Constitution.
To decide now that Congress had legislatively overruled Miranda 32
years ago _ a colossal ``never mind'' _ would have made the court
look ineffectual if not fatuous. A close student of the court's
history, on which he has published three well-received books,
Rehnquist may well have been dismayed by the prospect that a
decision to overturn Miranda might go down in the public mind as
the main legacy of his tenure as chief justice.
</P>
<P>
   The 75-year-old chief justice may not be as preoccupied with his
legacy as President Clinton is with his; unlike the president, the
chief justice faces no timetable for leaving office and, for all
anyone knows, may have no retirement plans. Still, having served on
the court since the age of 47, for the last 14 years as chief
justice, it would hardly be surprising if he had another, more
affirmative sort of legacy in mind.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, his mark on the court is substantial. He is the
prime mover behind the federalism revolution, the court's
dramatically revived interest in policing the exercise of
congressional power as well as the boundary between state and
federal authority.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1995, when the court ruled in United States vs. Lopez, in
an opinion by Rehnquist, that Congress had exceeded its authority
in making it a federal crime to carry a gun near a school, the
court has invalidated all or part of 25 federal laws, many on
federalism or separation of powers grounds. When Miranda's
opponents launched Section 3501 years ago on its circuitous journey
to the court, they should have expected heavy waters but can be
excused for not having anticipated the shoals on which the statute
foundered and ultimately sank.

THE MENU WINKS, AND CATCHES THE EYE 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the menu at Blue Hill, a new restaurant on
Washington Place, there's a dish that might give diners pause. It's
called ``Not Another Roast Chicken.'' Dan Barber, one of the chefs,
said he wants diners to know that this isn't the cliched dish found
in every restaurant. It's a free-range organic chicken from a
small, obscure farm, roasted in a fancy high-tech oven imported
from Austria.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're inviting interaction,'' Barber said. He wants to provoke
a reaction, so his waiters can have a chance to explain how it's
different.
</P>
<P>
   This is also Barber's way of using the menu as one more way of
communicating with the customer. In New York these days the
traditional serious menu is being upstaged by menus that try to
make some personal comment: funny, ironic, intriguing, sometimes
just sophomoric.
</P>
<P>
   Personality is beginning to emerge somewhere between the entree
and the price, offering small glimpses of the chefs tucked away in
the kitchen. They're not just dutifully cranking out dinners; they
have ideas about food and eating that they want to express to their
customers. The menu is the first chance to communicate those ideas.
</P>
<P>
   When this is done well and with restraint, it's refreshing, even
charming. For instance, on the Lobster Club's menu, you'll come
across ``Creamed Spinach With Almost No Fat?'' You have to think
about it for a second. It's a tease. There is no such thing as
creamed spinach without fat.
</P>
<P>
   When it's not done so well, as in the references to ``Seizure
Salad'' at Greenwich Village Bistro and ``Chocolate Salami'' at
Revel, it can leave you worrying about who's behind that swinging
door.
</P>
<P>
   The other, serious, school of menu writing lists all the
ingredients and their sources like film credits. As reading
material, this ranks in excitement with a dental equipment catalog:
By the end, you are dizzy and exhausted from the whirl of words,
and so bored you could cry.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Rosenzweig's menus at the Lobster Club are a reaction to
these styles. ``I've always felt that a menu was an opportunity for
chefs to have fun and poke a little fun at themselves,'' she said,
``because I think chefs take themselves too seriously and menus are
too serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Her ``Sexy Grits,'' ``Voluptuous Cauliflower'' and ``He-Man
Salad,'' appearing periodically on the menu, may not be ha-ha
funny, but they are surprising. ``When we're devising dishes in the
kitchen, it's exactly how I talk about food,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Keller, the chef at the French Laundry in the Napa
Valley, is famously irreverent on his menu. Two of his classic
dishes are ``Macaroni and Cheese'' and ``Tongue in Cheek.'' Of
course, the macaroni and cheese is made with lobster, mascarpone
and orzo. The tongue in cheek is braised veal tongue and beef
cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   There is a fine line, however, between clever and cloying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flantastico'' at Patria, for instance, feels more like an
entry in the Zagat guide describing a flan shop. ``Fusilli Aum!
Aum!'' _ Neapolitan for ``Fusilli Yum! Yum!'' _ at La Locanda is
cute, but when the moment comes to order it, who is actually going
to say the words?
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately some chefs realize when they've crossed the line. At
Atlas, the desserts called ``Rumpledinger's Ice-Cargots'' and
``Vacherin `A Liberal Interpretation''' have been reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people just didn't get it,'' said James Danos, the
chef. Now, the ice-cargots is called ``Rumpledinger's Ice Cream and
Sorbet.'' The vacherin has been retired.
</P>
<P>
   Danos did, however, keep the ``Baked Black Truffle Mutton
Button,'' a cheese course of sheep's milk cheese and truffles that
is nothing more than a delicious little treat.
</P>
<P>
   At Blue Hill, Barber, 30, and his partner, Alex Urena, 29, are
new to running a restaurant. He admitted that they have had second
thoughts about the commentary they have added to their menu. ``I
wonder if saying `Not Another Roast Chicken' is a little too early
for us,'' he said. Someone like Keller, he pointed out, has the
pedigree and the cooking skills to back it up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Barber and Urena are both shy about going out into the
dining room. To them, a menu with bits of their personalities _
they also offer ``Real Slow Cooked Salmon'' and ``Spring'' (a
salad) _ is a way to step out of the kitchen without actually
speaking to people.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when you invite communication, you may actually get
it. Not long ago, one diner sent the roast chicken back to the
kitchen with a message for the chef: It was just another roast
chicken.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE YANKS DON'T NEED SOSA'S K'S 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In all the conversations about Sammy Sosa, two numbers are
invariably mentioned, 66 and 63, his total of home runs for the
Chicago Cubs in the past two seasons. Hardly anybody has mentioned
the numbers 174, 171 and 171, his total of strikeouts for the
Chicago Cubs in the past three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   And he has already struck out 82 times this season.
</P>
<P>
   That's too many K's _ the scorebook shorthand for a strikeout.
</P>
<P>
   Too many times Sosa whiffed or took a third strike. Too many
times he didn't even hit the ball where it might have dropped
between the outfielders or might have been bobbled or thrown away
for an error. Too many times when he diminished the chance for a
big inning.
</P>
<P>
   When Sosa's name first surfaced two weeks ago in trade
discussions, all those K's were the first stat that one of George
Steinbrenner's ``people'' brought up.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not what we need,'' a respected member of the Yankee
hierarchy replied when asked if a trade for Sosa was being
considered. ``He swings and misses too much.''
</P>
<P>
   When Steinbrenner was reminded of Sosa's strikeout habit, the
principal owner had his ``people'' pursue Juan Gonzalez, the
Detroit Tigers' outfielder who hit 45 and 39 homers for the Texas
Rangers the past two seasons with a more reasonable number of
strikeouts for a slugger, 126 and 105.
</P>
<P>
   But after Gonzalez declined the Yankees' one-year, $12.5 million
offer, Sosa again appeared to be the principal owner's fondest
remedy for the Yankees, who are struggling to score runs and
struggling to return to what they consider their rightful place,
first, in the American League East.
</P>
<P>
   But for all his home runs, Sammy Sosa is not what the Yankees
need.
</P>
<P>
   What the Yankees need is another dependable starting pitcher, if
not two. What they need is another hitter who will crash some home
runs, but not strike out too often. What they need is a principal
owner who will forget about trading for a slugger who, for all his
home runs, does strike out too much and whose $20 million contract
demand might disrupt the clubhouse calm.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter and Bernie Williams, each with three World Series
rings, deserve to be the highest-paid Yankees _ not Sosa, who would
be a Yankee come lately.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cubs, a franchise that has been rebuilding almost
annually since 1908, when it last won the World Series, the Sosa
headlines have emphasized his home runs (20 this season) because at
Wrigley Field that's about all there is to emphasize.
</P>
<P>
   His strikeouts (82 this season) are mostly ignored, because the
Cubs now are next to last in the National League Central after
finishing in the cellar last season.
</P>
<P>
   In Sosa's home run duels with Mark McGwire, who hit 70 and 66
the last two seasons, Sosa's 171 strikeouts each year were even
more than McGwire's 155 and 141 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Over their history, the Yankees have been synonymous with home
runs, but none of their Hall of Fame sluggers _ Babe Ruth, Lou
Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Mickey Mantle and Reggie Jackson _ ever
struck out in a season anywhere near as often as Sosa did the last
two seasons and this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth's high in strikeouts was 93 in 1923. When he hit 60 homers
in 1927, he struck out only 89 times. His career total was only
1,330.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrig twice led the American League in home runs, with 49 in
both 1934 and 1936. He struck out only 31 times in 1934, only 46
times in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's ratio of home runs to strikeouts is arguably even
more impressive than his 56-game hitting streak. Over his career,
DiMaggio hit 361 homers against only 369 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, the year of his hitting streak, he had only 13
strikeouts. In 1939, he had only 20 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Mantle's career strikeout total of 1,710 ranks ninth all-time,
but his season high was 126, in 1959. When he batted .353, slugged
52 homers and drove in 130 runs for the triple crown in 1956, he
struck out 99 times.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson is the career leader in strikeouts with 2,597, but in
measuring the Yankees for World Series rings in both 1977 and 1978,
he struck out only (for him) 129 and 133 times. He led the league
five times in strikeouts, four times with Oakland (he had 171 in
1968, his first full major-league season) and once with California.
</P>
<P>
   But the Yankees don't need anybody with as many K's in the
scorebook as Sammy Sosa.

CAPTURING,   AND SELLING,   THE GLAMOUR   OF FLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: R.I., Va., N.C., Calif., France, Germany, Egypt)  (For release Sunday, July 2) 
 By RITA REIF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Posters helped sell aviation to the world a century
ago, though not until five years after Orville and Wilbur Wright
flew a heavier-than-air machine for the first time at Kitty Hawk,
N.C., in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, public interest in flying surged first not in the
United States but in Europe, when Wilbur Wright brought the
brothers' biplane to Le Mans, in western France, introducing it at
a race course and stunning the audience with its superior
performance. After that demonstration, aviation became a spectator
sport.
</P>
<P>
   European airplane producers promptly adapted various aspects of
the Wrights' technology to their monoplanes and biplanes. French
and German pilots demonstrated the improvements in their aircraft
at air meets that proliferated, becoming monthly events in cities
throughout Europe and North Africa like Frankfurt; Reims, France,
and Heliopolis, Egypt; they became as popular as rock 'n' roll
concerts are today. Meanwhile, poster production, which was far
more advanced on the Continent than in the United States, boomed,
awakening the public to every aspect of flying. And as flight
posters became increasingly colorful and diverse, they advertised
more than air meets. Some promoted the planes favored by the most
famous pilots, while others sold glamour, in consumer products that
ranged from Champagne to furs.
</P>
<P>
   The little-known role of posters in popularizing flight in the
early 20th century is the focus of ``Looping the Loop: Posters of
Early Flight,'' the first museum exhibition on the subject in this
country, on view at the National Air and Space Museum here through
next Sunday. The show was organized by the museum, along with the
owner of the 32 posters on view, the Allen Airways Flying Museum of
El Cajon, Calif., and the Smithsonian Institution Traveling
Exhibition Service. The show, which will travel through 2002, moves
next to the Thames Science Center in Newport, R.I. (July 22 to Oct.
8), and then to the Virginia Air and Space Center in Hampton (Oct.
29 to Jan. 7, 2001).
</P>
<P>
   ``The period covered in the show, the 1880s to 1915, represents
the beginning of the consumer society,'' said Joanna Gernstein
London, the curator of the exhibition. ``The public expected to
participate, even if it just meant watching.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of flight as depicted in these posters is frequently
meant to attract viewers, if not as fliers, then as buyers of
whatever the poster is selling. The message was sometimes obvious,
as in the earliest poster in the show, a French image from the
1880's, ``Ballon Captif,'' which depicts a tethered hot-air balloon
in a fairground. The image invites the public to inspect the
balloon and to float aloft in it; apparently the ploy worked,
increasing attendance at the fair.
</P>
<P>
   Posters in the early 20th century continued to show balloons,
but by then they were seen as upstaged by dirigibles and airplanes,
which were depicted soaring or floating past the spires of Gothic
cathedrals. With daredevil pilots demonstrating flying as a sport
and entertainment, poster artists depicted flight as a fantasy,
even a comedy. These conceptions would soon be replaced by darker
images, of airplanes as tools of war.
</P>
<P>
   In 1909, poster artists usually opted for the lighthearted
approach. In a Belle Epoque poster announcing an air meet in Monte
Carlo, a dapper aviator in cap, ascot, boutonniere and yellow
gloves is shown at the stick of an open-air Wright biplane, a lady
in red at his side looking as if she is flying through the air on
an earthbound swing, not in an aircraft high above the Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   That year, too, the Frenchman Louis Bleriot crossed the English
Channel in a monoplane in the first such powered flight, going from
Calais to Dover in a record 37 minutes, which made him a national
hero. The victory was advertised in a powerful poster by Gabriel
Borel, a Paris producer of the acetylene lamps on Bleriot's
aircraft, which is shown flying at night, its lamps illuminating
the white cliffs of Dover just before landing.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1913 poster, the mood quickens in a depiction of the French
pilot Adolphe Pegoud making aviation history by flying upside-down
and by doing an aerial somersault over a racetrack in Hanover,
Germany. Onlookers feared that his blood-tingling exhibition would
be suicidal, but the thrilling feats he performed were later cited
as the precursors of the combat tactics pilots mastered during
World War I.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's debt to two passionate collectors of
aeronautical material is clearly stated in the wall labels. The
rich cultural history used in the descriptions of the posters was
the work of Henry Serrano Villard, an American diplomat and writer
from a prominent New York publishing family. He was introduced to
aviation at age 9, when he was taken up in a plane during an air
tournament at Belmont Park on Long Island. Two years later, when he
moved with his family to France, he joined the Societe Generale
Aeronautique and attended many of the meets celebrated in these
posters, and he collected aeronautical memorabilia for the rest of
his life. Villard, who became the first American ambassador to
Libya in 1952 and later was ambassador to Senegal and Mauritania,
retired from foreign service in 1961 and wrote several books on
early aviation. The last of these bears the same title as the show,
and was published by Kales Press ($40) of Carlsbad, Calif., after
his death at 95 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The posters in the exhibition and the book were assembled by
Willis M. Allen Jr., who showed a bit of daring when he ignored a
warning printed on the Monte Carlo poster, a piece of ephemera that
was never meant to be owned privately. It says, ``Anyone found in
possession of this poster will be prosecuted.'' &QL;

   LONDON _ The bird fluttered around Centre Court, briefly
interrupting the proceedings at the All England Lawn Tennis &AMP;
Croquet Club, before Lleyton Hewitt contemptuously shooed it away.
He didn't need any help. He'd already mastered the role of pigeon.
</P>
<P>
   If nothing else, Hewitt's shocking 6-3, 6-2, 7-5 first-round
Wimbledon caging by 56th-ranked Jan-Michael Gambill Tuesday offered
evidence that Pete Sampras's imprimatur may be a tad premature.
</P>
<P>
   Tennis's current ruler had anointed the 19-year-old Australian
``the future of the game'' _ and that was even before Hewitt
toppled Sampras in the Stella Artois final at Queen's Club 10 days
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday Gambill turned him into a thing of the past, at least
for the present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had one of those days, really,'' said Hewitt, who
couldn't even take consolation in the victory of his girlfriend Kim
Clijsters over Nathalie Tauziat earlier in the afternoon. ``I
struggled off the ground the whole day. The court I found very
slippery out there. It didn't suit my game at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there was a lot more than landscaping to it. Sampras
proclaimed that Hewitt, ranked seventh in the world and seeded
seventh here, has all the tools to dominate tennis in a very short
while. Tuesday he brought equipment that was ideal for surviving
for a very short while. All the weapons were working in his
self-destructive arsenal: errant serving (eight double faults, 38
percent accuracy), an inability to sustain firepower in a
two-fisted baseline slugfest (two volley winners), and a lingering
lethargy that seemed to overtake him for the first two sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wasn't much to get pumped up about,'' Hewitt said. ``I tried
as much as possible out there. I really had very little chances,
particularly on his serve the first two sets. He just served bombs
the whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Funny, that's supposed to be one of Hewitt's calling cards. But
he was the victim against Gambill, who nailed 15 aces, including
seven in the third set, when Hewitt finally seemed to be emerging
from his ennui.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared energized when he broke Gambill for a 3-1 lead,
pumping his fist and exhorting himself with a cry of ``Come on!''
</P>
<P>
   He did, for a spell. But after building a 5-2 lead _ and visions
of a valorous comeback _ he collapsed, failing to win another game.
Gambill weathered six deuces on his next serve to stay alive at
5-3, broke Hewitt to 5-4, broke his spirit to go up, 6-5, and put
him away on the first match point, a serve that Hewitt plopped into
the net, along with his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole time, I still felt that I had a chance at winning,''
said Hewitt. ``I never doubted myself until it was over today.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this defeat was in the making well before it started,
with the great expectations that have become as much part of Hewitt
as his bushy ponytail that matches Clijsters's hairstyle. Maybe
Sampras and his fellow Hewitt worshipers were the real culprits.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, not at all,'' Hewitt said. ``I think I'm used to that,
living in Australia, playing the Australian summer, doing very well
in the Australian summer every year.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll have extra time to prepare for the Australian summer this
year, while Gambill basks in the gloomy London weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think playing a match like that is very helpful to me
confidencewise,'' said Gambill.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old Spokane, Wash., native is in fact no slouch, as
evidenced by his victory over Hewitt in the Scottsdale, Ariz.,
final last year. Hewitt got some revenge with a win over Gambill in
Miami this season, but he was trumped with a vengeance Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had some big results every year,'' said Gambill, ``but
not enough of them to really create and confirm the interest.''
</P>
<P>
   That's exactly what Hewitt's destiny is presumed to be. But
perhaps he has a better perspective of his place in the
constellation than do his admirers. Asked yet again about his
potential, he pointed out, ``I haven't made a quarterfinal of a
Grand Slam.''
</P>
<P>
   He would have settled for the second round of this one.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The sequencing of the human genome is often described as a
triumph akin to landing on the moon. For investors, that might not
be the most comforting analogy. Three decades after Apollo 11, no
one has yet made a profit going to the moon.
</P>
<P>
   A similar business challenge faces Celera Genomics. Having
mapped the human genome at a speed that doubters had said was
impossible, Celera now must once again defy the skeptics who say it
will not be able to make money by selling information about the
genome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a private company in 1967 announcing they are going
to race NASA to the moon,'' said Dr. William A. Haseltine, the
chief executive of Human Genome Sciences Inc., a rival genomics
company with a different strategy. ``And they did it. The next
question is, `What is the business plan?''' Haseltine ridiculed
Celera's business plan as the equivalent of selling real estate on
the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that knowing the 3 billion letters in the human
genetic code will be immensely important for creating drugs and
tests for disease. Genomics companies are using different methods
to build a business out of the genome. Incyte Pharmaceuticals of
Palo Alto, Calif., sells access to a database about genes to drug
companies. Millennium Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge, Mass., is using
genomics to understand disease processes to develop drugs. Human
Genome Sciences of Rockville, Md., is developing drugs and selling
its information.
</P>
<P>
   Like Incyte, Celera is licensing access to its databases for a
fee of several million dollars a year per corporate customer, with
lower fees for academic institutions. ``We're an information
business like The New York Times,'' said J. Craig Venter, the
doctor who founded Celera.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious difficulty with this strategy is that the publicly
funded Human Genome Project is also sequencing the genome and is
giving its information away.
</P>
<P>
   A second difficulty, competitors argue, is that pharmaceutical
companies are most interested not in the raw sequence but the genes
themselves, which code for the production of proteins that carry
out bodily functions.
</P>
<P>
   Genes account for only about 3 percent of the genome. The
function, if any, of most of the rest of the sequence is unknown.
Computer programs can spot genes amid the sequence, but not
reliably. Even with the genome sequence virtually complete,
scientists cannot agree whether there are 30,000 genes or 130,000.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte Pharmaceuticals and Human Genome Sciences have already
compiled databases of genes or gene fragments, which they found by
catching genes in the act of producing proteins in cells.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte already has more than 20 companies subscribing to its
database of genes, with revenues last year of $157 million. Celera
has five corporate subscribers, with revenues of $12.5 million in
the 1999 fiscal year. But in this fiscal year, revenues are
expected to more than triple.
</P>
<P>
   Incyte and Human Genome have applied for patents on thousands of
those genes. Celera of Rockville, Md., has also applied for patents
or plans to apply for them on genes, but Venter said the company is
depending on sales of information, not gene patents, for its
success.
</P>
<P>
   Although Incyte has more customers, Celera's stock market
valuation recently, more than $7 billion, is twice Incyte's.
Investors say the full genome sequence will be worth more than a
database of just genes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If information is power, Celera is going to be insanely
powerful,'' said Lissa Morgenthaler, biotechnology analyst for the
California Technology Stock Letter, who once hired Venter as a
consultant. ``If you haven't got the whole kit and caboodle, you're
one down from someone who does.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another player that will soon have the whole kit and caboodle,
is the National Institutes of Health's Human Genome Project, but
Venter says he is not worried. Celera, he says, has a more accurate
sequence and will offer more powerful tools for analyzing that
data.
</P>
<P>
   That matchup is similar to that between commercial computer
software and so-called public domain software. Public projects can
draw on more diverse brain power than a single company, but the
resulting product tends to be less polished than a commercial
product.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the public domain ever doing in collective fashion
what someone can do when their whole reason to exist depends on the
success of the database,'' said Michael King, biotechnology analyst
at Robertson, Stephens, a brokerage firm in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Even some scientists associated with the public project say
Celera has a more complete and accurate sequence. But the public
project will be where Celera is now in a year or two. So Celera
must keep progressing. It is racing to sequence the mouse genome by
the end of the year so it can offer man and mouse for comparison, a
valuable tool the public project will not be able to offer just
yet.
</P>
<P>
   Even without competition from the public project, Celera must
advance. Many biotechnology startups are already working on the
next task _ determining the functions of genes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Sangamo BioSciences Inc. and Exelixis Inc. have
technology for figuring out what genes do, sometimes called
functional genomics. Gene Logic Inc. and other companies offer
information on what genes are turned on in different types of
cells, a field known as gene expression. Other companies, such as
Cytogen and Oxford Glycosciences, are pursuing proteomics,
determining which proteins are present in particular cells.
</P>
<P>
   Celera is moving into proteomics. It is also compiling a
database of millions of differences in genome sequence among
people. Such differences, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms,
could become important in determining which drugs will work best
for which patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``The race at this point is not for the DNA,'' said Steven
Holtzman, chief business officer of Millennium Pharmaceuticals.
``That race is over. The race is in assigning to genes and to
variations in genes a role in disease initiation and progression
and drug response.''
</P>
<P>
   Celera hopes to bring to bear the same tremendous computer power
and money _ it raised about $1 billion in a stock offering this
spring _ that allowed it to race ahead in genome sequencing. The
company, which was founded in 1998, had a cumulative loss of $130
million at the end of 1999 compared with a cumulative loss for
Incyte, which was founded in 1991, of $55 million.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not as bad as it might sound. Celera is a subsidiary
of PE Corp. of Norwalk, Conn., which also makes the machines used
to sequence the genome. That part of PE, known as PE Biosystems, is
profitable and has no doubt benefited from the fact that Celera's
effort spurred others, including the public project, to buy more
sequencing machines. PE has also enjoyed some tax benefits
resulting from Celera's losses.
</P>
<P>
   Venter predicted Celera's genome database business will break
even by the end of 2002. But because Celera will be investing in
proteomics and other new activities, the company itself will not be
profitable for several years after that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Weisbrod, chief investment officer of Merlin Biomed
Group, a New York investment fund, said he did not think Celera's
database would be of much immediate value to drug companies. But
``if they can last,'' he added, ``they will be one of the premier
companies of the next decade.''

 &HT;    U.S. CONGRESS MOVES TO EASE CUBAN EMBARGO
 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (w) Washington categories.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress is poised to ease four decades of
sanctions against Cuba as early as this week, after House
Republicans reached agreement Tuesday over legislation that would
allow American farm goods to be sold to the struggling Caribbean
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would clear the way, immediately upon passage, for
U.S. farmers to begin annually exporting millions of dollars worth
of food to Cuba. It has been the target of a U.S. economic embargo
since communist revolutionary Fidel Castro consolidated control
over the tiny country, with the help of his Soviet patrons, in
1960.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the change, led by Rep. George Nethercutt,
R-Wash., were reviewing the possibility of attaching the
implementing legislation to some broader measure expected to be
passed by both the House and Senate before lawmakers break for the
July 4 weekend.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said President Clinton
supports the main thrust of the measure. Clinton has reservations,
however, about a provision that would prevent future presidents
from restricting U.S. food or medicine exports as part of punitive
sanctions against other nations.
</P>
<P>
   That provision, Lockhart told reporters, threatens to tie
presidents' hands in the formulation of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In theory, we don't have a problem if aid goes directly to the
Cuban people for the benefit of the Cuban people,'' Lockhart told
reporters at the White House. ``But the President also needs
</P>
<P>
   the flexibility, as the steward of our foreign policy, to
implement the policy. And we oppose anything that restricts that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said, though, that lifting the U.S. embargo on food
exports was not a first step toward an overall easing of 40 years
of sanctions against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Political repression and human rights violations under Castro,
said Lockhart, still call for sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The President has made clear we can provide aid, whether it be
food or medicine, to the people, but we don't believe it's time to
provide any kind of aid that helps the Cuban government,'' Lockhart
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt, though, whose state produces a large amount of
wheat, apples, peas and other farm goods for export, is opposed to
sanctions that have the effect of punishing American farmers. The
industry relies on exports of roughly $4 billion a month for a good
portion
</P>
<P>
   of its income.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is never justified in using unilateral food
and medicine sanctions as weapons of foreign policy,'' Nethercutt
said at a Capitol Hill press conference. ``This is a fundamental
shift in American foreign policy and a new day for American
agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nethercutt provisions are formally called the Trade
Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement portion of the $14.4
billion agriculture appropriations bill for 2001. That bill _ one
of 13 spending measures the Congress seeks to pass before the end
of the current fiscal year on Sept. 30 _ has been held up since May
amid negotiations over the proposed trade sanctions changes.
</P>
<P>
   In essence, the Nethercutt provisions terminate existing
sanctions, and prohibit future options, that restrict the export of
U.S. farm products and drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba is the main country affected. The U.S. State Department
opened farm exports to Iran, Sudan and Libya _ countries the U.S.
regards as official supporters of terrorism _ as the result of an
April 1999 White House directive. U.S. exports of medicine to Cuba
have been permitted since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agreed the shift in Cuba policy would be largely
symbolic and result in only a small amount of sales at first.
Extensive prohibitions against U.S.-Cuban commerce would remain in
place, as would restrictions on U.S. investment, banking and
tourism in Cuba. Imports into the United States of Cuban cigars,
for example, and other Cuban products would remain forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a concession to the powerful Cuban-American lobby, House
Republicans required that Cuba pay in hard cash _ American dollars
_ for any purchases the country makes from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, such purchases are aided by a system of financing
from American banks, credits to individual countries and loans
backed by the U.S. government to help facilitate overseas trade.
</P>
<P>
   Castro opponents, such as Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., who
was born in Cuba, said the financing restrictions would make it
difficult for Cuba to increase its purchase of U.S. goods in any
appreciable way.
</P>
<P>
   He also cast the legislation as a step toward tightening the
economic noose around Cuba . The legislation agreed to by House
Republicans would strip the White House of its authority to ease
restrictions on any American wanting to travel to Cuba. The House
measure would require instead that any such loosening first receive
Congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz-Balart hailed that provision as a victory for Castro's
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closing off Clinton's tourism option for Castro is our most
important achievement in years,'' Diaz-Balart said in a prepared
statement. ``We are extremely pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba gave a tepid greeting to the proposal, saying it was
''symbolic'' and left most existing U.S. sanctions in place.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, Nethercutt and his Congressional colleagues were
reviewing a number of options for securing passage of the measure.
House leaders were weighing whether to keep the bill as part of the
agriculture bill or to attach it as an amendment to some other
legislative vehicle _ the supplemental budget for emergency
spending has been mentioned in the Senate _ considered certain to
pass.

regards as official supporters of terrorism _ as the result of an
April 1999 White House directive. U.S. exports of medicine to Cuba
have been permitted since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agreed the shift in Cuba policy would be largely
symbolic and result in only a small amount of sales at first.
Extensive prohibitions against U.S.-Cuban commerce would remain in
place, as would restrictions on U.S. investment, banking and
tourism in Cuba. Imports into the United States of Cuban cigars,
for example, and other Cuban products would remain forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   And, in a concession to the powerful Cuban-American lobby, House
Republicans required that Cuba pay in hard cash _ American dollars
_ for any purchases the country makes from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily, such purchases are aided by a system of financing
from American banks, credits to individual countries and loans
backed by the U.S. government to help facilitate overseas trade.
</P>
<P>
   Castro opponents, such as Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., who
was born in Cuba, said the financing restrictions would make it
difficult for Cuba to increase its purchase of U.S. goods in any
appreciable way.
</P>
<P>
   He also cast the legislation as a step toward tightening the
economic noose around Cuba . The legislation agreed to by House
Republicans would strip the White House of its authority to ease
restrictions on any American wanting to travel to Cuba. The House
measure would require instead that any such loosening first receive
Congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   Diaz-Balart hailed that provision as a victory for Castro's
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Closing off Clinton's tourism option for Castro is our most
important achievement in years,'' Diaz-Balart said in a prepared
statement. ``We are extremely pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Cuba gave a tepid greeting to the proposal, saying it was
''symbolic'' and left most existing U.S. sanctions in place.
</P>
<P>
   Late Tuesday, Nethercutt and his Congressional colleagues were
reviewing a number of options for securing passage of the measure.
House leaders were weighing whether to keep the bill as part of the
agriculture bill or to attach it as an amendment to some other
legislative vehicle _ the supplemental budget for emergency
spending has been mentioned in the Senate _ considered certain to
pass.

FEMA REPORT CITES GROWING EROSION RISKS FOR COASTAL HOUSES

<TEXT>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency said Tuesday in a report
to Congress, that a quarter or more of houses within 500 feet of
the United States coast may be lost to erosion in the next 60
years, putting intolerable strain on the federal Flood Insurance
Program.
</P>
<P>
   The report called for a major new effort to map coastal erosion,
identify hazard areas and raise premiums in the insurance program,
perhaps even doubling them, to take erosion risk into account. And
it suggested the agency consider adopting setback requirements to
limit building at the edge of the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Though the report covers all ocean and Great Lakes coasts, it
said the erosion problem was particularly severe on the Atlantic
coast, where beaches retreat on average 2 to 3 feet a year, and the
Gulf coast, where the overall annual erosion rate is 6 feet a year.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 coastal structures now fall to erosion annually,
said James Lee Witt, the director of FEMA, in an interview Tuesday,
adding that the figure could rise to as many as 10,000 in 10 years.
Almost 350,000 houses are within 500 feet of the ocean and or Great
Lakes coastlines, according to the report. Though most are not
covered by the federal program, ``we have a lot more structures out
there at risk than we anticipated,'' Witt said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the situation would get worse if sea level continued to
rise and Americans continud to migrate toward the coasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have on average 3,600 people relocating to these regions
per day,'' he said. ``You're looking at an awful lot of risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen P. Leatherman, a coastal geologist at Florida
International University, where he heads the International
Hurricane Center, led the team of researchers who produced the
report. ``A lot people have been startled by the findings,''
Leatherman said. ``What we see is a lot of properties that have
been insured by FEMA that were built when there was a wide beach
and a big sand dune. Those have either been diminished or in some
places are completely gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Witt said erosion hazard maps and better building codes would
reduce property damage, but he also praised setback requirements as
``a first step and a good step.''
</P>
<P>
   But advocates for coastal property owners called the report a
thinly disguised effort to use federal insurance regulations to
force people off the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a small group of self-proclaimed experts who are
convinced that no one should live anywhere near the coast,'' the
American Coastal Coalition, an advocacy group for coastal
communities, said in a statement. ``Unfortunately the report cloaks
bad policy recommendations in the garments of scientific
respectability.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Howard Marlowe, the coalition's president, said it was important
for coastal residents, or prospective coastal residents, to
understand the hazards. But Marlowe said the federal government
should not use its insurance program to discourage people who want
to build at the coast.
</P>
<P>
   As for setback requirements, he said it would be crucial for
decisions to be made locally. ``We don't want to put the federal
government into the business of making zoning ordinances,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Buckley, who heads FEMA's existing mapping effort, said
the agency would seek congressional approval of money to cover
erosion mapping and whatever authorization was needed for changes
in insurance rates. A similar effort, including setback
requirements, foundered a decade ago amid opposition from
representatives of coastal areas.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA administers the Flood Insurance Program, which since its
establishment in 1968 has offered coverage to homeowners in coastal
areas who might otherwise have been unable to obtain it. Towns
seeking to make the insurance available to residents must enact
FEMA-approved building codes that, among other things, call for
structures to be elevated in zones where flood waters would spread
in major storms. Structures built in compliance with FEMA codes
have consistently survived with less damage in coastal storms.
</P>
<P>
   But critics assert that the program, by offering coverage that
private insurance companies are increasingly unwilling to provide,
inadvertently encourages unwise development of the coast.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, in establishing its zones and insurance rates, the
program did not take erosion into account. The report issued today
says that was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within the first few hundred feet bordering the nation's
coast, property owners face as large a risk of damage from erosion
as they do from flooding,'' it says. Unless rates are altered to
reflect that risk, it says, ``erosion losses will be subsidized by
policyholders in non-eroding areas or general taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   To fully reflect this risk, the report says, insurance rates in
high risk areas would be, on average, twice as high as they are now
_ typically $700 to $2,000 per $100,000 worth of coverage. Coverage
is capped at $250,000 for a house and $100,000 for its contents.
</P>
<P>
   The report, produced by the H. John Heinz III Center for Science
Economics and Environment under contract with FEMA, is available at
www.heinzcenter.org.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It estimates that it would cost approximately $5 million a year
to identify erosion hazard areas, map them, maintain the maps and
make the information available to potential purchasers or local
officials. But the investment would save money in the long run, it
says, because ``if all currently empty lots in areas most
susceptible to erosion are built on, damage from erosion would rise
by roughly $100 million a year for the value of the structures
alone. The cost effectiveness of mapping depends on how much the
maps reduce development (and rebuilding) within eroding areas, but
the investment is likely to be worthwhile.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, the report says, ``Information about the
magnitude of this risk, which varies widely, is not generally
available.''
</P>
<P>
   The report notes that several methods, notably beach nourishment
and the construction of so-called `hard structures' like groins,
revetments or seawalls can protect structures on the beach. But
hard structures can, as the report put it, ``have negative impacts
on the physical and aesthetic characteristics of beaches,'' and
beach renourishment, which it said costs an average of $300,000 a
year per mile of coast and is rarely cost effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoreline protection measures can augment, but are not
substitutes for, other options,'' the report says.

A MODEST CREATOR   WITH A GIFT FOR GLOSS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Md., Calif.)  (For release Sunday, July 2)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It is both a Hollywood legend and a fact that the
people who create glamorous films and television shows are often
not especially glamorous. Take the case of Darren Star: the son of
an orthodontist from Potomac, Md., a boy who used his bar mitzvah
money to buy a subscription to Variety, a quiet, friendly and
modest 38-year-old writer and producer who eschews fancy clothes,
clubs and trappings and somehow seems unlikely to have been
involved in the hugely successful and unmistakably flashy shows
``Beverly Hills 90210'' and ``Melrose Place,'' as well as HBO's
acclaimed ``Sex and the City.''
</P>
<P>
   Star, who also helped create two new television shows for the
fall, the WB network's ``Grosse Pointe'' and Fox's ``The Street,''
admitted that his shows are tinged with glamour and fantasy. ``I
enjoy bringing a slightly larger-than-life quality to characters in
fairly ordinary circumstances,'' he said while eating scrambled
eggs in a Santa Monica hotel coffee shop overlooking the beach.
``There's a gloss that draws in audiences and allows me to tell the
stories I want to tell.''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged. ``It also happens to be the train I'm on,'' he
said. ``And, for the moment, there's no reason to get off it.''
</P>
<P>
   Why should he? Star is not only one of the most successful
writer-producers on television, but also one of the most prolific.
By the fall season, he will have three shows on the air: ``Sex and
the City,'' the hit comedy series that seeks to offer a candid view
of sex and relationships among some (what else?) beautiful women in
Manhattan; ``The Street,'' about successful and, yes, handsome
young turks on Wall Street; and the suddenly controversial ``Grosse
Pointe,'' which is Star's tongue-in-cheek look at a teen-age
television soap opera that's very much like ``Beverly Hills
90210.'' The fact that the soap opera actors are not only depicted
as shallow and silly but actually resemble some real-life
counterparts has already stirred problems for Star.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful television producer Aaron Spelling, who has a
complicated relationship with Star as both a mentor and a
competitor, has complained that his daughter, Tori Spelling, is
being lampooned on ``Grosse Pointe.'' Spelling was one of the stars
of ``Beverly Hills 90210''; a ``Grosse Pointe'' character, Marcy
Sternfeld, is an actress with family connections that got her a job
on the fictional series. Star said that, under pressure from WB, he
had changed the hair color of the actress, Lindsay Sloane, who
plays Marcy Sternfeld, and deleted a scene in which the actress
becomes sick because of an eating disorder.
</P>
<P>
   But Star said he has fought Spelling's efforts to influence the
network, particularly in regard to the show's nepotism plot line.
``This is not Tori Spelling,'' Star insisted. ``I'm not out to hurt
anyone's feelings. I've made some minor changes.'' But Star said
that he would seriously object were the WB network to ask him for
weekly changes in the character. Spelling did not respond to a
request for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Star has plainly made an effort to move beyond the teen and
20-something genre that, in many ways, he helped create. After
moving to New York in 1995 _ he still has a home in the Hollywood
Hills _ Star created ``Central Park West'' for CBS. The glitzy soap
opera about rich and beautiful people in New York, which starred,
among others, Mariel Hemingway, Raquel Welch, Ron Liebman and
Lauren Hutton, flopped. Star said he believed the series failed
because CBS, with its older audience, was the wrong network for a
show initially designed for young professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for a lover of one of the younger women on the
show and I got this call from CBS saying that they really wanted
Gerald McRaney, and I realized the show was really going to have to
change,'' Star said. McRaney, in his 50s, had been the star of the
CBS series ``Major Dad.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point Star optioned the book ``Sex and the City,'' by
Candace Bushnell. ``I did this show because I was sick of network
television,'' Star said. ``I did `Melrose Place,' which had a huge
audience but no respect. I wanted respect. I couldn't really tell
stories in my voice. I couldn't really tell stories that I, myself,
wanted to see. And I felt the idea of a comedy about sex was
something I really wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Star, who produces the show with Michael Patrick King, brushed
aside the criticism that its sex-obsessed women are perhaps too
one-dimensional and verge on caricature. ```Seinfeld' was
sex-obsessed too _ that show wasn't about his job,'' Star said.
``Most shows about single guys are about sex too. The difference is
we don't veil it under double-entendres here, because it's HBO.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Albrecht, HBO's president of original programming, said
that Star's success on television rested in part on his ability to
deal with real issues: high-schoolers coping with teen-age angst
and sexuality (``Beverly Hills 90210''), young people struggling to
forge careers (``Melrose Place'') and successful women in their
30's searching for happiness (``Sex and the City''). But Star then
places his characters in a glamorous _ sometimes improbably
glamorous _ setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got relatability and you've got fantasy, and this makes
people want to watch these shows week after week,'' Albrecht said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Grushow, chairman of the Fox Television Entertainment
Group, has known Star since the early days of ``Beverly Hills
90210.'' ``Darren has an uncanny ability to understand what the
public wants,'' he said. ``He has his finger on the pulse of what's
going on, what people are talking about. And he captures it and
executes it brilliantly.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Jessica Parker, who plays the New York sex columnist who
narrates ``Sex and the City,'' and is also a producer of the
series, said that Star's writing was deceptive. ``It's often
appropriately glib and surfacey, the characters are colorful, but
then in the last three minutes he can turn the knife and kill
you,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Often the shows end on an unexpectedly poignant or believable
note, Parker said. As a result, she said, women relate to it and
men are engaged by it. ``When I walk down the street what people
most often say to me is, `This is my life,''' she said. ``They
relate to the hunt, the journey, the disappointments, the hurts,
the ridiculousness, the whims and the vulgarity of looking for
love. It just resonates with people.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Apart from indulging his taste for fancy restaurants in New York
and Los Angeles, Star, who is single, lives his life almost
entirely around his work. Several years ago he met with Madonna to
discuss a film project. ``She invited me to attend the Independent
Film Awards in New York,'' he said. ``It was something I was
excited to do. I'm a huge Madonna fan. But I was working. I showed
up an hour late. She wasn't happy.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.) (MORE)  &QL; 
 &QL; 
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Potomac, a suburb of Washington, Star was taking
screenwriting courses at American University while still in high
school. At the University of Southern California and UCLA, he
majored in creative writing. After graduation, he worked as a
waiter at a Hamburger Hamlet and as an assistant to a publicist. At
24, he sold his first screenplay, ``Doin' Time on Planet Earth.''
The movie quickly disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, he was living in an apartment complex in West
Hollywood (the inspiration for ``Melrose Place''), and his
unproduced screenplays soon won him a reputation as someone who
could write dialogue for teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Diller, then chairman of Fox, came up with the idea of a
television series set in a high school. Spelling was brought in to
produce, and Star, who was 28, was asked to write the pilot. The
series began in the fall of 1990, and ended in May after 10 years.
Star's involvement with the show lasted five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, the kids were beautiful and rich, for the most part, but
that wasn't the reason for the success of the show,'' he said. ``It
was about the power of friendship. And there was a universal appeal
for that show, I think, because parents did not come in and solve
their kids' problems, as in most shows about teen-agers. This was a
show in which kids solved their own problems. And that appealed to
a lot of people because that's what adolescence is about.''
</P>
<P>
   Star said that although he is often offered movie jobs, the fast
pace of television suits him better and, he said, so does New York:
``L.A. was too insular for me, too myopic, and I really love New
York. I'm doing the Wall Street show because I was surrounded by
Wall Street culture. And even I, like everyone else, was starting
to watch CNBC. And then I got a call from my broker in New York, a
guy I had never actually met. And I met him for drinks. And I
expected, like, my father to walk into the room. And this
26-year-old kid came in.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm like, `This is the guy I'm trusting all my money
with?' It was scary. And then it got me thinking. I began thinking
that this could make a very interesting show.'' &QL;

COMMENTARY: JAPAN'S MEMENTO MORI 
</HEADLINE>
   By PAUL KRUGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Japan's Liberal Democratic Party is neither liberal nor
democratic. Nor is it exactly a party in either the European or
American senses: It is more like a coalition of patronage-driven
political machines. And it does not exactly have a track record to
be proud of, having presided over a decade of stagnation in an
economy that was once the wonder of the world. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite its apparent vulnerability, not to mention the
personal unpopularity of Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori, the LDP
managed _ just _ to cling to power in last Sunday's election. The
main reason was that the opposition seemed, if anything, even more
clueless than the bumbling Mori about what to do next. And that is
something we should all find disturbing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Whenever I write about Japan, I get quizzical letters from
Americans who don't see why they should care. The world's
second-largest economy is neither doing well enough to provide
villains for a Michael Crichton novel nor badly enough to pose any
clear and present danger to prosperity elsewhere. So why should
anyone without a direct financial stake be interested in its
troubles? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer _ the reason professional macroeconomists are grimly
fascinated by Japan's economic malaise, and you should at least be
interested _ is that Japan's sad tale is a reminder that the roots
of prosperity may be shallower than we like to think. It's not just
the historical parallels, though Japan in the late '80s shared many
of the features of America in the early '00s: High growth without
inflation, technological dynamism, extremely high stock valuations
that analysts somehow managed to rationalize. What is really
unsettling about Japan is not so much the fact that it went wrong
but the way it went wrong.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you had polled serious economists a decade ago, and asked
whether it was possible for a modern economy to experience a decade
of ``demand-side'' stagnation _ productive capacity going unused
because consumers and businesses could not be persuaded to spend
enough _ I am sure that 99 percent of them would have answered
``no.'' We had learned the lessons of the Great Depression; never
again would the leaders of a major economy make the mistakes that
allowed that slump to go on so long. Even now a fair number of my
colleagues seem to think that a slump that cannot be cured with a
sufficiently low interest rate is theoretically impossible. Yet
that's the reality in Japan, and if it can happen there, why not
here? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Japan does not look like a nation in the midst of
depression, mainly because we have learned something these past 70
years: Instead of trying to balance its budget in the face of a
slump, the LDP has engaged in huge ``pump-priming'' deficit
spending. Or maybe that's a bad metaphor. Japan's fiscal efforts
don't call to mind a farmer getting his pump running so much as
sailors frantically bailing out a leaky boat. So far they have
succeeded in keeping the boat from sinking, giving themselves time
_ but time to do what? Neither the LDP nor the opposition seems to
have any idea.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only Japanese policy makers who have a clear vision of what
to do next are its central bankers, who have been preparing the
public for the imminent end of their ``zero interest rate'' policy.
Why insist on the need to raise interest rates when the economy is
still so depressed, when independent economists are warning that
Japan may well slip back into recession later this year? To force
structural change: The Bank of Japan believes that it must raise
interest rates to force the private sector to become more
efficient. This is just a modern version of ``Liquidate labor,
liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate ...
It will purge the rottenness out of the system'' _ the disastrous
advice that Herbert Hoover received from Andrew Mellon, his
treasury secretary.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the other reminder from Japan. In the United States
we have come to rely on Alan Greenspan's knack for doing the right
thing in an emergency. After seeing the financial crises of both
1987 and 1998 turn out to be manageable, we have come to take
sensible, even heroic action on the part of key economic officials
for granted. But in reality a good Greenspan is hard to find. So
Japan's troubles are a reminder of the lack of wisdom with which
the world is usually governed.

U.S. HOPES TO STEM RUSH TOWARD PATENTING OF GENES

 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before scientists had completed the task of reading the
human genome, parts of it had already been claimed for commerce. In
what has often been compared to a land grab, companies and
universities have filed for patents on hundreds of thousands of
genes and gene fragments.
</P>
<P>
   Amid concerns that such patents are being granted too liberally
and that they could hinder innovation,the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office is about to implement new guidelines that will make it
harder to patent genes. But critics say the new rules are still too
lax.
</P>
<P>
   Some opponents say that it is a moral affront to patent living
things or parts of living things. They argue that a gene is not an
invention, but something that exists in nature, which should be the
common heritage of mankind.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion that some company has a monopoly on my genes is
like claiming ownership of the air,'' said Jonathan King, a
professor of molecular biology at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Patent and Trademark Office, however, the law
allows patenting of discoveries from nature, such as penicillin, if
they are isolated and purified by the hand of man. ``From a patent
law standpoint, genes are treated just like any other chemical
found in nature,'' said Q. Todd Dickinson, commissioner of the
Patent Office. The patent office has now issued patents on 6,000
genes, more than 1,000 of them human genes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, genes have been patented for years. Many of the first
were for drugs. For example, erythropoietin, for anemia, was found
by cloning genes that coded for particular proteins. In those early
days, scientists knew the function of the protein and worked
backwards, taking years to isolate a single gene.
</P>
<P>
   But now high-speed gene sequencing and other techniques are
allowing genes or fragments of genes to be discovered en masse,
without knowing the functions of the proteins produced by the
genes. These genes, rather than representing a product in
themselves, are now guides to future product discovery. And there
is concern that if these genes are patented it would discourage
other scientists from doing research using the same genes. Some
compare it to trying to gain ownership of the alphabet, rather than
of a novel or play.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, for example, Human Genome Sciences, based in
Rockville, Md., was granted a patent on a gene for a protein that
turned out to serve as the entryway for the AIDS virus to infect
cells, even though the company did not know what the gene did at
the time. The gene's function was subsequently discovered by other
researchers. Still, Human Genome can receive royalties on any drug
that targets this entry portal _ or even block development of such
a drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have people who haven't contributed to subsequent
discovery being able to lay claim to those discoveries,'' said
Rebecca S. Eisenberg, a professor of law at the University of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors fear that genetic testing of patients could become
prohibitively expensive if each gene is patented. Research
scientists are already searching for clues to disease by seeing
which genes are active in diseased cells. But the chips used to
study the matter might become impractical if the rights to each
gene had to be licensed.
</P>
<P>
   Even some big drug companies, which normally preach the
importance of patents for spurring innovation, have expressed
concern about the ramifications of patenting genes.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bob Levy, senior vice president for science and technology
at American Home Products, calls the gene patenting situation a
``minefield.'' Finding out who owns rights to what takes an
increasing amount of time, Levy said at a health care conference
earlier this year organized by Chase H&AMP;Q, an investment bank.
Royalties paid to holders of patents on genes, research mice and
other tools can total 12 percent to 14 percent for a single drug,
he said, making some products uneconomical to produce.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of these concerns, 10 big drug companies formed a
consortium last year to study differences in the genome between one
person and another. These differences, known as single nucleotide
polymorphisms, or SNPs, could be important in testing
susceptibility to disease. The consortium is putting them in the
public domain to prevent other companies from patenting the SNPs
before their function is known. ``It's to ensure we have the basic
alphabet,'' said Arthur Holden, chief executive of the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   Some executives say concerns that innovation will be blocked are
unwarranted, pointing out that patents are designed to encourage
innovation, not retard it, by giving an incentive to inventors.
Also, the contents of patents must be published so that others can
learn from it.

   William A. Haseltine, president of Human Genome Sciences, the
leading patenter of human genes, said the electronics industry
continues to innovate rapidly and reduce prices despite numerous
patents.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen P.A. Fodor, chairman and chief executive of Affymetrix
Inc., which makes gene chips, said only one patent holder has
refused to allow its gene to be placed on a chip. Most patent
holders want people to do research on their genes in hopes of
finding a drug, which would bring really big royalties, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists often make a distinction between the genome itself -
the entire sequence of 3 billion chemical units in human
chromosomes - and individual genes. It was a confusion between the
two that caused the stocks of biotechnology stocks to plummet in
March after President Clinton and British Prime Minister Tony Blair
issued a statement saying the genome should be publicly available.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials later emphasized that genes themselves
should be eligible for patents.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial issue for patent examiners has been how much of the
gene's function must be known to satisfy the requirement that any
patentable invention be useful. Until now, the companies have filed
for patents in massive numbers without knowing the functions of
many genes, claiming that, at a minimum, they can be used as animal
feed. The patent office has granted some of these patents.
</P>
<P>
   Applications are pending for more than half a million fragments
of genes, which are known as expressed sequence tags, said John
Doll, director of biotechnology at the Patent Office. Some
applications claim that a fragment is useful because it can allow
scientists to find the entire gene.
</P>
<P>
   But now, in response to criticism, the patent office is raising
the bar by requiring that more of the gene's function be known.
``Nobody would go to the time and cost of isolating a protein from
a diseased cell merely to put it in dog food,'' Doll said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new guidelines expected to take effect in the next few
months, gene fragments will probably not qualify for patents. At
the other extreme, fully characterized genes whose function is
known - such as a gene that predisposes woman to breast cancer and
can be used in a diagnostic test - will continue to be patentable.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a vast ground in the middle, consisting of
full-length genes whose function is not known for sure but is
guessed at by computer analysis. The National Institutes of Health,
the National Academy of Sciences and oppose patents on these genes.
</P>
<P>
   With the technology in so much flux, gene patenting is likely to
be the subject of numerous court battles and might be revisited by
Congress. For companies that have staked their futures on owning
the rights to genes, and for science in general, a lot is riding on
the outcome.

THE THREE FACES, ALL OF THEM FEMALE, OF LIBERTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, July 2) 
 By SARAH BAYLISS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long before the Greco-Roman specter of Lady Liberty arrived in
New York Harbor in 1886, another woman symbolized the United
States, one long forgotten by most Americans. Sometimes known as
L'Amerique, or the Indian Princess, she was a Native American
figure who first appeared on maps in the 16th century. Wearing a
feather headdress, accompanied by a parrot and perched on an
alligatorlike reptile, she represented continental America
alongside female allegories of Europe, Asia and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's big, naked and exotic, portrayed with the plants and
animals of the New World,'' said Rayna Green, director of the
American Indian Program at the Smithsonian Institution's National
Museum of American History. ``She is America, which is rich,
powerful, opulent and perilous.''
</P>
<P>
   This early character, along with Liberty and the lesser-known
Columbia, is the subject of ``The Changing Face of Liberty: Female
Allegories of America,'' at the New-York Historical Society through
Sept. 3. Featuring political cartoons, maps, prints and advertising
ephemera by Paul Revere, Jean-Honore Fragonard, Nathan Currier and
others, the small but illuminating show reveals how these figures
have symbolized this country for more than four centuries.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition comes at a time when two real native women have
seen renewed popularity. Sacagawea, the Shoshone woman who guided
Lewis and Clark, appears on the widely promoted new dollar coin, a
billion of which will be issued by the end of the year. And Disney
recently adapted the story of Pocahontas, the 17th-century
Algonquin who saved the British adventurer John Smith from
execution by her father, Powhatan, in a highly successful animated
film. Like these real heroines, the early Indian figure symbolized
bravery and compassion in the New World _ even if her actions might
have put her in opposition to her own people.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the earliest cartoons of this persona were by British
caricaturists who supported the colonies' struggle for
independence. During Revolutionary times, she was decked out in
feathers, but she was slimmer than the cartographers' figure.
Wielding a bow and arrow, she often appeared as Britannia's
rebellious daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Able Doctor, or America Swallowing the Bitter Draught,'' a
violent 1774 engraving first published in London Magazine after the
Boston Tea Party, portrays a native woman, stripped to the waist,
being pinned to the ground by wigged Britons. (Paul Revere copied
this picture for publication in America.) The figure of Britannia
looks away in despair as one man forces the supine princess to
swallow the Boston Port Bill, in the form of tea, which she
defiantly spits back in his face. Another man, Lord Sandwich, peers
up her skirt. (The peeping Lord Sandwich ``was known to be an old
lech,'' said the exhibition's curator, Ann Weissmann.)
</P>
<P>
   Most images depict the native woman more favorably. In ``Liberty
Triumphant; or the Downfall of Oppression,'' a 1774 engraving by an
American caricaturist, she leads the colonists, who are wearing
feathered headgear and armed with bows and arrows, into battle with
the British. The devil accompanies the British Army, while the
goddess of liberty, holding a liberty pole and cap _ the latter
adapted from the Phrygian cap, worn by freed Roman slaves to cover
their shaved heads _ hovers over the Americans. As with other
broadsides, illustrations like these, with balloon texts, expressed
editorial views for those who could read and those who could not.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian Princess started looking more Anglo-European as the
colonies matured. ``She becomes white and neo-classical,'' Green
said. ``She wears the white robes that symbolize innocence and the
democracy of Greece and Rome, which people are talking about in
colonial rhetoric. She might have Columbia's Wonder Woman crown of
stars or Liberty's cap.'' In the exhibition, Charles Lemire Sr.'s
19th-century etching ``L'Amerique'' shows the white-robed woman
looking distinctly like Roman aristocracy. As Green sees it,
``ultimately, we get the Princess Pocahontas'' as the figure
evolves into a beauty-queen persona not unlike Disney's
interpretation of the Algonquin girl. ``She is the idealized
princess who saves America from her bad brothers and fathers,''
Green said.
</P>
<P>
   If the native figure represented America's rebellious spirit,
the goddesslike Columbia, with her shield and starred tiara,
signified American strength after the Revolution, with the threat
of Britain still in recent memory. ``The Indian Princess started
disappearing because America wanted a more dominant image _ more
powerful, aggressive,'' Weissmann said. ``Columbia represented the
mature, stable, independent colonies. She was the older daughter of
Britannia, while the Indian Princess was the younger one.''
</P>
<P>
   Columbia and Liberty are often interchangeable star-spangled
figures in the exhibition's 19th- and early 20th-century political
cartoons, posters and advertisements. John Goater's 1861
wood-engraved cartoon ``Little Bo-Peep and her Foolish Sheep''
shows a worried Liberty posing as a shepherdess and representing
the Union, watching as her sheep, standing for the seceding
Southern states, run away. Columbia is the more warriorlike.
``Columbia is usually armed,'' says Wendy Shadwell, curator of
prints at the New-York Historical Society. By contrast, the Statue
of Liberty ``just stands there with a tablet and a lamp.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Frederic-Auguste Bartholdi's Roman-size monument, with
her spiked crown and book of law, is closer to European versions of
Liberty than American ones, and has ``no relation'' to Columbia or
the Indian figure, said Jeff Dosik, a librarian at the Statue of
Liberty National Monument. A gift to the United States from France,
the continental Liberty symbolized ``the Enlightenment ideas that
our founding fathers borrowed from French philosophers _ about
political freedom for all mankind, and human rights for all men,''
Dosik said.
</P>
<P>
   Caricaturists quickly adopted the statue as the prevailing image
of America, even before it arrived in New York. Thomas Nast's 1881
engraving for Harper's Weekly, ``A Warning Light,'' made when a
rash of deadly epidemics seized New York, shows a skeletal Liberty
with an upside-down torch and the caption ``Leave All Hope Ye That
Enter Here.'' A reproduction of an 1885 wood engraving by Frederick
Burr Opper, published in Puck, parodies the way in which the statue
was exploited by advertisers even before it took up residence:
wearing sunglasses, she's plastered with ads urging people to
``smoke `suredeath' cigarettes'' and buy from ``G.O.G.G.L.E.S.
opticians.''
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition's contemporary section includes some patriotic
knickknacks that, while amusing, don't shed a lot of new light on
these figures.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most revealing and contradictory symbol of America
is Thomas Crawford's 1863 Statue of Freedom atop the U.S. capitol,
illustrated in the exhibition by a modern copy of an 1867 engraving
Crawford made for Harper's Weekly. Erected during the Civil War
under Abraham Lincoln's supervision, the sculpture is a hybrid of
Liberty, Columbia and the Indian Princess. The original design
featured the liberty cap, but Jefferson Davis, then the secretary
of war and later the president of the Confederacy, insisted that
the headpiece _ and its associations with emancipation _ be
replaced. Crawford revised it to the current starry helmet and
feathers. Philip Reed, a slave, supervised the statue's casting.
</P>
<P>
   When the Statue of Freedom was taken down to ground level for
cleaning a few years ago, Green recalled, ``she was repeatedly
visited by Indians who came to pay her homage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was quite interesting to see this pilgrimage,'' she said.
``Indians recognized her as their girl. It would cause a revolution
if people remembered that Freedom was originally an Indian woman.''

FRANCE WITHHOLDS SUPPORT FOR DOCUMENT AT DEMOCRACY FORUM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WARSAW, Poland _ To ensure that its disapproval of the
conference on democracy organized here by the United States was
officially noticed, France declined Tuesday to accept the document
summarizing the principles and signed by other participants.
</P>
<P>
   In a tart one-page statement, the French government said the
document, agreed to by more than 100 nations, should not be
interpreted as a ``political commitment'' for the participants to
act as a group to further democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The disavowal came one day after the French foreign minister,
Hubert Vedrine, discussed his philosophy about democracy with
American reporters and suggested it was misguided to believe that
democracy could be imposed.
</P>
<P>
   Democracy, Vedrine said, was most often a slow-growing process
that grew from within a country.
</P>
<P>
   Elaborating on Vedrine's discussion, the statement issued
Tuesday by the French Embassy said that spreading democracy was
``not a matter which allows sweeping generalizations,'' adding that
``The specifics of each case should be taken into consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement threw faint praise on the exercise, a gathering of
foreign ministers and some well-known human rights figures
orchestrated by the U.S. State Department. The statement said the
conference had provided a ``good exchange of ideas.'' But the
French insisted that the meeting should be regarded as the
``beginning for such an exchange, not as a program for action.''
</P>
<P>
   For France, the conference presented a perfect opportunity to
take a shot at the United States, whom Vedrine has called the
``hyper-power.''
</P>
<P>
   In terms of democratic values, France has taken a much tougher
line than the Clinton administration against Moscow's actions in
Chechyna and criticized the new Russian president, Vladimir Putin,
for his pursuit of the war there.
</P>
<P>
   For their more aggressive stance on Chechyna, the French have
been scorned by Putin, who made his first European visit to Germany
earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. delegation, headed by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, was taken aback by the French objections.
</P>
<P>
   By taking exception to the democracy conference, Vedrine,
purposely or not, was taking aim at the heart of what Albright
possibly hopes will be a large part of her legacy. The conference
was conceived by one of Albright's senior aides, Morton Halperin,
as a way of highlighting the spread of democracy since the end of
of the Cold War and enshrining the United States as its leading
light.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours after Vedrine spoke to American reporters on Monday,
the American Embassy called the French Embassy asking for a
transcript of the foreign minister's remarks. Since Vedrine had
spoken informally, a transcript was not available, a French
official said.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials made clear in the days before the
conference that the countries represented here had made their
attendance contingent on accepting the democracy document, known as
the Warsaw Declaration.
</P>
<P>
   The wording of the declaration was circulated to invitees well
before the meeting, they said.
</P>
<P>
   The document says that democratic governments may vary in many
respects but are the same in important respects. The common aspects
include free and fair elections, citizens are treated equally under
the law, respect for religion and the press, and freedom from
torture and arbitrary arrest. The document notes that opposition
political parties and trade unions have the right to organize.
</P>
<P>
   France's official disavowal of the declaration was organized
quietly between the French government and the Poles, who were the
hosts. Some days ago, the French government asked the Polish
foreign minister, Bronislaw Geremek, not to include France among
the countries who agreed to the declaration, a French official
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, at the final session at the Polish Parliament,
delegates found a piece of paper on their desks naming the
countries that had signed the Warsaw Declaration.
</P>
<P>
   France was conspicuously absent.
</P>
<P>
   State Department officials said the French podition was based on
a misconception. The conference, they said, was not intended to
start a movement to convert nondemocratic countries, rather to
strengthen democratic practices where they exist.

<P>
   After high school, I moved to Santa Cruz, Calif., to go to
college. This was before the big earthquake, and before the city
was rebuilt, and Santa Cruz had a very dark underside.
</P>
<P>
   I got into racing motorcycles there, which will be news to my
mother when she reads this. In my sophomore year, I moved to San
Diego and promptly got into a motorcycle accident down there.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors told me I had two choices. I could ride a bike every day
to rebuild my knee, or I could go under the knife. That was an easy
decision. At the time, I was doing the typical college partying. I
was smoking and was pretty overweight. But my mom said no to the
surgery. She said, ``We're sending out the old Schwinn from the
garage in New Jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't funny at the time.
</P>
<P>
   So, I just started riding it every day. I didn't realize how far
I was going, and I slowly built up strength. My folks got me a
better bike because I decided to try doing some racing.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, there was a mini-triathlon down in Mexico, and I
gave it a shot. Within a few months, I wanted to do a half-Ironman
triathlon: 1.2 miles swimming, 56 miles biking and 13 miles
running. So, I went to a meeting of the triathlon club at school,
San Diego State University. I learned later that people were
laughing at me.
</P>
<P>
   They said, ``A guy who smokes is going to do a half-Ironman?''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be 109 degrees on the day of the event _ they
were handing out painters' hats full of ice _ but I finished, and
my time was even decent.
</P>
<P>
   After that, I set my sights on a full Ironman.
</P>
<P>
   I was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   After college, I moved to New Zealand and then Australia to
train and compete. One day, we were all racing down a mountain, and
the next thing I knew we were all sprawled out on the pavement. I
had to fly back to New York for knee surgery. I remember looking at
myself in a mirror before I left and thinking, ``I'll never be in
as good shape as I am right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an amazing experience to know you have just peaked, to
know you may never be that happy again. I had had that feeling once
before, after my junior year of high school, when I'd had so much
fun with my friends and my girlfriend and my classes. But it was so
beautiful in Australia, and I was so happy. I'd gotten to a higher
peak.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, I couldn't really train.
</P>
<P>
   I interviewed with personnel agencies for a few jobs _ and got a
few dates with the women at the agencies but didn't get any jobs.
</P>
<P>
   I ended up managing a bar on the Upper West Side and then went
to law school. Afterward, I came back to New York, ran two
companies and eventually founded worldlyinvestor.com, a Web site
that offers international investment advice.
</P>
<P>
   Even when I was in Australia training, I thought I would move
back to New York at some point. I figured I'd gain back some of the
weight I lost and end up smoking again. And, yeah, I've gained back
some weight, and I smoke, occasionally, at parties. But for me,
it's a consequence of being in the 24/7 Internet life.
</P>
<P>
   What I'm doing comes with a lot more stress than I imagined, but
I can honestly say I'm having a blast. There are so many twists and
turns. But I have not yet looked in the mirror and thought, ``This
is not going to get any better.'' I don't think it's at a peak yet
at all.

 &HT;    NBA's Robinson saw star quality in Texas' Mihm
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Before his freshman year at the University of
Texas, Chris Mihm got an opportunity not afforded most young
basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   The recent graduate of Westlake High School spent two days in
San Antonio in July 1997, working out with David Robinson. When
they were done, by way of farewell, the San Antonio Spurs' all-star
center left Mihm with a few words that, three years later, are
prophetic.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe he was just being polite or maybe he meant it, but
Robinson told the young 7-footer that he someday expected to see
him in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember David telling me that Chris impressed him on the
court and off the court,'' said Jeff Austin, the Washington, D.C.,
agent who represents both Mihm and Robinson. ``And that was three
years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever he meant, Robinson was right. Chris Mihm's time has
come.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns' first-ever Associated Press first-team
All-American, Mihm will hear his name called early in tonight's
National Basketball Association draft in Minneapolis. If he is one
of the top four picks _ a distinct possibility _he'll be chosen
higher than any UT player in history.
</P>
<P>
   It will be the latest milestone in the relatively brief
basketball career of the ``gentle giant'' who didn't make the
Westlake High School varsity until his junior season. But in five
short years of full-time basketball, Mihm, 20, has transformed
himself into one of the top players ever produced in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``A player can't judge his own legacy,'' Mihm said. ``That's for
others. I've just tried to be one of the best players in Texas
history and be recognized for that. But it's not up to me to make
that decision.''
</P>
<P>
   UT's basketball history isn't exactly full of players who
succeeded in the NBA. At the end of last season, no former
Longhorns played in the league. The school has produced only four
first-round picks.
</P>
<P>
   The highest to go was center LaSalle Thompson. Like Mihm,
Thompson left after his junior season, in 1982, in the aftermath of
Abe Lemons' controversial dismissal as coach. Thompson was taken by
the Kansas City Kings with the fifth pick.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson's 15-year NBA career as primarily a journeyman began
well before UT's other three first-rounders were taken _ and ended
after they were gone. Guards Travis Mays and Lance Blanks were
selected with the 14th and 26th picks of the 1990 draft, and guard
B.J. Tyler went with the 20th pick of the 1994 draft. None was in
the league for long _ Mays and Blanks lasted three years, Tyler
two.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm has all the physical tools required for a long professional
career, including key traits often overlooked by the casual fan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got good footwork and great hands,'' said Rick Barnes,
who coached Mihm as a sophomore and junior at Texas. ``He's like a
vacuum with his hands, and that's important because great players
catch bad passes. He had his share of those, and he saved us a lot
of turnovers.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihm's athleticism comes from his parents, Gary and Nina Mihm,
who both played tennis at Marquette University.
</P>
<P>
   Mihm played basketball informally at an early age but was more
renowned for swimming and tennis. He was formidable in swimming _
``I was real good at the breaststroke and butterfly'' _ and earned
a state ranking for his age group in tennis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have loved to be his doubles partner,'' said Westlake High
basketball coach Clifton McNeely. ``Can you imagine him at the
net?''
</P>
<P>
   McNeely got the opportunity to have Mihm around a different net.
McNeely arrived at Westlake before Mihm's junior year, the time
Mihm decided to concentrate on basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved all sports growing up. Tennis, swimming, baseball,
soccer, whatever,'' Mihm said. ``I've always believed in setting
goals, and my goal in basketball was to be a high school
All-American. I knew if that was going to happen, I had to dedicate
myself to basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Mihm had been playing basketball long before he began
sprouting toward seven feet. Buried in a box somewhere, former
Longhorns assistant coach Vic Trilli has a photograph of a young
Mihm flanked by UT basketball players Locksley Collie and Guillermo
Myers at a 1991 UT summer camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was probably about 6-2 then,'' said Trilli, now head coach
at the University of North Texas. ``But he was mature in ways most
kids are not at that age. He just seemed to have an idea of what he
wanted to do with his life, even then.''
</P>
<P>
   Mihm and his Westlake teammate, Luke Axtell, committed to the
Longhorns before their junior seasons in high school. Axtell, who
transferred to Kansas two years ago, was the more highly regarded
prospect at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, despite his lack of experience, Mihm caught flak from
critics who didn't believe he was posting the kinds of numbers that
a big man should produce. Then as now, his intensity, desire and
passion for the game were questioned, and Trilli has the proof in
the boxes still unpacked from his move to Denton two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have letters around here somewhere from fans saying
we'd made a big mistake in signing him at UT,'' Trilli said.
``People said he was soft and questioned his toughness, but I don't
know how they could say that. Nobody knew. He was just starting to
develop.''
</P>
<P>
   The questions about his toughness and dedication to basketball
continue to dog him, despite the fact that Mihm is the first person
in UT history to record more than 1,100 points, 800 rebounds and
200 blocks for his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It amuses me. I take some hits for that, but I've grown
accustomed to it,'' he said. ``Playing a lot of individual sports
taught me to have an inner fire and drive from within. You're not
going to be yelling in a pool or on a tennis court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear so much that I don't love the game that it makes me
laugh. If I didn't love it, I wouldn't be doing it. People who
haven't been around me and haven't seen me practice don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wendlandt does, because he has. A Texas forward in the
early 1980s, the Austin businessman is also a Westlake High product
and longtime friend of Mihm. Wendlandt coached Mihm's peewee
basketball teams in the Western Hills Youth Association when Mihm
was in elementary school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm telling you right now, if you think Chris is soft, go
guard him for about 30 minutes and then tell me that,'' said
Wendlandt. ``He'll beat your butt and punish you physically. You'll
go away thinking you've been in a 20-round boxing match. I've been
guarding the kid for 10 years. I know.''
</P>
<P>
   To hear Mihm talk, he's eager to begin proving himself, all over
again, at the ultimate level of his profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love competition. And the competitiveness of basketball is
something that really appeals to me,'' he said. ``Growing up in
sports, I know what it takes. I think my background has given me an
inner drive to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   So David Robinson noticed, three years ago.

FDA TO CONSIDER MAKING MORE DRUGS AVAILABLE WITHOUT PRESCRIPTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Spurred by applications from Merck and
Bristol-Myers Squibb to sell their cholesterol-lowering medications
over the counter, the Food and Drug Administration is considering
whether many more medicines _ from antibiotics to birth control
pills _ should be made available without a doctor's prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with public hearings on Wednesday and Thursday, the
FDA will begin a re-examination of the way it regulates
over-the-counter drugs, the first such review in nearly three
decades. The last one, in 1972, created a new system for approving
over-the-counter drugs that enabled more than 600 drugs to switch
from prescription to nonprescription status.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, nonprescription drugs treat mild conditions, like
headaches, colds and athlete's foot. But now, in addition to
looking at infection-fighting agents and oral contraceptives, the
agency is raising a new question: whether patients with chronic
conditions, like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, allergies
and osteoporosis, should be able to treat themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are open to the possibility of having more and different
kinds of medicines available to consumers,'' said Dr. Robert DeLap,
the FDA official leading the review.
</P>
<P>
   ``The health care environment has changed tremendously in recent
years,'' DeLap said. ``People are much more interested in
self-care, and in being able to manage their minor conditions
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   But what constitutes a minor condition is a matter of
considerable debate, and some drug safety experts worry that
broadening access to medications will only harm patients, enabling
them to take drugs in dangerous combinations. And in making more
drugs available without a prescription, the drug agency could
greatly affect the $100 billion pharmaceutical industry, changing
the dynamic of who pays for medicines and how much they cost at a
time when these issues are at the center of the political debate in
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprescription drugs are generally cheaper than prescription
medications, and they also save money on doctors' visits. According
to the Consumer Healthcare Products Association, which represents
nonprescription drug manufacturers, consumers now save nearly $13
billion a year by using over-the-counter medicines that were once
available by prescription only. But while over-the-counter drugs
are cheaper, it is patients, and not insurance companies, who must
pay for them.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials said they are not certain whether or when any
regulations will change, but the review is generating controversy
even before it begins.
</P>
<P>
   In all, 55 people are scheduled to testify at this week's
hearings _ including drug and insurance company officials, safety
advocates, infectious-disease specialists worried about antibiotic
resistance and abortion opponents, who are fighting an
over-the-counter birth control pill, which taken in high doses can
be used as a morning-after contraceptive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you tamper with the health care system, you run into
very emotional responses,'' said Steve Francesco, a consultant who
advises the drug industry on changing drugs from prescription to
nonprescription status, a subspecialty known as Rx-to-OTC Switch.
``The FDA is saying, `Let's throw a rock in this pond and see where
the waves move.' I think that's very courageous, and long
overdue.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One case in point is Claritin, the best-selling allergy
medication, which last year generated $2.3 billion of its $2.7
billion in sales from the United States. Claritin is available in
other countries without a prescription, and Blue Cross of
California petitioned the FDA to give it over-the-counter status.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the Blue Cross petition, Dr. Robert Seidman,
argued that Claritin was safer than other nonprescription
antihistamines and said that maintaining it as a prescription drug
``is not in the best interests of society.''
</P>
<P>
   A switch would inevitably force the drug's maker, Schering
Plough Corp., to lower Claritin's price, to make it competitive
with other over-the-counter antihistamines, and the company opposes
it. But health insurers, like Blue Cross, would benefit from such a
move because they would no longer have to pay for the medication.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA typically does not make a drug over-the-counter unless
the manufacturer requests it. But as the agency reopens the issue
of over-the-counter drug regulation, the Claritin debate is
generating fears within the industry that the longstanding policy
will change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pharmaceutical companies have the most detailed knowledge of
their drugs, and they should decide when to make the switch,'' said
Jeff Trewhitt, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers Association, the industry trade group. ``Economics
should not play a role.''
</P>
<P>
   But economics does play a role. ``What's at stake here is money,
and control and safety,'' said Matthew Weinberg, a pharmaceutical
industry consultant. DeLap, the drug agency official, said,
``People are concerned about how these things play out
financially.''
</P>
<P>
   Before 1972, the FDA did not formally review all
over-the-counter drugs for safety and effectiveness. That year, the
agency began to set standards for the 300,000 to 400,000
nonprescription drugs that were already available; drugs that met
those standards were permitted to remain on the market. But new
medicines had to submit to a formal review by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, a range of medicines, from Rogaine for hair
loss to Aleve for pain to Monistat for vaginal yeast infections,
have switched from prescription to over-the-counter status.
</P>
<P>
   While DeLap, the FDA official, said this week's hearings were
simply to gather public opinion, regulators will soon be confronted
with a decision on cholesterol-lowering medications. Next month,
the FDA is scheduled to convene a panel of scientific experts to
evaluate applications from two drug manufacturers, Merck and
Bristol-Myers Squibb, to make low-dose versions of their
anti-cholesterol pills available without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Merck's request comes a year before the patent on its drug,
Mevacor, is due to expire; in seeking to market a 10-milligram dose
without a prescription, financial analysts say Merck is trying to
build brand loyalty and increase profits before a generic
equivalent goes on the market. Mevacor's U.S. sales dropped to $480
million from $593 million from 1998 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The Bristol-Myers Squibb drug, Pravachol, does not face patent
expiration until 2005. But, analysts say, the company is seeking
approval for over-the-counter status of a 10 milligram dose so that
it can compete with Merck.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both pharmaceutical companies cast the discussion
in terms of patients, not profits. They argue that consumers who
are not being treated for high cholesterol would benefit from easy
access to their drugs. ``The potential public health benefits, we
think, are substantial,'' said Janet Skidmore, a Merck spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Merck has conducted clinical trials to evaluate whether patients
can take the drug safely without a doctor's guidance; the results
will be made available at the hearing in July. But Dr. Sidney M.
Wolfe, who as director of Public Citizen's Health Research Group,
an advocacy organization, is a frequent critic of the drug agency,
said it would be both ``dumb and dangerous'' to permit
cholesterol-lowering pills to be sold without a doctor's orders.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a patient who has a headache, Wolfe said, a patient with
high cholesterol may not have symptoms. A test is needed to detect
the problem, he said, and a doctor is needed to interpret that test
and follow the patient to make certain the cholesterol condition
does not deteriorate into a case of serious heart disease. At the
same time, the drugs have the potential to cause liver damage.
</P>
<P>
   For those reasons, some financial analysts are skeptical that
the drug agency will approve the Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb
requests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FDA has always been worried about patients' trying to
diagnose themselves with a serious condition and then treating
themselves without getting follow-up monitoring,'' said Alex
Zisson, a pharmaceutical analyst at Chase H &AMP; Q in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, Zisson said, the FDA rejected a similar
application.
</P>
<P>
   If cholesterol sounds like a thorny issue, consider oral
contraceptives. Women's health advocates are expected to argue that
the ``morning after pill,'' which is used for emergency
contraception, should be made available over-the-counter.
</P>
<P>
   But abortion opponents have flooded the FDA with letters arguing
against any change that would make the birth control pill readily
available to teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an ethical question,'' said Judie Brown, president of
the American Life League of Stafford, Va. ``Young people live with
the aftereffects of sexual promiscuity every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Some have suggested that the agency follow Canada's lead, and
create a third category of drug, known colloquially as
under-the-counter. These drugs do not require a doctor's
prescription but cannot simply be picked up off store shelves.
Instead, the pharmacist would control access, acting as a buffer
between consumers and potentially dangerous medications, said Dr.
Raymond Woosley, chairman of the pharmacology department at
Georgetown University. ``That is a classification we have not had
in the past,'' Dr. Woosley said, ``and I think it is one we should
be discussing.''
</P>
<P>
   With so many difficult matters on its plate, Zisson, the
pharmaceutical analyst, says it is no wonder the drug agency has
sought the public's opinion. ``When in doubt,'' he said, ``they
call a panel.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   At least half of all 15-year-olds in the African countries worst
affected by AIDS will die of the disease even if the infection
rates drop substantially in the next few years, the United Nations
reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And if rates remain high, the odds are that more than two-thirds
of the 15-year-olds will die from AIDS in countries like Botswana,
according to projections from UNAIDS, a joint U.N. program based in
Geneva, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has never before experienced death rates of this
magnitude among young adults of both sexes across all social
strata,'' UNAIDS said in a report it released ahead of the 13th
International AIDS Conference, which begins on July 9 in Durban,
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   It is UNAIDS' second comprehensive report on the global epidemic
of AIDS. The first report was published two years ago in
conjunction with the last international AIDS conference, in Geneva.
That report painted a bleak picture of AIDS, showing one in four
people were infected in some parts of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The new report brings this picture into a sharper, grimmer
focus. More new infections are occurring through heterosexual sex
simply because the chances of an uninfected individual encountering
an infected partner have become higher, UNAIDS said.
</P>
<P>
   But the report contained glimmers of hope. It said that
infection rates have fallen in a small number of places, showing
that health officials are not powerless in stopping the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   In the new report, UNAIDS calculated for the first time the
impact of AIDS on young people, the very individuals who are most
often infected by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. HIV, which has
been spread primarily through heterosexual sex in Africa, is wiping
out many households, devastating national economies and killing off
so many teachers that it is undermining the delivery of basic
education, Dr. Peter Piot, the head of UNAIDS, said in a telephone
news conference from Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   But most people with HIV do not know they are infected because
testing for the virus is not widely available in Africa, said Dr.
Noerine Kaleeba, a Ugandan who is a UNAIDS official.
</P>
<P>
   HIV infection rates are more than five times as high among
African teen-age girls as among teen-age boys, largely because
young girls have sex with older men, who are more likely to be
infected. Also, girls are much more likely to be infected during
vaginal intercourse with an infected partner than are the boys. As
men age, their infection rate approaches that of women.
</P>
<P>
   The infection rates in sub-Saharan Africa are far greater than
any expert or computer model had predicted 10 years ago, Piot said.
</P>
<P>
   The result is an unusual demographic pattern in which a
country's population includes as many 60-year-olds as 40-year-olds
instead of the usual pattern of fewer older people. The U.S. Census
Bureau predicts that in Botswana, there will be more adults in
their 60s and 70s than in their 40s and 50s, assuming that H.I.V.
infection rates do not change.
</P>
<P>
   The ferocity of the AIDS epidemic in Africa is such that its
ravages thus far will seem minor compared with what lies ahead
unless affected countries make AIDS control programs a national
priority and other nations contribute much more money for
prevention and care, UNAIDS said.
</P>
<P>
   The estimated $300 million in international support this year
pales compared with the $2 billion needed each year in sub-Saharan
Africa alone, Piot said. He also said, ``It's time we make the
connection between debt relief and epidemic relief, because one
reason that many developing countries cannot invest enough in AIDS
prevention is that they have to pay such a high proportion of their
national budget'' for debt.
</P>
<P>
   On an encouraging note, Piot said that 19 years of experience
with AIDS has generated important insights into how to reduce the
impact of the AIDS epidemic. More young people are delaying first
sexual intercourse, decreasing the number of partners and using
condoms more often, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Uganda has dropped off the list of the top 16 infected countries
because its government, which was the first in Africa to recognize
the danger of AIDS to national development, has promoted broader
education and use of such measures to lower its infection rate to 8
percent, from 14 percent in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Zambia may follow Uganda's lead. Its infection rates have fallen
in recent years in its capital, Lusaka, where far fewer young women
were having sex before marriage in 1996 than in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Senegal has stabilized its HIV infection rate at less than 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting another generation of young people from premature
illness and death is the greatest leadership challenge for many
countries. That requires a nationally driven agenda ``with the
persistent engagement of the highest levels of government,'' Piot
said. Although more countries are showing such political will, it
is lacking in many others, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the HIV rate has stabilized in the United States and other
developed countries at a fraction of 1 percent, it exceeds 10
percent in 16 African countries. Among developed countries,
Portugal's rate of 0.7 percent and the United States' rate of 0.6
percent are the highest, said Dr. Bernhard Schwartlander, a
principal author of the UNAIDS report.
</P>
<P>
   In virtually any country where 15 percent or more of all adults
are currently infected with HIV, at least 35 percent of
15-year-olds will eventually die of AIDS, UNAIDS said.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 African countries are: Botswana (35.8 percent), Swaziland
(25.25 percent), Zimbabwe (25.06 percent), Lesotho (23.57 percent),
Zambia (19.95 percent), South Africa (19.94 percent), Namibia
(19.54 percent), Malawi (15.96 percent), Kenya (13.95 percent),
Central African Republic (13.84 percent), Mozambique (13.2
percent), Djibouti (11.75 percent), Burundi (11.32 percent), Rwanda
(11.21 percent), Ivory Coast (10.76 percent), and Ethiopia (10.63
percent).
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa, the country with the largest number of people
(4.2 million) living with HIV, the infection rate has jumped to
19.9 percent from 12.9 in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Infection rates are creeping up in West Africa. In addition to
Ivory Coast, which is 15th highest, Nigeria, the most populous
country in sub-Saharan Africa, has reached a 5 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   Two countries in the Caribbean _ Haiti and the Bahamas _ have
worse epidemics than any other country outside of Africa. In Haiti,
more than 5 percent of adults are infected and in the Bahamas, the
rate is more than 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   AIDS has made inroads in Asia, but it is not clear whether rates
will explode to rival those in Africa and when that might occur,
UNAIDS said.
</P>
<P>
   In India, where only 7 adults in 1,000 are infected, 3.7 million
people were living with HIV at the beginning of this year. The
total number in India is second largest in the world, behind South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Since AIDS was first recognized in 1981, HIV has infected or
killed more than 53 million people around the world.

`THE GINGERMAN,' THE CLASSIC WITH A PORNOGRAPHIC PEDIGREE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Ireland, France)   By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was on Thanksgiving Day in Dublin in 1949 that
J.P. Donleavy had the idea for the novel that would change his
life. He and his friends, many of them Americans studying at
Trinity College on the GI Bill, were leaving the school. They were
all headed in different directions, professionally as well as
geographically.
</P>
<P>
   As he recalled during a recent visit to New York from his home
in Ireland, he suddenly realized, ``This is all over: Trinity and
the world that we knew in Dublin,'' a world that he has described
as ``celebratory, boisterous and resolutely careless mayhem.'' He
decided to memorialize the high and rough times in print. At the
center was a fellow American, Gainor Stephen Crist, who became the
model for Sebastian Dangerfield, the title character in his novel,
``The Ginger Man.''
</P>
<P>
   In a later book, ``The History of the Ginger Man,'' Donleavy
called Crist ``a pagan sensualist,'' while making it clear that he
also always expressed moral values. His motto was, ``Do no evil.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he has to be regarded as a saint _ as simple as that,''
Donleavy said. ``I'm hoping that the tourist board in Ireland will,
at some future date, say, `Saint Gainor Stephen Crist, guide to all
tourists in Ireland.'''
</P>
<P>
   When Maurice Girodias published ``The Ginger Man'' in Paris in
1955, adding it to his list of erotic books, it became a scandalous
event. But the novel was subsequently acclaimed, especially by
other writers. Dorothy Parker called it ``a rigadoon of rascality,
a bawled-out comic song of sex.'' Capturing the rebellious spirit
of its time, along with ``The Catcher in the Rye'' it was taken up
by students as a kind of monument to iconoclasm. Eventually it
became an international best seller. ``The Ginger Man'' has sold
more than 10 million copies and has never been out of print.
</P>
<P>
   Donleavy's play based on the novel has had numerous productions,
although the current revival at the Irish Arts Center, performed by
a company of actors from Dublin, is the first New York production
since it was done off Broadway in 1963. Donleavy, 74, was in New
York for the revival, one of his periodic returns to the city of
his birth.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect personification of a dignified country squire _ the
opposite of the pub-crawling young men in his book _ and wearing
his customary tweeds, he looked as if he had just come from a walk
in the Irish countryside. Since 1967 he has been an Irish citizen.
For almost 30 years he has lived on a 180-acre estate called
Levington Park in Mullingar, Ireland _ a working farm where he
raises cattle and also has a soccer field and an indoor swimming
pool.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, when the Modern Library named the 100 best novels
in the English language in the 20th century, ``The Ginger Man'' was
99th, just ahead of ``The Magnificent Ambersons'' by Booth
Tarkington. No. 1 was James Joyce's ``Ulysses.''
</P>
<P>
   Donleavy greeted that lowly position without rancor, while
saying, ``Some of my friends were outraged that I was at the
bottom.'' In common with many others on the list, ``The Ginger
Man'' is generally accepted as a contemporary classic.
</P>
<P>
   The novel brought the author fame and, at first, a certain
degree of misfortune. After it was rejected by scores of publishers
in the United States and England _ the number varies from 35 to 45
_ Donleavy left New York for Ireland, where his parents lived
before coming to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Dublin, he was at a loss as to what to do with the
novel. A friend, the playwright Brendan Behan, read the manuscript
and filled it with a profusion of mostly helpful editorial comments
and corrections. He suggested that Donleavy send it to Girodias,
head of the Olympia Press in Paris. Behan had himself tried to
write a pornographic novel for Olympia and been turned down. He
thought Donleavy might have better luck _ and he did, in a manner
of speaking.
</P>
<P>
   To Donleavy's dismay, the book was published by Girodias (in
paperback) in the Traveler's Companion series of pornographic,
mostly pseudonymous novels. In the back of the first edition, it
was listed alongside such titles as ``White Thighs'' and ``The
Sexual Life of Robinson Crusoe.''
</P>
<P>
   Donleavy said that Girodias published his novel ``to cloak his
dealings as a pornographer _ he never thought the book would ever
make a penny.'' Because of the imprint, ``The Ginger Man'' was
regarded as something illegitimate.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was basically the end of my career,'' he said. ``I was `a
dirty book writer' out of Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to take revenge on his publisher and to regain control
of his book. Through more than 20 years of litigation, Girodias
tied up the rights, one reason the novel was not filmed despite
interest from movie companies. (In recent years, Donleavy's son
Philip has been trying to put together a film production of the
novel.) Largely as a result of his conflict with the publisher,
Donleavy became a legal expert and began drawing up his own
contracts. Not only did he win his case, but he also ended up
buying Olympia at auction. In a final twist, the original edition
of the book is a valuable collector's item.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point in the novel's reputation came, the author
said, when in an interview John Osborne welcomed Donleavy as an
American cousin of Britain's Angry Young Men. As Donleavy later
discovered, Osborne had apparently read ``The Ginger Man'' before
he wrote ``Look Back in Anger.'' Despite differences in the works,
both Dangerfield and Osborne's Jimmy Porter are rebels thumbing
their noses at accepted behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about his first novel, he remembered his friend Gainor
Crist, who died in the early 1960s. With Crist, he said, he can't
``separate fiction from reality,'' but whenever he and their mutual
friend George Roy Hill, the film director, would get together they
would swap stories about the charismatic Crist. Irrepressibly
convivial, Crist would talk to anyone in a bar or on the street
and, in hindsight, turn that person into ``an incredible
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   Crist read parts of ``The Ginger Man'' as it was written. ``He
was very much impressed by it but never thought it had much to do
with him,'' Donleavy said. He did, however, recognize a few events,
including the farcical scene in which the ceiling of his apartment
collapsed. For a while Crist taught English in Spain, and later he
worked for an airline in New York. Welcoming foreign dignitaries,
he ran up an astronomical bar bill. The name Dangerfield was a
tribute to Crist: it was his favorite name for an Englishman.
</P>
<P>
   At first, Donleavy called the novel ``SB'' or ``Sebastian
Dangerfield,'' but he changed the title at the request of Girodias,
who also rejected his other choice, ``His Hands Refuse to Labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Donleavy, who said he had never suffered from writer's block,
went on to write more than a dozen novels (his latest in 1998) and
several plays, as well as nonfiction. He has written sequels to
other books, but ``The Ginger Man'' is singular: ``I guess that it
had a degree of finality about it in this period and time.'' The
end of the book is the end of Dangerfield's story:
</P>
<P>
   God's mercy
</P>
<P>
   On the Wild
</P>
<P>
   Ginger Man.
</P>
<P>
   Although he has always retained his independence from anything
resembling a literary movement, Donleavy is well aware that in
recent years Ireland has become a far more hospitable place for
writers. ``Ireland has gone mad with authors,'' he said, and with
the mischievousness of Dangerfield, he added, ``I think they should
all go out and get decent jobs.''

<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia _ A terrifying surge of communal violence,
apparently fueled by anti-government agitators in Jakarta, is
tearing apart the remote and beautiful islands of Maluku, raising
fears of destabilization throughout Indonesia's ailing archipelago.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 people have reportedly been killed in the past
week in village massacres and in street fighting in the small city
of Ambon, pushing the death toll during the last 18 months to more
than 2,500.
</P>
<P>
   The unchecked fighting in the province of Maluku, once known as
the Spice Islands, has become one of the main challenges to the
political control of President Abdurrahman Wahid, who faces a
possible vote of no confidence in a parliamentary assembly in
August.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become a very serious issue,'' said Umar Juoro, a
former presidential aide who heads an Islamic policy institute.
``Now when you go to the mosque or you go to church you are hearing
about the killing of Muslims and the killing of Christians. This is
getting into our daily lives around Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is much more serious for Indonesia than East Timor
because it involves a conflict of elites in Jakarta,'' Juoro said
of the former Portuguese colony that broke away in August and was
never an integral part of national affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts suggest an array of disaffected groups that may be
involved: loyalists or family members of Suharto who fear
punishment by the government; extremist Islamic groups seeking to
create a less moderate regime in this largely Muslim nation;
elements of the military who oppose the downgrading of their
political role in Indonesia, and powerful economic interests
seeking to maintain their control.
</P>
<P>
   While Wahid has sought to foster good will, his nine months in
office have seen repeated outbreaks of religious violence, many
apparently provoked by unidentified agitators, including attacks on
mosques and churches as well as communal fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The government's inability to curb the violence is adding to a
perception among some Indonesians that Wahid is unable to control
an array of powerful and vengeful forces that were disenfranchised
with the overthrow of President Suharto two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wahid continues to command widespread respect for his liberal
and democratic goals. But the quality of his leadership has also
come into question from a series of financial scandals, political
missteps and seemingly intemperate comments.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say he has been slow to act on the Maluku fighting as
well as on other pressing issues. His defenders say that the
deep-rooted problems he faces defy aggressive solutions. In this
case, the situation has only spiraled further out of control.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When Wahid announced a state of emergency in Maluku on Monday
and vowed to disarm the combatants, he drew an anguished reaction
from local residents reached by telephone, who said they feared the
military as much as the local religious gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military is no longer capable of stopping the conflict,''
said Joseph Tethool, the Roman Catholic bishop of Ambon, who sent a
letter this weekend to the United Nations pleading for
international help. ``Many soldiers have taken sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Sammy Titaley, who heads the Protestant churches in
Ambon, said the fighting had escalated to include mortars,
automatic weapons and even small armored vehicles, a sign of
organized military involvement.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene reminiscent of the violence last year in East Timor,
the local military appears to have run out of control, arming
civilian combatants and, according to witnesses, sometimes leading
the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But in East Timor, the rogue military groups were clearly better
organized and commanded from above. In Maluku, the chain of command
appears to have broken down more thoroughly as Muslim soldiers join
the Muslim side and Christian soldiers join with Christian
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the commanders cannot control their men,'' said Umelto
Labetubun, a student who lives on the Christian side of the
now-divided town. ``One Christian soldier stopped by my house, a
first lieutenant, and he said, `Some of my men are on the other
side and they are now shooting at us.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the problem goes well beyond a breakdown of military
command.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that the government of Abdurrahman Wahid is
weak,'' said Salim Said, a political scientist. ``If you do not
have a strong government in this country you cannot overcome the
many problems that are the legacy of the old government. The old
government was put down but not destroyed. It is still very
strong.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the most obvious signs of trouble has been the influx in
recent weeks of 2,200 white-robed Muslim fighters calling
themselves the Laskar Jihad, who were mostly organized and trained
at a camp near Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Juwono Sudarsonso, in a recent interview, said
that there was no way to stop them from boarding interisland
ferries and traveling to the area, where they then received weapons
from unknown sources.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Local residents said they believed that these fighters were
involved in a horrific massacre a week ago at the village of Duma
on the island of Halmahera, where church workers said 206 Christian
villagers were killed in an attack that lasted just one hour.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Laskar Jihad have said they are engaged in
``self-defense'' and the attack on Duma was described as a revenge
attack. Last December, hundreds of Muslims were killed on Halmahera
by Christian gangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a very complicated, very big problem, because national
politics is involved,'' the Maluku governor, Saleh Latuconsina,
told a Dutch journalist last month. ``The Laskar Jihad is connected
to some political elite, because they can come to Ambon without
anyone stopping them. Maybe it's from the people of the status quo
. . . well, Suharto.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor, himself a Muslim, said he believed that ``not more
than 10 percent'' of the people of either religion wanted to fight.
</P>
<P>
   A European political scientist who has lived in Maluku, said the
most disturbing thing was that villagers could be so easily
provoked to go to war with each other.
</P>
<P>
   More than 90 percent of Indonesia's 210 million people are
Muslim, making this the world's largest Muslim nation. But they
have traditionally lived in harmony with religious minorities.
Maluku is one of the few areas where Christians and Muslims live in
nearly equal numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The areas in Ambon and Halmahera where the killings are going
on are places I worked 10 years ago, and I found them to be some of
the more peaceful and beautiful places I have visited anywhere in
the world,'' said the scholar. ``It does not bear thinking what
would happen if groups in other parts of Indonesia begin attacking
their fellow Indonesians for religious reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month more than 120 people were killed and thousands of
people were driven from their homes when Muslims fought Christians
for several days on the island of Sulawesi in eastern Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   In Maluku, the divisions have spread to the military in a way
they have not done elsewhere in the country. When a national police
barracks in Ambon was burned down last week, Labetubun said, some
of the attackers were wearing police uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Told of the president's imposition of a state of emergency, he
only laughed in despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military is just making it worse,'' he said. ``I am crying
because I cannot stand it any more. The military is shooting at us
so how can we trust the military? We cannot trust anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Ambon, the regional center, is now ``a dead city'' where
banks have closed and food and fuel are becoming scarce. ``The day
time is just like the night time,'' he said. ``No one goes out of
the house. You hear no sound, no car. Then you hear the shooting
and explosions.''

`THE CHIEF:' GOING BEYOND THE MYTHS OF HEARST, MAN AND MOGUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 &HT;    Orville Schell is dean of the graduate school of journalism at
the University of California at Berkeley and the author of
``Virtual Tibet.'' 
 By ORVILLE SCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even to open ``The Chief,'' David Nasaw's wonderful new
biography of William Randolph Hearst, is to be swept away by the
narrative flowing through its pages. Hearst was one of those
Promethean figures whose life was larger than life. Integrally
involved, albeit often to corrosive effect, in everything from
politics, the media and Hollywood to America's role in
international affairs, his life makes a grand American story.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes Nasaw's telling of it is the skill with which
he has tapped a whole new watershed of sources. By drawing on
hitherto unused archives _ like the San Simeon Historical
Monument's oral history collection, the Bancroft Library's Hearst
papers at the University of California at Berkeley and a previously
unplumbed warehouse of private Hearst Corp. papers in the Bronx _
Nasaw has given his biography an immediacy that almost makes the
reader forget that the author himself was not there as the story
unfolded.
</P>
<P>
   What further marks Nasaw's account is his evenhandedness, his
refusal to trade on popular mythologies about Hearst, like the
indelibly negative characterization of him in Orson Welles' film
``Citizen Kane.'' Such images gave earlier works on this powerful
but enigmatic American icon a polemical air. Instead, Nasaw tells
Hearst's story: his neglected childhood with his rough-and-tumble
father, George Hearst, a miner who ultimately parlayed his way into
the Senate, and his doting but controlling mother, Phoebe Apperson
Hearst, who held the purse strings to the family fortune until her
death; his ignominious flunking out of Harvard; his success in
building the first media conglomerate; his repeated attempts at
running for political office; his accumulation of luxury
apartments, estates and castles around the world; and his ardent
courting of almost everyone, from Mussolini, Churchill, Hitler,
Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt to Charlie Chaplin, George
Bernard Shaw, Irving Thalberg and Louella Parsons.
</P>
<P>
   Nasaw also regales the reader with Hearst's celebrated love
affair with the chorus girl ad film star Marion Davies, with whom
Hearst openly consorted for more than three decades, even though he
was married and had a family. By telling this story with only
modest embellishment, Nasaw grants his readers the pleasure of
arriving at their own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Nasaw's Hearst is an autocrat, spendthrift, bigot and egoist
capable of being deluded by his own power and influence, but he is
not entirely unsympathetic. ``The Hearst I discovered was
infinitely more fascinating than the one I had expected to find,''
he notes. He discovers him to have been a shy man who nonetheless
``had never been comfortable with solitude.'' But Nasaw also
observes that once Hearst ``strutted onto the public stage,'' he
was ``impossible to ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   While H.L. Mencken could accuse Hearst of having ``debauched
journalism,'' he also acknowledged that Hearst ``shook up old bones
and gave the blush of life to pale cheeks.'' Despite the fact that
Hearst was a grand progenitor of yellow journalism, Mencken still
praised him for publishing exposures that ``completely broke down
the old American respect for mere money, and paved the way for many
reforms that are still in being.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Hearst so interesting is the welter of contradictions
at his core. He was a crusading, trust-busting, populist Democrat
who could nonetheless become a staunch isolationist, an admirer of
aspects of Hitler and finally even a supporter of Sen. Joseph R.
McCarthy's witch hunts. After visiting Hearst at San Simeon in
1929, Churchill described him to his wife as being ``a grave,
simple child _ with no doubt a nasty temper _ playing with the most
costly toys.'' But, he admitted, ``I got to like him.''
</P>
<P>
   The kind of advocacy journalism that Hearst practiced _
especially in his rivalry with Joseph Pulitzer _ led him not only
to play shamelessly to the mass market but also to view both the
editorial and news sides of his empire as private preserves. As
Nasaw writes, Hearstian journalism ``was advocacy journalism at its
most extreme. . . . There was no commitment to objective,
both-sides-of-the-story journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, Nasaw states, was also ``the first publisher to
understand that the communications media were potentially more
powerful than the parties and their politicians.'' For Hearst, who
aspired to political office during much of his early life, ``access
was power.'' But he was also not above using his media outlets to
influence world events, even to manufacture news.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hearst was different,'' Nasaw tells us. He was not only
interested ``in reporting the news, but in making it.'' His most
notable episode of news-making occurred during the Spanish-American
War, when after trying to manipulate events in Cuba to increase
circulation, Hearst commanded his Morning Journal to run a bold
front-page headline inquiring, ``How Do You Like the Journal's
War?''
</P>
<P>
   It is a measure of how the debate over the need for fire walls
between the business office and the newsroom has evolved that it is
now considered a dubious practice (at least in principle) for the
business side to intrude on the news side, much less for a media
mogul to brazenly trade favorable coverage for political favors, as
Hearst so often did.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of how much better established the precept of
editorial independence has become since Hearst's heyday, one has
only to recall the recent uproar involving the publisher of the
Hearst-owned San Francisco Examiner, Timothy O. White.
</P>
<P>
   Before a federal judge, White acknowledged that he had engaged
in some political ``horse trading'' with Mayor Willie L. Brown Jr.
of San Francisco while discussing a complex business deal involving
the sale of his paper and the purchase of The San Franciso
Chronicle. In the Chief's day, no one would have batted an eye at
insinuations of such collusion. In this case, however, the very
corporation that William Randolph Hearst created felt obliged to
suspend its publisher to protect its name.

HOUSE AGREES ON DEAL TO ALLOW CUBA TO BUY FOOD, MEDICINE FROM
U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHARLES POPE  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the House reaching a hard-won agreement
yesterday allowing Cuba to buy food and medicine from the United
States, Washington state farmer Cary Janson and Rep. George
Nethercutt are among those with good reason to look forward to the
fall harvest.
</P>
<P>
   For Janson, partially lifting long-standing trade sanctions
against Cuba and four other nations means he'll be able to sell his
crops _ peas, lentils and wheat _ to five large and hungry markets.
</P>
<P>
   Before the sanctions were imposed in 1961, Cuba was a huge
market for Washington state crops. The state's pea and lentil
growers in particular have mourned the loss of Cuba as a trading
partner, because it had been the largest importer of those
commodities in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   Reopening that market could boost the price of peas and lentils
enough to turn a loss for the year into a small profit, Janson
believes.
</P>
<P>
   For Nethercutt, the harvest could mean the difference between
profit and loss in political terms. The Washington Republican is
hoping farmers will reward him with their votes this fall in what
promises to be a tight election for a fourth term. Farmers and
their lobbyists in Washington have been pushing hard to open those
markets.
</P>
<P>
   All of this potential took root Tuesday as Nethercutt and other
farm-state lawmakers reached agreement at 2 a.m. after more than
five hours of bruising negotiations. The session climaxed six weeks
of talks between Nethercutt and Republican leaders who opposed any
relaxation of trade barriers with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Easy passage is expected in the full House. The Senate also is
expected to approve it. Although the White House has reservations,
President Clinton is expected to sign the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began this process guided by the principle that the United
States is never justified in using unilateral food and medicine
sanctions as weapons in foreign policy,'' an elated Nethercutt
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement accomplishes exactly what I first set out to
do: upon enactment, American farmers will have access to all five
unilaterally sanctioned markets. It's not a perfect agreement ...
but that's the nature of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a fundamental shift in American foreign policy and a
new day for American agriculture.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, sales of food and medicine to Cuba, Sudan,
North Korea, Libya and Iran would have to be ``cash only'' with
additional restrictions to guarantee that the U.S. government or
banks do not finance any of the purchases by Cuba. Cuba initially
would be able to purchase only $45 million worth of U.S. farm
goods, according to an estimate by the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic
Council. That compares to $400 million if the country could use
U.S. financing.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Wahl, director of Washington State University's
International Marketing Project for Agricultural Commodities and
Trade, said Cuba is too small to provide much help to struggling
farmers. But, he added, ``this is good news for farmers because
it's been a long time since they've had any good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Wahl believes a more significant change is the requirement that
Congress approve future sanctions. That, he said, is likely to
result in fewer sanctions which will help farmers who suffer when
markets are closed.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt and his allies, however, said the agreement was the
first step in a larger effort to liberalize trade with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line for me ... was we want to open markets for us
to sell products to them. Even though it will be a little more
difficult in Cuba (to finance purchases), I think it can be done,''
Nethercutt said. ``This is a first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas Rep. Jay Dickey, who worked with Nethercutt, said: ``To
those people who say we didn't go far enough or we didn't make a
good enough bargain, we're getting our foot in the door. It's not
perfect; we're trying to do as much as we can right now. The
resistance was unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   The measure must now be approved by the Senate, which in the
past has overwhelmingly endorsed lifting sanctions on food and
medicine to Cuba. Sanctions against the five countries would be
lifted 120 days after the bill becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   If all of that happens before Congress leaves for the July 4
recess _ as Nethercutt hopes _ some of the harvest from U.S. fields
could be on dinner tables in Cuba as early as this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Still, opposition remains.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is concerned that the agreement would require a
president to get congressional approval before imposing future
embargoes on food and medicine to other countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not opposed to allowing things like food and medicine
to go to Cuba, as long as it is for the benefit of the people, and
not the benefit of the Castro government,'' said White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart. ``We do have concerns on what I call an
institutional basis, based on the limits that it puts on
presidential prerogatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers from south Florida and groups opposed to Cuban
President Fidel Castro remain opposed to the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ileana Ross-Lehtinen, R-Fla., a Castro critic who
negotiated against Nethercutt, said the legislation would ``make it
as difficult as possible'' for such sales to take place. The
agreement would also write into law the existing ban on Americans
going to Cuba as tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that what Castro has wanted is access'' to U.S.
financial markets, she said. ``He's not going to get any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   And Nethercutt's effort has energized anti-Castro groups to
launch ad campaigns against those supporting any form of trade with
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The largest and wealthiest _ the Cuban American National
Foundation _ announced a new round of television ads condemning
Castro for allowing 77 U.S. citizens convicted of felonies to live
in his country. The ads, which will initially be aired in
Washington, D.C., follow another ad broadcast 10 days ago in
several locations, including Nethercutt's district.
</P>
<P>
   ``We find it unconscionable that the U.S. Congress would be
debating economic overtures to the Castro government while Fidel
Castro protects and provides safe haven to 77 U.S. fugitive wanted
by the Federal Bureau of Investigation,'' said Jose Cardenas, head
of the Washington office of the Cuban American National Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Cardenas would not say if the new ad would run in Nethercutt's
district, but in describing the type of lawmaker that would be
targeted, he described Nethercutt. ``These ads are going to be run
against House members who favor lifting the sanctions and who are
in difficult elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The ad campaign, Cardenas said, is designed to ``remind the
American people who Fidel Castro is and what he stands for and ...
and why it is not a good idea to pursue any semblance of a normal
relationship with the Cuban dictator.''

ASSAD'S SON DESIGNATED SOLE CANDIDATE FOR SYRIAN PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ As Hafez Assad, absolute ruler of Syria for 30
years, slipped into a final coma several days before he died on
June 10, his closest circle of aides and advisers worked swiftly
behind the scenes in Damascus to ensure that his untested
34-year-old son would have a smooth, well orchestrated ascension to
power.
</P>
<P>
   That steady, swift march continued Tuesday as that son, Bashar
Assad, was, not unexpectedly, approved unanimously by Parliament as
the sole candidate for president in a referendum scheduled for July
10.
</P>
<P>
   His father regularly won such referundums by an official tally
of 99.9 percent, and there is little likelihood of voter drop-off.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker of Parliament paused a second or so before declaring
the result of the show of hands, followed by cheers and chants.
</P>
<P>
   Assad had already, in rapid succession, been promoted from army
colonel to lieutenant general _ his father's rank _ and commander
in chief, elected leader of the ruling Baath Party by acclaim at
its first congress in 15 years and leader of its ruling Regional
Command Council, all in the last 16 days.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the only thing that slowed the bandwagon was the
eagerness of Syrian officials to climb aboard. A parliamentary
committee delegated to study his candidacy on Sunday found him
overwhelmingly qualified, and he was scheduled to be anointed in a
session on Monday night. But so many lawmakers _ about 200 of the
250-member assembly _ wanted to speak in his praise that the voting
had to be rescheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The late president, one delegate declared, made Syria ``the envy
of all the world.'' To his son the delegate pledged, ``We shall
march behind you with absolute loyalty and sincerity.'' Another
called him a ``knight, who will lead us day to day.''
</P>
<P>
   There was momentary consternation on Monday when one member
objected to a constitutional change put through in 15 minutes after
the president's death that lowered the age for president to 34, not
coincidentally the age of the son.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker who objected was shouted down and later apologized.
</P>
<P>
   Hafez Assad was known as a very careful planner, and the pieces
have been put into place in the last two years as his son was put
in charge of Syria's domination of Lebanon and given more and more
responsibility for governing at home.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, last year he was put in charge of an
anti-corruption drive that purged a number of high-ranking
politicians and generals who might have turned into challengers.
</P>
<P>
   Among the once-powerful figures no longer on the scene as a
result is former Prime Minister Mahmoud Zubi. After 13 years as
prime minister and several more as speaker of Parliament, Zubi was
reported to have committed suicide last month as security forces
surrounded his villa after accusations that he was corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hekmat Shehabi, who had been the army chief of staff, fled
the country rather than face a graft investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The member of his father's old guard who appears to be most
protective and supportive of Bashar al-Assad is the defense
minister, Gen. Mustafa Tlas. He arranged at least two meetings for
senior military officers to get to know the young man and has been
by his side at many of his public appearances since the president's
death.
</P>
<P>
   Tlas' son, Manaf, is said to be one of Assad's closest friends
and has been introducing him to members of the country's Sunni
Muslim merchant class in an apparent attempt to broaden his base of
support.
</P>
<P>
   Manaf Tlas commands a battalion in the elite Republican Guard, a
mainstay of the late president's support, as does Assad's younger
brother, Maher. Tlas' brother-in-law, Asef Shawkat, is the director
of security and military intelligence. Another important supporter
is Bahajat Suleiman, director of internal security.
</P>
<P>
   The support of the military and the dozen or so overlapping
intelligence agencies, which were central to his father's rule,
will also be crucial to the new president's survival.
</P>
<P>
   Many key security positions are held by Alawites, who like the
Assad family are members of a once-poor minority sect risen to
power. It did not pass unnoticed that Zubi was a Sunni Muslim and
so is Shehabi.
</P>
<P>
   Assad was training in London as an ophthalmologist until his
older brother, Basil, a charismatic soldier and athlete who was the
heir apparent, died in a car crash in 1994. Michael Hudson,
director of the Center for Arab Studies at Georgetown University,
recalled meeting Assad at a computer convention and described him
as shy, studious and ``apparently a genuinely nice guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson, who happened to be in Damascus at the time of President
Assad's funeral, said Assad must ``thread his way through
minefields of potential opposition as he moves to build his own
power base,'' warning that the anticorruption drive could be a
two-edged sword.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dozens of other high officials are vulnerable to similar
charges,'' Hudson said. ``They must already be strategizing about
how to curb this possibly dangerous young man.''
</P>
<P>
   While the plan to bring the young man to power appeared well
orchestrated, said Fawaz Gerges, a professor of Middle Eastern
studies at Sarah Lawrence College, Assad's most urgent task is
``not only to gain legitimacy and consolidate power, but also to
keep the military-security ruling elite united.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerges said that in the coming months, it will be crucial for
Assad to build `'a coalition of like-minded lieutenants who fully
support him, as well as to manage wisely and decisively rivalry
among the elite that might spin out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   A measure of the speed with which the old guard is moving to
consolidate itself around Assad is that the election date has been
set well before the end of the traditional 40-day Muslim period of
mourning, which would be July 20.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the shifting political alliances could be seen in the
appointments to the 21-member regional command, the Baath Party's
ruling body. Among those joining Tlas and Vice President Abdel
Halim Khaddam, who promoted Assad to general and commander, are
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara and Prime Minister Mohammed Mero,
new members who appear to be part of an established core of support
for Assad.
</P>
<P>
   Another major new appointment is of Saeed Bkhaitan, a close aide
of Assad who is now director of the National Security Bureau, which
coordinates party and government bodies.
</P>
<P>
   Several formerly important generals have been eased into
retirement and lost their political positions in recent months.

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - When you hear national basketball aficionados
speak of the heart of the game, states such as Indiana, California,
New York and Kentucky are always the first ones mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Californians will talk your ears off about UCLA, John Wooden,
Lew Alcindor, and the Showtime Lakers. Indy hoop fans proudly
recollect countless anecdotes from favorite son Bob Knight to Keith
Smart's jump shot to beat Syracuse to why Gene Hackman was cheated
out of the Oscar for his performance in ``Hoosiers.'' Bluegrass
basketball junkies reminisce about Adolph Rupp, Joe B. Hall, Goose
Givens and Rick Pitino. New Yorkers boast of playground legends and
some will even tell you Michael Jordan was born in New York, not
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   But if you ask the aforementioned fans about Texas, they will
undoubtedly say, ``Yeah, Texas. That's a football state.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, football is a religion in Texas. Yes, high school football
is more popular here than Anna Kournikova on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But what of basketball? Does Texas get enough respect for the
basketball talent it produces?
</P>
<P>
   In today's NBA draft, two Texas kids could go 1-2 in the draft.
Most of the experts have Kenyon Martin, the University of
Cincinnati forward who played at Dallas Bryan Adams High School,
tabbed as the top pick, going to the New Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
   University of Texas center Chris Mihm has been listed anywhere
from No. 1 to No. 7 in mock drafts. Experts like his athleticism
and versatility in addition to his 7-foot size.
</P>
<P>
   If either Texas player goes No. 1, it will be the third time in
the last 10 drafts that this state has yielded the NBA's top draft
pick. In 1991, the Charlotte Hornets grabbed Dallas Skyline's Larry
Johnson out of Nevada-Las Vegas with the first pick. Louisville's
LaBradford Smith, who played at Bay City, went the same year at No.
19 to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Orlando used its top pick to take San Antonio Cole's
Shaquille O'Neal of Louisiana State. The Phoenix Suns also took a
Texas player in the first round, grabbing ex-Fort Worth Southwest
center Oliver Miller of Arkansas at No. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1990, 28 players who played high school ball in California
have gone in the first round. New York has produced 16, Indiana
eight and Kentucky four.
</P>
<P>
   What about Texas?
</P>
<P>
   The Lone Star state has produced 14 first-round picks since
1990, more than enough to be mentioned in the same breath as
California and New York. Texas had at least one first-round pick in
all but two drafts of the 1990s _ 1993 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think due to our location, away from the eastern coast of
the country, Texas is often overlooked,'' said Bob Springer,
publisher of Texas Basketball Magazine. ``That doesn't mean we
don't have some of the best talent in the nation. If you look back
over past NBA drafts, all the way back to Larry Johnson and Shaq,
you will see that Texas has as much basketball talent as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime Port Arthur Lincoln coach James Gamble, who coached
former NBA player and UT ex B.J. Tyler, thinks high school
basketball is starting to get more recognition than it did in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the '80s, hoops is getting to be a larger spectator
sport, including high school basketball,'' said Gamble, who has
coached at Lincoln for 27 years. ``Fans are becoming more
appreciative of good high school basketball and that encourages the
kids to work even harder to get better.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Kunstadt, the publisher of Texas Hoops.com., said hoops has
evolved over the last decade, particularly on the high school
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Texas is really that overlthe participation
level is another reason for its rise in popularity and the
subsequent crop of NBA first-rounders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are more kids playing basketball now than 15
years ago,'' he said. ``Some of the better athletes that used to
concentrate on the other sports, like football _ some of them are
playing basketball now. They are finding you can make the big money
in basketball, too.''

 &HT;    Who'll be the first pick in NBA draft tonight?
 &HT;    By Mark Rosner
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas - Kenyon Martin fearlessly attacks the rim on
offense, making the backboard shudder with his dunks. He
aggressively protects the basket on defense, a human detour.
</P>
<P>
   Those skills seem to make Martin the likely No. 1 pick in the
NBA draft tonight in Minneapolis. Or do they?
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Nets, who on Monday appeared set to open the
draft by choosing Martin, now say they are also considering
Stromile Swift and Darius Miles. Martin, a 6-foot-9-inch senior
forward why played college basketball at Cincinnati, is recovering
from a broken leg. Swift is a 6-9 sophomore forward at LSU, Miles a
6-9 forward who just finished high school in Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Kenyon is more ready, other than the injury, today
than the other two,'' Nets President Rod Thorn said Tuesday at a
press conference to introduce the team's new coach, Byron Scott.
``But you have to project what they are going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance the Nets might not choose any of the three.
They have entertained trade offers, particularly from Orlando,
which has the Nos. 5, 10 and 13 picks and wants to move up to take
Martin, who is from Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, which has the Nos. 4, 7 and 24 picks, also has shown
interest. Should the Bulls remain where they are, some analysts
predict they will draft Chris Mihm, the 7-foot former Texas
Longhorns center. If Chicago passes on Mihm, Orlando might be
waiting for him at No. 5. The worst scenario for Mihm, according to
a few analysts: he slips to No. 7, Chicago's second pick. Then
again, Cleveland is reportedly angling to obtain the third pick
from the Los Angeles Clippers in an effort to secure Mihm. The
bait? Cleveland's pick, No. 8, and point guard Brevin Knight.
Cleveland might make the same offer to Orlando if Mihm slips to No.
5.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts believe this draft lacks a player capable of
single-handedly rescuing a foundering team anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the projection business,'' Orlando General Manager
John Gabriel said. ``It was that way last year, that you have so
many players high in the draft who aren't ready for the NBA. It
means you have to be a little more tolerant about waiting. I do
think this draft is going to be a deep one. But the impact, like
the last few years, will be more clear by the All-Star break.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone seems to agree that, for now, Martin most resembles a
franchise-type player _ despite a broken fibula in his right leg
that he suffered during the first round of the Conference USA
tournament in March.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other players in the draft, Martin has not been able to
work out for NBA teams. But Martin has been examined by enough
doctors to fill two hospitals and a golf course. Doctors who
examined him at the NBA's pre-draft camp earlier in June expect a
complete recovery by training camp in October. Similar results were
reported by doctors who examined Martin for the Nets last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put that kid through so many tests, I don't think he
could go near a nuclear reactor because he'd be glowing,'' Martin's
agent, Dan Fegan, told the New York Post. ``They had leg and ankle
specialists, the best radiologists money can buy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nets already have lost one player to a broken leg, Jayson
Williams, their starting center. Williams, who has not played since
April 1999, is on the verge of retirement. Starting guard Kerry
Kittles recently underwent surgery to his right knee for the fourth
time in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the situation with Jayson Williams and Kerry Kittles,
they're going to be cautious,'' Fegan said. ``And their medical
people seemed satisfied. They're not going to say something will
never happen. Good doctors and good lawyers never say 100 percent.
It's 98 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is that shadow of a doubt. How will the injury
affect someone who relies so much on his ability to elevate
quickly? How many years of pounding can the leg absorb?
</P>
<P>
   Should New Jersey trade the No. 1 pick today, it will be the
first time in seven years a team has done that. In 1993, Orlando
drafted Chris Webber and traded him to Golden State for Penny
Hardaway and three future draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Orlando might use one of those picks, No. 5 this
year, in an attempt to move up to No. 1 and secure Martin. To
complete a trade with New Jersey, Orlando might have to also
relinquish the No. 10 slot in the draft as well as a player or two,
reportedly Corey Maggette and either Michael Doleac or Matt
Harpring.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver, which has the second pick, has its eyes on Swift.
According to the NBA grapevine, the Grizzlies have considered
trading down to obtain more than one player.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Clippers, who pick third, are likely to take
Iowa State power forward Marcus Fizer as a replacement for
departing free agent Maurice Taylor. But there have been some
rumors suggesting the Clippers might opt for Miles.
</P>
<P>
   Most draft analysts predict the Bulls will take either Mihm or
Miles with the fourth pick. The Bulls need a center more than a
small forward, but some NBA scouts think that Miles might become a
star like Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant, both of whom skipped
college.
</P>
<P>
   Should Orlando remain at No. 5, it can pick whoever is left
between Mihm, Miles or Fizer.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Texas teams, all three are trying to move up in the
draft. For now, Houston owns the ninth pick and Dallas No. 12,
while San Antonio does not have a first-round selection.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predict the Rockets will take DerMarr Johnson, a
thin, 6-9 shooting guard who was Martin's teammate at Cincinnati.
Others believe the Rockets will address their needs at power
forward with 7-foot Jerome Moiso of UCLA, 6-10 Nigerian Olumide
Oyedeji or 6-9 Etan Thomas of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, which needs frontcourt help, might take Oyedeji or 7-2
Iakovos Tsakalidis, who plays professionally in Greece and
generally is considered the third-best center in the draft behind
Mihm and Joel Przybilla of Minnesota. According to one prediction,
the Mavs will take Keyon Dooling, a point guard from Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have the 41st and 54th picks in the second round. They
might look for a center to back up David Robinson. Several should
be available in the second round, including LSU's Jabari Smith and
junior-college star Ernest Brown. Among the foreign players
available are Dalibor Bagaric from Croatia, Primoz Brezec from
Slovenia and Soumalia Samake from Mali.
</P>
<P>
   Draft analysts predict the Spurs might take a point guard,
shooting guard or small forward. Khalid El-Amin of Connecticut and
Ed Cota of North Carolina are potentially available point guards.
Lavor Postell of St. John's and Mark Karcher of Temple are possible
choices at shooting guard. Eduardo Najera of Oklahoma, Dan Langhi
of Vanderbilt or Pete Mickeal of Cincinnati might be around at
small forward. Among those players, Postell is considered most
likely to be taken before the Spurs' turn arrives.

   Ironically, Orlando might use one of those picks, No. 5 this
year, in an attempt to move up to No. 1 and secure Martin. To
complete a trade with New Jersey, Orlando might have to also
relinquish the No. 10 slot in the draft as well as a player or two,
reportedly Corey Maggette and either Michael Doleac or Matt
Harpring.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver, which has the second pick, has its eyes on Swift.
According to the NBA grapevine, the Grizzlies have considered
trading down to obtain more than one player.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles Clippers, who pick third, are likely to take
Iowa State power forward Marcus Fizer as a replacement for
departing free agent Maurice Taylor. But there have been some
rumors suggesting the Clippers might opt for Miles.
</P>
<P>
   Most draft analysts predict the Bulls will take either Mihm or
Miles with the fourth pick. The Bulls need a center more than a
small forward, but some NBA scouts think that Miles might become a
star like Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant, both of whom skipped
college.
</P>
<P>
   Should Orlando remain at No. 5, it can pick whoever is left
between Mihm, Miles or Fizer.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Texas teams, all three are trying to move up in the
draft. For now, Houston owns the ninth pick and Dallas No. 12,
while San Antonio does not have a first-round selection.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts predict the Rockets will take DerMarr Johnson, a
thin, 6-9 shooting guard who was Martin's teammate at Cincinnati.
Others believe the Rockets will address their needs at power
forward with 7-foot Jerome Moiso of UCLA, 6-10 Nigerian Olumide
Oyedeji or 6-9 Etan Thomas of Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas, which needs frontcourt help, might take Oyedeji or 7-2
Iakovos Tsakalidis, who plays professionally in Greece and
generally is considered the third-best center in the draft behind
Mihm and Joel Przybilla of Minnesota. According to one prediction,
the Mavs will take Keyon Dooling, a point guard from Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have the 41st and 54th picks in the second round. They
might look for a center to back up David Robinson. Several should
be available in the second round, including LSU's Jabari Smith and
junior-college star Ernest Brown. Among the foreign players
available are Dalibor Bagaric from Croatia, Primoz Brezec from
Slovenia and Soumalia Samake from Mali.
</P>
<P>
   Draft analysts predict the Spurs might take a point guard,
shooting guard or small forward. Khalid El-Amin of Connecticut and
Ed Cota of North Carolina are potentially available point guards.
Lavor Postell of St. John's and Mark Karcher of Temple are possible
choices at shooting guard. Eduardo Najera of Oklahoma, Dan Langhi
of Vanderbilt or Pete Mickeal of Cincinnati might be around at
small forward. Among those players, Postell is considered most
likely to be taken before the Spurs' turn arrives.

SPORTS COLUMN: ANGELS ARE BROUGHT TO THE GYM 
</HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE VECSEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something truly wonderful has been happening in Atlanta this
baseball season, but unfortunately it has been obscured by the
blather of John Rocker.
</P>
<P>
   Just turned 39, Andres Galarraga has bounced back from
non-Hodgkins lymphoma, a form of cancer in his lower back. After a
full year of inactivity and four months of rebuilding in the gym,
he has made one of the great recoveries in the history of sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Cat _ it's a wonderful story,'' said Joe Torre of the
Yankees, who is recovering from prostate cancer. ``It gives hope to
a lot of people with cancer. He lets people know there's life out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   If there is any justice in the world, Torre will be managing
against Galarraga in the All-Star Game in Atlanta on July 11.
Galarraga is currently second in the voting behind Mark McGwire,
and his own manager, Bobby Cox, gets to fill out the roster.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a phenomenal happening,'' Cox said recently of Galarraga.
``It's a tribute to medical science plus the strength of somebody's
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   There are miracles all around us. We must never become jaded to
the advances in heart bypass surgery, organ transplant, cancer
treatment, joint replacement, techniques that were not available a
decade or a generation ago. When they are personified in a very
public man of grace like Galarraga, the message is as vivid as the
pealing of bells.
</P>
<P>
   He had a backache at the end of the 1998 season, and the doctors
discovered the lymphoma in the third lumbar vertebra in the lower
back, and said he would need five months of chemotherapy and a
short series of radiation.
</P>
<P>
   He was feeling well enough to join the Braves late in the 1999
season, and stay in uniform right through the four-game loss to the
Yankees in the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lit up the clubhouse; it was great for the club,'' Brian
Jordan said. ``You pray for him. You can't explain what's
happening. With his smile, you know angels are watching over him.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctors and his personal angels got him to a point last
November, but then Galarraga had to push himself toward major
league condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw myself in the mirror, I didn't believe it,''
Galarraga said the other day. ``I said, `Wow, I have to lose
weight.'''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, his angels were with him. Instead of going home to
Venezuela in the winter, Galarraga went to Powerhouse Gym on
Okeechobee Road in West Palm Beach, Fla. There he introduced
himself to a muscular trainer named Eric Peterman, a former social
worker dedicated to ``drug-free'' body-building.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no idea who he was,'' Peterman said on Monday. ``I never
really followed baseball. It turned out I had seen him discussing
his illness on television but I never once made the connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterman was neither a hero-worshiper, nor was he squeamish
about working with a man recovering from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my profession, I worked with multiproblem adolescents and
later I worked with sexual abuse,'' Peterman said. ``None of this
stuff fazed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterman had also worked out with members of the Cleveland
Browns in his hometown, so he knew how hard he could push.
</P>
<P>
   ``Professional athletes have a totally different passion from
everybody else,'' Peterman said. ``Their health and fitness are the
key to their success. Without that, they have no career, no
lucrative contract. I realized he's a pro. Hee wants to win. He
wants to get back on that stage.''
</P>
<P>
   They worked out routines that would put no stress on the
weakened bones and muscles in the lower back. At first, Galarraga
was capable of a biceps curl with only the 45-pound bar; four
months later he was curling between 115 and 135 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was also watching his diet, starting to run, then he went
to the batting cage,'' Peterman recalled. ``He would slam the ball
and come back with a grin on his face like he'd discovered a new
kind of candy.''
</P>
<P>
   By February, Galarraga was in shape to report to spring
training. Bobby Cox, moving at a newfound trot on his own
surgically rebuilt knees, followed Galarraga out to a batting cage.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shocked us,'' Cox said. ``We had gotten Wally Joyner just
in case, but Andres hit balls 500 feet the first day. We were going
to take it easy, but he was in as good a shape as anybody.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor said, `Go ahead, keep going.' You didn't know if he
should take it easy. He dictated everything. He played as if
everything was normal.'' Jordan recalled: ``I came in early this
spring, I saw him, you had to ask, `Was he ever ill?' It couldn't
happen to a nicer guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga got off to a strong start, and has never slipped.
Going into last night's game in Montreal, Galarraga was batting
.308 with 18 homers and 55 runs batted in playing in 70 of the
Braves' 75 games. He thanked Peterman by flying him up to a home
stand and introducing him around the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to stay alive,'' Galarraga said recently. ``I also
wanted to be here with my glove and bat. I had to keep myself
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   His strength, both physical and mental, has been a marvel to
those who have been paying attention.
</P>
<P>
   When the Braves arrive at Shea Stadium Thursday, a warm salute
for Andres Galarraga would be a perfect way for fans to exorcise
the prejudiced toxins let loose by John Rocker.

IRS SAYS RECORD NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS EARN MORE THAN $100,000 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036
or 888-346-9867.) By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stock options, two-career couples and capital gains helped lift
a record number of taxpayers _ one in 15 _ to six-figure annual
incomes in 1998, the government reported Tuesday, an increase of
1.1 million from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The Internal Revenue Service counts a married couple who file
jointly as one taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   The number of taxpayers with incomes of $100,000 or more soared
in 1998 to 8.3 million, up 15 percent from 7.2 million in 1997,
preliminary figures from 1998 income tax returns showed.
</P>
<P>
   The book of statistics was issued Tuesday by the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The data help explain why federal tax revenue has surged,
prompting President Clinton on Monday to raise the budget surplus
over the next decade to $1.9 trillion from the February estimate of
$792 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of the IRS data by The New York Times also showed the
number of taxpayers making $100,000 or more expanded to 36.9
percent in 1998 from 34.2 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the first glimpse of the impact of the Taxpayer Relief Act of
1997, the taxes paid by these Americans rose by 30.4 percent as
more of their income was subject to the 31 percent, 36 percent and
39.6 percent rates.
</P>
<P>
   The 6.6 percent of taxpayers earning more than $100,000 paid 58
percent of all income taxes in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Many more taxpayers in 1998 _ 828,000, which is a 40 percent
increase over the previous year _ paid the Alternative Minimum Tax,
the new data show. The tax, which phases out deductions for state
and local taxes, and even for children, was adopted 31 years ago to
stop rich taxpayers from using so many legal tax breaks that they
paid no federal income tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows how this frightening tax complexity monster is
growing in our midst,'' said David Keating of the National
Taxpayers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Because Congress has not updated the law for inflation, the
minimum tax now reaches so far down the economic ladder that it can
sometimes tax a single parent making $28,000.
</P>
<P>
   The tax data also raised questions about the effectiveness of
the sharp reduction in capital gains taxes, a major element of the
Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which was sponsored by the House
Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The highest long-term capital gains tax rate was cut to 20
percent from 28 percent in 1996 and part of 1997, yet the rate of
growth in capital gains fell by half, from 48 percent in 1996 to 22
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, promoted the lower rate as a key to
increasing savings and investment and building a prosperous future.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, taxpayers with incomes less than $15,000 seem
to be lagging behind inflation. But interpreting the data is hard
because the lowest income category is now heavy with rich children.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people with income less than $15,000 annually
declined by 3 percent, from 40.5 million in 1997 to 40.1 million in
1998. The average income grew by just 0.6 percent, to $6,290, an
increase of a scant $45 over 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the picture is the growing number of prosperous
families who file tax returns for children who have their own
college funds.
</P>
<P>
   The one indication that the lowest income category is now
populated with rich children is that 44 percent of this group's
income came from capital gains, four times the contribution of
capital gains to the incomes of those making $30,000 to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of the IRS data also showed that the boom at the top is
overwhelmingly the result of more people crossing the $100,000
income threshold, rather than of increases in income among those
already there.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 6.2 million taxpayers making $100,000 to $200,000, the
average income fell by $514, to $131,189, from $131,703 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The number of taxpayers with income above $200,000 _ the highest
category delineated by the IRS in these data _ grew by a brisk 18
percent.

MARKET PLACE: SEC PROPOSES STRICTER ACCOUNTING RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission proposed new rules
Tuesday to tighten standards on what other services accounting
firms could sell to companies whose books they audit. The proposal
immediately ran into stiff criticism from some accounting firms,
but gained support from others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without confidence in an auditor's objectivity and fairness,
how can an investor know whether to trust the numbers?'' asked
Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the SEC. ``Sound and verifiable
numbers are to financial markets what oxygen is to breathing. Our
financial markets simply cannot work without access to strong,
high-quality financial reporting.''
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules, which will be subject to public comment for
75 days and then to public hearings before the commission decides
whether to adopt them, would in some cases bar accounting firms
from performing consulting services they now perform for companies
whose books they audit.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal asks for comment on a wide range of issues,
including whether auditors should be allowed to write promotional
materials for tax shelter advocates, whether they should be allowed
to help design the financial systems they will then critique as
part of their audits and whether it is proper for auditors to lobby
on behalf of their clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time there has ever been a rule proposal on
the scope of services these firms provide,'' said Lynn Turner, the
SEC's chief accountant. ``People have wondered whether that growing
scope related to some of the major audit failures we have seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the five largest accounting firms, and the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants, strongly criticized the
proposal as being unnecessary and seeking to solve a problem that
does not exist. They have already begun to enlist congressional
allies in case they need to seek legislation to overturn any rules
the commission adopts.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that there was no demonstrated problem, and
challenged the SEC to name one audit that was compromised because
the auditor also performed consulting services for the client. And,
they added, the knowledge of consultants helped, not hurt, the
audit.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us to protect investors, you need a wide range of
expertise within our firm,'' said Stephen Aliss of KPMG. ``The
direction of this proposal is to drive talent from our firm.''
</P>
<P>
   He argued that it would be hard to attract highly qualified
consultants because many potential customers would be off limits as
audit clients.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Deloitte &AMP; Touche and Arthur Andersen joined
in the criticism. ``The more you know about the client, the better
the audit is going to be,'' said Jeffrey Peck, a managing director
of Arthur Andersen, adding that the SEC proposal would reduce the
quality of audits.
</P>
<P>
   But the remaining big five firms _ Ernst &AMP; Young and
PricewaterhouseCoopers _ said they broadly support the SEC's
initiative. ``We believe that the perceived independence problem is
becoming a factor in the marketplace and needs to be dealt with,''
said Larry Parnall, a spokesman for Ernst &AMP; Young. ``We hope the
rule-making process is the beginning of this effort and we look
forward to working with the SEC on this.''
</P>
<P>
   PricewaterhouseCoopers issued a statement saying: ``We are fully
committed to supporting the SEC's efforts to enhance audit quality
and investor protection. At this crucial moment in the history of
the accounting profession, the public interest must take precedence
over self-interest.''
</P>
<P>
   That split in the accounting profession could make it easier for
the SEC to take action this year. Some of the opponents contend
that the commission was rushing the comment period in an effort to
complete its work before a new president took office in January.
The new president would be able to name a new SEC chairman if he
wished to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Levitt emphasized that the commission had
already discussed the ideas extensively with the industry and was
open to all comments. ``The firms have nothing to fear and
investors have everything to gain from this open public debate,''
he said. He said he hoped for broad public participation in the
process.
</P>
<P>
   The AFL-CIO offered support for the proposal. ``We believe that
the proposed changes, by extending the range of financial, business
and employment relationships that are deemed to create conflicts of
interest, will ensure that auditors are genuinely independent,''
said John Sweeney, the federation's president.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC proposal also includes a series of generally
non-controversial proposals to liberalize the rules regarding
investments by employees and officials of auditing firms. In
general, the rules would allow many more investments and would
substantially relax the rules relating to spouses of such people.
</P>
<P>
   A report released by the SEC in January concluded that most
partners at PricewaterhouseCoopers had violated the existing rules
and similar studies are now underway regarding the other four
firms.
</P>
<P>
   Accountants who are opposed to the other changes complained that
the SEC should have separated those rules to enable them to be
adopted quickly.
</P>
<P>
   All the major accounting firms have considered efforts to
separate themselves to some extent from their consulting divisions.
Ernst &AMP; Young has gone the furthest, selling its operation. Others
are considering a variety of revamping proposals, including the
sale of minority stakes. The proposal seeks comment on the extent
of separation that would be needed before a related consulting firm
could provide otherwise prohibited services to the accounting
firm's audit client.
</P>
<P>
   Turner, the SEC's chief accountant, said the argument that
providing consulting services made for better audits ``just doesn't
hold water.'' He noted that one study showed three-quarters of
audit clients get no other services from their auditing firms.
``Does that mean that in 75 percent of the cases, we have poor
audits?''

   CUBA-TRADE (Washington) _ With the House reaching a hard-won
agreement allowing Cuba to buy food and medicine from the United
States, Washington state farmer Cary Janson and Rep. George
Nethercutt are among those with good reason to look forward to the
fall harvest. For Janson, partially lifting long-standing trade
sanctions against Cuba and four other nations means he'll be able
to sell his crops _ peas, lentils and wheat _ to five large and
hungry markets. For Nethercutt, the harvest could mean the
difference between profit and loss in political terms. The
Washington Republican is hoping farmers will reward him with their
votes this fall in what promises to be a tight election for a
fourth term.

   SPINBALDAK, Afghanistan _ Bargain hunters, perhaps it is time to
consider a shopping trip to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it is a shlep, requiring a journey across Iran or
over the rugged mountains of the Hindu Kush or through the steep
gorges of the Khyber Pass.
</P>
<P>
   But in a place called Spinbaldak _ in the flat, desert terrain
near the Pakistani border _ there are ever-so-cheap cars,
television sets, stereos and cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Entire stores carry nothing but motor oil from England or sewing
machines from Japan or wheel rims from just about anywhere. There
are great deals on Vaseline Hair Tonic and Palmolive Shampoo. For
those who prefer to buy in bulk, there are sets of 72 Duralex
French tumblers, 10-packs of Sony tape cassettes and bars of Lux
soap by the gross.
</P>
<P>
   Spinbaldak is like a Price Club crossed with a Salvation Army
Store and a flea market. There are about 100 shops, each one spare
and decidedly inelegant. Most are merely open cargo containers _ 10
feet wide and 20 feet deep. There is no electricity. The climate
control seems stuck on the notch that calls for a dust storm.
</P>
<P>
   But service is friendly. ``Sprechen Sie Deutsch?'' called out
one merchant, Abdul Qadir. ``No? OK, I speak a little English, too.
And I give you the best deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, Qadir trades in television sets, which are banned
by the Taliban militia, rulers of most of the country. But his
customers are not Afghans. They are usually Pakistanis and Iranians
here to buy on the cheap for themselves or for resale back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you like?'' asked Qadir, a tall, persistent man standing
before two rows of televisions stacked eye-high, perhaps 70 in all.
``Samsung, Panasonic, Toshiba? Here look, I sell you a 29-inch Sony
for 10,000 rupees'' (about $200).
</P>
<P>
   There are some hitches to buying appliances in Spinbaldak, and
these became apparent as the sales pitch went on. ``I guarantee you
that 80 percent of my televisions work,'' Qadir said. ``And the
rest, easy to fix. No problem.''
</P>
<P>
   While the soap sold here is brand new, the appliances and cars
are all used. These are goods discarded by Japanese families and
gathered in large quantities by traders. They are then shipped to
Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and hauled into Afghanistan by
truck.
</P>
<P>
   The small-time merchants of Spinbaldak buy the wares by the
container-full, either on their own or with partners. They sell the
merchandise just as they bought it, unaware of whether it
functions. In this part of the world, repairs are cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, there was no shortage of customers, but the new
military government in Pakistan seems to be unusually serious about
collecting customs duties at the border.
</P>
<P>
   In Spinbaldak, a three-hour drive from any sizable city, this
surge in enforcement is a bother. More border guards means more
people who must be bribed. Customers pass a far longer gantlet of
open palms.
</P>
<P>
   These greedy men in uniforms can be avoided by employing a
smuggler. Men with donkeys will carry just about anything along
more discreet trails. But this does add to the buyer's expense,
about $60 extra on that $200 television purchase. At the same time,
the condition of an appliance is unlikely to improve while it is
strapped to the back of a donkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I show you a camera?'' asked Abdul Bari, whose shop is
more eclectic than the others, filled with hair dryers, clocks,
ashtrays, motorcycle helmets and toaster ovens.
</P>
<P>
   He opened a large suitcase full of cameras, displayed in a heap
like ties at an end-of-the-season sale. ``For Nikon, I usually
charge more,'' he said amiably. ``But for you, my friend, the price
is the same, and I will give you one that will work for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the way, Gul Khan was selling sewing machines. By his
guess, 90 percent were broken. ``But you cannot go wrong,'' he
said. ``I'll sell you this machine for 250 rupees'' _ $5 _ ``and if
you are worried about spare parts, you can buy two more at the same
price.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban are popular here. Indeed, when they began their
conquest of the country in 1994 they received financial support
from big traders who wanted the highways cleared of brigands. The
Taliban have made travel in Afghanistan safe again, and they, in
turn, make a hefty sum taxing cross-country shipments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Taliban, robbers would not only steal your vehicle,
they'd take your money and maybe even your clothes,'' said Amir
Muhammad, an auto dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad and his several associates run a car lot. The autos are
all used Japanese models. They were bought from traders in Dubai
who have a take-it-or-leave-it attitude. They allow the cars to be
started but not driven.
</P>
<P>
   He had a 1995 Toyota Land Cruiser on sale for a modest $5,600.
The interior was clean. The tires had treads. The engine operated
without a cough.
</P>
<P>
   But was it a good vehicle?
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad considered the question. ``If you want a cheap car,
this is the right place,'' he said bluntly. ``If you want a perfect
car, maybe you should go somewhere else.''

RED SOX OUT OF TALKS, YANKEES SAID NEAR DEAL FOR SOSA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While the New York Yankees prepared to close a deal for Chicago
Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa, the Red Sox quietly bowed out of the
running, according to a major league source with direct knowledge
of the talks between the Cubs and Sox. The talks never advanced to
the point where the sides exchanged names, according to the source.
</P>
<P>
   Boston general manager Dan Duquette did make a phone call to the
Cubs, following up earlier contact made by one of his subordinates,
the source said, but club officials have not spoken in the last
four or five days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the Sox have been a player in this for a
while,'' the source said. ``Dan loves Sosa, but I don't think they
ever made a hard run for him. Whatever the reason, it never got
real serious. I don't know if it was because Dan decided he needed
pitching more, or didn't think the Sox could sign Sosa to an
extension, but no names were ever exchanged.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, who scouted the Red Sox extensively since Boston first
expressed interest in Sosa two weeks ago, had put together a list
of names. Any package the Cubs would have wanted, the source said,
almost certainly would have included outfielder Trot Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Cubs were looking for big league help, too, not just
kids,'' the source said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, while the Sox were in the midst of losing 8 of 12 to
the Yankees and Blue Jays, Duquette said the team's priority was to
upgrade its offensive production. Since that time, Nixon strained
his hamstring and the Sox called up three players from Pawtucket _
outfielders Curtis Pride and Izzy Alcantara and first baseman-DH
Morgan Burkhart _ and signed infielder Sean Berry, who was released
by the Milwaukee Brewers. Berry is in Fort Myers, Fla., getting
himself back into playing shape.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox have inquired about other infielders, including Rich
Aurilia of the Giants and Ed Sprague of the Padres. It appears the
Giants have decided not to move Aurilia, while the Sox have not
been happy with what the Padres want in return for Sprague.
</P>
<P>
   There are 4 1/2 weeks left before the trading deadline, plenty
of time for Duquette, who historically has gone to the final hours
before making a deal. According to another major league source, the
Red Sox might have interest in trying to rent Detroit Tigers
slugger Juan Gonzalez, who is eligible to become a free agent after
the season. But it is uncertain whether Gonzalez, who on Monday
rejected an offer from the Yankees, would be amenable to a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some other big names could go on the market, including Astros
outfielder Moises Alou, if Houston can persuade him to waive his
no-trade clause. In the last few days, the Sox had accelerated
attempts to swing a deal for pitcher Scott Erickson, but those
talks apparently have gone nowhere.

BAY STATE MOVES TO BAR JAILED FELONS FROM VOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Massachusetts, one of three states that permits
prisoners to vote, is taking a step toward changing that as
lawmakers prepare to place a constitutional amendment on the
November ballot that would ban many inmates from voting.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-sponsored change to the state constitution --
which will put Massachusetts closer in line with 47 other states --
would bar inmates convicted of felonies from voting while they are
incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Francis Marini predicted the amendment
will easily be adopted when the House and Senate meet in a
constitutional convention Wednesday. The proposal _ which requires
passage by two successive legislative sesions before being put to
voters _ was approved 155-34 two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Using a reference to the game Monopoly, Marini said: ``It is
part of the penalty - you are in jail, you don't pass go, you don't
collect the $200, you don't vote until you get out.''
</P>
<P>
   Prisoners' voting rights have become a hotly debated issue among
criminal justice experts. Liberals argue stripping inmates of the
right to participate in elections disproportionately hurts
minorities, and call the measure a more subtle version of the poll
tax and literacy tests that Southern segregationists used to bar
blacks from voting. Racial minorities have a higher rate of
incarceration than whites.
</P>
<P>
   But conservatives argue that prisoners have proven by their
criminal acts to be untrustworthy citizens, and therefore should be
denied voting rights. They say convicts have only themselves to
blame and that society has the right to put limits on their civic
participation.
</P>
<P>
   Only Massachusetts, Maine, and Vermont now allow inmates to cast
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The ban is being pushed by Governor Paul Cellucci. It would
apply to state, local and federal elections and be imposed on state
prisoners and those county inmates guilty of felonies.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the amendment argue that inmates, though
incarcerated, retain certain rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``When someone is sentenced to prison, they are sentenced to
lose their liberty, but not to forfeit every right they have as a
citizen,'' said Ann K. Lambert, legislative counsel for American
Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The constitution has worked well for hundreds of years and we
don't need to tinker with it to disenfranchise a segement of the
population,'' Lambert said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ogletree, the Harvard Law School professor and director
of its Criminal Justice Institute, said the measure lacks grounding
in moral reasoning and flies in the face of efforts to teach
prisoners basic lessons of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the clear signs of a strong democracy and participation
of citizens is exercising the right to vote,'' Ogletree said.
``This is one of the few ways to show them they can become a
respoonsible citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogletree said the lawmakers should not be mixing the issue of
voting rights and crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope the rhetoric of crime does not blind them to the
reasons for participatory democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Marini rejected the argument that allowing prisons to vote
will prepare to them be better citizens once they are released.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their right to vote before they committed their crimes didn't
help them be part of better citizens,'' Marini said.
</P>
<P>
   Marini also dismissed the argument that the GOP amendment is
disproportionally tougher against minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care one way or the other,'' Marini said. ``It is not
about race. It s about crime and people who serve felony sentences.
We ought to be less colorblind, not more.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some Democrats are also privately expressing concern
that the presence of the amendment on the November ballot is in
part a political ploy to draw more conservative voters to the
polls. They said those voters would likely cast ballots for GOP
presidential candidate George W. Bush and for Cellucci's income tax
cut initiative also scheduled to appear on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great news for Bush and (tax-cut leader) Barbara
Anderson,'' said one top Beacon Hill Democrat.

AMA TARGETS THREE SENATORS IN PATIENTS' RIGHTS CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The American Medical Association is targeting
Washington and two other states with Republican senators in tough
re-election races in a advertising campaign urging GOP lawmakers to
drop their opposition to a comprehensive patients' bill of rights.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would give patients expanded rights to appeal
when health plans deny coverage. It would guarantee all 161 million
Americans with private health insurance the right to sue insurers
when harmed by delays or denial of treatment. The bill is backed by
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that cuts across all lines of age, race,
economic status and gender,'' Dr. Richard Corlin, president-elect
of the AMA, said in an interview Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA campaign, which begins Wednesday, represents a change of
direction for the physicians' group _ long a conservative presence
in national politics. In 1965, the AMA targeted Washington state in
an unsuccessful campaign to block Congress' enactment of Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA is directing its latest message in this state at Sen.
Slade Gorton, a member of the Republican Senate leadership blocking
the AMA-backed bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The patients' bill of rights is one vote from passage in the
U.S. Senate: He (Gorton) has the opportunity to be that one vote,
and put this bill on the president's desk for signature,'' Corlin
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nancy Auer, president-elect of the Washington State Medical
Association, noted that a state patients' rights bill was enacted
into law this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obviously something that people in Washington agree
with,'' Auer said.
</P>
<P>
   Corlin, a gastroentrologist from Santa Monica, Calif., argued
that patients' rights to appeal are essential to what he called ``a
crucial issue of public need.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The appeals process must be external, it must be independent
and it must be binding on both parties,'' he argued.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA's initial campaign is also directed at Sens. John
Ashcroft, R-Mo., and Spencer Abraham, R-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   All were in the majority on a 51-48 Senate vote that blocked the
patients' rights bill June 8. With one absent Democrat likely to
vote for patients' rights, the AMA needs at least one of the three
targeted senators to switch and support the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Bergman, Gorton's press secretary, said the senator is
``listening to the concerns of the local medical community.'' She
added that he is working on a ``grand compromise'' to allow
patients to hold health plans ``accountable.'' But she denounced
the AMA-backed legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The AMA's proposal would create a situation where patients
will be spending their time and money waging lengthy court battles
and lining the pockets of trial lawyers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Health is an issue that has taken center stage in Senate races
around the country, including Gorton's.
</P>
<P>
   A major corporate lobbying group, the Business Roundtable,
recently ran newspaper ads praising Gorton for voting against
patients' rights proposals that, it claimed, would have led to
costly lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   Americans for Job Security, an insurance industry committee, has
run a series of pro-Gorton TV spots. But the ads have focused on
topics far removed from patients' rights.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance-financed group has praised Gorton on education,
and recently hit the airwaves in Eastern Washington hailing the
senator's opposition to removing dams from the Snake River.
</P>
<P>
   Corlin denied that lawsuits will proliferate under patients'
rights legislation. When Texas enacted a 1997 accountability law
for health maintenance organizations, he added, ``the HMOs argued
it would open the floodgates to litigation.'' But only five
lawsuits have been filed since Gov. George W. Bush signed the bill
into law.
</P>
<P>
   He said it is necessary to get decisions on treatment out of the
hands of insurance companies. ``We have had health plans that
define `medical necessity' as the least intensive, lowest cost
alternative as determined by them,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Auer said patients' rights legislation is particularly needed in
emergency medicine. The legislation contains a clause mandating
insurance coverage in cases where, in her words, ``a prudent
layperson would have gone to the emergency room.''
</P>
<P>
   The AMA also plans to run ads thanking the four Republican
senators who defied party leaders voted for the patients' bill of
rights in the Senate. They are Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., Peter
Fitzgerald, R-Ill., Lincoln Chafee, R-R.I., and Arlen Specter,
R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-four Democratic senators voted for the bill. One
Democratic senator was absent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not into the issue of who Washington picks to be their
senators or representatives,'' Corlin said. ``We're simply saying
that Sen. Gorton needs to hear from his constituents.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has shown strong sensitivity to medical issues.
</P>
<P>
   He has introduced legislation to prevent drug companies from
selling prescription drugs in Canada and Mexico at a lower prices
than in the United States. Gorton extolled his proposal in a recent
taxpayer-financed mailing to Washington seniors.
</P>
<P>
   But Gorton also is a longtime ally of the insurance industry. He
is a leading sponsor of legislation to limit juries' awards of
punitive damages in product liability suits.
</P>
<P>
   The patients' rights issue has become a campaign theme for the
two Democrats vying for their party's nomination to oppose Gorton
in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gorton hasn't figured out yet that we need to restore the
patient-doctor relationship in determining a patient's health
needs. I'm glad the AMA is calling him on this,'' former Rep. Maria
Cantwell said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   State Insurance commissioner Deborah Senn, at a breakfast for
her Senate campaign, Tuesday produced a succession of individuals
and families who were denied coverage by health insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Senn was introduced at the breakfast by Dylan Malone. Malone and
his wife, Christine, made national news in their fight with Aetna
when the insurer tried to cut off home nursing care for their
nine-month-old son, Ian. An angry call from Vice President Al Gore
caused the company to change its mind.

PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY STEPS UP EFFORTS TO KILL MEDICARE DRUG
PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Iowa, Minn., Mont., Ore.)   By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First, the drug makers rolled out advertisements
featuring ``Flo,'' an arthritic bowler who warned against a Clinton
administration proposal for a new Medicare prescription drug
benefit. Now the industry is enticing twenty-somethings to call
their grandparents and urge them to lobby against the Clinton drug
plan.
</P>
<P>
   The global drug industry, operating through a group that can
legally conceal the source of its money and the targets of its
spending, has accelerated its lobbying against the administration's
drug proposal, which it contends will lead to price controls and
throttle pharmaceutical research. The stepped-up campaign coincides
with a vote in the House that is expected as early as Wednesday on
competing Republican and Democratic proposals on Medicare drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for Better Medicare, a group created a year ago by drug
manufacturers, has spent more than $2 million in just the past
three weeks on television advertisements opposing the
administration's drug proposal, according to the Democratic
officials who are tracking its advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Citizens for Better Medicare tried to draw young
visitors to its Web sites by offering free $10 calling cards and
urging them to telephone their grandparents to talk about Medicare
drug coverage. Demand for the free cards was so great that the
group is now asking people to call their grandparents ``on your own
dime.''
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception last July, the group has spent more than $30
million on television advertising alone and unknown amounts on
radio, print and Internet advertising, according to the Democratic
analysis. Many of the recent television spots are running in the
same regions of the country as a new Democratic National Committee
advertising campaign supporting the administration's prescription
drug plan.
</P>
<P>
   The group operates under a tax provision that allows it to
engage in issue advocacy but not to campaign for or against
candidates. But it has focused its advertising on the districts of
a number of Democrats who support expanded Medicare drug benefits,
skating close to the rule that prohibits direct involvement in
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent drug industry advertisements warn against
allowing ``big government'' into people's medicine chests. They
also charge that millions of seniors will lose their drug benefits
if the Clinton plan is enacted. Citizens for Better Medicare urges
a ``bipartisan approach'' that would leave coverage of the cost of
prescription drugs in the hands of private insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the group is little more than a front organization
for the drug industry, which they say is lobbying to kill drug
benefits while also offering a vague compromise plan that has
little support in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they're all for better Medicare, but the point is
this is a very, very deceptive campaign,'' said Rep. Rosa DeLauro,
D-Conn. ``Look at their name: these are not citizens, they are not
for a better Medicare. This is a pharmaceutical industry front
group, pure and simple. Their interest is to distort the issue and
frighten the elderly rather than have a debate on an affordable
drug coverage for seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   Timothy C. Ryan, the executive director of Citizens for Better
Medicare, acknowledged that the majority of the group's money comes
from drug makers, but he said the aim of the group was not to
thwart legislation, only to ensure that any drug plan would not
create a costly new bureaucracy or lead to government price
controls on medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately this is a philosophical debate about whether you
stand for greater or lesser government control as we devise a plan
to help seniors better afford their medicines,'' Ryan said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that while Citizens for Better Medicare and the
pharmaceutical companies oppose Democratic plans for drug coverage,
they are not fully supportive of the Republican alternative,
either. That plan would provide subsidies for the elderly to
purchase private prescription drug insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would like to see comprehensive reform,'' Ryan said. ``In
an election year with a lot at stake, that seems unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for Better Medicare describes itself on its Web site as
a broad-based coalition of ``patients, seniors, pharmaceutical
research companies, doctors, caregivers, hospitals, employers and
health care experts.'' The group lists more than 40 members,
including the well-known National Association of Manufacturers and
the United States Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Lesser-known members include the Alliance for Aging Research;
the Alliance for Lung Cancer Advocacy, Support and Education; the
Association of Black Cardiologists; the Healthcare Marketing and
Communications Council, and the Kidney Cancer Association. All
receive substantial support from drug companies, according to a
study published last week by Public Citizen, a group founded by
Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for Better Medicare was established as the lobbying and
grass-roots organizing arm of the Pharmaceutical Research and
Manufacturers Association. Last year, Ryan left the association,
where he served as marketing director, to lead Citizens for Better
Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a phony coalition when it was started, and it's a phony
coalition now,'' said Martin A. Corry, director of federal affairs
for the American Association of Retired Persons. ``They were
created by the pharmaceutical industry and are almost entirely
funded by the pharmaceutical industry. They're not fooling
anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The group was set up under Section 527 of the Internal Revenue
Code, which governs political activity by nonprofit organizations.
It does not have to report its income or divulge its spending, so
long as it sticks to issue advocacy and does not advocate the
election or defeat of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Such groups can accept money from any source, including foreign
corporations and individuals. Several of the biggest members of the
association are the U.S. subsidiaries of European pharmaceutical
concerns, including Bayer A.G., Boehringer Ingelheim
Pharmaceuticals Inc., Glaxo Wellcome PLC, Hoechst Marion Roussel
A.G. and Rhone-Poulenc Rorer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Citizens for Better Medicare is one of the prime targets of
members of Congress who have introduced legislation to require
greater disclosure by so-called 527 groups.
</P>
<P>
   In its advertising, Citizens for Better Medicare has taken aim
at a number of House Democrats who co-sponsored a bill that would
require drug companies to offer discounts to pharmacies for
medicines they sell to Medicare recipients. The advertisements name
Reps. Leonard L. Boswell of Iowa, Darlene Hooley of Oregon, Bill
Luther of Minnesota and Mark Udall of Colorado, but stop short of
telling viewers to vote against them.
</P>
<P>
   But the group reserved particular wrath for Brian Schweitzer of
Montana, a rancher and first-time candidate who is challenging Sen.
Conrad Burns, the two-term incumbent Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Schweitzer led a widely publicized bus trip of
seniors to Canada to dramatize the lower cost of prescription
medicines there. Citizens for Better Medicare responded with an
advertisement broadcast across Montana. ``Brian Schweitzer wants
Canadian-style government-controlled health care on prescription
medications here in America,'' the narrator intoned. ``Tell Brian
Schweitzer no thanks.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan called Schweitzer's bus trip a ``stunt'' and said that the
drug industry wanted to explain that drugs were cheaper in Canada
because Canada imposes price controls under its national health
system.
</P>
<P>
   But Schweitzer said the industry's tactic backfired, increasing
his name recognition and creating a groundswell of support.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was clear what they were trying to do _ prop up the failing
re-election bid of Conrad Burns,'' Schweitzer said in a telephone
interview. He estimated that Citizens for Better Medicare has spent
between $500,000 and $750,000 in radio and television advertising
in Montana, including $60,000 in radio advertisements last week
alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they think they're going to fool the people of Montana,
they don't know Montanans,'' said Schweitzer. ``If they think
they're going to scare Brian Schweitzer, they don't know Brian
Schweitzer. This is one rancher in Montana who's getting pretty
damn mad.''

ACLU SUES MICHIGAN, CITING BIAS IN GIVING COLLEGE AID 
</HEADLINE>
   By NICHOLE M. CHRISTIAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The American Civil Liberties Union accused the state
of Michigan Tuesday of discriminating against minority students by
awarding thousands of merit scholarships solely on the basis of
standardized state test scores.
</P>
<P>
   In the lawsuit, filed in federal district court in Detroit, ACLU
lawyers asked that the state be prevented from using scores from
the Michigan Educational Assessment Program to award onetime
scholarships of up to $2,500 to college-bound high school seniors.
The lawsuit said the practice violated Title VI of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
   The group also wants a judge to order the Michigan Merit Award
Scholarship Program to re-evaluate students who were denied awards
this year and to include other gauges such as grade point averages
and extracurricular activities in its selection process. The ACLU
filed its suit Tuesday on behalf of five high school graduates, all
minorities, who failed to receive passing scores on the reading,
writing, science and math exams that make up the voluntary Michigan
test.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU maintains that the Michigan test is flawed because
students in poor schools rarely receive the same amount of
preparation for the tests as student from wealthier districts and
private schools ``This is not an attack on the MEAP test,'' the
executive director of the Michigan ACLU, Kary Moss, said in a news
conference. ``What it is an attack on is the misuse of the MEAP. By
using the MEAP test alone, the state is essentially punishing
students for the schools they attend.''
</P>
<P>
   This fall, the state plans to give more than $100 million to
colleges and universities that have accepted the roughly 40,000
Michigan high school students who won scholarships. While states
are increasingly tying grade promotion and graduation to student
test scores, Michigan is considered the only one in the country to
base college tuition scholarships solely on test scores. Experts
say most states use a combination of measures in awarding tuition.
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU's lawsuit, which comes at a time of intense national
debate over standards in education and the use of test scores,
could set a precedent, much like a 1989 case in New York state. In
that case, a federal judge forbade officials to use SAT scores to
award the prestigious Regents and Empire scholarships, and the
ACLU's Women's Rights Project said that girls were
disproportionately discriminated against.
</P>
<P>
   ``A defeat in Michigan should stop other potential test-score
abusers in their tracks,'' said Robert Schaeffer, public education
director for the National Center for Fair and Open Testing, a
nonprofit advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   State officials insisted that the test scores offer a clear
picture of academic achievement. ``A two-point grade average is not
the same in every school,'' said state Treasurer Mark Murray, whose
office administers the program. ``We have a uniform, unbiased
assessment instrument that is the same in every school. No student
has an advantage or disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   The program is paid for with money from the state's settlement
with tobacco manufacturers. Students who attend Michigan schools
are eligible for $2,500 in aid, while those who go out of state
receive $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   To further ensure equal access to a scholarship, Murray said
students who fail the test have two chances to retake it, and can
qualify by passing two of the four sections of the MEAP and
receiving at least a 24 on the ACT or 1170 on the SAT. The program
was created by the Legislature in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Heller, an assistant professor of education at the
University of Michigan who spent a year researching the
legislation's impact, said such allowances do little to close the
gap. Based on his research, he said one in three white students who
took all four of the tests in spring of 1999 received a
scholarship, whereas only one in 14 African-Americans, and one in
five Hispanics and Indians, received awards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michigan is the only state that uses a test like the MEAP test
as the sole criterion for awarding these scholarships,'' he said.
``In all other state measures such as high school rank, grade point
average or those in combination with a test like the SAT or ACT are
used to determine who is awarded these scholarships.''
</P>
<P>
   The ACLU lawsuit was based in part on Heller's research, which
was conducted independently months before the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vast majority of these awards are likely to go to students
who would have attended college anyway,'' Heller said.
</P>
<P>
   After maintaining a 3.45 grade point average through high school
and graduating sixth in her class at Beecher High School in Flint,
Mich., Bianca Kelly was certain that she would be selected as a
Michigan Merit Scholar. Even after learning she had scored a 19 on
the ACT and passed all but one of the MEAP tests _ science _ she
thought her record and extracurricular activities would help snare
an award. After all, Howard University had found reason enough to
accept her.
</P>
<P>
   But Michigan's scholarship program did not.
</P>
<P>
   Bianca is applying for loans and depending on help from her
family to pay tuition, room and board at Howard. ``It's just that I
worked so hard and it's like it still wasn't good enough,'' she
said.

   SPINBALDAK, Afghanistan _ Bargain hunters, perhaps it is time to
consider a shopping trip to Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, it is a shlep, requiring a journey across Iran or
over the rugged mountains of the Hindu Kush or through the steep
gorges of the Khyber Pass.
</P>
<P>
   But in a place called Spinbaldak _ in the flat, desert terrain
near the Pakistani border _ there are ever-so-cheap cars,
television sets, stereos and cameras.
</P>
<P>
   Entire stores carry nothing but motor oil from England or sewing
machines from Japan or wheel rims from just about anywhere. There
are great deals on Vaseline Hair Tonic and Palmolive Shampoo. For
those who prefer to buy in bulk, there are sets of 72 Duralex
French tumblers, 10-packs of Sony tape cassettes and bars of Lux
soap by the gross.
</P>
<P>
   Spinbaldak is like a Price Club crossed with a Salvation Army
Store and a flea market. There are about 100 shops, each one spare
and decidedly inelegant. Most are merely open cargo containers _ 10
feet wide and 20 feet deep. There is no electricity. The climate
control seems stuck on the notch that calls for a dust storm.
</P>
<P>
   But service is friendly. ``Sprechen Sie Deutsch?'' called out
one merchant, Abdul Qadir. ``No? OK, I speak a little English, too.
And I give you the best deals.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, Qadir trades in television sets, which are banned
by the Taliban militia, rulers of most of the country. But his
customers are not Afghans. They are usually Pakistanis and Iranians
here to buy on the cheap for themselves or for resale back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you like?'' asked Qadir, a tall, persistent man standing
before two rows of televisions stacked eye-high, perhaps 70 in all.
``Samsung, Panasonic, Toshiba? Here look, I sell you a 29-inch Sony
for 10,000 rupees'' (about $200).
</P>
<P>
   There are some hitches to buying appliances in Spinbaldak, and
these became apparent as the sales pitch went on. ``I guarantee you
that 80 percent of my televisions work,'' Qadir said. ``And the
rest, easy to fix. No problem.''
</P>
<P>
   While the soap sold here is brand new, the appliances and cars
are all used. These are goods discarded by Japanese families and
gathered in large quantities by traders. They are then shipped to
Dubai in the United Arab Emirates and hauled into Afghanistan by
truck.
</P>
<P>
   The small-time merchants of Spinbaldak buy the wares by the
container-full, either on their own or with partners. They sell the
merchandise just as they bought it, unaware of whether it
functions. In this part of the world, repairs are cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, there was no shortage of customers, but the new
military government in Pakistan seems to be unusually serious about
collecting customs duties at the border.
</P>
<P>
   In Spinbaldak, a three-hour drive from any sizable city, this
surge in enforcement is a bother. More border guards means more
people who must be bribed. Customers pass a far longer gantlet of
open palms.
</P>
<P>
   These greedy men in uniforms can be avoided by employing a
smuggler. Men with donkeys will carry just about anything along
more discreet trails. But this does add to the buyer's expense,
about $60 extra on that $200 television purchase. At the same time,
the condition of an appliance is unlikely to improve while it is
strapped to the back of a donkey.
</P>
<P>
   ``May I show you a camera?'' asked Abdul Bari, whose shop is
more eclectic than the others, filled with hair dryers, clocks,
ashtrays, motorcycle helmets and toaster ovens.
</P>
<P>
   He opened a large suitcase full of cameras, displayed in a heap
like ties at an end-of-the-season sale. ``For Nikon, I usually
charge more,'' he said amiably. ``But for you, my friend, the price
is the same, and I will give you one that will work for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the way, Gul Khan was selling sewing machines. By his
guess, 90 percent were broken. ``But you cannot go wrong,'' he
said. ``I'll sell you this machine for 250 rupees'' _ $5 _ ``and if
you are worried about spare parts, you can buy two more at the same
price.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taliban are popular here. Indeed, when they began their
conquest of the country in 1994 they received financial support
from big traders who wanted the highways cleared of brigands. The
Taliban have made travel in Afghanistan safe again, and they, in
turn, make a hefty sum taxing cross-country shipments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Taliban, robbers would not only steal your vehicle,
they'd take your money and maybe even your clothes,'' said Amir
Muhammad, an auto dealer.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad and his several associates run a car lot. The autos are
all used Japanese models. They were bought from traders in Dubai
who have a take-it-or-leave-it attitude. They allow the cars to be
started but not driven.
</P>
<P>
   He had a 1995 Toyota Land Cruiser on sale for a modest $5,600.
The interior was clean. The tires had treads. The engine operated
without a cough.
</P>
<P>
   But was it a good vehicle?
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad considered the question. ``If you want a cheap car,
this is the right place,'' he said bluntly. ``If you want a perfect
car, maybe you should go somewhere else.''

CAPRIATI FINDS HER FORM WITH HELP FROM HER FIRST COACH, HER
FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Belgium, France, Australia, the Netherlands)   By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ A bewildered Jennifer Capriati once
searched out a coach capable of salvaging the confidence she had
lost during the haze of her dysfunctional disappearance from
tennis. With her spirits in a puddle, she found a faith healer of
sorts in Harold Solomon to push her through a remarkable revival
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But he was not in the friends box of Court 1 Tuesday afternoon.
In mid-April, Capriati parted with Solomon, began a romance with a
talented but underachieving Belgian player, Xavier Malisse, and let
her discipline to diet slip. But with her ranking tumbling from
13th to 18th, and after a disturbing first-round exit in the French
Open, she did not reach for Solomon again to right her.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati turned to a familiar face. After she panted just a bit
Tuesday while overpowering 16th-seeded Dominique Van Roost, 6-2,
6-4, with fuel-injected ground strokes, Capriati stopped lumbering
and waved at a coach who once appeared to be part creator of her
dark teen-age funk: her husky father, Stefano. With him, she will
try to reinvent yet another comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one thing I've learned, how to come back from feeling
down or not so confident,'' Capriati said. ``I can always get it
back, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, ``always'' seems to run out. But for this second day
of Wimbledon _ which left Andre Agassi and Lindsay Davenport, both
seeded second, with victories made simpler when their opponents
retired with injuries _ two players once branded as the next hot
items in American tennis had a chance to keep hope alive.
</P>
<P>
   At age 24, Capriati pulled off an upset in the first round, as
did the 23-year-old Jan-Michael Gambill. With herky-jerky forehands
and backhands, the 56th-ranked Gambill swiped the gloss off
Australia's paparazzi target, seventh-seeded Lleyton Hewitt, with a
6-3, 6-2, 7-5 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Gambill was once just like the 19-year-old Hewitt: fresh,
handsome and all the rage. Just one week removed from undoing Pete
Sampras at Queen's Club and several days into a news media frenzy,
Hewitt was facing high expectations. Gambill remembers the hype
well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tough to live up to what we have to live up to,
frankly,'' said Gambill, referring to his generation of players.
``Pete has done unbelievable. If I somehow make it to anywhere near
that level, I'd be very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gambill never wavered against Hewitt. With unshakable nerves, he
came up with 5 break points in 11 opportunities. When Hewitt had an
opening for a break, he sprayed the ball and converted just one of
six. It was odd to see Hewitt so flat. Normally, the buoyant
Australian can manufacture enough positive energy to overcome
pressure situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just had one of those days,'' he said. ``There wasn't much
to get pumped up about.''
</P>
<P>
   Agassi was different in his ability to come with an edge on
call. He was playing against a qualifier, the American Taylor Dent,
who was ranked 256th but very capable of unveiling the game of his
life on Center Court. At least for half an hour. With volleys that
kissed the baselines, a 130-mile-an-hour serve that generated eight
aces and with pinpoint approach shots, Dent unsettled a crowd
assembled to rave about Steffi Graf's domed beau. In 24 minutes,
Dent had the first set, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, Agassi sharpened his focus and took a 2-6, 6-3, 6-0,
4-0 lead when Dent left the court after falling awkwardly on his
right knee. In Dent's wake, there was a question: is this unknown
19-year-old from California, the son of the former Australian Davis
Cup player Phil Dent, another American hope?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always hard to say,'' Agassi said. ``There's a lot you
need to have to succeed out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Having just the right support group is as critical as having the
tools. Capriati appeared to have just the right mix with Solomon.
Fresh off her success at the U.S. Open, she zipped through the draw
at the Australian Open. On her way to the semifinals, she was
effusive about the miracles Solomon had worked on her will. Then,
everything changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not always going to last forever, be a forever thing,''
Capriati said. ``Just one of those things. We didn't see things,
you know, the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Some on the tour wonder if Capriati's budding romance started
taking priority over her practice schedule and suspect Malisse's
spotty work ethic as a player has rubbed off on her. Whatever the
case, Solomon has been dropped, and her father has stepped in at
the controls again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just that he's known my game ever since, well, he started
me playing,'' Capriati said. ``Really, just he knows, I guess, the
way to tell me things. He just says the little things here and
there the simple way he knows that will make me really understand
it.'' MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Six seeded players were upset Tuesday. Beyond Dominique Van
Roost and Lleyton Hewitt, 13th-seeded Amelia Mauresmo lost to
47th-ranked Gala Leon Garcia, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5; seventh-seeded
Nathalie Tauziat was beaten by 31st-ranked Kim Clijsters, 6-3, 3-6,
6-2; Tommy Haas upset his fellow German Nicolas Kiefer, seeded
13th, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, 6-3; and Julie Halard-Decugis, the 14th-seeded
woman, lost to Kristie Boogert , 7-6 (4), 0-6, 6-1. . . . Lindsay
Davenport was in an uncomfortable position when her friend and
doubles partner, Corina Morariu, slipped in the second set of their
first-round match. Morariu lost her footing, fell to the grass and
injured her left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when she was testing her sore back and getting good
results, Davenport was in control, 6-3, 1-0, when Morariu retired,
but she felt uneasy with the way her victory came about. ``It's
very bittersweet,'' Davenport said. ``It's good I won the first set
with two breaks. I was going to have break point at the beginning
of the second, but then when something like that happens to a good
friend, it's terrible.'' &QL;

RE-EXAMINING THE IDEA OF SCHOOL UNIFORMS

<P>
   LONG BEACH, Calif. _ For Carl Cohn, the path to educational
innovation began a decade ago on a gritty Long Beach street when a
few dozen children, caught in the middle of a gang shootout, were
forced to the floor of a school bus.
</P>
<P>
   Cohn was a former truant officer in this heavily industrialized
port city adjacent to Los Angeles, and in the wake of that
lawlessness he was asked to head an antigang task force. Its
principal aim was, like that of some U.N. peacekeeping missions, to
protect noncombatants, known elsewhere as primary school students.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to give safe passage for students through some very
tricky terrain,'' said Cohn, now the superintendent of schools
here. ``We realized the way to make it visible who the students
were was clothing, uniforms. We didn't think about all the other
issues. It was safety, pure and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   It was an unusual start for what came to be hailed as a major
step in helping to reinvigorate public education, not just here but
across the country. In 1994, Long Beach mandated uniforms at all
its elementary schools after trials at a couple of schools. Test
scores and grades rose. Absenteeism, failures and discipline
problems declined. Schools in more than 35 states have now adopted
uniforms policies, with Philadelphia scheduled to adopt such a
policy this fall.
</P>
<P>
   But it is worth recalling the sobering origins of that success
as Long Beach takes the next step, completing the introduction of
uniforms at its first high school. The school district that helped
push school uniforms to the front lines has now pulled them back,
if slightly, as a tool.
</P>
<P>
   Woodrow Wilson High School, to which students must apply for
entry, has phased uniforms in one year at a time, and next year,
students in all grades will be wearing khaki bottoms and burgundy
or white collared shirts. But a visit to the school and
conversations with administrators, parents and students reveal a
subtle appreciation for the limitations as well as the merits of
uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, if uniforms mean uniformity, these are a failure.
The school allows the students to fulfill the requirements in many
ways. They can wear trousers, skirts, baggy shorts or capri pants
on the bottom, and a range of tops on condition they are white or
burgundy and have collars.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Meyer, the school's co-principal, said the administrators
chose loose standards to allow older students to express themselves
while minimizing the potentially divisive effects of dress, like
designating gang affiliation or economic differences. He is even
toying with eliminating a rule requiring students to keep their
shirts tucked in in the classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The point, Meyer said, is that they have found uniforms just one
of several tools for refocusing the school, and, he insisted, they
require complete support by parents and students.
</P>
<P>
   `It's not the answer, but it contributes,'' he said. `I don't
think that the uniform alone does a whole lot, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, there have been improvements. Three years ago, the
school had 861 suspensions. This past year, there were 280.
</P>
<P>
   And that is not just because the school began a policy three
years ago that students apply to get in. Despite that, the student
body still represents a cross section of the city. Well over a half
of the students come from families with incomes below the poverty
line, said Keith Hansen, the assistant principal, and 350 of the
students speak English as a second language.
</P>
<P>
   But the real issue is that uniforms were just the most visible
of several reforms introduced. Students are required to take more
credits, including four years of a foreign language, math, science
and English. They must maintain a 2.0, or C, average.
</P>
<P>
   Noelle Ebright, who will begin her senior year at Wilson in the
fall and was the student government president last year, said of
uniforms, ``They aggravate me more than they help me.'' But she
added that they appeared to have cut down on the number of fights.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Flanary, a senior administrator at the National
Association of Secondary School Principals, in Arlington, Va., said
the limited amount of research on the subject had placed only
modest emphasis on uniforms as a way of turning around a troubled
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no direct link between uniforms and performance,''
Flanary said, ``but we know there is a link between the school
environment and performance. Uniforms might be one way of affecting
the environment, but just one.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even with their expectations moderated, Long Beach
officials are believers, if well-informed believers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, it's a very good question as to whether five or seven
years from now uniforms will still be a priority,'' Cohn said.
``There is a part of me that says if we really want to grow these
young people into young adults, it is, in fact, their behavior that
will really mark them, not what they wear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having said that, these are difficult times. And there is the
reality that there is something to be gained if these young people
spend less time paying attention to their dress.''

CONDE NAST CLOSING WOMEN'S SPORTS &AMP; FITNESS MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After less than four years of publication, Women's
Sports &AMP; Fitness, an enthusiast magazine for women that was perhaps
best known for featuring the volleyball player Gabrielle Reece on
its cover more times than any other magazine in the world _ will
cease publication with the September issue.
</P>
<P>
   The move signals a continued trend toward watching the bottom
line at Conde Nast, which publishes Women's Sports. In March, S.I.
Newhouse Jr., chairman of Conde Nast and its parent, Advance
Publications, announced that he would temporarily shut Details
magazine, a magazine for young men, and transfer it to Fairchild
Publications, which Advance bought last summer, for a makeover.
</P>
<P>
   The demise of Women's Sports came one day after EMAP Petersen
announced that it will cease publication of Sport magazine, a
general-interest monthly that has been published since 1946.
</P>
<P>
   From the first issue in 1997, Women's Sports &AMP; Fitness ambled
from one editorial identity to another. First titled Conde Nast
Women's Sports &AMP; Fitness, the magazine changed its name to Women's
Sports &AMP; Fitness in 1998. Its publication schedule went from
monthly to every other month and then back.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine recently raised its rate base _ the circulation
guaranteed to advertisers _ to 650,000, but Conde Nast executives
said the additional circulation was acquired through off-price
subscription offers and was not reliable over the long term.
Overall circulation grew by 9.9 percent for the six-month period
ended Dec. 31, but newsstand sales fell by 3.9 percent during the
same period, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   James Truman, Conde Nast's editorial director and the editor who
conceived of the idea for a women's sports magazine, said that
Women's Sports never found an audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt we were publishing a very good magazine, and we had
been really holding on with it for a long time, 18 months,'' he
said. ``We kept hoping the audience would materialize, but it did
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Advertising pages were up _ by 41.9 percent through July to 346
pages, according to Mediaweek Magazine _ but not sufficiently.
Advertisers never flocked to the title, citing its lack of focus.
Lucy Schulte Danziger, the magazine's editor in chief, said Tuesday
that she would resign.

<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ In a pointed rejection of President Robert
Mugabe, voters here have taken away what was his governing party's
almost unchallenged authority in Parliament by electing a powerful,
new opposition party to more than a third of the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Counting in the closely watched election ended early Wednesday
with the new party winning 57 seats in the 150-member Parliament, a
share large enough to prevent Mugabe's party from unilaterally
changing the constitution, as it has been able to do for more than
a decade.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Mugabe's party has controlled all but three seats in
Parliament, giving it virtually unlimited power over lawmaking and
governance. His party, the Zimbabwe African National
Union-Patriotic Front, will still control a majority of seats. But
analysts agree that the election this past weekend will inevitably
reshape legislative politics here, introducing consultation and
negotiation into a chamber that has rarely needed or allowed it.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech broadcast on national television Tuesday night,
Mugabe promised to deal with the new opposition as lawmakers
wrestle with the nation's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to working with the new Parliament as together
we grapple with the pressing challenges of improving the livelihood
of our people and developing our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   And as supporters of the nine-month old opposition party cheered
their victory Tuesday, honking horns and dancing in impromptu
sidewalk celebrations, other government officials also admitted
that the world they knew had dramatically changed. After years of
apathy, frustrated urban voters had finally turned their backs on a
governing party that had failed to focus on the issues of
joblessness, soaring inflation and government corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there are diverse voices, the government of the day is on
its toes,'' said Jonathan Moyo, a spokesman for the governing
party, known as ZANU-PF. ``And there is no doubt that for the next
five years we are going to be on our toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe's party won only 62 of the 120 contested seats, most of
them in rural areas where the party's support has traditionally
been strongest, the final tallies showed. (Under the constitution,
the public elects only 120 of the 150 members of Parliament. The
president appoints 20 members. And local chiefs select the other
10.)
</P>
<P>
   The opposition party, the Movement for Democratic Change, won
its seats in lopsided victories in the country's urban centers.
Almost overnight, the party, known as the MDC, became the most
powerful opposition force in Zimbabwe's history.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference Tuesday morning, the party's leader, Morgan
Tsvangirai, generally praised the weekend's peaceful voting. But he
said his party is also carefully scrutinizing the results and is
considering challenging the count in about 20 races.
</P>
<P>
   The races include those in which the MDC had lost by a margin of
500 or less and those in which intimidation and political violence,
which has claimed at least 26 lives since March, may have
influenced the vote. Tsvangirai, who lost his race for Parliament,
plans to challenge the result in his own district.
</P>
<P>
   Once that is resolved, Tsvangirai said he would turn his
attention to running for president in the year 2002, facing off
against Mugabe, 76, if Mugabe chooses to run again. And in the
meantime, he urged people to work together across party line to
rebuild trust and to improve the unraveling economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Zimbabweans have to learn to work together,'' said Tsvangirai,
reflecting on what has been a bitter and divisive campaign, as the
cameras flashed and the television cameras rolled. ``This election
result means that neither Zanu-PF nor President Mugabe can go it
alone.''
</P>
<P>
   It has certainly been one of the most extraordinary political
campaigns in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in this nation's 20-year history, opposition
candidates contested all 120 parliamentary seats that are up for
election, riding a wave of voter frustration and anxiety. For the
first time, dozens of politicians defected from Mugabe's party to
run as independent candidates, many of them men in their 30s and
40s who saw little future for themselves in a party still dominated
by aging freedom fighters.
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time ever, the white minority, which still
controls much of the economy here, woke up from years of political
hibernation to bankroll the MDC, allowing the fledgling party to
wage a successful campaign, which was critical since the party had
virtually no access to government controlled media.
</P>
<P>
   The unprecedented political activity owes much to growing public
frustration over Mugabe's often iron-fisted style of governance,
the unraveling economy and government corruption. And for many
whites, the government's increasingly hostile racial rhetoric and
support of the recent spate of land invasions became increasingly
intolerable.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the past decade, the percentage of people living in poverty
has surged to more than 60 percent from 40 percent. Wages have
fallen to pre-independence levels. The government can no longer pay
creditors, buy adequate fuel or supply medicines to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   And by early this year, it was clear that Mugabe, who was once
revered for expanding access for the entire population to schools
and clinics during his first decade in power, was no longer
unassailable. In February, in an astonishing rebuke to the ruling
party, the nation voted against a constitutional referendum that
would have expanded President Mugabe's power.
</P>
<P>
   And this weekend, energized by frustrations with what had
virtually become a one-party state, voters turned out in heavy
numbers. Election officials estimate that about 60 percent of the
5.8 million registered voters went to 120 polling stations on
Saturday and Sunday, up from about 26 percent in the parliamentary
elections of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Voters also ousted several of Mugabe's cabinet ministers,
including Simon Moyo, the tourism minister, Thenjiwe Lesabe, the
job creation minister and Sydney Sekeramayi, the security minister.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In their places, voters elected opposition candidates and
political novices who had experienced the hardships of ordinary
people. Among the newly elected is Evelyn Masaiti, 35, a high
school science teacher who struggles to feed her family and was
repeatedly intimidated and attacked by supporters of the governing
party.
</P>
<P>
   Benni Tumbare Mutasa, 44, runs a local butchery and beauty
salon, and can no longer afford to buy spare parts for his trucks.
Tafadzwa Musekiwa, 24, is a university graduate who has been unable
to find a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel over the moon,'' Musekiwa said Tuesday. ``All night
yesterday, I didn't sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe had campaigned heavily on the pledge that he would make
good on his promise to redistribute fertile land, which is still
mostly owned by the tiny white minority here. He supported the
invasions of hundreds of white-owned farms by black squatters and
was widely blamed for supporting the waves of political violence.
He repeatedly disparaged opposition party members as puppets of the
whites.
</P>
<P>
   Mugabe seemed more than ready Tuesday night to reconcile.
Prominent members of his party are already admitting that they will
have to change their message and, perhaps, reshuffle their ranks to
appeal to a younger and increasingly urban population.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech Tuesday night, Mugabe said, ``There is a great
expectation in our country, around the land, which is still to come
to our people in a big way, and around the economy, which is going
through a bad patch and for which lasting answers will have to be
found.''
</P>
<P>
   For many ordinary people in this country, that is the message
they have been longing to hear.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is important at the end of the day is that they solve our
problems, whoever is in charge,'' said Edwin Ncube, 47, an
accountant, who voted for the MDC this weekend. ``All we want to
see is the economy picking up, life getting better.''

TV NOTES: `SURVIVOR' AND CBS  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ``Survivor'' connection to CBS News will be extended next
week when the news magazine program ``48 Hours'' broadcasts a
segment featuring two of that adventure show's contestants in an
edition devoted to the subject ``The Price of Fame.''
</P>
<P>
   The segment, which will offer a profile of two of the people who
signed up to compete for a $1 million prize on ``Survivor,'' the
hit CBS summer series, will be one of four reports on the program
exploring the lengths to which Americans are willing to go to to
achieve some measure of fame. The program, normally seen on
Thursday nights at 10, is to run as a special next Wednesday at 10.
There will also be a Thursday edition.
</P>
<P>
   That Wednesday is the same night that ``Survivor'' will be
broadcasting its fifth episode at 8, leading in directly to the
first episode of CBS' other heavily publicized summer reality
series, ``Big Brother,'' at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Both shows have already become closely tied to CBS News, mainly
through regular features on ``The Early Show.'' The news announcer
from that show, Julie Chen, will participate directly in ``Big
Brother,'' supplying the voice that will tell the contestants in
the competition which one of them has been banished each week.
</P>
<P>
   Chen's role in ``Big Brother'' has initiated concerns within
some quarters of CBS News that ratings concerns are eliminating
barriers between news and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Zirinsky, the executive producer of ``48 Hours,'' said
that the ``Survivor'' segment on her news program had nothing to do
with a network-wide promotional push for the reality shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody from the entertainment division suggested I do this,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that she had long planned to do a show on fame and
that the ``Survivor'' participants seemed a natural fit with that
theme. ``These are people who agreed to go to this island because
they are lusting after fame,'' Zirinsky said. ``We're looking to
answer the question: Why are these people willing to do these
things?''
</P>
<P>
   The idea for the fame program began, Zirinsky said, when a ``48
Hours'' crew was following an 11-year-old singer, Sammie Bush. The
program trailed him for a year, during which he did in fact emerge
as a young singing sensation.
</P>
<P>
   The program will also present profiles of the actors who starred
in the award winning ``Whass-up?'' commercials for Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
   Almost inevitably, Zirinsky is also including an interview with
Darva Conger, who exploded into fame on the year's most discredited
reality show, ``Who Wants To Marry a Multi-Millionaire?'' and then
spent months disdaining that performance in interview and is now
topping off the collision with fame by appearing nude in Playboy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People seem to believe they have an inalienable right to be
famous,'' Zirinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the chances that her program might be accused of being
swept up in the ``Survivor'' tidal wave sweeping CBS, Zirinsky
said: ``I don't think that would be fair. We're doing an honest
deal here on fame. I still believe in the total separation of
church and state.''

<P>
   POKEMON, UNCHOSEN
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon, it seems, may not be immune to children's very rapid
aging process, in which 1.5 adult years can be equal to, say, 86
kiddie years.
</P>
<P>
   Following the fizzles of the Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles and
the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers crazes, there are signs that the
appetite for all things Pokemon, once considered insatiable, is
starting to subside.
</P>
<P>
   One bellwether: Quarterly ratings figures released Tuesday show
that viewership is shrinking for ``Pokemon,'' the cartoon show
based on the Nintendo video game that runs at various times
throughout the week on the WB network.
</P>
<P>
   According to the latest figures, the audience for the show's
flagship broadcast on Saturdays at 10 a.m. was 1.8 million strong
during the second quarter of 2000, down by nearly 1 million viewers
from the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the household audience for the 9 a.m. Saturday showing
of the cartoon was down by nearly 1 million viewers compared with
its February debut in that time slot. Ratings for the 4 p.m.
weekday broadcasts were off a bit as well.
</P>
<P>
   One thing WB executives can tell their sponsors is that the
second quarter includes some of those lazy days in June when school
is out and youngsters are soaking in the sun rather than the
cathode rays of the television.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the show did not have the same sort of audience declines for
from the first to second quarters in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   That is delighting executives at other networks that run
children's programming, especially Nickelodeon, the cable channel
that had held first place on Saturday mornings for two years until
``Pokemon'' came on strong in the fall and helped WB take it over.
</P>
<P>
   With the show's decline, Nickelodeon's ``Rugrats'' has reclaimed
its place as the No. 1 show in children's television, returning
Nickelodeon to its former state of Saturday morning glory.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at WB said they believed that they had nothing to
fear and that ``Pokemon'' would continue to show strength.
</P>
<P>
   On July 21 Warner Brothers will release the second Pokemon
movie. When the first feature was released last year, it did
extremely well and helped the entire Pokemon franchise. The WB
executives said that they believed the same thing would happen this
year and that the film would help their ratings into the fall.

<P>
   CHALLENGE TO CNN
</P>
<P>
   The 24-hour cable news competition, it appears, is continuing to
close in on CNN, which, until the mid-1990s, was the only national
all-news network.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC, the financial network, was watched in more homes per day
than CNN during the second quarter of 2000, representing the first
quarterly ratings period in which that has happened. CNBC was
watched in an average of 280,000 homes per day compared with
253,000 for CNN from April through late June, according to Nielsen
Media Research statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, CNN faced increased competition from the Fox News
Channel. Its household audience grew by 20 percent, an average
132,000 households, between the second quarter of 1999 and the
second quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   During that same period CNN's audience decreased by 35 percent,
marking its worst second quarter in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   CNN executives, who recently celebrated the channel's 20th
anniversary, have been contending with reports about their ratings
for some time now and have blamed the figures on a slow news
period.
</P>
<P>
   They have maintained that Fox and CNBC have separate reasons for
their audience gains. While the overall news cycle is slow, there
has been plenty of significant financial news for CNBC. And Fox's
20 percent growth in audience coincides with a 22 percent gain in
subscribing households.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, MSNBC is in 14 percent more households than it was
last year, yet its audience was 17 percent smaller.
</P>
<P>
   CNN did have some positive news: It had 19 of the top 20
most-watched programs among all-news channels during the period.

VIACOM WRESTS WRESTLING SHOWS OFF USA CABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL CARTER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most popular weekly programs on cable television, hourlong
wrestling shows produced by World Wrestling Federation
Entertainment Inc., will leave the USA cable network in the fall
and move to cable channels owned by Viacom as a result of a
decision Tuesday in a Delaware court.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which awarded the rights to WWF programs to Viacom
based on a higher bid that the court said USA had not matched as
required by its contract, was widely seen as a serious blow to USA
Networks Inc., which had sued to try to prevent Viacom from buying
away the five hours of wrestling shows that have been carried on
USA.
</P>
<P>
   Sumner Redstone, the chairman of Viacom, said, ``This is a much
more important victory for us than most people know.'' In
particular, he said, the shift will benefit the TNN cable channel,
which was previously owned by CBS and is now part of Viacom's MTV
Networks. The channel, once known as The Nashville Network, had
mainly been known for programming oriented to country music fans.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom plans to revamp TNN programming in the coming television
season, and wrestling will be the biggest part of that improvement,
Redstone said.
</P>
<P>
   Among other WWF programs, two Monday night wrestling shows,
``Raw Is War'' and ``Live Wire,'' which are routinely watched more
than any other shows on cable television, will shift to TNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will surely mean a big increase in the distribution of
the channel,'' Redstone said. ``TNN has not been in the same class
as other MTV networks, and now it clearly will be. As a result of
this and other programming we plan for that channel, TNN will
become a much more valuable asset for Viacom.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss of wrestling may have the opposite effect on USA,
though the channel's executives took pains Tuesday to try to play
down the effect on the channel. In a statement, Stephen Chao, the
president of USA Cable said, ``We would have preferred a different
decision but, as we said, the loss of the WWF will have a
negligible effect on our ratings and a positive effect on our
profits.''
</P>
<P>
   USA executive had previously tried to argue that wrestling was
not all that important to the USA channel because other programming
could replace it and because it was never as profitable as its
ratings would seem to indicate because the wrestling company itself
took most of the advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Chao, nor Barry Diller, the chairman of USA Networks,
nor any other USA executive would comment further, said Ron Sado, a
USA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But one executive involved in the lawsuit noted that USA
executives had testified that WWF programming was highly profitable
and amounted to a crown jewel in the schedule because it brought
more viewers to other USA programs.
</P>
<P>
   USA executives have not said what programs will replace
wrestling, though it had previously announced a lineup of potential
new shows including a comedy about warring neighbors and a drama
about female bounty hunters.
</P>
<P>
   The court case centered on USA's contention that it did not have
to match every aspect of a Viacom offer to satisfy a clause in its
contract that allowed its deal with the wrestling company to
continue as long as it matched any new offer.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, USA argued that it should not have to match
promises like promotion on radio and billboards and sale to
international television channels and an agreement not to pre-empt
the wrestling shows regularly, as USA Network had done with
programs like the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show. The decision by
Chancellor William B. Chandler III of Delaware Chancery Court found
that USA was obligated to match on those points, though not on some
others, like carrying a new package of football games being
produced by the wrestling company.
</P>
<P>
   Viacom plans to carry games of the new XFL football league on
TNN on Sunday afternoons as well as on one of its broadcast
outlets, the UPN network, on Sunday nights. It will also shift one
of the WWF wrestling shows, ``Sunday Night Heat,'' to MTV, where it
will have a younger, more rock-music-oriented format.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Viacom has promised to stage WWF events at its
theme parks and to stage pay-per-view wrestling events at its
theaters in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The decision against USA comes at a time of transition in part
of its ownership. USA Networks is 45 percent owned by the Seagram
Corp., which is being acquired by the French media company Vivendi.
One executive close to the deal said Tuesday that the loss of the
wrestling programming was unlikely to have any effect on the
Seagram-Vivendi deal.
</P>
<P>
   Redstone, who has had previous battles with Diller, most notably
a financial battle over the Paramount studio in 1994, which
Redstone also won, said, ``I don't feel badly about winning against
my friend Barry Diller.''

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT MOVES TO BLOCK $115 BILLION WORLDCOM-SPRINT
MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH SCHIESEL   with DAVID LEONHARDT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Justice Department sought to curb the headlong consolidation
of the telecommunications industry Tuesday by moving to block
WorldCom Inc.'s proposed $115 billion acquisition of Sprint Corp.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time in the face of opposition in Europe, WorldCom
and Sprint formally withdrew their deal from consideration by the
European Commission, reserving the option to file again in the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department, while seeking an injunction against the
deal in federal court, cited concerns that the combined company
would stifle competition on the Internet and in the long-distance
telephone industry. Industry executives said the filing probably
doomed the deal, which was agreed to last year and would have
created an Internet powerhouse and the nation's second-largest
long-distance phone company after AT&AMP;T. Two days ago, the European
Commission's top antitrust regulator said he was unlikely to
support the deal, contending that it would place too much Internet
traffic under control of one company.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding their plans, the companies said only that they would
review their options. WorldCom and Sprint could fight the
government in court, but executives from the companies have said in
the past that they would almost surely abandon their deal in the
face of a government suit.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the companies said that while Sprint and
WorldCom remained unlikely to battle the Justice Department through
an entire trial, they might file preliminary objections to the suit
in hopes of reopening negotiations to win approval.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Sprint fell $1.1875, to $58.375, while Worldcom stock
rose $2.1875, to $39.6875.
</P>
<P>
   The attempted merger is the biggest the department has ever
tried to block, dwarfing the previous largest _ the Lockheed Martin
Corp.'s $8.3 billion plan to acquire the Northrop Grumman Corp.,
which would have created a behemoth in the military industry.
Lockheed and Northrop abandoned their pact in 1998 in the face of
the Justice Department's opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's move indicates that the Justice Department intends to
draw limits, even amid the multibillion dollar consolidation in
various sectors of the telecommunications industry, as companies of
all size and description try to expand their geographic and
technical reach.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, AT&AMP;T won conditional approval from the
Federal Communications Commission for its $58 billion acquisition
of MediaOne Group Inc., one of the nation's biggest cable
television companies. And less than two weeks later Bell Atlantic
won the FCC's conditional approval of the company's $53 billion
acquisition of the GTE Corp., a deal that will create the nation's
biggest phone company. In both cases, the Justice Department had
already signed off on the mergers, provided that certain conditions
were met.
</P>
<P>
   One merger still pending antitrust and regulatory review is
America Online Inc.'s proposed $165 billion acquisition of Time
Warner Inc. That deal would create the biggest company in both
traditional and electronic media.
</P>
<P>
   But the America Online-Time Warner deal could have an easier
time with regulators than the WorldCom-Sprint merger, at least on
antitrust grounds. Because Worldcom and Sprint currently compete in
many of the same markets, their merger appears much more vulnerable
to a traditional antitrust challenge than the deal between America
Online and Time Warner, which are not significant competitors in
any of their far-flung operations.

   Antitrust regulators traditionally consider whether a merger
would reduce competition and, as a result, limit customer choices.
In its filing with the U.S. District Court in Washington, the
Justice Department made just such an argument, saying that a
Sprint-WorldCom merger would reduce competition in markets where
the two companies are currently rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This merger threatens to undermine the competitive gains
achieved since the department challenged AT&AMP;T's monopoly 25 years
ago,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said in a statement Tuesday.
``It is critical to our economy that we preserve competition for
services that many of us rely upon in our everyday lives _
long-distance calls, data network services and Internet
connections.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference, Joel Klein, the assistant attorney general
in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division, said that
his main concern about the WorldCom-Sprint deal was that it would
reduce the number of major competitors in the long-distance market
from three to two.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom acquired the MCI Communications Corp. in 1998 and still
uses the MCI brand for some products. AT&AMP;T controls roughly half of
the $80 billion long-distance business while WorldCom currently
controls about 20 percent and Sprint about 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between two and three bidders can be very, very
significant,'' Klein said in an interview. ``They're both on the
tube and in telemarketing to compete for your business. When you
take one of them out, most consumers are aware, that restricts your
options,''
</P>
<P>
   Similar considerations would probably not apply in the America
Online-Time Warner deal, since the companies generally do not
compete in the same markets. The exception is areas where Time
Warner's Roadrunner cable modem Internet-access service competes
against America Online's Internet service over telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sprint-WorldCom is irrelevant to AOL-Time Warner,'' said Scott
Cleland, a regulatory analyst in Washington for the Precursor
Group, an independent research firm. ``WorldCom-Sprint is a very
different sort of merger in that it is a straight horizontal
merger, and AOL-Time Warner is a vertical merger. The horizontal
mergers have a lot of precedents and very clear guidelines.
Vertical mergers have very few guidelines and few standards so it's
much more an unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleland said the closer comparison for AOL-Time Warner would be
the AT&AMP;T-MediaOne deal that the government has already approved.
</P>
<P>
   That comparison is cold comfort for WorldCom.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   People close to WorldCom and Sprint had said last week that the
two companies were considering big concessions _ including a
complete spin-off of Sprint's long-distance telephone business and
Internet operation _ to appease antitrust regulators. But in the
end, the concession offer never came, those people said, because
the Justice Department wanted the companies to also agree to a
spin-off of Sprint's local phone business. WorldCom was reluctant
to agree, while Sprint was adamantly opposed, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Klein refused to discuss details of his negotiations with the
two companies.
</P>
<P>
   WorldCom could consider some concessions because its main goal
in acquiring Sprint was to gain control of Sprint's extensive
wireless telephone network _ a business in which WorldCom has a
negligible presence.
</P>
<P>
   In a terse statement Tuesday, WorldCom said only: ``WorldCom was
advised today that the U.S. Department of Justice intends to file
suit to block WorldCom's proposed merger with Sprint. WorldCom will
promptly review its options with Sprint.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Richard Devlin, Sprint's general counsel, said in a
statement: ``We are disappointed that we have been unable to
convince the Justice Department that the merger is in the best
interest of the American public and would advance competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors Tuesday were already trying to handicap the companies'
next moves. If WorldCom and Sprint do in fact tear up their deal,
WorldCom will still lack a wireless operation and will probably
still seek one.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely candidates are Nextel Communications Inc., based
in Reston, Va., and the VoiceStream Wireless Corp., based in
Bellevue, Wash. Shares of both companies rose Tuesday on
speculation that either could become the next potential target for
WorldCom. Nextel stock rose by $1.4375, to $60.625, while shares of
VoiceStream closed at $126, up $4.875 in Nasdaq trading.
</P>
<P>
   If Sprint remains single, its most likely consolidation partners
appear to be the BellSouth Corp. and Deutsche Telekom of Germany.
BellSouth, the only one of the seven original Baby Bell local phone
companies that has not yet participated in a major merger, lost a
bidding war for Sprint with WorldCom last year.
</P>
<P>
   Deutsche Telekom, meanwhile, has long cast about for entry into
the U.S. market, and until last year was a partner with Sprint in
an international venture called Global One. Each of those
companies, however, could face serious regulatory or legal hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth, as one of the regional Bell companies that emerged
from the breakup of the old American Telephone &AMP; Telegraph Co. in
1984, is currently not allowed to sell long-distance communications
services to customers in its core Southeastern region.
Long-distance, of course, is Sprint's main business.
</P>
<P>
   Under current laws and regulations, Deutsche Telekom, Germany's
main phone company, would probably face few serious hurdles to
acquiring Sprint. But Tuesday, Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C.,
introduced a bill that could block such a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Hollings bill, companies in which foreign governments
own a stake of 25 percent or more would not be allowed to acquire
U.S.-based communications companies. The German government owns 58
percent of Deutsche Telekom.

`TRIXIE': NAIVE DETECTIVE PACKING GOOFY MALAPROPISMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Few filmmakers are as generous toward actors as Alan Rudolph.
That's why they flock to be in his films, even though the chances
of a box office hit are next to nil. Like his actor-friendly
mentor, Robert Altman, Rudolph is a maverick who has always gone
his own way, strewing behind him a filmography (now 17 movies) the
bulk of which might be described as ambitious failures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trixie,'' this director's latest experiment in combining
genres, tantalizingly (and accurately) bills itself as a
``screwball film noir.'' But with its off-kilter mixture of menace
and cornball humor attached to a sketchy, sluggishly paced story
whose holes are left gaping, it is unlikely to break the pattern.
</P>
<P>
   The sad thing is that there is enough to admire about ``Trixie''
to make you wish it were much, much better, but not enough for the
movie to be called even a qualified success. Still, ``Trixie'' is a
comeback of sorts; it isn't half as frustrating as the surreal
sludge Rudolph left behind last year with his impenetrable film
adaptation of Kurt Vonnegut's ``Breakfast of Champions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Trixie'' is above all a showcase for Emily Watson, who appears
in almost every scene as the title character, a saucer-eyed,
virginal amateur sleuth from Chicago (Watson lays on an extra-thick
Midwestern accent) investigating a murder in a lakeside casino
resort somewhere in the Far West. If Trixie is a much less meaty
part than Watson's roles in ``Breaking the Waves'' and ``Hilary and
Jackie,'' it still allows her ample space for flexing her talent,
starting with that accent. And underneath the character's wary,
prudish exterior lurks an erotic spark waiting to ignite.
</P>
<P>
   With her carefully exaggerated accent, this squeaky-clean
character often seems like a first cousin of Frances McDormand's
intrepid, unfailingly polite police investigator in ``Fargo,'' the
far superior Coen brothers film to which ``Trixie'' bears a
sometimes uncomfortable resemblance. In much the same way that the
Coens fetishized their heroine's squareness to throw us off balance
by gently mocking her decency, Watson's Trixie is given to naively
spouting slogans using the wrong words. ``You've got to grab the
bull by the tail and look it in the eye,'' she blurts. Or ``That's
the truth, the hole in the truth and nothing but the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving the character one or two goofy malapropisms might have
been a refreshing touch. But the screenplay (written by Rudolph
from a story he concocted with John Binder) makes the mistake of
basing much of its humor on Trixie's continual verbal stumbling,
and the joke is quickly beaten to death.
</P>
<P>
   Trixie's adventures begin in the casino where while working as
an undercover detective she attracts the lustful attention of Dex
Lang (Dermot Mulroney), a bar-hopping Don Juan who works as a gofer
for Red Rafferty (Will Patton) a sleazy local developer. In the
movie's best scene, Trixie winds up with Dex on Red's boat, along
with Red's drunken, pill-popping girlfriend, a pathetically inept
pop-country singer named Dawn Sloane (Lesley Ann Warren). Also
aboard is Drummond Avery (Nick Nolte), a hard-drinking senator who
is Red's partner in several kinds of mischief. In a scene rumbling
with undercurrents of violence and sex, Trixie tussles with Red and
is ordered off the boat.
</P>
<P>
   The story darkens after Dawn disappears and is discovered by
Trixie, beaten up, hysterical and in possession, she claims, of a
sexually incriminating videotape. Soon afterward, she is found dead
beneath her hotel window. Determined to solve the case, Trixie
stalks the senator to an exclusive restaurant where, sozzled on
martinis, he delivers a rambling, incoherent monologue about
presidential hanky-panky. Only a director as fond of actors as
Rudolph would have allowed Nolte the room to deliver a
scenery-chewing rant that for all its dramatic heat, also stops the
movie cold.
</P>
<P>
   Skulking around the outskirts of the story are Kirk Stans
(Nathan Lane), a lounge impressionist with a shady past, and Ruby
Pearli (Brittany Murphy), a reckless barfly and ex-lover of Dex.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its occasional flashes of brilliance (every Rudolph film
has them), this unsavory stew never comes to a boil. The biggest
problem is the screwball side of the equation. From its forced
malapropisms to sudden, clumsy lurches into farce, the movie's
humor feels like a painfully self-conscious exercise in genre
bending. It turns out that the kind of ironic playfulness that
comes so naturally to younger filmmakers nowadays is just not
Rudolph's forte. Even when ``Trixie'' is being ``light,'' the
weight of the director's heavy hand keeps the lid on any genuine
levity.
</P>

 &HT;    Scientific-Atlanta readies for sale of set-top boxes
 &HT;    By Kathy Brister
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - For 18 months, a team of Scientific-Atlanta engineers
has been working a brutal schedule and marking the days until
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fast-approaching deadline set by federal regulators who
say they want cable companies, such as those served by
Norcross-based cable-equipment maker Scientific-Atlanta, to
re-engineer the boxes that sit atop TVs. The idea is that with some
technical changes to the set-top box, a cable subscriber won't have
to get the device from the same company that provides his cable
service. This, say the feds, will foster competition among makers
of the set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   But nobody _ not Scientific-Atlanta, the cable operators they
serve, not even the retailers who lobbied for the Federal
Communications Commission to impose the deadline _ expects to see a
generic set-top box on a store shelf anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City ``will not have the boxes available for retail in
July,'' said Bill Cimino, spokesman for the electronics chain.
``Our company's waiting at this time for the evolution of the
product. We are hesitant about selling a product that doesn't have
the same functionality as boxes leased from (cable companies).''
</P>
<P>
   Circuit City has been the most vocal retailer pushing for
commercial availability of set tops. In papers it filed with the
FCC opposing some cable operators' requests for an extension of the
deadline, the retailer claimed the cable industry was dragging its
feet on adopting standards and encouraging its manufacturers _ such
as Scientific-Atlanta _ to build fully functional set tops for
retail distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Broadband industry analyst George Hunt of Charlotte-based
Wachovia Securities said retailers aren't just looking out for
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   They hope to tap into the same kinds of revenue-sharing
agreements they have with direct broadcast satellite, Hunt said.
Generally, a retailer selling a satellite kit gets a piece of the
ongoing revenue stream created by subscribers' monthly fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing Circuit City wanted was a portion of a monthly
cable bill. The cable operators hated that. They hate revenue
sharing,'' Hunt said.
</P>
<P>
   The cable industry admits there are pros and cons to retail
set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conceptually, this is a good idea to have these boxes
available at retail,'' said Chris Bowick, vice president of
technology development for Atlanta-based cable company Cox
Communications, controlled by the same corporation that owns The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ``Set-top boxes are capital
intensive. We, Cox and the other (cable companies), wouldn't mind
getting that capital expense off our books.''
</P>
<P>
   But there's no proven retail model for cable. Unlike direct
broadcast satellite, cable has a targeted base of customers who
live along its lines. In addition, even though the industry says
it's moving toward open technical standards, there are many kinks
to be worked out. And a generic box won't be cheap _ at least not
at first.
</P>
<P>
   Cable companies don't want to see a $400 set-top box on store
shelves next to a $250 direct broadcast satellite system, said
Bruce Leichtman, an analyst for Boston technology research firm the
Yankee Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason cable companies like (retail sale of set tops)
is because it gets the expense off their books. That's the
operational side. Marketingwise, it's like fighting Mike Tyson with
your hands tied behind your back,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta chief scientist Tony Wasilewski said the
company doesn't expect its year and a half of work to pay off
anytime soon. ``We haven't been getting too many orders.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a number of reasons those orders haven't been pouring
in, starting with limitations of the re-engineered set-top box
itself. While it's now possible for someone to cart a set-top box
from Atlanta to Milwaukee, all he could do with it is watch TV. And
with the burgeoning plethora of digital interactive cable services
_ from video-on-demand to online shopping _ who'd want to settle
for that?
</P>
<P>
   Until the industry works out standards for software and hardware
needed to juice up traditional set-top functions _ a process that's
already begun but that could take two years to complete _ it's
unlikely consumers will want to buy the devices, Wasilewski said.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the Saturday deadline and the set-top rebuild is a
paragraph sandwiched into the 1996 federal Telecommunications Act.
The paragraph _ known simply as Section 629 _ never mentions the
word ``cable.'' What it says is that the FCC should ensure the
commercial availability of multichannel video programming
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators are using that paragraph as the basis for requiring
cable companies to separate set-top box security _ what keeps
someone from illegally tapping into the cable network _ from
broadcast functions.
</P>
<P>
   Separating those components makes it possible to build a fairly
generic set-top box that could be used to watch TV on any cable
system, anywhere. One that could be sold retail, ending cable
companies' grip on the supply of set-top boxes and freeing them
from the dual role of supplying both service and equipment. One
that could erode the set-top market dominance of Scientific-Atlanta
and its major competitor, General Instrument Corp., a subsidiary of
Motorola.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, if a consumer wants a cable set-top box with all the
digital bells and whistles, he leases that box from his cable
company. The cable company orders it according to the technical
specifications of its local network from, generally,
Scientific-Atlanta or General Instrument.
</P>
<P>
   Section 629 was designed to change that, to open the set-top box
market to consumer demand the way the retail market for telephones
sprang open after the breakup of Ma Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not what's going to happen here. (The cable set-top
box) is a much more sophisticated device than the telephone,''
Leichtman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Near term this deadline means very, very little. Consumers are
not going to be going to Circuit City to buy a cable set-t

 &HT;    Bearcats' Johnson looms as Hawks' choice in NBA draft
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA The Atlanta Hawks sit on a major decision today, but
they're not complaining
</P>
<P>
   With the sixth pick of tonight's NBA Draft, they can take a
player with a terrific shooting touch and the credentials to be a
very solid player in the league for years .
</P>
<P>
   Or they can elect to gamble a little, take a less proven player
with star potential but also with slightly higher chance of
failure.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand there is Mike Miller, 6-7 1/2 from Florida, as
comfortable shooting from 24 feet as he is from 15. Miller is quick
enough to play guard.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand there is DerMarr Johnson, 6-8 1/4 from
Cincinnati. Johnson is one in a small crop of long, lanky athletes
who left school too early but offer a smorgasbord of developing
skills and awesome potential. He has the wing span of a 7-footer
and the knack of floating so high he appears to fly.
</P>
<P>
   When the Hawks make their pick about 8 p.m. the name most likely
will be Johnson, and the reason is that he can be that good.
</P>
<P>
   This draft ``is all about athleticism and potential,'' Hawks
general manager Pete Babcock has said repeatedly. ``If you can find
a player with star potential, you have to really take a look at
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the lottery was set May 21, the Hawks have been fitted
with Miller by every national survey taken. They worked him out
last week. They were intrigued initially, and they were impressed
by a workout in which he showed dedication and an ability to shoot
3-pointers better than anyone else entered in this year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson also has great range and has the chance to be a
franchise player, perhaps even the Dominique Wilkins of the coming
decade.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Johnson raises questions. He is seven months younger
than Dion Glover, one of last year's Hawks rookies. Johnson
attended four high schools, and the Hawks would be his sixth team
in that many years. After playing at three schools in metro
Washington, Johnson transferred to tough Maine Central Institute
for his senior year. There, he averaged 26.1 points, 6.3 rebounds
and 3.9 assists a game. His team went 34-4 and won the New England
Prep School championship.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman at Cincinnati, as the third and fourth option on a
highly ranked team, Johnson averaged 12.6 points and shot .478 from
the floor. Scouts say he deferred willingly to All-American Kenyon
Martin and senior Pete Mickeal, the dominant personalities on the
Bearcats. Johnson could have averaged 15-20 shots a game but took
fewer than 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks must like that about him. They had him in twice and
the second visit confirmed the first. They liked his ability, and
they liked his personality and his intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   The Orlando Magic, in fifth position, could make the decision
easier on the Hawks by taking Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The Hawks have had offers to trade down and get an additional
pick, plus something for later. They can get a talented player a
few spots down the list.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had discussions, some of them pretty intriguing,''
Babcock said, ``but I'd say right now we're going to keep the pick.
I like our chances with it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said, ``I hope we never draft this high again.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why he is likely to gamble on potential greatness.

`GETTING TO KNOW YOU': IN A BUS STATION, SURROUNDED BY STORIES AND
LIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``That's why people lie, out of necessity,'' says Judith
(Heather Matarazzo), the clear-eyed protagonist of Lisanne Skyler's
entrancing ``Getting to Know You.'' The movie is based on Joyce
Carol Oates stories and conjures an alluring spell of mistrust and
hope, getting to the self-deception that Oates' characters often
weave for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Matarazzo's Judith _ her face a conglomeration of angles and
rounded curves with a hint of a dimple in her cheek _ is stuck in a
bus station with her older brother, Wesley (Zach Braff). The
squabbling between the siblings, who have that way of getting on
each other's nerves as only a brother and sister can, is an honest
outcropping of their defense mechanisms.
</P>
<P>
   The easygoing Judith, with her clear blue eyes, has a friendly
streak of curiosity in her, compared with the closed-off ambition
of her brother, who pursues his studies as if school were a one-way
ticket out of his misery. Judith's interest leads her to Jimmy
(Mark Weston), who claims to know her from school.
</P>
<P>
   Judith and Wesley have been essentially abandoned by their
parents, Trix (Bebe Neuwirth) and Darryl (Mark Blum), a pair of
former ballroom dancers. These self-absorbed failed performers
play-act at being a grown-up couple; they have turned their
marriage into dinner theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't talk much about the future or us, just
themselves,'' Wesley observes as he and his sister hide on a
staircase while their parents float across the living room of a
house from which they will probably soon be evicted.
</P>
<P>
   The soured practicality of these children, who have become like
a married couple as they fend for themselves, is chilling and, like
many of the details in ``Getting to Know You,'' is underplayed.
</P>
<P>
   Judith and Jimmy have their own sort of game, making up stories
around the lives of other people at the bus station.
</P>
<P>
   Skyler has woven her film from Oates' strains of self-deception
and fear of betrayal. In doing so, she strikes a note of hope. And
even though it's the kind of hope that comes out of a delirium,
it's still more than one might feel the right to ask for.
</P>
<P>
   The hope comes across in the giddiness of her actors, who take
to the material with welcoming arms. Skyler doesn't pursue the
modest, petty desperation Oates can traffic in. The director
supplants it with the neediness of small-time dreamers, offering
people who can feel better about themselves only by loving others.
She makes the ache in Jimmy and Judith all the more real because
they're creating these bus-station scenarios, like a pair of
Scheherazades in a treehouse.
</P>
<P>
   In one of these stories, which function as subplots, Irene
(Tristan Skyler, the director's sister) falls for Sonny (Chris
Noth), a gambler whose surface confidence is a magnet to her. The
story unfolds almost as fully in Irene's big, expressive brown eyes
as it does through action and dialogue. When Sonny's luck goes cold
and his depressive side emerges _ Noth is better at the low notes
than the high ones _ Irene feels his downturn more deeply than he
does and wants to help.
</P>
<P>
   Lisanne Skyler has cast her actresses well. Audiences who have
seen Neuwirth only as the emory-board Lilith from ``Frasier'' and
are unaware of how fully she can use her dancer's body will
experience the elation she feels through movement. Her Trix refuses
to allow Judith and Wesley to call her Mother or Mom and is
slightly nonplused at the concept that these tall strangers came
from her. She uses them more as an audiences than anything else,
and she turns mean at the idea of their growing up and leaving her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting to Know You'' is the kind of independent movie that
tests the system, because it's missing the cramped, high-concept,
low-budget pushiness that makes many small films the bargain bin
equivalent of studio pictures. Skyler's patience and skill reveal
themselves in a number of small, gratifying ways. The vivacious
color scheme contrasts with the plangent emotional tone, most
noticeably in the bus station; it takes on life beyond just a
framing device. She's not only a filmmaker, she's truly a director.

`TONIGHT AT 8:30': SAVORING FLEETING JOYS WITH EYEBROWS ARCHED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY

   WILLIAMSTOWN, Mass. _ If seizing the moment were an Olympic
event, like figure skating, Noel Coward's characters would surely
take the honors for form. True, they generally don't have the
athleticism of American hedonists; ``seize,'' in fact, may not be
quite the correct word for what they do.
</P>
<P>
   But as demonstrated in the choppy but intriguing Williamstown
Theater Festival production of ``Tonight at 8:30,'' a sextet of
short Coward plays presented over two evenings, much can be said
for savoring fleeting joys with the restraint and rueful elegance
of the people portrayed here.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they break into spontaneous song, which they do in the
most unexpected places, these charmed souls keep their backs
straight, their smiles suave and their eyebrows arched. Their
choice of rhythms, as often as not, is waltz time. And their
crisply rhymed lyrics are as tart as they are sentimental, as in:
</P>
<P>
   Life needn't be gray,
</P>
<P>
   Although it's changing day by day,
</P>
<P>
   Though a few old dreams may decay,
</P>
<P>
   Play, orchestra, play.
</P>
<P>
   That fragment of song comes from ``Shadow Play,'' a surreal and
fluid vision of life as a dark musical comedy and a work that
prompted the critic Kenneth Tynan to identify Coward as a precursor
to Harold Pinter. It appears on the second part of the bill at
Williamstown, under the direction of Ann Reinking, and it may come
as a slight jolt to audience members who know Coward only for
``Private Lives'' and ``Blithe Spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Its tone is throughly typical of the Coward regularly performed
in repertory; its form is less obviously so. The same might be said
of two of the offerings in the first trio of plays, directed by
Michael Greif, in which thought-defining songs erupt among both a
group of Victorian mourners and a tense romantic triangle at a
colonial supper club.
</P>
<P>
   As a character in ``Shadow Play'' speculates, ``It would be so
much easier if we had music when things go wrong, music and a
little dancing.'' Coward, being a gentleman, saw fit to grant that
wish, and the results, if imperfectly executed in these
productions, are truly fascinating.

NEW DESIGN APPROVED FOR COLUMBUS CIRCLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID W. DUNLAP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Four months ago, with demolition of the New York
Coliseum under way, a final design had yet to be approved for
Columbus Center, the project that would take its place. Instead,
the developers, their architects and city officials were at a tense
impasse.
</P>
<P>
   About all they could agree on was this: Columbus Center had
become a camel.
</P>
<P>
   Architectural visions for the Columbus Circle site had begun
with a gargantuan prism in 1985, and evolved into an overscaled
Central Park West apartment tower in 1988 and then a glass-sheathed
echo of Deco in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But by February, as the development group and a mayoral design
advisory panel were negotiating over the percentage of stone in the
facade, the vision had turned into two boxy towers; a horse
designed by committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's common denominator was not a good plan,'' said the
chief architect, David M. Childs of Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   With little time to lose, Childs drew up a new plan. The
55-story, 750-foot towers would shed their stone for broad planes
of sheer glass. Shaped like parallelograms, they would skew to
Broadway's angle. They would rise from a curved seven-story base
hugging Columbus Circle, with a prow at one end announcing the
presence of the company formed by the pending merger of American
Online and Time Warner, and a midblock atrium, where 59th Street
once ran, topped by a glass-walled performance space for Jazz at
Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw it, I liked it immediately,'' said Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani, who is to unveil the design Wednesday at Columbus Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani gave credit to the the five-member panel of civic
leaders, architects and planners that advised him on ``what they
thought was the most beautiful and aesthetically pleasing
project.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked very well,'' he said of the review process.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the occasional tumult that resulted, Giuliani
laughed. ``Luckily, I wasn't a part of it,'' he said. ``Usually I'm
in the middle of these things. By having a committee come to me,
sometimes with Band-Aids on their faces, I didn't know about all
the fighting. I just got the end result.''
</P>
<P>
   After much pushing and pulling _ as well as some table pounding
and gauntlet tossing _ room was found in a single building for AOL
Time Warner headquarters and a suite of CNN studios; Jazz at
Lincoln Center, including a theater with a seating capacity of
1,300 and a performance atrium overlooking Columbus Circle; 543,000
square feet of retail space (almost as much as in Saks Fifth
Avenue's flagship store); a 249-room, five-star Mandarin Oriental
Hotel; 203 condominium apartments; and 548 parking spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Each element had not only its own needs but also its own
architect: Rafael Vinoly for Jazz at Lincoln Center, Elkus/Manfredi
for the retail space, Brennan Beer Gorman for the hotel, HLW
International for AOL Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the building _ though he could just as well have
been describing the process _ one of the developers, Kenneth A.
Himmel, said: ``This is like a Swiss clock. Everything you move
moves everything around it.''
</P>
<P>
   Himmel, president and chief executive of the Palladium Co., is
managing the $1.7 billion Columbus Center project with Stephen M.
Ross, chairman and chief executive of the Related Companies. The
other developer is William L. Mack, co-founder and senior partner
of Apollo Real Estate Advisors.
</P>
<P>
   They make up the second group in 15 years to try to claim the
prize of developing the extraordinarily visible 3.4-acre site at
the confluence of Central Park, Clinton and the Upper West Side; a
void along Broadway between the theater district and Lincoln
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Mortimer B. Zuckerman and Edward H. Linde of Boston Properties
were the first. With the financial concern of Salomon Brothers as
their major tenant and co-developer, they proposed a 2.7
million-square-foot building designed by Moshe Safdie as a bundle
of angled shafts rising 925 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Among the opponents was Joseph B. Rose, now the chairman of the
City Planning Commission, then the chairman of the mid-Manhattan
community board. At the time, he assailed the ``striking numbness
to any aesthetic criteria whatsoever'' in the choice of the Boston
Properties plan.
</P>
<P>
   Protesters with black umbrellas captured the public imagination
in 1987 by tracing the shadow they said the building would cast
across Central Park. Later that year, Salomon withdrew from the
project just before opponents won a court case that challenged the
zoning benefit given to Boston Properties.
</P>
<P>
   With that, Zuckerman turned to Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill.
``People hated the Safdie scheme,'' Childs recalled. ``It was so
alien. I was trying to find ways to make it fit in.'' In 1988,
Boston Properties offered a plan that was frankly derived from
1930s towers on Central Park West.
</P>
<P>
   By 1989, the bottom had dropped out of the real estate market.
Three years later, Boston Properties dropped out of the Columbus
Circle project.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Giuliani administration and the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority, which owned the site, issued a new
request for development proposals. Ross and his partners offered an
apartment and hotel project designed by Childs. In overall massing,
though not in architectural detailing, it was similar to the
earlier Boston Properties design.
</P>
<P>
   The development guidelines limited the towers to 750 feet and
the size of the project to 2.1 million square feet.
</P>
<P>
   (The approved project will actually have 2,768,700 square feet
of space _ almost as much as the former Pan Am Building at 200 Park
Avenue _ but 668,700 square feet are not counted for zoning
purposes because the space is under ground or used for equipment.
That calculation does not convince Olive Freud of the Committee for
Environmentally Sound Development, a longtime opponent of Columbus
Center, who regards it as an unauthorized increase of 30 percent in
the project size.)
</P>
<P>
   Two things happened in 1997 that profoundly affected the design.
Ross and Himmel persuaded Richard D. Parsons, the president of Time
Warner, to join the project. Giuliani insisted that the Columbus
Circle development include a performing arts center, perhaps for
opera. ``I felt we could extend Lincoln Center by doing that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It turned out that the constituent most in need of a permanent
home was Jazz at Lincoln Center. ``Until you have a physical
presence,'' said Rob Gibson, its executive producer and director,
``you're not connected to the industry of the city. Or the
public.''
</P>
<P>
   The developers have agreed to set aside 100,000 square feet of
space and build the basic structural shell for Jazz at Lincoln
Center, which will complete and maintain the space, for which it
has begun a $103 million capital campaign.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the Columbus Center partners were chosen as the new
developers. That was when the hard work of reconciling all the
diverse occupants began. Each occupant would lay claim to the
highest possible profile in the project.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most important change in layout was the skewing of
the towers, which were originally aligned in such a way that
occupants on the north side of the 58th Street building would have
a view of another building only 65 feet away. Ditto for occupants
on the south side of the 60th Street tower.
</P>
<P>
   There began a series of revisions and compromises resulting in
designs that pleased no one. ``You looked at it and your heart
sank,'' recalled Rose. ``I said, `We did not go through this whole
process to end up with a building designed by committee. We want
something here the city can be proud of, an iconic building, not a
series of unsuccessful compromises.'''
</P>
<P>
   But didn't the administration itself create just such a
committee?
</P>
<P>
   No, Rose said. The purpose of the panel was not to fine-tune but
to point the developers in a direction that would be acceptable,
ultimately, to Giuliani. Besides Rose, the panel includes John S.
Dyson, a former deputy mayor; Jack L. Goldstein, executive director
of the Theater Development Fund; Andrew Heiskell, chairman emeritus
of the New York Public Library; and Jaquelin T. Robertson of the
architectural firm Cooper, Robertson &AMP; Partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the architects came back treating the feedback as if it
were `tweak this and tweak that,' the response was fairly brutal,''
Rose said.
</P>
<P>
   Childs, too, was reaching the end of his patience. ``I'm pretty
good at compromise,'' he said. ``But at a certain point, I said:
`I've let this go too far. We'll get the building done but frankly,
I don't want to have my name on it.' Thank God, it went over.
Everyone agreed. Everyone realized that it had gone too far
overboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, the developers did not take quite so bleak a
view, although they acknowledged the camellike aspects of the
interim version.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody was happy, but we were prepared to accept it,'' Ross
said. ``Time was marching on. We had already ordered the steel. It
was pretty scary. There had to be a lot of faith on both parts _
but more from us than them.''
</P>
<P>
   In late winter, Childs and his partners T.J. Gottesdiener and
Mustafa K. Abadan made another try. ``When this orthogonal geometry
slid into the modern shape of a parallelogram, its expression
couldn't be in square brick any longer,'' Childs said. ``It's now
in ice, sliced ice. Glass.''
</P>
<P>
   Another expanse of glass is the source of some contention. The
600-seat performance space of Jazz at Lincoln Center, which once
was to overlook Columbus Circle directly, will now be recessed 20
feet behind a larger glass curtain wall framing the central atrium.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue of presence and visibility is critical,'' said
Vinoly, the architect for Jazz at Lincoln Center. ``Do we have
presence?''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, the planning chairman, said the jazz space would be a
``major presence'' in the project. ``It's the best design yet,'' he
said. ``The building captures its place in the city, in the urban
context. David Childs rose to the occasion. There were some raised
voices involved, but it was to good effect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a place for a bad building.''

DEATHS OF THE ELDERLY ARE TIED TO AIR POLLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Microscopic particles of air pollutants from
tailpipes, power plants and other sources are causing measurable
increases in deaths and the hospitalizations of the elderly, a
study of the nation's 90 largest metropolitan areas has found.
</P>
<P>
   The study was conducted by an independent scientific
organization funded by auto manufacturers and the Environmental
Protection Agency and is scheduled to be released on Wednesday by
the Health Effects Institute of Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   It found a 1 percent increase in the death rate for each small
increase of tiny particles in the air and a 2 percent to 4 percent
increase in hospitalization of the elderly. The quantity of
particles _ 20 micrograms per cubic meter _ is equivalent to about
7 ten-millionths of an ounce.
</P>
<P>
   At that rate, an ounce of the particles added to a five-story
building that is 950 feet wide would raise the death rate 1
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The correlation was strongest in the Northeast, researchers
found, and in the New York City area, the increase in the death
rate was twice as high as the average of the other cities studied.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers said the reason was not clear but might be that New
York has better monitoring of particulate pollution than some other
cities. With a clearer picture of pollution levels, the
correlations were stronger. Or, the researchers added, it might be
because the tiny particles in the Northeast are made up of
different chemicals, tending to be sulfur-oxygen compounds, while
in the West, they are more likely to be nitrogen-oxygen compounds.
</P>
<P>
   Although 1 percentage point sounds small, government officials
said the finding was important because of the huge number of people
exposed to particulate pollution. Robert W. Perciasepe, the head of
the EPA's air pollution program, said that elevated particulate
levels might occur ``two days this week, two days next week,'' and
other times in the year. Considering that this short-term effect
could be repeated over and over, and considering that there is
probably also a long-term effect, which was not addressed by this
study, ``it's thousands of deaths a year.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the study's authors did not give a number of deaths.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still some work that needs to be done in terms of
translating our numbers,'' said Dr. Jonathan Samet, the principal
investigator and a researcher with the Johns Hopkins University
School of Public Health. ``We didn't do that exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   The study raised another question it did not answer: whether the
additional deaths were among frail people whose demise was simply
hastened by a few days, or whether the people dying would otherwise
have lived for many years. Some air pollution experts blame many of
the 5,000 asthma deaths per year on particulate pollution, although
they acknowledge that some of those who die have heart and lung
problems that would probably have killed them soon anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The study is only the latest in a series that links particulate
emissions to illness and death. Others, in fact, found a larger
correlation, but they covered one or a handful of cities. This one
is considered by statisticians to be more reliable because it
integrates data from a large area.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, by looking at death rates and particulate
concentrations over time, in a variety of different weather
conditions, the authors say, it isolates the effect of the
particles from the effects of summer heat, or of other pollutants,
like smog.
</P>
<P>
   The study is being published as the EPA is making a major effort
to clean up diesel engines, a major source of particulate
pollution. The agency has recently proposed sharp reductions in the
allowable level of sulfur in diesel fuel and hopes to issue a final
rule by the end of the year. The new rule would reduce the tailpipe
emissions of sulfur compounds that can form particles, and it would
also allow the use of sophisticated catalytic devices that capture
nitrogen compounds. The catalytic devices are poisoned by
high-sulfur fuel and thus are not practical now.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, from Johns Hopkins University and the Harvard
School of Public Health, wrote that their study provided ``new and
strong evidence linking particulate air pollution to adverse health
effects.''
</P>
<P>
   Clean air advocates and government officials familiar with the
findings of the report praised it. Perciasepe said, ``I believe the
study substantially validates some of the basic science behind the
regulations, with real-world data.''
</P>
<P>
   At the American Lung Association, Ronald H. White, the director
of national programs, said, ``this is additional scientific
evidence that supports toughening the standard for particulate
matter.'' The study, he noted, does not appear to identify a
threshold concentration level, below which particles are safe. That
means the government should pursue any strategy to reduce
particulate emissions, he added. The current federal limit is an
annual average of 50 micrograms per cubic meter and 150 micrograms
in a 24-hour period.
</P>
<P>
   At Ford Motor Co., which is a sponsor of the institute, Phil
Colley, a spokesman, said: ``we respect their findings. We're not
arguing with their findings.''
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, the company said it would continue
developing new technologies to control particulate emissions, and
would continue supporting scientific research.  &QL;

AMERICA ONLINE TO OFFER MUSIC IN ITS NEWEST SOFTWARE  
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY HARMON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a deal that may break a logjam in promoting the secure
downloading of music from the Internet, America Online said Tuesday
that it had agreed to include software from the InterTrust
Technologies Corp. on compact discs containing AOL 6.0, the newest
version of its own popular software, later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Like several other companies providing digital rights
management, InterTrust allows a recording company to wrap music in
software that ensures it will only be played according to rules
specified by the company. Before downloading a song, customers
would agree to terms like how much they would pay, or how long they
would be able to play it. But in order to be able to make that
choice, they would need to have special software to interpret what
is being offered.
</P>
<P>
   Although the software itself would be invisible to consumers,
depositing it on enough computers to make the whole system worth
using has been a stumbling block.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 20 million subscribers _ more than the next 15
largest Internet service providers combined _ and a notorious
strategy for blanketing the nation with its compact discs, America
Online could serve as a particularly potent delivery vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The online service also said that it would integrate
InterTrust's system into a version of its Winamp music player,
another piece of the digital music puzzle required to make secure
distribution work. Already one of the most popular MP3 players,
Winamp could become more attractive to companies seeking to
securely distribute digital music.
</P>
<P>
   With the huge popularity of the MP3 format, which allows music
to be sent quickly and at no cost across the Internet, the
challenge for recording companies is to find a way to entice
consumers to use a system that would require them to pay and
restrict their ability to copy. But the music industry has been
slow to even try, in part because of the difficulties in putting
the technology in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, it's been that consumers don't need the players that
use the secure format because there's no content in the format, and
content owners don't put content in the secure format because the
consumers don't have the players to play it,'' said Eric Sheirer,
media and entertainment analyst for Forrester Research, a
consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. ``This gets them over the
chicken-and-egg hurdle.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies competing in the area of digital rights
management include Microsoft _ whose software is currently being
used by Sony Music to distribute about 50 singles for $2.49 each
that can be played only on Microsoft's Windows Media Player _ and
IBM, which along with InterTrust is among the companies that
Bertelsmann's BMG Entertainment unit selected to use in its own
digital download system, scheduled for introduction later this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Whether America Online's pending merger with Time Warner means
that Warner Music will endorse InterTrust as a result of the deal
is unclear, although officials at InterTrust, which is based in
Santa Clara, Calif., indicated that they certainly hoped so.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of our figuring out how to commercialize
digital downloading,'' an AOL spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Even less clear is whether consumers will choose to use the
technology of secure distribution, however easy it is made for them
to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But Talal Shamoon, senior vice president for media at
InterTrust, said America Online's large user base would be an ideal
setting from which to start a secure version of Napster, the widely
used system for swapping pirated music files. For instance, music
companies could harness AOL's subscribers to drive sales by
offering incentives like free concert tickets to individuals who

 &HT;    California educator not enamored of school technology
 &HT;    By Alan Judd
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   To William L. Rukeyser, the Georgia World Congress Center this
week has seemed like a temple of technology for schools.
</P>
<P>
   But during the National Educational Computing Conference, he
said, the temple was filled with false idols.
</P>
<P>
   Inside a cavernous meeting room, next to an exhibit hall filled
with the latest educational software and hardware, thousands of
educators listened Tuesday to the chief executive of the world's
largest computer microchip maker. It was hardly a surprise when
Craig Barrett of the Intel Corp. said that educational technology
offers ``one of the best opportunities we have to make advances''
in such subjects as math and science.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, the nation's top education official agreed _ and
said nonbelievers should change their ways. ``Everyone responsible
for teaching children in this new century,'' said U.S. Education
Secretary Richard Riley, ``should know how to use the tools of this
new century.''
</P>
<P>
   But a few blocks from the conference, in a downtown Atlanta
motel, Rukeyser asserted that the effectiveness of the heavily
promoted technology is unproven. And, he said, it is prohibitively
expensive to buy and maintain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody loves to play with new toys,'' said Rukeyser,
coordinator of a California-based group called Learning in the Real
World. ``That's why we love Christmas. But the fact is, when it
comes to technology in schools, there is no Santa Claus. Taxpayers
are going to be picking up the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Rukeyser is part of a small but increasingly vocal group of
educators who are raising questions about the growing reliance on
technology in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   His privately funded, nonprofit organization describes classroom
computers as ``expensive flash cards.'' It says that ``a child must
be literate before he or she is computer literate.'' And it
cautions that ``children are not little adults'' and shouldn't be
pressured to learn complex computer skills.
</P>
<P>
   At events like the computing conference, though, Rukeyser's is
such a lone voice that he might as well be wandering through the
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, he said it's important to offer an alternative view,
especially considering that, according to Intel's Barrett, American
schools have already spent $40 billion on technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they don't tell you at these conferences,'' Rukeyser
said, ``is that the ongoing costs (of technology) are an immense
issue.''
</P>
<P>
   For every $3 million in school technology, he estimated, it
costs $1 million a year to train users and to install upgrades to
keep it from becoming obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   ``These costs,'' he said, ``have gone unrecognized in this rush
to computerize schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, said Rukeyser, a former official with the California
Department of Education, it hasn't been proved that students are
learning more because of the expanding classroom technology.
</P>
<P>
   On this point, Rukeyser and Barrett agree. Barrett noted that
despite the growing use of educational technology, American
students still fare poorly in math and science when compared to
children from other industrialized countries. American
fourth-graders rank third in science scores and 11th in math among
25 countries, he said. But in a study of 21 nations, U.S.
12th-graders come in at 16th in science and 19th in math.
Nevertheless, some studies have found that specific computer
programs improve student performance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his criticism, Rukeyser is hardly a Luddite.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks technology can be a useful tool for some students:
those with physical disabilities, those who are geographically
isolated or those living in extreme poverty.
</P>
<P>
   And his organization _ largely funded by a foundation called the
Center for Ecoliteracy, which promotes nature appreciation programs
in schools _ has a presence on the World Wide Web, where it uses
technology to advocate a lesser reliance on technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do know how to use a mouse,'' Rukeyser said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, the reaction he initially gets from most
technology-loving educators is usually the same: ``Go away.'' But a
book published last year by another anti-technology advocate from
California also questioned the value of classroom computers, and
Rukeyser and some federal education officials have expressed doubts
about the focus on technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly is a minority view,'' Rukeyser said of the
anti-technology movement. ``But there is a growing minority of
people saying there is a good reason to be skeptical.''

U.S. NEAR TO EASING EMBARGO ON CUBA &HT;    
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle &HT;    WASHINGTON _ Republican leaders struck a deal with House GOP
<TEXT>
members Tuesday to clear the way for the sale of agriculture goods
and medicine to Cuba, altering a 40-year embargo on trade with the
communist country.
<P>
   The agreement, all but forced on a reluctant GOP leadership by
Rep. George Nethercutt, R-Wash., is expected to win approval by the
full House as either an amendment to the 2001 agriculture spending
bill or as part of a funding measure for military construction
projects.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership would prefer it be attached to the popular
military construction measure, which would avoid a divisive debate
over Cuba policy between farm state lawmakers and members who
represent the Cuban-American community in south Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The House signaled its backing last year in a vote calling for a
change in sanctions policy. The Senate also passed a non-binding
measure on easing sanctions last year, and is expected to back the
Nethercutt proposal or something close to it.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt's proposal has the backing this year of more than 100
farm state lawmakers from both sides of the aisle, who have long
argued in favor of a major change in the U.S. trade sanctions that
were imposed on Cuba after Fidel Castro took control in 1959.
</P>
<P>
   But in a concession to Cuban-Americans, aimed at attracting more
support, Nethercutt's measure would prohibit the extension of U.S.
credit or loan guarantees to help the Castro government buy
American farm products and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The prohibition could make it more difficult for Cuba to
purchase U.S. goods because it would force the cash-starved country
to use hard currency or seek more costly third-party financing _
probably through another trading partner such as Canada or France _
to make the U.S. purchases.
</P>
<P>
   That provision was added at the insistence of Rep. Lincoln
Diaz-Balart, R-Fla., who said it amounts to tougher restrictions on
sales to Cuba than are currently written into law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prefer this deal to current law,'' said Diaz-Balart.
</P>
<P>
   Nethercutt also had to make other compromises. He agreed to
include current restrictions on travel by Americans to Cuba in his
bill, and to continue the prohibition on Cuban exports to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   His bill also would ease similar sanctions on food and medicine
against Iran, Sudan, North Korea and Libya.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Nethercutt told reporters that the agreement still
represents ``a fundamental shift in American foreign policy''
toward Cuba that will open the door to expanded trading
opportunities for American farmers, drug and medical companies.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also marks a fundamental shift in the attitude of
the GOP leadership, which has listened closely to the
Cuban-American community in shaping its positions on sanctions and
other issues regarding Castro.
</P>
<P>
   But in this election year, the support of farm and business
interests could make a big difference in close races around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, who opposes changing
the sanctions policy, acknowledged as much in a briefing for
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can count votes,'' Armey said. ``There's a strong desire to
open that market to American sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey said the Nethercutt measure also has the support of the
Senate GOP leadership, and will likely be accepted by President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, Clinton spokesman Joe Lockhart said the
president would back the legislation if it includes provisions that
will ensure that any sale of medicine and food ``goes to the
benefit of the Cuban people and not Castro's government.''
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart also sought to dispel any speculation that the
Nethercutt bill could lead to a further lifting of U.S. sanctions
against Cuba or to a warming of relations between Washington and
Havana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe it's time to provide any kind of aid that
will help the Cuban government,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was hailed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as ``a
positive development'' that will end a ``senseless'' policy that
only harmed the Cuban people.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture interests, such as the Texas Farm Bureau Federation,
also voiced approval. But they were skeptical about the bill's
benefit to small American producers and companies in desperate need
of new markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a step in the right direction. . . . But our gains are
going to be minimal because of the restrictions on credit,'' said
Steve Pringle, legislative director for the Texas Farm Bureau
Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Texas farm interests ``will be looking at thousands of dollars
in trade rather than hundreds of thousands,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Pringle said, the state's farmers ought to celebrate
the change in ``political attitudes in Washington'' regarding Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to understand where we've come from on this thing.
Two years ago, we couldn't even get a vote'' on lifting sanctions,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to credit restrictions, the agreement would continue
a 1992 law that bars ships that visit Cuba from entering U.S. ports
for 180 days. In order to accommodate U.S. exports to the island,
shipping companies would have to be willing to change their
freighter schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Lengthy and tedious licensing requirements through the State
Department for U.S. companies wanting to sell to Cuba, Libya, Iran,
Sudan and North Korea also will remain in place.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House Republican leaders agreed on Tuesday to end
four decades of sanctions on sales of food to Cuba, in a decision
that carried great political significance.
</P>
<P>
   But the economic value is relatively minor, as Cuban-American
lawmakers managed to place severe restrictions in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The deal would in principle allow American farmers and
agricultural businesses to sell their goods directly to Cuba for
the first time since 1962. The agreement also echoes existing
policy allowing the sale of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But the federal government and American banks would be barred
from providing any financing for Cuba, making it difficult for
Cuba, with little cash, to buy goods.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the trade would be one-way: Cuba would not be
permitted to export to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has already approved a more expansive version of the
legislation as part of its agriculture spending bill. The House and
Senate must now resolve their differences, but the more stringent
House language is expected to win approval.
</P>
<P>
   The full House and Senate could take up the bill in the coming
weeks as part of a larger spending package. That means there would
be no vote specifically on lifting the Cuba sanctions, only on the
larger bill. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bill would also lift food and medicine sanctions against
Libya, the Sudan, North Korea and Iran. Under the bill, Iran would
also be ineligible for private financing from American banks.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican leaders reached their agreement early on
Tuesday morning after nearly six hours of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders long opposed any weakening of the
embargo against Cuba, which is meant to put pressure on Fidel
Castro. But an intense lobbying campaign from agribusiness and
recent action by Congress and the Clinton administration to ease
trade restrictions on other nations, including China and North
Korea, helped soften the Republican opposition this year.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the White House expressed reservations about the deal,
mostly because it would require the president to get congressional
approval for imposing future sanctions on sales of food and
medicine to other countries. To date, the imposing of such
sanctions has been a presidential prerogative.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George W. Nethercutt, the Washington Republican who
championed the bill, described the agreement as a ``fundamental
shift in American foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Doing business with Cuba, he said, is ``not as easy as it would
otherwise be'' because of the restrictions. . ``But,'' he added,
``the door is open and that's what's important.''
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, both Florida
Republicans, said they viewed the agreement as a symbolic matter
that benefited their agenda as well. For instance, the bill would
turn existing federal restrictions on tourism into law. Currently,
federal rules specify who can travel to Cuba, with cultural and
religious groups among them.
</P>
<P>
   That provision triggered a round of criticism from House and
Senate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican proposal ``not only does too little to insure
that U.S. food and medicine will reach the Cuban people,'' said
Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn. ``It also will unnecessarily interfere
with critical people-to-people contacts.''
</P>
<P>
   The reaction from Cuba was negative. The president of the
National Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon, said the bill contained
``unacceptable discriminatory conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill is also silent on existing law that complicates the
transport of farm goods to Cuba. Under a 1992 law, any ship that
visits Cuba, whether registered in the United States or a foreign
country, is barred from calling on any U.S. port for six months,
and most analysts agreed this adds another obstacle to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Still, agricultural and business groups, as well as academic
experts, said the bill could be the first chink in the armor of
American sanctions to clear Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing that it means politically is that this is the
first time that the U.S. congress has taken a decision to open up
economic sanctions with Cuba, I think ever,'' said Jorge Dominguez,
a professor of government at Harvard University.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For the House Republican leadership, the agreement was a
political calculation. Nethercutt faces a tough re-election bid in
a swing district and, with a slim Republican majority in the House,
leaders did not want to defeat him on his signature issue and anger
his constituents. Neither did they want to anger Cuban-Americans,
who are mostly Republican.
</P>
<P>
   The Elian Gonzalez saga also played into congressional
sensibilities this year, after the boy's plight prompted a
widespread discussion of America's foreign policy toward Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, said on Tuesday during a news conference in Wayne, Mich.,
that he continued to oppose the legislation, saying no softening in
sanctions are warranted until Fidel Castro puts an end to human
rights violations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have opposed lifting the sanctions, and I still continue to
do so,'' Bush said. He expressed skepticism that Castro would let
food reach his people, and added, ``I like to remind people, this
is a man who is tyrannical.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides for Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic nominee,
said Gore takes issue with the bill's interference with a
president's right to issue sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest beneficiaries of the bill would be large
agricultural companies, which have lobbied Congress for years to
lift the embargo.
</P>
<P>
   They are best equipped to help secure loans for Cuba from
foreign banks at little risk to the banks or to themselves. But
unlike Iran, with its oil, Cuba has no hard currency exports to
speak of.
</P>
<P>
   Cuba withdrew from the World Bank and the International Monetary
Fund in the 1960s, and so is barred from any financing from them.
Cuba buys agricultural products from countries like France, China
and Canada, whose governments heavily subsidize the sales.
</P>
<P>
   The American Farm Bureau calculates that Cuba spends $1 billion
a year on agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
   During the next 12 months, American farmers stand to make sales
to Cuba of $25 million to $45 million, according to an estimate by
the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, a center financed by
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban-American National Foundation, the leading anti-Castro
lobby, said it would fight the bill.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - First comes love. Then comes marriage. Then comes a
newborn shown off live on the Internet before its powdered bottom
ever hits the baby carriage.
</P>
<P>
   That's the premise behind BabyPressConference.com, a
fast-growing new company that has signed up more than 75 hospitals
nationwide and could be coming to metro Atlanta by late summer.
</P>
<P>
   New parents will be able to conduct personal, live-action
``netcasts'' direct from the hospital, meaning friends and loved
ones scattered around the country and co-workers stuck back at the
office don't have to miss Junior's first gurgles and coos.
</P>
<P>
   And surely these friends and relatives will want to witness such
momentous events, after they've spent months checking out sonograms
and other details of the developing pregnancy on the
parents-to-be's personal Web page. And even before that, perhaps,
getting a preview of the reception, bridal party and more on the
couple's wedding Web page. Remember when experts warned us about
the possible isolating effects of computers? Check your e-mail
again.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the Internet now affords us the chance to learn
more than ever about others' traditionally ``personal'' moments.
And although there's definitely something to be said for letting
your Web site do the talking to nosy Aunt Mabel in the hectic weeks
leading up to the wedding, some experts wonder how much of a good
thing is -- oo much.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we have a technological explosion like right now,
there's the issue of playing with the technology and the separate
issue of `Why are we doing it?''' said Greg VanHoosier-Carey, an
assistant professor specializing in new media in Georgia Tech's
department of literature, communication and culture. ``The whole
question of what is private and what is public is difficult for us
to sort out right now.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing new, of course, about this urge to tell all.
What is different now is the ease and speed with which the Internet
allows that to occur and, to a lesser extent, the concerns it
raises for the privacy of everyone involved.
</P>
<P>
   Yet some trendsetters point to the increasing de-personalization
inherent in modern life and say they are harnessing the Internet's
power to counteract some of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're recapturing something old by using the
technology of today,'' said Lee H. Perlman, president of
BabyPressConference.com, pointing out that new mothers now spend
very little time in the hospital, and their family and friends
often are far-flung. ``What we're doing is using the Internet to
re-create the experience that's been taken away from people. People
get to see the new baby now, bonding with the parents, instead of
two or three weeks or even months later.''
</P>
<P>
   There's almost no end to what the Web can make instantly
share-able. Expectant parents who register with the service create
a family Web page where they can chart the progress of their
pregnancy, create a gift registry and post sonograms. They put
together a list of people to receive an e-mail when they firstsign
up and later can invite them to attend the live netcast, usually
the day after the baby is born.
</P>
<P>
   The in-hospital broadcasts, which cost the parents and
``invited'' guests nothing, can last as long as 30 minutes and are
archived for 14 days. Perlman hopes to make money through sales of
copies of the netcasts for $29.95 and the company's share on items
such as flowers, cribs, toys (Toys ``R'' Us is an investor), even
bronzed baby shoes, sold through its online store.
</P>
<P>
   The concept sounds like a natural for metro Atlanta, where
newcomers are pouring in at an unprecedented rate and everyone, it
seems, is worldwide-wired. Seventy percent of households here have
computers, according to the Metro Horizon Poll of 2,000 adults in
16 metro Atlanta counties conducted in March by The Marketing
Workshop. In homes with children, that number rises to 77 percent _
compared with 59 percent of all households nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Northside Hospital, the place for delivering babies in Atlanta
and the Southeast, already has an online ``Web nursery''
(http://63.64.125.218/), featuring still photographs of newborns,
accessible only with a secret code given to family and friends.
Katherine Watson, marketing communications specialist at Northside,
said she ``couldn't confirm'' whether the hospital is in
negotiations with BabyPressConference.com.
</P>
<P>
   Some new parents may already have taken the Internet plunge via
wedding Web sites. At DigitalBliss.com, which creates personalized
wedding Web sites,packages are offered for as little as $39.95 and
for as long as six months. Each package includes lists of
recommended hotels and information for the ceremony and reception
sites, while some offer an online RSVP feature and a list of
important dates.
</P>
<P>
   For $139.95, the top-of-the-line ``PlatinumPak'' includes an
online gift registry, with direct links to any stores with an
Internet presence; a photo album, where ``you'll be able to quickly
share your honeymoon pictures''; and e-mail ``ticklers'' sent to
everyone you want to direct to your site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rather than having to tell 100 different people 100 different
times where to stay, what time dinner is, where you're registered,
this way you can publish it once and everyone can stay current,''
said Tom Czajkowski, 35, of the Chicago suburb of Naperville. Going
through all that with wife Lisa before their wedding prompted the
couple to create a Web site and, eventually, DigitalBliss.com.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even couples who apparently think nothing of posting
photographs of their bridal party are concerned about who actually
gets to view their site. Toward that end, Czajkowski said,
DigitalBliss creates a unique ``url'' address for each customer,
who determines to whom it will be distributed.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Akula, who was born in India and lives in North Potomac,
Md., helped talk his daughter into creating a Web site for her
upcoming nuptials. When the engagement of Heather Akula and Eric
Clapprood was announced in The Washington Post recently, along with
the particulars on their professions and parents, the article also
included the address for the couple's Web site
(members.xoom.com/akulamd1/wedding.htm.).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've moved around to many states for my job, so we have
friends all over,'' said Charles Akula, an engineer. ``And all of
my family are in India, so I thought it would be good to show them
what we are doing here. No postage, no customs, no immigration.
People can see it any time from anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the Web site idea initially struck the bride-to-be as a
bit ``dorky,'' she never was unsettled at the thought of strangers
logging on to critique her choice of bridesmaid dresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great that other people can look at our Web site,
especially if they want to get ideas from it,'' said the
21-year-old bride-to-be, whose wedding is scheduled for August
2001. ``A lot of people are clueless when it gets to weddings.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people have even bigger ideas when it comes to sharing
their personal moments on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   At BabyPressConference.com, a few prospective customers have
``implied'' they'd like to include video of the birth, but Perlman
said that's not a business they're getting into.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that is too personal,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the flip side of the privacy issue? Some people
might resent receiving electronic suggestions to check out a site_
and maybe even buy a gift.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have to open them,'' Wendy Simonds, a sociology
professor at Georgia State University, pointed out. ``I get files
all the time from people sending me photos and I don't open them
all.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's a private decision. And even private and personal
moments can go unexpectedly public on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we get more used to the technology, I think it's something
where we'll say, `Hey, maybe I shouldn't put that out there,'''
said Georgia Tech's VanHoosier-Carey. It's always possible for
someone to stumble across a supposedly secret Web site address or
password, or to forward a ``private'' e-mail to an unwanted
recipient, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once someone sends some bad e-mail or shows up at a (private)
party,'' he said, ``people will start to think about it a lot
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless, of course, they're too busy thinking up the next big
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine what we'll be doing 20 to 30 years from now,''
said Simonds, 37. ``When I grew up, you still had to walk across
the room to change the TV channel.''

 &HT;    Burn victim describes fateful day in Waco
 &HT;    By MARK ENGLAND
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas - Misty Ferguson raised her right hand Tuesday to
take an oath to tell the truth and the sleeve on her dress fell to
reveal more about the injuries she suffered April 19, 1993 than
words ever could.
</P>
<P>
   She lost the fingers on both hands in the fire that destroyed
the Branch Davidians' Mount Carmel complex. The inferno led to the
deaths of David Koresh and 75 followers _ and a $675 million
wrongful-death lawsuit against the government that's in its second
week.
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson was 17 and hiding in a back bedroom on the second floor
of Mount Carmel when the fire started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had come out into the hallway, and I felt heat underneath my
feet,'' Ferguson, 24, testified.
</P>
<P>
   She tried going down the hallway, but the stairs had been
buckled by FBI tanks ripping into Mount Carmel to disperse tear
gas, Ferguson told Houston attorney Mike Caddell, lead attorney for
the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The floor was caved in,'' Ferguson said. ``Before I knew it, I
was engulfed in smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson was the last witness called by Caddell and wife Cynthia
Chapman, as they rested their case.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Attorney General Ramsey Clark, representing longtime
Davidians such as Clive Doyle and Sheila Martin, had just started
presenting his case to U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. and
an advisory jury when court recessed. Houston attorney James
Brannon, representing the estate of Koresh's legal children, will
follow Clark.
</P>
<P>
   After being enveloped in smoke at Mount Carmel, Ferguson dropped
to the ground, she testified Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seen a little bit of light down toward the other way,''
Ferguson said. ``At that point, there was a lot of crackling
noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson said she crawled toward the light and found a gap in an
outside wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a hole toward the front side of the building where a
tank had come in,'' Ferguson said. ``I jumped from the building
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked Ferguson if she knew the extent of her injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point, the only thing I knew that was burned was my
hands,'' Ferguson testified. ``They were already burnt.'
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson was one of three Davidians taken to Parkland Memorial
Hospital's burn unit in Dallas. The other two, Marjorie Thomas and
Clive Doyle, were also in court Tuesday. Ferguson was also burned
on her face and body, requiring a long hospitalization and
rehabilitation.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell submitted a written deposition from Frederick Lanceley,
an FBI negotiator at Mount Carmel, critical of the FBI's decision
to aggressively insert tear gas into the building. Lanceley said he
agreed with the assessment of Gary Noesner, who coordinated the
negotiation team at Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   A 1993 government report of an interview with Noesner after the
fire was then read.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noesner ... determined that no one asked the negotiators and
behavioral scientists what the response would be if the tanks
punched holes in the building,'' the report said. ``Noesner sees
this as a fundamental flaw in the implementation of the operation.
Any negotiator would have told them that dismantling the building
would provoke a violent response. ... He believes that is what
triggered the starting of the fires and the shooting of the
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Government counsel Michael Bradford then read an excerpt from
Lanceley's deposition in which the former negotiator stated that he
wasn't critical of the FBI agents on the Hostage Rescue Team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was drinking coffee and eating donuts and they were out
there lying in the grass, and I understood some of them even
entered the burning building to pull some of those folks out,''
Lanceley said. ``They risked their own lives to save lives and
that's more than I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson began her testimony with a description of Feb. 28,
1993, the day of the raid on Mount Carmel by agents of the federal
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the women, I can't remember who they were, said,
'They're coming. They're here,''' Ferguson testified. ``Shortly
after I heard the words, 'They're coming,' there was shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   Government co-counsel Marie Hagen had Ferguson recount her
testimony since other Davidian women have testified they didn't
know there was going to be a raid. Ferguson told Caddell that she
didn't know either.
</P>
<P>
   Caddell asked if Ferguson saw any Davidians carrying weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so close to the floor,'' Ferguson said. ``I had my head
buried. I didn't see anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferguson was accompanied to court by her mother, Rita Riddle,
who testified last week. Riddle left Mount Carmel during the siege.
</P>
<P>
   In other testimony, Caddell submitted a written deposition from
Livingstone Fagan, who is serving a prison sentence on manslaughter
and weapons charges. Fagan said the Davidians' boast after the ATF
raid that they had weapons capable of blowing a tank into the air
was an idle threat intended to keep the government from realizing
``how vulnerable we were.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We only stated that so they would think that,'' Fagan said.
``As long as they thought that, we had a little grace.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan also said he saw ATF agents on the roof of Mount Carmel
during the raid and shot at them. One fell off the roof, but Fagan
said he doesn't know if he shot him.
</P>
<P>
   The trial resumes today.

Golden Gate Fund to Keep Clients' Investments Close to Home &HT;    By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It had to happen sooner or later: The first
mutual fund to invest exclusively in San Francisco Bay Area
companies will premiere next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Gate Fund will join a smattering of other regional funds
that have had varying degrees of success.
</P>
<P>
   It will be run by a smallish Larkspur, Calif., investment
advisory firm, Collins &AMP; Co. Its managers, Bruce Raabe and Brian
Eisenbarth, have never run a mutual fund. Until now, they have
focused on value investing, but the new fund will be ``a blend of
value and growth with a bias toward growth,'' says Raabe.
</P>
<P>
   Any pro will tell you that investing in a single state or region
makes little sense. But then the Bay Area is not any old place.
It's home to more than 600 public companies, concentrated in the
fast-growing technology, medical and financial sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area has been a place where things always happen ahead
of the curve,'' says Raabe.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Gate will face stiff competition from Franklin California
Growth. This fund can invest throughout the state, but at the end
of March, 22 of its largest 25 holdings were headquartered in the
Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   At $2 billion in assets, Franklin California Growth is the
largest regional fund, and the best performing. For the five years
ending May 31, it was up 34 percent a year on average, beating the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 by more than 10 percentage points a year.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, almost two-thirds of the portfolio was in
technology. The next-biggest sectors were services, health and
financials.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar analyst Scott Berry says technology helped the
fund's performance, but so did nontech winners like Robert Half
International (up 100 percent this year) and Silicon Valley
Bancshares (up 67 percent).
</P>
<P>
   The main argument for regional funds is that managers gain an
edge by being close to the companies they own. With the Franklin
fund, ``proximity helps, but so does size. A fund of this size can
get in front of a lot of (company) managements,'' Berry says.
</P>
<P>
   He's not sure Golden Gate Fund will get the same kind of access.
Its investment options will also be more limited. If tech goes
south, Franklin can also go south _ as in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd wait to see how (the new fund) does before I'd jump right
in,'' Berry says.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Gate Fund is licensed for sale only in California and
will be distributed mainly through  &LR; www.goldengatefund.com &LR; . Annual
expenses will be steep, at 1.95 percent of assets.
</P>
<P>
   Other regional funds include Safeco Northwest, WM Growth Fund of
the Northwest, HomeState Pennsylvania Growth, Aquila Rocky Mountain
Equity, Growth Fund of Washington, Maxus Ohio Heartland and New
York Equity.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
 &LR;  MORE NEW FUNDS: Golden Gate Fund is just one of a slew of new
funds coming out of the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Litman/Gregory, based in Larkspur and Orinda, will
open the third in its family of Masters' Select Funds, this one
focusing on value stocks.
</P>
<P>
   For each fund, Litman/Gregory picks a handful of top mutual fund
managers who each select no more than 15 stocks for the Masters'
fund. The idea is to get the best ideas from the top minds.
</P>
<P>
   So far, it seems to be working. In fact, Ken Gregory says most
managers are doing better with their Masters' picks than with their
own funds.
</P>
<P>
   From January 1997 through May 2000, Masters' Select Equity fund
was up 21.1 percent a year on average, according to Gregory. ``The
weighted average of the managers' own funds was only 16.9
percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gaul of Morningstar says the Masters' fund is in the top
quartile of ``large-blend'' funds for the past three years.
</P>
<P>
   The Masters Equity Fund mixes growth, value, large and small
companies, with each manager chosen for his expertise in one style
of investing.
</P>
<P>
   Of the fund's six managers, two are doing slightly worse in
Masters' than in their own funds. Of the four who are doing better,
``three are ahead by a wide margin,'' Gregory says. But he refused
to name names.
</P>
<P>
   Masters' Equity was in the news in March when it replaced one of
its managers, Robert Sanborn of the Oakmark fund, with Bill Miller
of Legg Mason Value Trust. Around the same time, Sanborn resigned
from the Oakmark and was replaced by Bill Nygren, who also runs
Oakmark Select.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup for the new Masters' Select Value Fund includes
Miller and Mason Hawkins of Longleaf Partners, who also pick value
stocks for Masters Equity; Nygren; and Larry Sondike of Franklin
Mutual Shares.
</P>
<P>
   Morningstar's Gaul is not surprised that Litman/Gregory would
pick two managers from the Equity fund for the Value fund. ``If
they think (Miller and Hawkins) are the best managers overall, then
they'd think they're the best value managers, too,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But, he adds, ``I wouldn't buy both funds, because there's going
to be a certain degree of overlap.''
</P>
<P>
   If you like the Masters' concept, check out the Managers funds.
This family also picks multiple outside managers to run its funds.
But the Managers funds are not as concentrated, because its
managers are not limited to 15 stocks.
</P>
<P>

 &QL; 
 &LR;  (Full disclosure: I own shares in the Masters' Equity Fund.)
</P>
<P>
   I-YI-YI: That brings us to Barclays Global Investors, which
launches funds faster than Barry Bonds knocks out homers.
</P>
<P>
   BGI is behind the new exchange-traded funds called iShares.
These are index funds that trade on the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco company has launched 27 iShares since May and
will add 13 more before the end of July. (This doesn't include 17
overseas iShares previously known as WEBS.)
</P>
<P>
   BGI will have an iShare tracking every index you can imagine and
some you can't, such as the Standard &AMP; Poor's 600.
</P>
<P>
   iShares have some advantages over regular index funds: You can
trade them and get prices throughout the day, instead of once a
day. And expenses are rock-bottom, ranging from 0.09 percent a year
on the S&AMP;P 500 fund to 0.99 percent on emerging-markets funds.
However, you have to pay a brokerage commission when you buy and
sell them.
</P>
<P>
   IShares compete with Spiders, which are exchange-traded unit
investment trusts managed by State Street Bank and Trust, and
Nasdaq 100 Shares, better known by their ticker symbol QQQ. Soon,
they'll face a lineup of exchange-traded funds from Vanguard Group.

   Try to Find a PC at This Year's PC Expo &HT;     By CAROLYN SAID  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Maybe they should call it ``Post-PC Expo.''
</P>
<P>
   You could walk a mile in the cavernous Jacob K. Javits
Convention Center here, passing many of the 600 vendors exhibiting
at PC Expo without seeing an actual personal computer. Instead of
boring beige boxes, vendors were hyping small, wireless and
Web-enabled devices. And no hoopla was greater than that
surrounding Palm and Palm-compatibles.
</P>
<P>
   From Sony Corp.'s entry into the market to Palm Computing's
announcement that every existing Palm soon will have wireless Web
access, handheld organizers hogged the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The handheld device market today resembles the PC market in
1982, said Jeff Hawkins, co-founder of both Palm and its licensee
Handspring, in a keynote speech. In other words, the best is yet to
come.
</P>
<P>
   Quoting a study that says more people will eventually access the
Internet from mobile devices than any other platform, Hawkins
predicted that within two years, most handheld devices, including
both Palm-like machines and phones, will have persistent Net
connections, obviating the need to manually connect. And the
potential wireless audience is immense: Research firm IDC projects
that 1.3 billion people will soon have Web-capable phones.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Palm is stepping in to give wireless connectivity to
the majority of its user base. Although the Palm VII is the only
model that comes with built-in wireless access, Palm said it will
offer cables and software that will let other Palm users link their
devices to a cellular phone to get online.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually all Palm users will be able to connect their devices
to the Web,'' said Douglas Solomon, chief strategy officer at Palm.
The products will be available in September for less than $50. The
speed will be only 8 to 9 Kbps, but Palm said that will be adequate
for viewing Web sites that use its Web clipping technology.
</P>
<P>
   Palm also said its future devices will add a slot to plug in
postage stamp-size cards for data storage or specific applications.
Cards could be developed for such uses as monitoring your heart
rate and blood pressure, Palm said.
</P>
<P>
   Palm has some 70,000 developers, including quite a few that have
licensed the operating system to run on their own hardware. But its
latest licensee had TV crews lining up to film its prototype Palm
OS device, which it kept housed in a glass bubble. And that's
despite the fact that consumer electronics giant Sony was mum on
just about every detail of its forthcoming PDA. The price, the
features, even the name will be revealed later, a representative
said.
</P>
<P>
   The device will use Sony's memory stick technology to accept
plug-ins the size of a stick of gum, has a ``joy-dial'' control (a
kind of thumbwheel) for selecting applications and will be marketed
to average consumers, said David Yang, a Sony public relations
specialist. It will have unspecified ``digital imaging''
capabilities for both still and moving pictures.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PCEXPO28 (32978 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  If Palm's OS licensing program is ``too'' successful, would Palm
ever pull the plug, the way Apple Computer did on its OS licensing?
Solomon, who used to be in charge of licensing at Apple, said the
situation is different with Palm because it is licensing the OS
early in the product life cycle. Instead of cannibalizing existing
sales, as happened with Apple, presumably Palm licensees would help
grow the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   Handspring, the Mountain View company whose Visor devices use
the Palm OS, said the OmniSky wireless modem and service will be
ready this fall for Visors. Already available for Palms, OmniSky
modems are $299; the service is $39.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Although at a quick glance it seemed like the majority of PC
Expo's 85,000 attendees use Palm devices, Palm's entire installed
base is just 7 million units. That's a drop in the bucket compared
with 400 million PCs, noted Dell Computer founder Michael Dell in a
press meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually quite a small market despite all the attention
it gets,'' he said, adding that Dell does not plan to make its own
handheld devices.

   New MP3 Players Use Disks for Storage &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A major limitation for portable MP3 players is
the high price of memory needed to store the music. But two
companies, MP3 newcomer Iomega Corp. and pioneer Diamond Multimedia
Systems Inc., introduced new products yesterday designed to solve
that problem using small, cheap, removable disks.
</P>
<P>
   At the PC Expo in New York, Iomega Corp., the Utah maker of the
Zip storage drive for desktop computers, said it was jumping into
the growing portable MP3 player market with the RaveMP 2300, made
by Sensory Science Corp. of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the new handheld digital audio players on the market use
internal flash memory chips that store one or two hours of near-CD
quality music or audio files. Adding another 32 megabytes of
memory, about one hour's worth of music, costs about $100.
</P>
<P>
   But the RaveMP 2300, which will cost $299 when it goes on sale
next month, uses a built-in Iomega Click drive, which reads
removable 40-MB minidisks. A pack of 10 Click disks costs about
$100.
</P>
<P>
   ``So for the same $100, you can have 400 MB of memory,'' said
Craig Rathbun, director of Iomega's Click product line.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company plans to sell its own Iomega-brand
digital audio player by the end of the year. Iomega, trying to
rebound from a year of cutbacks and a management shakeup, is hoping
to capitalize on the fast moving evolution of music lovers using
computers and the Internet to listen to their songs. Iomega hopes
to spread the use of its Click drive to handheld computers,
cellular phones and digital cameras.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of a larger strategy to reinvent our company,''
Rathbun said. ``We see the MP3 player as just being part of the
portable products marketplace we want to make a foray into.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of IOMEGA28 (101847 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Meanwhile, Diamond Multimedia Systems Inc., which produced the
first portable MP3 player in 1998, will ship its third generation
Rio 600 digital audio player today.
</P>
<P>
   The $169 Rio 600 comes with 32 MB of flash memory, while the Rio
800 will come with 64 MB. Both, however, are designed to
accommodate a minidisk drive that should be available by late 2000,
said Jim Cady, communications division president for Diamond
Multimedia, a unit of S3 Inc. in Santa Clara, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond has a stake in Dataplay Inc., a Colorado company that is
developing a 500 MB disk that is thinner than a quarter and should
cost ``less than $10'' each, Cady said yesterday during a product
demonstration in San Francisco. The price of Dataplay's minidisk
drive, which snaps into the back of the Rio, will be in the $120 to
$150 range.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that it holds more memory and is a lot cheaper is
attractive,'' said Phil Leigh, an Internet analyst with Raymond
James &AMP; Associates of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only drawback is that you have a moving part,'' the
spinning disk, Leigh said. The advantage of flash memory used in
other digital audio players is that it has no moving parts that
break or cause the sound to skip.
</P>
<P>
   But Rathbun said the new RaveMP 2300 reads the music off the
disk, then stores it in an internal buffer memory during playback,
so the sound won't skip if the player is bumped or dropped.
</P>
<P>
   And Cady said the Dataplay drives are being designed to
withstand the force of being dropped 4 feet onto cement.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh expects sales of portable MP3 players to double this year.
He added that sales could increase by three or four times if
Napster, the controversial file-swapping software, survives
copyright lawsuits.

Bay Area Students Still Seek Internship Opportunities &HT;     By PETER SINTON  
 c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Summer has already arrived but that doesn't mean
it's too late to hire a student intern for your business or
nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce, for example, has placed
about 300 high school students and recent grads with San Francisco
employers but has applications from 100 more students still looking
for work.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nifty program for both employers and students interested
in learning about the workplace and making some money. Businesses
agree to pay at least $6.50 an hour, 20 hours a week for six weeks
to those students hired.
</P>
<P>
   Nonprofits don't have to pay anything because local temp agency
owner Richard Essey and a few other entrepreneurs have put up about
$35,000 to cover the salaries for 50 student interns.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the pay, students get three hours a week of
career education hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank, Internal
Revenue Service, City College of San Francisco, Bank of America and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Young, manager of the chamber's School-to-Career program,
said big companies such as BofA, Bechtel and Schwab hire most of
the students, while small businesses such as Elite Repographics,
Stevens &AMP; Associates architects and even a few startups such as
Listen.com hire about 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the chamber has set $6.50 as base pay for business
employers, Young said the pay goes as high as $15 or $16 an hour
for students with Web page design skills.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate manager the Swig Co. has hired two summer interns
``to help us get caught up on things,'' said Mills Building manager
Agnes Wyman.

 &LR;  Conference planners insist that home-field advantage or the fact
that many of the 30 judges had local roots had nothing to do with
the choice. The T-RAM startup, it seems, has T-Rex-like power. Its
proprietary memory has the potential to revolutionize the
semiconductor industry by providing the memory density of dynamic

memory (SRAM).

   The nearly $40,000 in prize money on top of the $25,000 first
prize in a recent Stanford engineering school contest is good news
for T-RAM founders and recent doctoral recipients Farid Nemati, 29,
and Homan Igehy, 27. But the financial faucet is just starting to
open for the two Iranian-born engineers. Igehy, who moved to the
United States at age 5, said T-RAM is going after a $100
billion-a-year chip market and a couple of Palo Alto VC firms are

BUSH WOULD USE POWER OF PERSUASION TO RAISE OIL SUPPLY 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WAYNE, Mich. _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas said Tuesday that if
he was president, he would bring down gasoline prices through sheer
force of personality, by creating enough political good will with
oil-producing nations that they would increase their supply of
crude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would work with our friends in OPEC to convince them to open
up the spigot, to increase the supply,'' Bush, the presumptive
Republican candidate for president, told reporters here Tuesday.
``Use the capital that my administration will earn, with the
Kuwaitis or the Saudis, and convince them to open up the spigot.''
</P>
<P>
   Implicit in his comments was a criticism of the Clinton
administration as failing to take advantage of the good will that
the United States built with Kuwait and Saudi Arabia during the
Persian Gulf war in 1991. Also implicit was that as the son of the
president who built the coalition that drove the Iraqis out of
Kuwait, Bush would be able to establish ties on a personal level
that would persuade oil-producing nations that they owed the United
States something in return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ours is a nation that helped Kuwait and the Saudis, and you'd
think we'd have the capital necessary to convince them to increase
the crude supplies,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why the Clinton administration had not been able to use
the power of personal persuasion, Bush said: ``The fundamental
question is, `Will I be a successful president when it comes to
foreign policy?''' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to suggest, as he did in answer to other questions,
that voters should simply trust him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be,'' he said in answer to his own question about
whether he would be a successful president. ``But until I'm the
president, it's going to be hard for me to verify that I think I'll
be more effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush made his comments in a news conference in Wayne after a
brief meeting with participants in a local private welfare-to-work
program. This was his only public event of the day, which began
with a fund-raising breakfast in New York that raised $3 million,
private meetings with the editorial boards of The New York Times
and The Wall Street Journal, and then, after his news conference,
ended with a private meeting with financial contributors at Masco
Corp. in Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanying Bush was the Michigan governor, John Engler, a
Republican. Bush jokingly pre-empted a question about his
vice-presidential selection process by saying Engler was on his
short list and then adding: ``What do you expect me to say? He's
standing right here.''
</P>
<P>
   On a more serious note, Bush said that he had disagreed with the
Supreme Court's 7-2 ruling on Monday that upheld the reading of
Miranda warnings to criminal suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should never undermine the right of a person arrested to
have their rights read to them,'' he said. ``I did believe, though,
that voluntary confessions should be allowed without a Miranda
reading. The court didn't agree with my position. I'm now going to
uphold the law.''
</P>
<P>
   As for how he would handle the rise in gasoline prices, he said
he would not use the strategic petroleum reserves, saving them for
a national emergency.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he did not support a repeal of the federal gasoline
tax of more than 18 cents a gallon, saying he was worried about
what effect that would have on the transportation budgets of the
states.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that the news on Monday that projections of the
federal budget surplus were up to $4.2 trillion only confirmed his
own earlier estimates. He said he did not expect to increase the
size of his proposed tax cut _ $1.3 trillion over 10 years _ just
because more money might be available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased with the way my plan now sits,'' he said. ``Things
may change over time.''
</P>
<P>
   He brushed off President Clinton's proposal, driven by the new
surplus estimates, that he would accept a Republican proposal to
cut the marriage tax penalty in exchange for the inclusion of a
prescription drug benefit in Medicare. ``In terms of horse-trading
with the Congress, it's up to the president and the Congress,''
Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He was also asked to respond to remarks made Tuesday morning by
Chris Lehane, press secretary to Vice President Al Gore, to
reporters in Philadelphia. Lehane had criticized Republicans, and
Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., in particular, for releasing reports
last week that a Justice Department official had called for a
special prosecutor to investigate Gore's fund-raising activities.
</P>
<P>
   Lehane said that the Republicans were ``turning the U.S.
Congress into a scandal-industrial complex'' and that Bush was
``the CEO'' of that.
</P>
<P>
   Bush dismissed Lehane's comments, saying, ``It's frankly the
type of politics people in America are sick of, this kind of finger
pointing, calling names and trying to divert attention.''
</P>
<P>
   He returned to the subject after a subsequent question about how
he would court independent voters in Michigan. He said he would
``make the case that I'm the person that can change the tone of
Washington, D.C.,'' and added, ``Just give me a chance to be the
president.''

GORE UNVEILS $125 BILLION ENERGY PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BRUNI  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Offering a sweeping vision of a future in which
pollution is conquered and cars run without a ``drop of oil or
gasoline,'' Vice President Al Gore on Tuesday proposed tax breaks
and other incentives for both reducing America's dependence on oil
and cleaning up the environment.
</P>
<P>
   And he made clear that he wanted to claim these issues in the
presidential election not only with his soaring oratory but with
the amount of money _ more than $125 billion over 10 years _ that
he was willing to devote to them.
</P>
<P>
   The plans that the vice president outlined Tuesday _ mostly
various forms of tax breaks for businesses that provided or
invested in more efficient, less conventional or less polluting
sources of energy _ represented an estimated $75 billion in lost
federal tax revenue or spending over 10 years, aides said. But they
said that the additional proposals that Gore was expected to make
on Wednesday and Thursday would bring that figure up to more than
$125 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Gore framed that investment as both an opportunity and an
obligation created by the country's current period of extraordinary
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be a next stage of prosperity in which American
creativity builds not just a better product but also a healthier
planet,'' Gore said outside an energy plant here that was a model
for the use of newer, cleaner, more efficient technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will say to the nation's inventors and entrepreneurs: if
you invest in these new technologies, America will invest in you,''
Gore continued. ``And we will prove, once and for all, that we can
clean up pollution, make our power systems more efficient and more
reliable, and move away from dependence on others all with no new
taxes, no new bureaucracies, and no onerous regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   While economists and business executives often worry that more
clean-air efforts and stringent environmental regulations would
hamper industry and limit the creation of new jobs, Gore's approach
emphasized the carrot of tax savings rather than the stick of
restrictions, and it anticipated the growth of new companies and
new jobs on the cutting edge of fuel technology.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Gore's pitch was more than just an exhortation for a cleaner
environment. It also reflected the sudden emergence of high
gasoline prices as a potent issue in the 2000 presidential
elections. Republicans have assailed the Clinton administration for
an energy policy that they say has left the country too vulnerable
to the whims of foreign oil producers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore even folded into his speech a call for the Federal Trade
Commission's investigation into possible price-gouging by the oil
industry to include public hearings, possibly with testimony from
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, when Gore embarked on what he called a
``prosperity and progress'' tour, he said he would spend this week
talking about environmental policy. But since then, gas prices have
become an increasingly heated point of contention between
Republicans and Democrats, and today, the word energy accompanied
and even preceded the word environment in the headlines atop the
written remarks and policy summaries that Gore's aides distributed
to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore frequently alluded in his 26-minute address to the
problems of American dependence on ``big oil,'' a phrase
undoubtedly meant as a dig against his Republican rival, Gov.
George W. Bush of Texas, a former oil company executive. Democrats
have said that Bush's former professional ties and the enormous
sums of campaign money he has received from oil companies would
make him unwilling to press for lower prices at the gas pump.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Gore said in his speech, ``Our next-stage
prosperity must be built on our ability to make sure Americans will
be free forever from the dominance of big oil and foreign oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that America today stood ``on a new frontier of energy
independence and environmental protection'' and should not fail to
explore it. ``It is an old, timid way of thinking to build our
lives and livelihoods around a fuel source that is distant,
uncertain and easily manipulated,'' he said. ``It is a new, bold
way of thinking to demand and develop new technologies to free
ourselves from gas-tank price-gouging.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, in a satellite interview with an ABC affiliate in Green
Bay, Wis., Gore attacked Bush more directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been afraid to take on big oil,'' Gore said. But,
the vice president added, ``My opponent comes out of the oil
industry. His experience is as an oil company executive. He called
for higher oil prices to boost the oil companies' profits.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Bush campaign noted that Bush had endorsed
the Federal Trade Commission's investigation into oil companies and
said that Gore was merely trying to deflect attention from the
Clinton administration's responsibility for gas prices that have
risen as much as 50 cents a gallon in some areas of the Midwest.
Gore, as it happens, will be taking his new energy message to that
region over the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides further said that what Gore unveiled today was
really a set of environmental proposals, none of them especially
visionary, that were recast and reconfigured to sound like an
energy plan because the political landscape had changed so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The vice president seems to forget who's been in office for
seven years,'' Bush said at a news conference in Michigan this
afternoon. ``This is an administration that's been in charge and
the price of gasoline has risen steadily.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan that Gore began to outline Tuesday centered on an
unspecified ``menu of financial mechanisms,'' as material
distributed by his aides called it, of tax incentives, loans,
grants and bonds to help ``power plants and industries that come
forward with projects that promise to dramatically reduce climate
and health-threatening pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Gore's proposals represented expansions of current
federal programs, while others were new. They included doubling the
tax credit for businesses that turn wind or landfill methane into
electricity and giving accelerated tax deductions to companies for
the purchase of equipment that makes cleaner and more efficient use
of fuel. In the coming days, Gore's aides said, the vice president
will talk about tax breaks for consumers who use solar energy or
buy products, like cars, that do not use traditional sources of
fuel like oil.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's proposals seem to veer in somewhat different directions
from those of the last Democratic president to offer a sweeping set
of proposals on energy use, Jimmy Carter. As a way of trying to
reduce dependence on foreign oil, Carter set import quotas on the
amount of foreign oil accepted into U.S. ports. And he encouraged
the development of alternative sources of fuel, including coal, oil
shale, unconventional gas and the sun. Carter asked that utility
companies cut their use of oil by 50 percent over a decade, and
switch to other fuels, particularly coal.
</P>
<P>
   And most famously, he ordered thermostats turned down in the
winter as a conservation measure and wore a sweater in the chilly
White House.

RENO DEFENDS HER DECISION ON INQUIRY OF CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno said Tuesday at a
Senate hearing that no one ever pressured her into deciding to
refuse to seek an outside prosecutor to investigate President
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore for their political fund-raising
activities during the 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, who has repeatedly rebuffed requests for outside inquiries
of Clinton and Gore, testified that she had made judgments on the
basis of the facts and her interpretation of the independent
counsel law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not been shy about appointing independent counsels when
the facts and the law required it,'' she told the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans sought to probe beneath the surface of Reno's
decision-making, but she blunted their efforts, frequently reading
aloud Justice Department documents, made public long ago, in which
she had explained her thinking.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Democrats rallied around Reno. In an exchange
with Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., the attorney general said she
had never asked any Justice Department official to reach a
particular outcome when interpreting whether to send a case to an
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ask him to come out a certain way, though, in
determining which way _ whether to prosecute or not to prosecute on
those campaign finance cases?'' Leahy asked, referring to Lee J.
Radek, head of a unit that advised Reno on such matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never,'' Reno replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the president of the United States ever pressure you to
come out a particular way on any particular matter?'' the senator
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did the vice president of the United States ever pressure you
to come out a particular way on a particular matter?'' the senator
then asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, sir,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   Reno testified five days after Justice Department officials
confirmed that Robert J. Conrad Jr., head of the agency's campaign
finance unit, had urged her to appoint a special counsel to
investigate Gore's fund-raising in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Gore aides criticized a Republican on the committee,
Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, who has been leading hearings into
how the Justice Department handled campaign finance issues and who
was the first lawmaker to publicly disclose Conrad's
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, accused Specter
of ``McCarthyite tactics.'' Lehane said that Specter and other
Republicans ``have turned the Congress into a scandal industrial
complex designed to manufacture and create partisan scandals and
inflict political damage on the vice president a mere four months
before voters go to the polls.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, Specter said he had announced Conrad's
recommendation for purposes of ``public accountability'' only after
Conrad had refused to respond when Specter asked him in an earlier
hearing whether the prosecutor had sought a special counsel for
Clinton or Gore. ``That disclosure was made in the course of the
committee's business,'' Specter said.
</P>
<P>
   Reno is weighing the proposal and has asked Conrad to respond in
writing to questions she has raised about it, government officials
said Tuesday. Conrad is expected to meet in a few days with Reno,
who, the officials said, seems unlikely to opt for an outside
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has twice refused to seek an independent counsel to
investigate Gore's political fund raising. Although the law
governing such appointments has lapsed, Reno still has the
authority to name special counsels under rules that grant these
prosecutors much the same powers as an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad's recommendation to appoint a special counsel was based
largely on Gore's sometimes combative answers during an April 18
interview with prosecutors in which Gore was asked about a number
of events, among them his appearance at a Buddhist temple in
California, White House coffees for campaign supporters and missing
e-mail messages.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Republicans sought to persuade Reno to discuss her
deliberations on Conrad's recommendation, but she would not comment
on what she said was a pending case. She said, ``If the
circumstances justify the appointment of a special counsel, I'll be
the first to make it.''

IRS SAYS RECORD NUMBER OF TAXPAYERS EARN MORE THAN $100,000 
</HEADLINE>
   (Subs to DELETE 6th graf 'Analysis of the IRS'; Subs last graf
`Among the 2 million' ) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stock options, two-career couples and capital gains helped lift
a record number of taxpayers _ one in 15 _ to six-figure annual
incomes in 1998, the government reported Tuesday, an increase of
1.1 million from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS counts a married couple who file jointly as one
taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   The number of taxpayers with incomes of $100,000 or more soared
in 1998 to 8.3 million, up 15 percent from 7.2 million in 1997,
preliminary figures from 1998 income tax returns showed.
</P>
<P>
   The book of statistics was issued Tuesday by the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   The data help explain why federal tax revenue has surged,
prompting President Clinton on Monday to raise the budget surplus
over the next decade to $1.9 trillion from the February estimate of
$792 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In the first glimpse of the impact of the Taxpayer Relief Act of
1997, the taxes paid by these Americans rose by 30.4 percent as
more of their income was subject to the 31 percent, 36 percent and
39.6 percent rates.
</P>
<P>
   The 6.6 percent of taxpayers earning more than $100,000 paid 58
percent of all income taxes in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Many more taxpayers in 1998 _ 828,000, which is a 40 percent
increase over the previous year _ paid the Alternative Minimum Tax,
the new data show. The tax, which phases out deductions for state
and local taxes, and even for children, was adopted 31 years ago to
stop rich taxpayers from using so many legal tax breaks that they
paid no federal income tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows how this frightening tax complexity monster is
growing in our midst,'' said David Keating of the National
Taxpayers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Because Congress has not updated the law for inflation, the
minimum tax now reaches so far down the economic ladder that it can
sometimes tax a single parent making $28,000.
</P>
<P>
   The tax data also raised questions about the effectiveness of
the sharp reduction in capital gains taxes, a major element of the
Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, which was sponsored by the House
Republican leadership.
</P>
<P>
   The highest long-term capital gains tax rate was cut to 20
percent from 28 percent in 1996 and part of 1997, yet the rate of
growth in capital gains fell by half, from 48 percent in 1996 to 22
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who is chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee, promoted the lower rate as a key to
increasing savings and investment and building a prosperous future.
</P>
<P>
   At first glance, taxpayers with incomes less than $15,000 seem
to be lagging behind inflation. But interpreting the data is hard
because the lowest income category is now heavy with rich children.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people with income less than $15,000 annually
declined by 3 percent, from 40.5 million in 1997 to 40.1 million in
1998. The average income grew by just 0.6 percent, to $6,290, an
increase of a scant $45 over 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the picture is the growing number of prosperous
families who file tax returns for children who have their own
college funds.
</P>
<P>
   The one indication that the lowest income category is now
populated with rich children is that 44 percent of this group's
income came from capital gains, four times the contribution of
capital gains to the incomes of those making $30,000 to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Analysis of the IRS data also showed that the boom at the top is
overwhelmingly the result of more people crossing the $100,000
income threshold, rather than of increases in income among those
already there.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 6.2 million taxpayers making $100,000 to $200,000, the
average income fell by $514, to $131,189, from $131,703 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Among the 2 million taxpayers making more than $200,000, total
income was up a robust 17.7 percent, but the average income rose
only 3.1 percent to $568,941.

BILL PAPAS, SOUTH AFRICAN-BORN ARTIST AND CARTOONIST, DIES IN PLANE
ACCIDENT  
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Papas, an artist and political cartoonist whose work was
syndicated worldwide, died on June 19 in an airplane accident in
British Columbia, Canada. He was 73 and lived in Portland, Ore.
</P>
<P>
   Papas, who had been fishing with a group of friends, drowned
when the float plane on which he was a passenger crashed, his wife,
Tessa, said. Two friends also died in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regard myself as an artist reporter, a recorder of people,
places and events,'' Papas once wrote. ``A sketchbook commands
respect, a degree of awe and instant communication in a way a
camera cannot. It is a passport to people.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in Ermelo, South Africa, to Greek parents, William Papas
attended art school in London.
</P>
<P>
   In 1952 he returned to his home country, capturing in strong,
simple lines the street scenes of Cape Town and, more dramatically,
the treason trials of Nelson Mandela, for The Cape Times, Drum
magazine and The Johannesburg Star.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 he moved back to London, where he was hired by The
Guardian. During the 1960s, he earned renown as one of England's
best-known political cartoonists, particularly for his images of
the Six Day War in the Sinai.
</P>
<P>
   His work, which also appeared in The Sunday Times and Punch
magazine, was widely syndicated.
</P>
<P>
   After Papas retired in 1971, he and his wife spent the next 12
years in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984 the couple moved to the United States, traveling more
than 100,000 miles before settling in Portland, and recording their
initial impressions of the country before becoming, in Papas'
words, ``too Americanized.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was ``Papas' America,'' a large-format,
limited-edition book that evoked scenes of everyday life in a
manner that led some critics to label him the Norman Rockwell of
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the couple published ``Papas' Portland,'' an examination
of their adopted city through words and watercolors.
</P>
<P>
   Papas also illustrated publications like C.S. Lewis' ``Screwtape
Letters'' and ``Illustrimi'' by Pope John Paul I, as well as a
number of children's books published by Oxford University Press.
</P>
<P>
   His artworks are in the collections of the National Portrait
Gallery in London, the Vorres Museum in Athens and the Old City
Museum in Jerusalem, among others.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife Papas is survived by a daughter, Peta
Papas-Girod of Geneva; two sons, Warren and Vollmer, both of
Somerset West, South Africa; two brothers, Tasso, of Ermelo, South
Africa, and Bob, of White River, South Africa; two sisters, Irene
Horewood of Somerset West and Athena de Villiers of Cape Town; and
two grandchildren.

DIANE DIVERS BLAIR, WHO TAUGHT AND PRACTICED ARKANSAS POLITICS,
DIES AT 61 
</HEADLINE>
   By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Diane Divers Blair, who taught and practiced politics in
Arkansas for 30 years, becoming fast friends with Bill and Hillary
Rodham Clinton, died Monday at her home in Fayetteville, Ark. She
was 61.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, her family said.
</P>
<P>
   At her death she was professor emeritus of political science at
the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, where she lectured and
wrote from 1968 until her retirement three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Blair befriended the Clintons in the mid-1970s. She served as a
researcher for Clinton's presidential campaign in 1992, and an
adviser in his 1996 re-election effort. In 1993, Clinton appointed
her to the board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   The friendship drew scrutiny in Clinton's first term after it
was revealed that Blair's husband, James B. Blair, the chief
counsel to Tyson Foods, had helped Clinton make nearly $100,000 in
profits from trading in commodity futures.
</P>
<P>
   Blair was a regular guest at the White House, and the Clintons
reciprocated, visiting her in Fayetteville three times in recent
months during her illness.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons are expected to attend a memorial service for her
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Blair was born in Washington. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from
Cornell University in 1959 and received an master's degree in
political science at the University of Arkansas in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   In between she worked as an analyst for the President's
Committee on Government Contracts, a researcher for the Senate
Special Committee on Unemployment and legislative secretary to Sen.
Stuart Symington, the Missouri Democrat. After moving to Arkansas,
she served Govs. Dale L. Bumpers and David H. Pryor on various
state commissions.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, Clinton appointed her a commissioner of the Arkansas
Educational Television Network, and she served until 1993. The
board of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting elected her
chairman in 1997 for a two-year term.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to writing many articles and book chapters, she was
the author of ``Arkansas Government and Politics: Do the People
Rule?'' (University of Nebraska Press, 1988).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband of 21 years, Blair is survived by a
son and a daughter by an earlier marriage, William R. Kincaid of
Washington, and Kathryn K. Jong of Fayetteville; two stepdaughters
and a stepson, Heather E. Blair of Chicago, Arden S. Blair of
Columbia, Md., and James R. Blair of Fort Worth, Texas; a sister,
Lois Alard of Fayetteville, and two grandchildren.

SCOTT HAS ANSWERS TO NETS' QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Just over a week ago, Rod Thorn and
Byron Scott sat in a room in Chicago's O'Hare Airport talking
basketball. There were no game films to watch, no statistical
profiles to ponder, just Thorn and Scott and a magnetic board
between them.
</P>
<P>
   Thorn, the Nets' president, asked Scott to use the magnetic
pieces to demonstrate everything he knew about basketball _
offensive game plans, defensive philosophy and fast-break theories.
For six hours, Scott worked the board, astounding Thorn with his
knowledge and convincing him that he was the coach the Nets needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went over every possible conceivable situation that could
happen on the basketball court,'' Thorn said Tuesday at the Nets'
Champion Center. ``That's when I became sold on Byron. He had all
the answers, so I was very impressed with what he knew about the Xs
and Os part of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only was he a terrific player, but he also has been doing
his homework regarding how the game is played, how the game is
taught, how the game is coached. This team needs a terrific coach.
This team needs somebody who will nurture our young players and
this team needs a firm hand where rules will be set and rules will
be followed. That's what Byron Scott brings to the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Scott, the former Los Angeles Lakers guard who won
three championships playing with Magic Johnson and Kareem
Abdul-Jabbar, was announced as the Nets' new head coach. He
received a three-year deal for $6.3 million, and the Nets have an
option to keep him for a fourth season.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who played for the Lakers, Indiana Pacers and Vancouver
Grizzlies during his 14-year career, said the day's events were the
fulfillment of a dream that began six years ago, when Larry Brown
told him that he would make a good head coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``Larry allowed me to come in there and teach the guys, teach
them how to win and what winning was all about,'' Scott said of the
two years he played under Brown with the Pacers. ``That was the
first time I really started thinking about coaching. He was the
first person to tell me that I think you'd be a great coach. It's
been on my mind ever since.''
</P>
<P>
   While Scott's strategic knowledge impressed Thorn, his
background also served as an advantage. In addition to playing for
Brown, he also played seven seasons for Pat Riley with the Lakers,
giving him the distinction of having played for two of the league's
top coaches. Scott, 39, said he learned a great deal from the two
coaches and incorporates much of their style and teachings into his
coaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bring the type of discipline that they bring to a team,''
Scott said. ``I'm very demanding because I've had two very
demanding coaches, so I have nothing but that in my blood right
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a positive person. I understand that these guys love to be
patted on the back, but they also want that discipline of knowing
that they did do or didn't do the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, whose only coaching experience came when he assisted Rick
Adelman in Sacramento the past two seasons, compared himself to Doc
Rivers, the former player who was coach of the year this season in
his first year with Orlando. Scott said he believes that former
players have an advantage as coaches because they can better relate
to the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been through all the stuff the players are going
through, so what you tell them carries a little more weight,'' said
Scott, who retired in 1997. ``I understand the players. I
understand what it takes to win. I've been to the mountain top.
I've achieved unbelievable success as an NBA player so I know what
it takes to get to the next level, and I know how to push those
buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephon Marbury, the Nets star point guard, is already sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brings respect from the door, as soon as he walks in,''
Marbury said. ``Having a guy like that, you know his mentality as
far as practice. You know what's going to be expected of you. You
know you're going to have to come in everyday and work, and that's
what we need. We need that attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott said he will attempt to bring the fast-break style of the
Lakers to New Jersey. Offensively, that will mean lots of ball
movement. He will also encourage Marbury to push the ball in the
open court. Defensively, that will mean improved on-the-ball and
help coverage and stronger rebounding.

KEITH REEMTSMA, PIONEER IN MEDICAL TRANSPLANTS, DIES AT 74 
</HEADLINE>
  (Editors: The title ``M-A-S-H'' in the 15th graf should be accented
with asterisks.) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dr. Keith Reemtsma, who in 1964 transplanted a kidney
from a chimpanzee to a woman who then lived with it for nine
months, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 74.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to performing cross-species transplants, known as
xenotransplantation, Reemtsma was an expert in all kinds of human
transplants. For 23 years, he was chairman of the department of
surgery at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, where he helped
create a leading heart transplant center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith was a giant in the field of transplantation,'' said
another surgical pioneer, Dr. Thomas E. Starzl of the University of
Pittsburgh, who developed liver transplants.
</P>
<P>
   ``If xenotransplantation eventually works, no doubt the starting
point will be traced to Keith Reemtsma,'' Starzl said.
</P>
<P>
   Reemtsma is credited with being the first to show that nonhuman
organs could be transplanted into humans and function for a
significant period. He achieved that by giving six humans
chimpanzee kidneys in the first chimpanzee-to-human organ
transplants in 1963 and 1964.
</P>
<P>
   A 23-year-old teacher survived with a chimpanzee kidney for nine
months; she died of overwhelming infection. The other five
recipients also died from infections, from 8 to 63 days after
receiving chimpanzee kidneys.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the length of the teacher's survival, as well as the
nine-week survival of a 44-year-old dock worker, surprised many
experts. ``That was his signature contribution,'' Starzl said, and
``it has been the one real beacon of hope'' for researchers who
have tried to break the cross-species transplantation barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Reemtsma undertook the controversial transplants in desperation,
because of an impasse in obtaining donor organs and a reluctance to
use live human donors ``for ethical, scientific and legal
reasons,'' he wrote later in a scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s, doctors knew that certain blood cells recognized
transplanted organs as foreign and attacked them, but they did not
know which cells were involved or how the process worked. Now, as
the field of immunology has flowered, scientists have identified
several cells that act in concert to reject foreign cells. Also,
scientists have developed several drugs to suppress the immune
system to prevent such rejection. Reemtsma lived to see his
students achieve one-year survival rates of up to 90 percent for
human kidney transplants and 85 percent for heart transplants.
</P>
<P>
   But as the results improved, the waiting list for organs grew.
Reemtsma continued to promote research into xenotransplantation in
the belief that there would never be a sufficient supply of human
organs. But protests from advocates for animal rights and concerns
that giving humans animal organs could unleash another AIDS virus
have heightened the controversy over cross-species transplants.
</P>
<P>
   Reemtsma spent his career seeking to transplant islet cells from
the pancreas as a cure for diabetes. A month before his death, he
learned that scientists in Canada had apparently succeeded with
this procedure in eight patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always thought it was going to work,'' said his wife, Judy
Reemtsma.
</P>
<P>
   Reemtsma, who stood 6 feet 3 inches, was born in Madera, Calif.,
on Dec. 5, 1925. He grew up on a Navajo Indian reservation in the
Southwest, where his father, Henry, was a Presbyterian minister and
missionary.
</P>
<P>
   Reemtsma attended schools in Oklahoma and Utah and graduated
from Idaho State College in Pocatello in 1945. After earning a
medical degree at the University of Pennsylvania in 1949, Reemtsma
began training at Columbia to become a surgeon. But in 1951 his
career was interrupted by the Korean War; he served in the Navy and
Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mrs. Reemtsma, Reemtsma was a model for the
character Dr. Hawkeye Pierce in the movie and television series
``M-A-S-H.''
</P>
<P>
   After the war, Reemtsma became the chief resident at Columbia.
He received a doctorate in medical science from Columbia in 1958 as
he was leaving for Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, he became chairman of the department of surgery at the
University of Utah. Organ transplantation remained his main
interest. But when he learned that Dr. Willem Kolff, who had
developed the artificial kidney, was unhappy at the Cleveland
Clinic, Reemtsma recruited him to Salt Lake City to establish one
of the world's first programs to develop a variety of artificial
organs for implantation in humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reemtsma was a man who immediately inspired confidence,''
Kolff said. He went on: ``I bought a house in Salt Lake City before
I had a contract because there was never any doubt about his word.
I came with an extensive program, and he offered me wooden barracks
from World War I that no one wanted but that I thought were
ideal.''
</P>
<P>
   The work in Utah led to the first implantation of an artificial
heart, in Dr. Barney Clark in 1982 at the University of Utah.
Mechanical hearts, known as ventricular assist devices, are now
used as temporary bridges to transplants at Columbia and other
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   When Columbia recruited Reemtsma to be its chief surgeon in
1971, ``he had no desire to leave Utah,'' Kolff said. He made
demands that ``he never expected Columbia would accept,'' and
Columbia accepted, Kolff said.
</P>
<P>
   Much later, after stepping down at Columbia, Reemtsma founded an
international center for health outcomes research there. Reemtsma
advocated a system of ``your fault'' insurance in which individuals
paid for medical problems that developed from having ignored clear
health warnings.
</P>
<P>
   Starzl recalled coming down with the flu last November, while he
and Reemtsma were at a meeting in Japan. When Reemtsma learned of
his condition, he advised Starzl to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keith seemed fine then,'' Starzl said, ``but 10 days later, he
called me from home and said he had turned yellow'' from cancer of
the liver.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Reemtsma is survived by their two sons,
Lance Brewster Reemtsma of Berkeley, Calif., and Dirk Van Horn
Reemtsma of Oceanside, Calif.; a sister, Carol Sharpe, of Guelph,
Ontario; and two grandchildren.

Communications, a leading analyst of Internet trends, the two
companies said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Combining the two companies will create ``the definitive source
for Internet measurement and analysis,'' said Tod Johnson, chairman
and chief executive of Media Metrix, which calculates the
popularity of more than 21,000 Web sites based on software tracking
the habits of 70,000 computer users in the United States and
overseas.
</P>
<P>
   But in the volatile Internet economy, no one's traffic
statistics are universally accepted as reliable, and the
projections of research firms often turn out to be wildly off the
mark. Tracking Internet activity has turned out to be surprisingly
difficult because there are so many different possible
measurements, including how often people visit a site, how long
they stay, and whether they transact any business there. There are
no standards for comparison comparable to those used in accounting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both Media Metrix and Jupiter are seen as industry
leaders in providing valuable insights into Internet trends,
however questionable the actual figures on which they are based.
</P>
<P>
   ``Media Metrix's monthly reports definitely move stocks,'' said
Henry Blodgett, who tracks a broad portfolio of Internet companies
for Merrill Lynch. ``It's the closest thing there is to a
standard.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said that the merger should help the two companies
expand overseas, where demand for Internet information is growing
rapidly. It is also intended to provide opportunities for
``hybrid'' products, including analytical commentaries on Media
Metrix data and databases that help Jupiter produce analysis of
more narrowly defined market segments.
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix's largest competitor is Nielsen/NetRatings, an
alliance of Nielsen Media Research and NetRatings Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter, which gets most of its revenue from subscribers to
monthly research reports and seminars, competes most directly with
Forrester Research, based in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were not immediately impressed by the possibilities.
Media Metrix's shares fell $4.875, or 17 percent, to $23.375 while
Jupiter's dipped $1.937, or 8 percent, to $21.625. Under the terms
of the agreement, Jupiter shareholders will receive .946 shares of
Media Metrix stock for each of their shares. The stock swap, which
was valued at about $414 million when the deal was announced, was
worth $343 million by the end of trading.
</P>
<P>
   One possible dampening factor was the expectation that the
Gartner Group, a Stamford, Conn.-based consulting firm with just
under 20 percent of Jupiter's stock, will sell the roughly 9
percent stake it would end up with in Jupiter Media Metrix. And,
indeed, a Gartner spokeswoman confirmed Tuesday that such a selloff
was likely.
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter Media Metrix would not be profitable until the end of
this year, according to Johnson. Jupiter earned just $11,000 from
continuing operations on revenues of $17.2 million in the first
quarter while Media Metrix lost $2.3 million on revenues of $10.2
million in the same period.
</P>
<P>
   The company would be based in New York, where both Jupiter and
Media Metrix are headquartered. Johnson will become chairman and
chief executive. Gene DeRose, chairman and chief executive of
Jupiter, will become president and vice chairman of Jupiter Media
Metrix. .

KINGS WANT MORE INFO ON LINDROS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ The medical report the Kings hoped would
bring some clarity to Eric Lindros' future in the NHL was released
Tuesday, but shed little light on whether the former league MVP
will play again after suffering four concussions in the last four
months.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia Flyers, who are hoping to trade Lindros before
Saturday, received the findings of neurologist James Kelly, who has
treated the former Flyers captain this past year.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's report ruled out playing for now, but said Lindros needs
to be reevaluated after symptoms of post-concussion syndrome have
passed. Lindros told the Kings on Monday that he still is groggy
from the fourth concussion, which occurred last month during Game 7
of the Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not seen the report and did not talk to (Flyers general
manager) Bobby Clarke today,'' Kings general manager Dave Taylor
said Tuesday. ``But I know what Eric told me. That there still were
problems. I don't expect any decision to be made before the
weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia must offer Lindros $8.5 million, the equivalent of
last year's salary, by Saturday or risk losing him to unrestricted
free agency without compensation. The Flyers have granted
permission to the Kings, New York Rangers and Toronto Maple Leafs
to speak to Lindros, but without a positive medical report,
everything is on hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Kelly wants Eric to be free of symptoms for one week's
time before he examines him,'' Philadelphia team physician Jeff
Hartzell said Tuesday. &QL;

 &HT;    Norman to have hip surgery, will miss British Open
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. - Greg Norman will miss next month's
British Open at St. Andrews after he undergoes hip surgery
Wednesday to repair a problem he says has bothered him since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While it pains him to miss his favorite tournament at his
favorite course, Norman was upbeat Tuesday when discussing his
second operation in the past 27 months. The relatively new,
hourlong arthroscopic surgery is expected to have Norman, 45, back
playing the PGA Championship in mid-August at Valhalla, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know this will give me a new lease on life,'' Norman said.
``When I walk out of there after surgery, it's going to be very
exciting because I will be 100 percent repaired. This is not a
degenerative condition like Bo Jackson or Jack Nicklaus. I should
have done this two or three years ago, but they didn't have this
technology back then.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman said he's had pain in his right hip for several years,
but it became more severe in recent months. He said he constantly
tried to fix the ailment, but doctors either didn't diagnose it
properly or didn't know what they were looking for.
</P>
<P>
   He said it wasn't until he shot an 82 in the second round at
Pebble Beach _ his worst score in a U.S. Open _ and missed the cut
by 10 shots that he felt compelled to get the hip repaired. The
surgery will be performed by Dr. Marc Philippon at Holy Cross
Hospital in Fort Lauderdale. Philippon will be assisted by Dr.
Richard Hawkins, who operated on Norman's left shoulder in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of humility at what happened at Pebble Beach,''
Norman said. ``It was kind of what happened at the (1998) Masters
when I almost killed the guy with my driver (on a tee shot on the
18th hole). There's no more humbling experience than walking off
the course after you've shot 17-over. You get to the point where
enough is enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman said Philippon and Hawkins both told him the hip
situation likely led to his shoulder injury. X-rays showed there
were calcium deposits in his hip that may have been there as long
as seven years ago, which led him to put more stress on his
shoulder to compensate.
</P>
<P>
   Philippon said the surgery _ which Norman will be able to watch
on a monitor _ will include cutting away dead tissue from the
labrum, which lines the inner rim of the hip socket. Philippon also
might need to use laser treatment to decrease the size of Norman's
ball joint which, because of a slight abnormality, is bigger than
the socket.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a degenerative condition, and it's possible Greg
can be hitting balls as soon as within 10 days,'' Philippon said.
``Physiologically, Greg has the body of a 20-year-old. There's no
reason he can't go back to playing the way he was before the hip
started hurting.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman has won 86 tournaments worldwide, but none since he
underwent the shoulder surgery in April of 1998, which caused him
to miss the rest of that season. His 18th PGA Tour title came in
the 1997 World Series of Golf and he last won at his Holden
International in Australia in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Norman returned to tie Jose-Maria Olazabal for the back-nine
lead at the 1999 Masters, but made two late bogeys and finished
third. He also contended at last year's British Open _ where he won
both of his majors _ at Carnoustie before finishing sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Norman, 45, knows many golf fans will think his career is
nearing an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``First off, I don't look at this as major surgery,'' he said.
``People can think that (I'm done), but they don't know what the
intensity is like in myself once I know I'm 100 percent healthy and
I can go out and execute again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time is not on my side, admittedly. But 45 is just a number.
It's how you feel and how your body reacts that's important. The
doctors have told me I can come back and play 10 years as hard as I
want.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman said he considered having the surgery after the British
Open, but that would jeopardize him playing in the PGA and possibly
the Presidents Cup in mid-October.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no guarantee I wouldn't go over and shoot 17-over
again,'' Norman said. ``This way, I know I'll be healthy and I
won't miss the PGA. It was a tough decision, but it was the
decision I had to make.''

EDITORIAL: POLITICIZING GASOLINE PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 28:
</P>
<P>
   Few politicians have been able to resist exploiting public anger
over $2-a-gallon gasoline in the Midwest. But none have shed much
light on the subject. Vice President Al Gore suspects that oil
companies are gouging customers and would not mind if voters took
revenge on Gov. George W. Bush, a former oil company executive.
Bush accuses the administration of having sat back while OPEC
tripled the price of crude oil. He also cites Gore's book on the
environment to suggest that Gore thinks gas prices are too low to
begin with. Others have called for relaxing environmental
standards.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the accusations lie rather mundane facts. The
industry has often been accused of price collusion, but
investigations have never turned up evidence. OPEC decisions
explain why prices are up nationwide _ but not why they are
sky-high in the Midwest. Whatever role environmental regulations
have played in boosting gas prices, their impact is temporary and
appears to be waning.
</P>
<P>
   A study by the Congressional Research Service provides rough
estimates that production cutbacks by OPEC have boosted gasoline
prices nationwide by about 50 cents a gallon over the last 18
months. Gas prices in the Midwest are about 50 cents higher than
that. Approximately half of the gap can be traced to broken
pipelines. The other half could be due to a peculiar interplay
among various environmental rules and ethanol, a fuel additive.
</P>
<P>
   To meet provisions of the 1990 Clean Air Act, refiners in
certain Midwest cities blend ethanol into gasoline to reduce carbon
monoxide and toxic chemicals. But ethanol also tends to make
gasoline evaporate easily, and in so doing adds to urban smog. In
recognition of the smog problem, the Environmental Protection
Agency on June 1 imposed updated rules designed to reduce
evaporation. This meant the refiners had to figure out anew how to
blend ethanol with gasoline in a way that alleviates one air
pollution problem without aggravating another. This task, in turn,
has complicated production and may have at least temporarily
contributed to the shortage.
</P>
<P>
   Even modest interruptions in gasoline supplies can drive prices
upward, in part because refineries hold small inventories and thus
have little gas on hand to absorb production drops. But the
interruptions, though troublesome, are temporary. They do not
justify suspending the June 1 environmental rules that are
important to cleaning up the air and have been years in the making.
Besides, they are unlikely to raise prices by more than about a
nickel a gallon once the system has time to settle down.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, many scientists now question the need to add ethanol
or any other ingredient to gasoline to control carbon monoxide
emissions. But this is a matter for Congress to decide, and should
not be driven by short-term supply imbalances in the Midwest. Until
the Federal Trade Commission completes its current study of the
situation, no one will know for sure why gas prices rose above $2 a
gallon. But it seems unlikely that the commission will find a
single villain.

ORACLE SAYS IT INVESTIGATED MICROSOFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: The following story is an added starter on The New York
Times front page) 
By JOHN MARKOFF and MATT RICHTEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Oracle Corp. acknowledged Tuesday that it had
hired a prominent Washington detective firm to investigate groups
sympathetic to its archrival, Microsoft Corp., an effort that
yielded documents embarrassing to Microsoft in the midst of its
antitrust battle with the government.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle's admission Tuesday followed reports linking the
detective firm, Investigative Group International, to an
unsuccessful attempt this month to obtain documents from a
pro-Microsoft trade group, the Association for Competitive
Technology, by offering payments to janitors at the group's
Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle said the investigations on its behalf had established
that the association and two other organizations ``were
misrepresenting themselves as independent advocacy groups, when in
fact their work was funded by Microsoft for the express purpose of
influencing public opinion in favor of Microsoft during its
antitrust trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Documents from two of the organizations were cited in articles
in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal showing that the
groups had received financing from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   An official of one of the groups said he thought documents that
later showed up in the press were on two laptops stolen from the
group last June. But an Oracle spokesman said the company had
stipulated to the detective firm that nothing illegal was to be
done in the operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Oracle asked IGI to investigate numerous Microsoft front
organizations, we didn't specify how IGI should go about gathering
information,'' the spokesman said. ``We did, however, insist that
whatever methods IGI employed must be legal.'' He said Oracle was
repeatedly given such assurances.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Harrison, president and chief executive of the detective
firm, issued a statement saying he had no comment. The firm's
chairman, Terry Lenzner, did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   The episode indicates the profound bitterness of the
software-industry rivalry between Microsoft and Oracle, companies
headed by two of the world's richest men: Bill Gates of Microsoft
and Lawrence J. Ellison of Oracle.
</P>
<P>
   Vivek Varma, a Microsoft spokesman, said Tuesday night, ``This
is further proof that our competitors have conducted and paid for
and orchestrated a public relations and lobying campaign to
generate government intervention into a industry that is highly
competitive and delivering for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lenzner, a onetime Watergate investigator, has come to
prominence in recent years in his work for the tobacco industry and
the Clinton White House, gathering information on their accusers. A
Microsoft law firm even hired the Lenzner firm earlier this year to
assist in a software piracy and counterfeiting case.
</P>
<P>
   Oracle said it had retained the detective firm in June 1999 to
investigate the Independent Institute of Oakland, a free-market
policy institute that had just placed full-page advertisements
defending Microsoft _ signed by 240 academic figures and portrayed
as reflecting independent views _ in The Washington Post and The
New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   In September, The Times, citing internal institute documents,
reported that the Independent Institute's ad was actually paid for
by Microsoft. The Times said the documents had been provided by a
Microsoft adversary associated with the computer industry who
refused to be further identified.
</P>
<P>
   A Times spokeswoman, Catherine Mathis, said it has long been the
paper's policy not to disclose the names of confidential sources.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, an article in The Wall Street Journal reported that
the National Taxpayers Union, which had issued a study blaming the
antitrust case for a loss of value in state pension funds, had
received financing from Microsoft. It attributed the information to
a person familiar with the group's corporate fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take it that there has been no suggestion of any improper
activity by The Journal, or any knowledge by The Journal of any
such activity by any of its sources, and we know of none,'' said
Richard Tofel, a spokesman for the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The other group that Oracle acknowledged was a target of the
investigation, the Association for Competitive Technology, is a
pro-Microsoft trade group. According to documents from the company
that manages the association's office space, a woman offered two
cleaning workers cash on two occasions early this month to hand
over trash from the group's office.
</P>
<P>
   The offers were rebuffed. The woman making them had gained
access using a key from another tenant, whose credit application
bore the name of an investigator identified in the past as an agent
of the Lenzner firm.
</P>
<P>
   An Oracle executive said the company knew nothing about that
incident other than what had been reported in the press.
</P>
<P>
   And the executive said Oracle had had no involvement in another
episode, in which Microsoft's support for a free-market lobbying
group called Citizens for a Sound Economy was reported in The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Both that group and the Independent Institute reported recent
thefts of laptop computers from their offices that they said might
have contained documents that later appeared in the press.
</P>
<P>
   The targets of the Oracle-backed investigation expressed outrage
this evening, suggesting that the company was guilty of the same
dirty-pool tactics of which it has long accused Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's despicable,'' said Jonathan Zuck, president of the
Association for Competitive Technology. ``I would hope to get a
letter of apology from Larry Ellison and an explanation of how, in
a climate over so much concern over the issue of privacy, he could
think this is an acceptable business practice.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He said he was considering legal action over what he said was a
violation of his employees' privacy in the trash-buying attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not dumpster diving in offices outside the building,
this is bribery,'' he said. ``It's also a security issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Repeated requests by phone and e-mail for comment from Ellison,
the Oracle chairman, were unavailing.
</P>
<P>
   David J. Theroux, president of the Independent Institute, said
Oracle had called into question its own credibility. ``Clearly
anybody who stoops to whatever was done here, you can't trust,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He asserted that the documents that were cited in The Times
obscured the debate because they implied that the Independent
Institute was a front for Microsoft. Theroux said the Institute was
advocating free-market policies for years before Microsoft ever
became a supporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that instead of engaging the issues in a
visible public forum,'' Theroux said, speaking of Oracle, ``it was
considered to be appropriate to use subterfuge and back-alley
tactics to deal with the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   John Berthoud, president of the National Taxpayers Union, based
in Alexandria, Va., said, ``It's disappointing but perhaps not
unexpected that Microsoft opponents, who are trying to use the
American judicial system to run down Microsoft, would stoop to
these kind of political tactics against the voices of the free
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Berthoud said he had been approached by reporters contending
they had been given internal financial documents from his group.
But he said he had not seen the documents and could not verify
their authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   He said his group ``engages in the rough and tumble of
politics,'' but added, ``This kind of nonsense is uncalled for and
below the belt.'' &QL;

   Change comes slowly to Mexico, the country with the world's

the 1920s of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), power in
Mexico has changed hands through backroom deals in which the
incumbent president has chosen his successor _ whose subsequent
electoral victory was a formality, achieved when necessary by
fraud. No longer. That makes Mexico's presidential election on July
2 a historic _ and hopeful _ event. &QL;

Chechnya, the rebel republic devastated at his command. Things may

   Health-care spending is everywhere on the increase. In 1948, it
took 3 percent of gross world product; now, says a new report from
the World Health Organization, the figure is 7.9 percent and
rising. Governments and health-care providers have much to learn
from studying the structure and performance of other countries'
health systems. But what may matter more for public policy than the
rankings in the WHO report are four general conclusions about
health care. &QL;

   SAN FRANCISCO _ On June 22, the California Environmental
Dialogue, a new 32-member group including _ improbably _ General
Motors, Chevron, BP Amoco, the Sierra Club and Environmental
Defense, published a paper on the state's transport policy. In it,
they endorsed the principle that the ``user should pay'' for road
use and that ``tolls and congestion pricing should be utilized
whenever possible'' _ a first for the big oil and car firms.
Drivers' groups, however, are opposed to the idea. Kevin Murray, a
state senator from freeway-laced Los Angeles, calls road-pricing a
middle-class fantasy dreamed up by ``some dweeb in a dark room
doing quantitative analysis.'' &QL;

So, at least, runs the contention of the United Nations officials

They have invented a new, blue ``withdrawal line'' where it thinks
the Lebanese border should run. But the Lebanese government, which
already has to cope with green, red, black and purple lines left
behind by the country's civil war, is reluctant to add another
shade to the spectrum. It argues that the new boundary leaves
several chunks of Lebanese territory inside Israel. &QL;

   Change comes slowly to Mexico, the country with the world's
longest-serving ruling political party. Ever since the emergence in
the 1920s of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), power in
Mexico has changed hands through backroom deals in which the
incumbent president has chosen his successor _ whose subsequent
electoral victory was a formality, achieved when necessary by
fraud. No longer. That makes Mexico's presidential election on July
2 a historic _ and hopeful _ event. &QL;

   On the face of it, the past decade has been a splendid time for
democrats. All over the world, dictatorships, whether communist or
military, have been in retreat; demand for ballot boxes, election
monitors and people who know how to run parliaments has been as hot
as for Pokemon cards. Indeed, for the first time in history, the
proportion of the world's population that lives in countries that
can claim to be broadly democratic has climbed past 50 percent.
Closer scrutiny, however, finds several imposters in the crowd:
countries still ``in transition'' towards full democracy. &QL;

man, a former KGB officer, has been cracking his whip. He has
sounded belligerent towards several of Russia's former vassal
states on its rim, and shows little sign of softening towards
Chechnya, the rebel republic devastated at his command. Things may
yet change but, for the time being at least, Putin remains on
probation. &QL;

HARRINGTON NAMED USA TODAY PLAYER OF THE YEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT MAGOLOFF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Matt Harrington receives typical small-town hero treatment in
Palmdale, Calif., the desert community which fostered his growth.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher, a recent graduate of Palmdale High, is frequently
stopped around town for autographs.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington's growing popularity reached a new peak _ at the
national level _ on Tuesday, when USA Today selected him as the
2000 All-USA Baseball Player of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington was one of four from California named to the
10-player team. A full-length color photo of Harrington, who was
taken in the first round of the major-league draft by the Colorado
Rockies, graced nearly the entire upper half of a page in the
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't think stuff like that can happen,'' Harrington said.
``With (the recent publicity from) Baseball America, I thought
other people might start recognizing me. A lot of places have these
outstanding players and you never heard of it until that player
comes out of there. I think Palmdale's been getting some good
recognition the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever recognition Harrington has received has been due.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Lance Pierson, who retired at the end of the season, said
Harrington has devoted his life to the art of pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Harrington agreed, saying his hard work began to pay off during
the offseason, when he gained confidence by playing travel ball, in
the Area Code games and the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of those years where I knew almost every game was
going to go my way,'' said Harrington, who this season went 11-0
with a 0.54 ERA and struck out 126 batters in 65 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Fans exposed to Harrington for the first time after seeing
Tuesday's USA Today will notice the gaudy statistics and assume how
good he is. Fans in Palmdale already know what the rest of the
nation is just realizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt has taken Palmdale by storm _ it's been awesome for the
community,'' Pierson said. ``You always tell kids to work hard and
you can be whatever you want to be and I guess he's that story.
He's the best (prep) player in the U.S. and that's great.'' &QL;

PEREZ BACK IN STARTING ROTATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At long last, no more wondering if a demotion was
coming, no more lengthy bullpen appearances, no more uncertainty of
any kind.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Perez is a starting pitcher again.
</P>
<P>
   The departure of Orel Hershiser means Perez is in the rotation
for the foreseeable future. His next start is Saturday in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as they give me the ball to pitch, I want to help my
team. I want to win some games,'' Perez said. ``I don't go nowhere.
I was a (starting) pitcher my whole career.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Perez has pitched well enough this season, going 4-3
with a 5.25 ERA. There had been doubt if he would stay after last
season's debacle, when he went 2-10 with a 7.43 ERA. But Perez has
pitched well enough to end those discussions.
</P>
<P>
   His last appearance was in relief, 4 innings Monday against San
Diego in which he gave up no runs and two hits and with one walk.
This followed a similarly strong outing last weekend in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've used me because we don't have guys who can go four,
five innings,'' Perez said. ``It's difficult when you warm up in
the bullpen. You hve to warm up faster. (Monday) night, I threw 17
pitches and that's it. I tell them I'm ready. ... The bullpen needs
rest. The starting pitchers need to go six, seven or eight innings
and then we can go to the other guys.''
</P>
<P>
   ON DEPTH: Hershiser wasn't exactly lighting things up, but
neither has anyone except maybe Kevin Brown _ and even he gave up
some runs in his last start. With the suspension announcement due
soon, Malone said there's nothing to worry about. The team has
depth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have six pitchers,'' Malone said. ``We have five starters
in place, and if we need to, we can use Matt Herges. Mike Judd is
throwing well in Triple-A. Jeff Williams just came off the DL.
Robinson Checo is pitching well, but he's on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got options in the minor leagues, but if it didn't work,
Matt Herges is very flexible. He started in the minor leagues.
That's another option if need be.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who had been on the 60-day DL with an injured left
forearm, was reinstated and optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Herges, 5-0 with a 3.40 ERA in 29 appearances, last pitched
Saturday in St. Louis and gave up one earned run and one hit with
two walks. He was ecstatic about Malone mentioning him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm honored by that,'' he said. ``It makes me want to go out
and prove myself even more.''
</P>
<P>
   WHITE UPDATE: Outfielder Devon White, out with a tear in his
left rotator cuff, hit right-handed off a tee Tuesday and did well,
according to physical trainer Pat Screnar. White hit left-handed
off a tee Sunday and felt similarly fine. Screnar said White will
continue with the tee-hitting program today by hitting from both
sides. &QL;

GORE'S OWN WORDS WILL HURT HIM, REPUBLICANS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES DAO   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Vice President Al Gore announced last week
that he was releasing the transcript from his April 18 interview
with Justice Department investigators, he confidently declared, ``I
think the truth is my friend in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are convinced he is right. Attorney General Janet Reno
is unlikely to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Gore's
1996 fund-raising activities, they say. And voters will be inclined
to view Gore as having been truthful in the interview and
forthright in releasing the transcript.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans clearly believe Gore's transcript will also be
their friend. Even if Reno does not appoint a special prosecutor,
they say, the mere whiff of scandal emanating from the transcript
will hurt the vice president this November.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps more useful, Republican strategists argue, will be
Gore's words themselves. In the frequently combative four-hour
grilling, conducted under oath, the vice president often comes
across as evasive or legalistic, they assert. Many of his answers
are too carefully parsed. And more than a few times, his memory _
considered to be quite excellent _ fails.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Republicans argue, Gore's performance that day
can only bolster their contention that he, like President Clinton,
plays fast and loose with the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I read one of his answers, I laughed out loud because it
sounded so Clintonesque,'' said Mark Miller, the executive director
the Republican Leadership Council, a centrist Republican group.
``He was trying to define the word `raising.' And I just said to
myself, he's learned from the master.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was referring to a passage in which Robert Conrad, the
head of the Justice Department's task force investigating campaign
finance abuses, quizzed Gore about White House events in which
Democratic contributors, or potential contributors, met with
Clinton or Gore over coffee. Had anyone told Gore that those
coffees would be used to raise money? Conrad asked.
</P>
<P>
   Gore replied, ``Well, let me define the term `raising,' if I
could, because if you mean by it, would they be events at which
money was raised, the answer is no.'' In fact, Gore said, the
coffees were a means to show a potential contributors ``respect,''
and the pitch for money would come later. Hence, they were not
fund-raisers, he argued.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad followed up. Did Gore know that, according to a Senate
Republican report, more than 103 White House coffees had helped
raise $26.4 million for the Democrats? And given that report, would
it not be fair to describe the coffees as ``a fund-raising tool?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I hesitate to wordsmith it,'' Gore replied. ``I would not call
them fund-raising tools.''
</P>
<P>
   To some political analysts, such hair-splitting echoes Clinton's
famous response to a question about whether he was having an affair
with Monica Lewinsky: ``It depends on what the definition of is,
is.'' Or Gore's own explanation for why he had not broken the law
when he made fund-raising phone calls from the White House, that
there was ``no controlling legal authority.''
</P>
<P>
   About that reply, Ross Baker, a professor of political science
at Rutgers University, said: ``If he had not used that tortured
expression a few years ago, which has become a mantra for evasion
and subterfuge, I would think this would be less damaging. But
there is a prelude to this. And the prelude has come to define
political weasel words.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's aides argue that the public will see Gore's answers as
reasonable and forthright, given the contentious conditions of the
interview. More important, they assert that the public no longer
cares about the continuing scandal investigations, and that there
may even be an electoral backlash against Republicans who continue
to push for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans think this plays into Clinton fatigue,'' said
Chris Lehane, Gore's press secretary. ``But the thing people are
fatigued with is scandal.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's argument with Conrad over the definition of
``fund-raiser'' spilled over into questions about his 1996
appearance at the Hsi Lai Temple in Los Angeles. In 1996, Gore
described that event as ``community outreach.'' In 1997, he called
it ``a political event'' at which ``finance people were going to be
present.'' And to Conrad, he described it as a ``finance-related
event.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked by Conrad to define what that meant, Gore explained that
the event was not a fund-raiser because, ``There was no
solicitation of money. I did not see any money or checks exchange
hands.''
</P>
<P>
   But several people who attended the temple event, including
Buddhist monks and nuns, later gave checks to the Democratic
National Committee, in many cases using money that was not their
own. The event's organizer, Maria Hsia, was convicted in March for
hiding $109,000 in illegal contributions and making false
statements to federal regulators about the temple luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Conrad questioned Gore about a memorandum in
which Gore was quoted discussing his fund-raising activities. The
vice president asserted that the memorandum was written by an aide.
Conrad asked if the memorandum accurately expressed his views.
</P>
<P>
   Gore responded with this carefully constructed sentence: ``It
would have contained recommendations by someone else as to what I
could say in order to support his understanding of my views.''
</P>
<P>
   In yet another passage, Gore seemed to raise questions about the
sincerity of his own form letters to his supporters. One letter,
full of superlatives, contained ``the kind of routine overstatement
that is quite common,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, when you refer to them as great friends, you don't
necessarily mean that?'' Conrad asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do mean it,'' Gore replied. ``But I don't mean it in the way
that you and I would use the phrase with a lifelong friend that you
met in college or something.''
</P>

   THE CONVENTIONS: PROTEST PLANS MONITORED
</P>
<P>
   Some advance anxiety is on display in Philadelphia, five weeks
before the Republican presidential convention, as organizers of a
protest march voice suspicions that the police are tracking their
plans and photographing them. Some groups have promised extensive
protests and possible civil disobedience, while police officials
have promised to keep the city orderly for the conventioneers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Secret Service, the FBI, the Justice Department and the
Philadelphia police have all videotaped our news conferences,''
said Mike Morrill, one of the organizers of the Unity 2000 protest
march planned for July 31, the eve of the convention. There is
nothing illegal about that, but Morrill said the police were
``doing lots of things to intimidate demonstrators in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Police departments routinely gather intelligence in advance of
demonstrations. But the Philadelphia American Civil Liberties Union
said it would check to see that proper procedures were being
followed.

   THE REPUBLICANS: BIG BREAKFAST FOR BUSH
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gov. George W. Bush of Texas knows how to throw a
breakfast. By offering scrambled eggs at the River Club overlooking
the East River in Manhattan Tuesday, he was able to extract $3
million from about 55 donors for the Republican National Committee.
Neither the campaign nor the committee would identify any of the
people at the event. The location was kept secret from reporters
until the event was over.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Hughes, Bush's spokeswoman, said private events were,
well, private. This also applies to a lunch that Bush is to attend
Wednesday in Cleveland, where each couple will pay $25,000 to raise
$1 million for the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The breakfast was unusual in that such big-ticket events are
rarely held in the morning. (Usually donors get at least lunch.) A
Bush fund-raiser said the donors came from across New York state,
although most were from Manhattan and many were from Wall Street.

   THE THIRD PARTIES: ILLINOIS BALLOT GROWS
</P>
<P>
   The two leading third-party presidential hopefuls, Pat Buchanan
and Ralph Nader, have filed petitions for a ballot spot in
Illinois, a major battleground. Buchanan, the probable Reform Party
nominee, showed up on Monday in Springfield, the capital, to file,
saying he had collected some 67,000 signatures from supporters,
more than twice the 25,000 required. ``Illinois is a crucial swing
state, and if you're not on the ballot in Illinois, you're not a
serious candidate,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   The papers to put Nader, the Green Party nominee, on the ballot
were also filed on Monday, by party officials. Both men say they
expect to make the ballot in almost every state by Election Day.
The two are still well down in the single digits in most national
polls, but in states where Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President
Al Gore are locked in a tight race, such as Illinois, they could be
an influential swing factor.

DEA LOOKS AGAIN AT CASES INVOLVING INFORMER WHO LIED ON WITNESS
STAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Calif., Colo., Ill., Texas, La., Mass., N.J., N.Y.)   By JO THOMAS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   URBANA, Ill. _ Andrew Chambers has the easy manner of a friend
you can trust. Federal agents trusted him, and so did drug dealers.
Over a 16-year career as an undercover informer, Chambers helped
send 445 drug dealers to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a reversal of fortune, the Drug Enforcement
Administration has suspended Chambers and is re-examining the 295
cases in which he was involved. For reasons that are not clear,
Chambers, who is one of the agency's top informers, has been caught
lying on the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our investigation shows he has lied 17 times about his
personal history,'' said Michael McManus, a public information
officer for the agency. ``DEA is concerned about any lies, but
there is no evidence he has ever lied about the facts of a case.
There are lies about his college education, payment of taxes to the
IRS and his arrest records. It appears his motivation was that he
was embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   H. Dean Steward, a former federal public defender in California
who has spent three years trying to get information about Chambers
on behalf of a client, Daniel Bennett, who pleaded guilty in a
murder-for-hire case, said he was outraged about Chamber's lying.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no such things as little lies in federal court,''
said Steward, who has sued the agency in federal court in
Washington, to get information on Chambers. ``DEA has put this guy
on the stand many times, knowing he was a perjurer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I took him down,'' Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers sees things differently, saying the arrests were minor.
</P>
<P>
   He admits he should have told the complete truth about himself,
but he insists he has always told the truth about drug dealers. He
said he doubted that the new turn of events would affect many
cases, saying, ``Ninety-five percent of my cases pleaded out.'' He
said he had not helped send an innocent man to jail.
</P>
<P>
   While out of action, he has gone on something of a public
relations campaign, granting interviews and planning a book and a
movie. But his heart is on the street. ``I'd go back to work
tomorrow if I could,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chambers is 43, and as he arrived for dinner at a local
restaurant, the only thing exceptional about his appearance were
his fingernails, which were manicured and very, very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're real,'' he said, holding them up to the light. ``I
don't look like no cop. I look like somebody that could be a
player. I'm not working, I don't have no 8 to 5, but I'm doing
something.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since he first walked into the drug enforcement
office in Clayton, Mo., to inquire about becoming an agent,
Chambers has been a player, on the government's side. He did not
have the college degree required to be an agent, so he became an
informer.
</P>
<P>
   He was valued, several agency officials said, because he had a
clean record, did not drink, smoke or use drugs, and always tried
to keep himself, the agents and the drug dealers safe. In 16 years,
he said, no one ever pulled a gun on him or robbed him.
</P>
<P>
   McManus said that the agency had some 4,500 informers. Some,
like Chambers, are mercenaries and are hired by the job. Others
have jobs, ranging from baggage handlers to taxi drivers, who serve
the agency as eyes and ears on the street. Many are criminals
seeking reductions in sentences.
</P>
<P>
   He had attended parochial schools, was an altar boy and a Cub
Scout, and played sports.
</P>
<P>
   But he dropped out of high school after two years and joined the
Marines. Three years later, he returned home to try college but
lasted one semester. Then he decided on a career in law enforcement
and chose the DEA because he would not have to wear a uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff McCaskill, a retired drug enforcement agent, worked with
Chambers in 1987 on a Long Beach, Calif., case that he said
involved ``the first and largest crack cocaine organization taken
down in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   That case began when Chambers met Cecil Fuller, the owner of a
Long Beach nightclub, on a flight from Los Angeles to St. Louis,
where Fuller was attending a family reunion. Chambers ingratiated
himself with Fuller and set up a sting operation. Everyone in the
organization ended up in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Chambers has worked for other federal law
enforcement agencies, including the FBI and the IRS, and for police
in many major cities, including Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Denver,
Houston, New Orleans, New York and Newark, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Chambers has been paid some $2.2 million, including
$300,000 for expenses. He now concedes that he mismanaged his money
and neglected to pay federal income tax, which he now owes $64,000.
</P>
<P>
   His credibility problems began with a 1996 case involving Edward
Stanley, a Los Angeles restaurant owner. Chambers had given federal
agents Stanley's cell phone number, and on the resulting wiretap
they overhead Stanley hiring Bennett as a hit man.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to overturn his client's plea-bargained murder
conviction, Steward challenged the search warrant for the wiretap.
</P>
<P>
   Steward learned that Chambers had lied on the stand in earlier
cases, saying he had never been arrested. In fact, he had been
arrested 10 times from 1984 to 1998, with one conviction.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers was twice arrested for soliciting sex and pleaded
guilty in one case, in Denver, to a misdemeanor and paid a fine. He
now says he had hoped that the prostitute, actually an undercover
policewoman, would help him find a drug dealer.
</P>
<P>
   McManus, the DEA public information officer, said senior agency
management learned of Chambers' problems in August 1999, and put
him on restricted use.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Chambers' hometown newspaper in St. Louis, The
Post-Dispatch, published a front page article proclaiming, ``Top
U.S. Drug Snitch Is a Legend and a Liar,'' and in February, the
agency suspended Chambers. Since then, cases in which he was
involved, have been dismissed before trial in Miami and Tampa,
Fla., and in Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are the floodgates going to open and hundreds of defendants
get out of jail?'' Steward asked. ``No, but each case he worked on
has to be looked at.''

GOVERNMENT FAILED TO CONVINCE SCIENTISTS FOR TIGHTER SECURITY,
REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Energy Department has failed to convince
scientists at the government's nuclear weapons laboratories of the
need for tougher security measures to prevent espionage, according
to a new congressional report.
</P>
<P>
   Because senior officials have not convinced the scientists at
the three national weapons laboratories, efforts to impose tougher
security have fallen short, according to the report by the House
Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   New regulations by the Energy Department in the wake of
allegations of Chinese nuclear espionage at Los Alamos National
Laboratory were not accompanied by a strong effort by department
officials to convince the rank-and-file at the laboratories, the
report said. As a result, there has been opposition to subjecting
key weapons scientists to polygraph examinations, while security
training efforts at the laboratories have been dismal.
</P>
<P>
   Convincing laboratory scientists of the need for better security
is vital to receiving their cooperation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson's plan to require about 800
laboratory employees to undergo polygraph examinations as part of a
more stringent security program has drawn intense criticism from
laboratory employees in the past few months. Laboratory employees
have worn buttons to work with slogans like ``Just say no to the
polygraph.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The attitude toward polygraphs at the laboratories runs the
gamut from cautiously and rationally negative to emotionally and
irrationally negative,'' the report stated. ``Moreover, since the
polygraph is a highly visible part of the overall
counterintelligence effort, the entire counterintelligence program
has been negatively affected by this development.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was issued after a review of the laboratories
conducted by a special panel headed by Paul Redmond, former chief
of counterintelligence at the Central Intelligence Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Redmond panel was created by the House intelligence
committee in response to the possibility that China may have
received stolen nuclear data from Los Alamos National Laboratory in
New Mexico. The study was conducted before the latest security
problem: hard drives containing sensitive information about nuclear
weapons that were missing for several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The report acknowledged that the scientists have some legitimate
concerns about whether a polygraph program could be implemented
fairly. But the report also noted that part of the problem was that
the scientists believed they were ``indispensable and special, and
thus should be exempt from such demeaning and intrusive measures as
the polygraph.''
</P>
<P>
   The report criticized the Energy Department's effort to explain
the need for polygraphs to employees as ``ineffectual.'' The
Redmond panel found that resistance to polygraphs had in some cases
been ``unreasonable,'' while the Energy Department's response had
been ``dictatorial and pre-emptory.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel urged the Energy Department to get managers at the
laboratories more heavily involved in selecting the employees who
should undergo polygraph examinations because of the sensitive
nature of their work.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also recommended that the Energy Department and the
laboratories model their programs on those used at the National
Security Agency, the government's code-breaking and eavesdropping
arm. While the laboratories employ physicists and other scientists,
the security agency employs world-class mathematicians and
cryptographers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key factor in NSA's success in the training and awareness
appears to be that its overall integrated security and
counterintelligence program has been in existence for many years,
and the mathematicians enter a culture where, from the very
beginning of their employment, security, counterintelligence and
the polygraph are givens in their daily work,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department, it continued, ``is now starting virtually
from scratch and would do well to learn from the positive
experiences of agencies such as NSA.''

   U.S. GOES TO COURT TO STOP WORLDCOM DEAL FOR SPRINT
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department sought an injunction in federal court
against WorldCom's proposed $115 billion acquisition of Sprint,
citing concerns that the combined company would stifle competition
on the Internet and in the long-distance telephone industry.
</P>
<P>
   The companies said only that they would review their options.
WorldCom and Sprint could fight the government in court, but
executives from the companies have said that they would almost
surely abandon their deal in the face of a Justice Department suit.
Shares of WorldCom increased $2.1875, to $39.6875, while Sprint
fell $1.1875, to $58.375.

EDITORIAL: AFTER THE GENOME ANNOUNCEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Wednesday, June 28:
</P>
<P>
   Now that decipherment of the human genome has been so grandly
trumpeted, practical and highly personal questions inevitably
arise. What difference will this make to me? How soon will it help
or hurt me? The answers were not always easy to discern in the
torrent of commentary after Monday's triumphal announcement that a
public consortium of academic institutions and a private company
had each determined the exact sequence of the vast majority of
chemical letters in the human genetic material. It is those letters
that determine, when strung together as genes, how all the cells in
the human body develop and function. In the commonly used metaphor,
the genome is a blueprint for life.
</P>
<P>
   In the long run, there seems no question that deciphering the
genome will help propel research and medicine to a deeper level of
understanding. Using so-called gene expression chips, scientists
will be able to detect which genes are active in a heart cell and
which are active in a kidney cell, shedding light on what makes
those cells develop differently. They will also be able to compare
gene activity in normal cells and cancer cells, in an effort to
identify all the genes involved in causing the cancer and then to
find a way to intervene at the molecular level. That would leave
today's primary treatments for cancer _ cutting the cancer out, or
zapping it with radiation, or hitting it with a toxic brew of
chemicals _ looking like crude and barbaric relics of a less
sophisticated past.
</P>
<P>
   But what is often lost in the excitement is how long the process
of discovery may take. Everyone expects some medical breakthroughs,
in the form of drugs or diagnostic tests based on the new genetic
understandings, to emerge in the next 5 to 10 years, but no one can
say for certain just what the breakthroughs will be. Dr. Francis
Collins, head of the publicly funded Human Genome Project, hazarded
a guess that within the next decade there will be tests to tell
people what genetically influenced diseases, such as diabetes and
heart disease, they are at increased risk for, and that in 15 to 20
years drugs will be targeted on the precise molecular problem
contributing to, say, cancer or mental illness. But Collins seemed
much less sanguine about manipulating the aging process to extend
the human life span, calling that far less certain to happen over
the next 40 to 50 years, though it could.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody really knows. Indeed, the truth is that simply knowing
the exact sequence of chemical units in the human genetic material
does not tell scientists much about how the genes function, how
they interact with each other, or what proteins they produce to
catalyze events in the body's cells. The proteins are the real
center of interest in biology and the most likely targets of drug
treatments. Their mysteries will be far harder to penetrate than
was the genome. That is why eminent biologists have been saying
there is a century of work ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, having the entire genome laid out on computer
databases will be a great advantage because researchers can search
for relevant genes at speeds unimagined in the recent past. At
Monday's ceremonies, key scientists in the genome work recounted
how genes that took a decade of hard work to find in the 1980s
could be found today by a single postgraduate student in anywhere
from 15 seconds to two weeks, just by searching a database. That
enormous amplification of research power alone warrants all the
exuberance over the genome project. &QL;

IN NBA DRAFTS, THE EMPHASIS IS ON THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE WISE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Kenyon Martin is still rehabilitating the leg he
fractured three months ago, but insists he will be healthy for
training camp. ``I should be fine,'' he said. ``I just have to work
extra hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Darius Miles has not had a full-time job but he would like to be
a sixth or seventh man for a National Basketball Association team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think teams will pick me like they did Kevin Garnett or
Tracy McGrady or Kobe _ a player that comes straight out of high
school that can learn quickly, like they did,'' the 18-year-old
said Tuesday. ``That's how I think teams look at me. I don't think
they look at me to dominate the game.''
</P>
<P>
   This is not your grandfather's draft. It is not even Garnett's
1995 draft. They're calling it the Stars of Tomorrow Auction.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, the consensus national college basketball player of the
year, is expected to be taken No. 1 Wednesday night by the
soft-in-the-middle Nets.
</P>
<P>
   Stromile Swift's two-month ascension from unknown LSU
shot-blocker to bona fide lottery pick will most likely end with
the Vancouver Grizzlies selecting the 6-foot-9 forward No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa State power forward Marcus Fizer may not get past the Los
Angeles Clippers at No. 3, leaving the Chicago Bulls with the
prospect of taking Miles with the fourth pick. Chris Mihm, the
7-foot Texas center, is expected not to go lower than No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   After Florida's Mike Miller, Cincinnati's DerMarr Johnson and
Fresno State's Courtney Alexander, the nation's leading scorer, a
plethora of forwards and 6-foot-and-under point guards will compete
for attention in the Target Center green room.
</P>
<P>
   Another bumper crop of early-entry candidates applied. Of the 37
prospects, 27 are college underclassmen, eight are international
players and two are high school teen-agers. After Miles, DeShawn
Stevenson out of Washington Union High School in Fresno, Calif.,
hopes to become the 15th player in the league's modern era to jump
straight from high school to the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   With the proliferation of teen-agers still storming the league
with alarming regularity, free agency has proven more of a quick
fix than the draft in recent years. But there are power brokers who
still see the annual talent auction as a genuine way to build their
teams.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago general manager Jerry Krause, who once nabbed Scottie
Pippen and Charles Oakley, possesses the Nos. 4, 7 and 24 picks in
the first round, not to mention the 32nd through 34th picks in the
second round. Orlando has the 5th, 10th and 13th selections, while
the Clippers pick No. 3, No. 18 and No. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, six players from three teams were swapped today in
the first action of the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee dealt forwards Robert Traylor and J.R. Reid to the
Cavaliers while trading veteran guard Vinny Del Negro to the
Warriors. Cleveland dealt guard Bob Sura to the Warriors, and
Golden State sent forwards Jason Caffey and Billy Owens to
Milwaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, out of Cincinnati, would become the second power forward
to go No. 1 in consecutive years after Chicago plucked Elton Brand
out of Duke last June. He would also be the first top pick from
Dallas since the Charlotte Hornets selected Larry Johnson No. 1 in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets ran a battery of tests on Martin's broken leg and had
their doctors closely inspect the injury. No long-term effects were
projected, and Nets president Rod Thorn has intimated he will most
likely take Martin with the first pick _ if Orlando does not pry it
out of his hands with a lucrative deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That remains to be seen,'' Martin said today. ``I'm going to
do all I can to help the team win if I'm there. They have Keith,
Stephon, Kendall Gill and people like that, so they have a pretty
good nucleus already.''
</P>
<P>
   If Martin does not go No. 1? ``I don't think I'll slip far,'' he
said. ``If I don't go No. 1, there's a good chance I'll go two or
three.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles is the most intriguing player available. Lean and agile at
6-9 and less than 220 pounds, he can sky over defenders or contort
his way through mounds of muscle in the pain. Last year, he worked
as a counselor at Michael Jordan's summer camp in Santa Barbara,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a little counselor game every night and he picked me
to be on his team every night,'' Miles said of Jordan, who has
publicly stated he would take Miles if Washington had the No. 1
pick. He truly liked the kid's precocious behavior.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody like the Lakers or Portland had a top pick, I know
I'd never get to play,'' Miles said when asked if he'd rather go to
a lottery team. ``Sometimes I'd probably just put my warm-up suit
on, and not even my jersey. Low teams need the lottery pick. They
need players that are going to make a difference. Like Vince
Carter. He came in, and three years later they made the playoffs.
If you get a player with a whole lot of potential, he can turn your
franchise around.''
</P>
<P>
   In earlier times, that was the goal on draft day. These days,
NBA teams realize they have more projects than perennial All-Stars
on their hands. &QL;

SOSA TALKS NEARLY OVER, ONE WAY OR ANOTHER 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The Sammy Sosa trade talks envelop the New York
Yankees like a fog that won't go away. But the president of the
Chicago Cubs wants the discussions settled, one way or the other.
And the Yankee manager, Joe Torre, has suggested to club executives
that for the good of the team, they should make a deal or move on.
</P>
<P>
   With pressure for a resolution mounting from both sides, Sosa
could be a Yankee within 24 hours, in a trade of five to seven
prospects for Sosa and pitcher Ismael Valdes. Or the Yanks might
make another deal, perhaps with the Oakland Athletics, Pittsburgh
Pirates or the Baltimore Orioles. Or, they might do nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for this thing to be prolonged any
further,'' said Andy MacPhail, the Cubs' vice president, in a
telephone interview Tuesday night. ``I will push for this to come
to a resolution one way or another shortly. It's not that hard. We
can agree, or we can agree to disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said, ``Make it happen, or make it go away.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and the Cubs are on the verge of settling on a trade
that would send a stable of prospects _ shortstop Alfonso Soriano,
infielder D'Angelo Jimenez, pitchers Jake Westbrook and Alex
Graman, outfielder Jackson Melian and outfielder Ricky Ledee are
among those being discussed _ to Chicago for Sosa and Valdes, a
right-handed pitcher who would presumably join the Yankees'
rotation. Once the two sides reach an agreement on players, then
the Yankees would presumably receive a 72-hour window within which
to negotiate a contract with Sosa and to persuade him to waive his
right to veto the trade.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides understand now where the middle ground is. They both
understand what it will take to complete a deal. But while the
Yankees continue to talk to the Cubs _ one Yankee official
indicated that the Cubs are pushing to complete the deal _ New York
is evaluating the implications of the huge commitment in money and
prospects the trade would entail.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, whose farm teams are solid but not teeming with
prospects, would bite deep into their system and swap a handful of
young players who could help them, while earning low salaries, in
the years to come. In return, they would receive Valdes, a talented
but erratic pitcher whose mound fortitude has been repeatedly
questioned, and a high-impact offensive player who could contribute
lots of home runs, lots and lots of strikeouts and phenomenal
marquee value.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees could go in another direction. They have had
discussions with the Oakland Athletics about acquiring an offensive
player, possibly outfielder Ben Grieve, whose salary will skyrocket
next year, or Olmedo Saenz or Matt Stairs; Oakland covets Soriano
and Shane Spencer.
</P>
<P>
   The Pittsburgh Pirates represent a more modest deal that would
bring the Yankees a pitcher and a hitter _ either Francisco Cordova
or Jose Silva, both right-handed pitchers, paired with either the
proven hitter Wil Cordero or the veteran John Vander Wal. The
Yankees also spoke with the Baltimore Orioles today about the
availability of the right-hander Scott Erickson, and continued
discussions about the left-handed-hitting outfielder B.J. Surhoff;
these talks are not yet serious.
</P>
<P>
   Talks regarding Houston's Moises Alou are all but destined to
fail; Alou has a no-trade provision in his contract and doesn't
want to be dealt.
</P>
<P>
   What the Yankees must decide is whether they are ready to take
the Sosa leap; it's the bungee jump of their trade options.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody involved, from executives to players, want the Yankees
to jump quickly, or back off quickly. Bernie Williams, the Yankees'
center fielder and the team's leader, believes the trade talks have
weighed on the team, which has lost 24 of its last 39 games. ``You
see a guy trying to press, like it's their last game,'' Williams
said. ``Everybody's wondering what's going to happen. Even if it
takes away only 5 percent of our attention, or 10 percent, it's
still a distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams didn't mention Ledee's name directly, but he might as
well have. Ledee has been on edge since spring training, when his
name was part of the Jim Edmonds trade talks, and particularly
since May, when George Steinbrenner wondered aloud whether Ledee
was tough enough to play in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee learned last Thursday that he was part of the conditional
Juan Gonzalez deal with Detroit, and for four days, he waited to
see if Gonzalez would reach a contract agreement with the Yankees.
Each day, Ledee wondered if it was his last with the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, Ledee flipped on his computer in the Atheneum
hotel in downtown Detroit, and the first headline he saw said that
Gonzalez had turned down a one-year offer from the Yankees. Ledee
signed on to the Yankees' Web site, and he read as fans batted his
name back and forth in trade rumors, for Sosa, for Cordero. He
turned the computer off well past midnight.

 &HT;    Dad as coach helps Capriati win at Wimbledon
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Jennifer Capriati won her first-round match
Tuesday at Wimbledon, this time with the same coach she had when
she became the youngest player in history to win a match here: her
father.
</P>
<P>
   Stefano Capriati recently received the official title from his
daughter after not having it for seven years, she said after
upsetting No. 16 seed Dominique Van Roost 6-2, 6-4 in her
first-round match.
</P>
<P>
   Capriati, 24, realized she needed a coach after her first-round
bomb-out in Paris and then jointly decided with her father that he
was the right man for the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the French, it was just like, 'Forget this. I need
somebody as my coach.' I think my dad is the perfect person for
right now,'' she said. ``So far it's good. I've done well the last
couple weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati and former coach Harold Solomon parted ways in April,
soon after she was linked romantically with fellow player Xavier
Malisse at the Ericsson Open. Solomon won't discuss the split, but
it came at his request.
</P>
<P>
   ``That happens,'' she said. ``Just because we got together and
had that relationship, it's not always going to be a forever thing.
We didn't see things on the same terms in some areas.''
</P>
<P>
   She credited Solomon with helping her get over a competitive
hump in the 12 months they worked together and she plans to carry
on with many things he taught her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've definitely had enough experience playing this
game,'' Capriati said. ``Hopefully I'm strong-willed enough that I
don't need somebody there all the time. You know, I'm not like a
little baby here.''
</P>
<P>
   But her fitness level has faltered _ she looked winded
throughout her match _ and her results bottomed out for a few weeks
with three straight opening-round losses.
</P>
<P>
   It was a shock after Capriati had started the year in great
shape and with great fanfare, losing a close match to Lindsay
Davenport in the Australian Open semifinals and defeating Serena
Williams at the Ericsson before losing in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   However, since putting her father on her official team, Capriati
reached the quarterfinals in Birmingham two weeks ago and the
semifinals last week in Holland where she lost to eventual champion
Martina Hingis.
</P>
<P>
   Stefano Capriati, of course, was widely blamed for _ however
unintentionally _ smothering his daughter and pressuring her as a
young player. She turned pro at 13 and advanced to the fourth round
of Wimbledon in 1990 at age 14.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, she reached a career-high ranking of No. 6, but by late
1993, she had quit the tour and for several years, she struggled
publicly with growing up.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Dad will restrict his work primarily to
coaching duties, Capriati said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, he was my dad, there doing everything,'' she said.
``But now, on the court, I just let him say whatever as any
coach.''
</P>
<P>
   She thinks he's a perfect fit to help her tennis because he
knows her game and her so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``He started me playing tennis,'' she said. ``He knows the way
to tell me things so I understand them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though flags certainly will rise at this reconnection,
Capriati said she's aware and feels confident he will be able to
separate the father/daughter relationship from the coach/player
relationship and that it won't cause problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's getting better at it, especially now that I'm
older,'' she said. ``It's going to be tough always to get a
complete separation. I don't want that anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Capriati is seeking a balance between those roles, despite
knowing many players have struggled to find it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're learning,'' she said. ``It helps that I'm older and I
have my own things going. I have my boyfriend here. That makes it a
little bit easier.''
</P>
<P>
   She wouldn't reveal anything her father has done to help her
game but did say Malisse provided a pointer on her serve that has
helped.
</P>
<P>
   But both men in her life have pushed her toward contentment and
that has made tennis easier, whether she's winning or losing, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good thing because I won't take it as serious,''
Capriati said. ``It's good having the support in my personal life,
off the court. That helps me cope with the tennis.''

REPORT: AIRLINES BLAMING CONTROLLERS FOR DELAYS, RATHER THAN
TRUTH 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Airlines, required to tell their passengers if a
flight will be delayed, often blame air traffic control, even if
the real reason is bad weather, a shortage of crew members or
maintenance problems, the Transportation Department said in a
report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, intended to gauge how well the airlines are meeting
their customer service commitments, was ordered by Congress last
fall and issued by the department's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The report said there was ``major room for improvement in the
accuracy, reliability and timeliness of the airlines'
communications to customers about the status of flights.'' In
general, the inspector general found, the airlines were making a
``clear and genuine'' effort to keep their promises, but that the
results were mixed. The airlines ``have a ways to go to restore
customer confidence,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines agreed to improve service last year to stave off
legislation that would have required such action. The House and
Senate held hearings on the issue because of growing complaints
about overbooking, lost baggage and delays, including an incident
in Detroit last year, when hundreds of Northwest Airlines
passengers were stuck on snowbound planes for up to eight hours.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general, Kenneth Mead, said there was still room
for improvement on the airlines' promise to offer consumers the
lowest fare for which they are eligible. In some cases, the report
said, telephone ticket agents did not ask callers if they were
willing to adjust their itineraries to get a cheaper fare.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines promised to use their best efforts to return lost
baggage within 24 hours, but the report found that the carriers
cannot agree on what 24 hours means. Some started the clock when a
passenger filed a missing bag claim, while others started it only
when the bag finally arrived at the destination airport.
</P>
<P>
   The airlines, at a news briefing earlier Tuesday, said they had
generally improved. American Airlines said it was providing more
leg room on all domestic flights by removing some seats;
Continental said it had set up service planning centers at hub
airports to help re-book passengers or find them hotel
reservations; Delta said it was installing automated ticketing
kiosks to cut waiting time; and United said it was providing
``mobile workstations'' to help reduce lines when passengers rush
to rebook.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said the report was evidence that
Congress should have made the improvements mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hard, independent evidence that there is a big gap
between what the airlines have promised the passengers and what
they have actually delivered,'' Wyden said.

COOPERATIVE BAPTISTS TRY TO PUT THE PAST BEHIND 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   They are the ``other'' Southern Baptists _ the ones who don't
have a quarrel with Disney.
</P>
<P>
   Many are ``moderates,'' those who largely ran Southern Baptist
Convention agencies and seminaries until conservatives, in a long,
determined effort, wrested control away and ousted them. They still
carry wounds, many of them, from those wars in the convention in
the 1980s. The bitterness of the struggles occasionally shows up in
their conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the members of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship say they
have tried to put the past behind them and create an organization
united around what made them Baptist in the first place: individual
and congregational autonomy, evangelism and missions.
</P>
<P>
   The fellowship will hold its annual national General Assembly in
Orlando, Fla., from Thursday to July 1, with about 4,500
participants sitting in seats recently vacated by Southern Baptist
Convention members, who met at the Orange County Convention Center
June 13 and 14. Unlike the Southern Baptist Convention, which has
asked members to boycott the Walt Disney Co., the fellowship is
holding sessions at Epcot with Disney's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly marks the ninth year for the organization that
began as a refuge for like-minded Southern Baptists who were
alienated from their denomination. It now has more than 1,800
contributing churches and a $15.5 million budget that supports 40
staff members and 150 missionaries. By contrast, the Southern
Baptist Convention counts more than 41,000 churches and has a
comprehensive budget of more than $927 million.
</P>
<P>
   Most churches that contribute to the fellowship also give money
to and would be counted by the Southern Baptist Convention, which
is possible because Baptist churches are autonomous and
participation in any organization is voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   Fellowship leaders insist it was never intended to be an
organization like the Southern Baptist Convention, only a
loose-knit cooperative, but it has the outward appearance of a
denomination. It supports, but does not run, 11 seminaries that
sprang up as moderate alternatives to the six Southern Baptist
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a partnering network rather than owning and operating a
lot of programs. I think we fulfill a denominational role, but we
don't do it with a convention model,'' said the Rev. Daniel Vestal,
the fellowship's chief executive, from his office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Vestal said the CBF is healthy and growing, pointing to 20 state
or regional affiliated ``networks.'' Ongoing controversies in the
SBC, such as this year's revision of the Baptist Faith and Message
document that declared ``the office of pastor is limited to men as
qualified by Scripture,'' continue to drive churches into the arms
of the fellowship, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The CBF is at something of a crossroads, and one of its major
agenda items, to be considered Friday, is a strategic plan to
continue the direction the fellowship has chosen: putting together
networks rather than building a bureaucracy. Offices in Atlanta
would be named the CBF Resource Center, and a chief operating
officer would be added to coordinate the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the CBF has done a good job of focusing the energy of
disaffected people,'' said Greg Warner, executive editor of
Associated Baptist Press, an independent news agency in
Jacksonville, Fla., formed in 1990 with support from the CBF. ``It
has been a struggle at times, because `moderate Baptist' means
they're not going to get excited about much of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat and Carolyn Anderson, who live in Lakeland, Fla., are
coordinators of the CBF in Florida. They said differences between
the CBV and the SBC are illustrated by each group's annual
meetings. The upcoming assembly will keep business sessions to a
minimum, spending most of its time in educational workshops and
small discussion groups. There will be no resolutions or
pronouncements on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``An observer would see more openness. You would see a lot more
lay persons. You'd see a lot more women in leadership roles,'' Pat
Anderson said. ``Our moderator is Sarah Frances Anders, a lay woman
from Louisiana, and next year it will be Donna Forrester, who is on
the staff of First Baptist Church in Greenville, S.C. At the
Southern Baptist Convention, all the speakers in favor of the
Baptist Faith and Message were white male clergy.''
</P>
<P>
   The disputes between factions in the convention 10 to 15 years
ago centered on the interpretation of the Bible. The issue of
whether women could be ordained or be pastors served as a dividing
line between the way conservatives and moderates interpreted the
Bible.
</P>
<P>
   The Andersons both were raised in Southern Baptist churches.
Pat's father was a pastor and director of missions for an
association, or district. Pat was elected first vice president of
the Florida Baptist Convention for 1986-87. Carolyn was elected
second vice president of the state convention _ the second woman to
hold statewide office _ for 1988-89.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida Baptists were firmly in the conservative camp, and
as the conservatives gained power in the national convention, the
Andersons say they were no longer welcome in state convention
circles. In August 1990, after it was clear that conservatives had
consolidated their hold on the SBC's power structure, disaffected
moderates met to consider their options. Pat Anderson was asked to
coordinate the group from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The Andersons' first mailing list had 112 people. Today they
have about 8,000 addresses, a staff of five _ soon to be six _ and
a $450,000 budget. About 50 churches in Florida support them.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Baptist leaders seem to have adopted a strategy of
officially ignoring the CBF. There are occasional discussions in
national or state meetings about not accepting money from churches
that also give to the fellowship, but Florida Baptist Convention
leaders say that has never been an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a CBF-aligned church needs assistance from our staff, we're
going to work with them,'' said Don Hepburn, vice president for
public relations at the Florida Baptist Convention. ``We have not
tried to draw any line in the sand. We don't view them as
competitors. There's such a great need for evangelism, it's going
to take all of us working together.''

N.Y. STATE LEVIES $133,600 IN FINES FOR LATE REPORTS ON LOBBYING 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The state lobbying commission assessed $133,600
in fines Tuesday, quadruple what it levied in all of 1998, in a
sign that a new lobbying law and a get-tough attitude by the
commission are affecting a culture of lax compliance with
disclosure rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Temporary State Commission on Lobbying fined 37
organizations, including the New York Yankees, New School
University, the accounting firm of Ernst &AMP; Young, Polytechnic
University of Brooklyn, the unions representing New York City's
police detectives and paramedics, and various less famous
transgressors _ all for failure to meet filing deadlines.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyists and their clients are required to disclose lobbying
income and expenses every three months. But under the old law, a
missed deadline brought nothing more than a warning, followed by a
grace period in which the report could be filed late without
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   The new law, adopted in December, eliminates the grace period
and allows fines up to $25,000 for violations of the disclosure
rules, up from a maximum of $5,000 under the old law.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was revealed that the chief lobbyist in Albany for
Philip Morris, the world's largest tobacco company, had failed to
disclose dinners, tickets to events and other gifts to legislators
and other state officials, and had falsified many of her lobbying
reports.
</P>
<P>
   After those disclosures, the commission _ which, despite its
name, has existed since the 1970s _ began flexing its muscles. In
November, it assessed fines of $75,000 against Philip Morris and
$15,000 against its lobbyist, Sharon T. Portnoy, for repeated
violations of the law. No person, company or firm had ever been
fined more than $5,000 in a single case.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the commission fined Microsoft $30,000 for filing a
report that misstated who had attended a dinner it gave at a
Manhattan restaurant for city and state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's fines were meted out against one lobbyist and 37
lobbying clients for failure to file year-end reports on 1999
lobbying by Jan. 15. The commission held a public hearing on the
late reports last week, then held a closed meeting to set the
fines, which ranged from $1,500 to $5,000. Officials at the
commission declined to explain the differing amounts.
</P>
<P>
   In a written statement, the commission said that in addition to
the fines, it had already charged fees of up to $25 for each day a
report was late.
</P>
<P>
   The commission assessed $21,900 in fines for all of 1997. In
1998, the figure rose to $33,300. In 1999, it jumped to $103,750,
but $90,000 of that was the Philip Morris case.
</P>
<P>
   So far, this year, the commission has levied $183,600 in fines,
almost half of it for late filings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year's only half over,'' said David M. Grandeau, executive
director of the commission. ``I'm sure there will be more.''

SOTOMAYOR, BANNED FOR DRUG, IS OUT OF GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Javier Sotomayor, the Cuban world record-holder in the high jump
and the only person to leap eight feet, was suspended Tuesday for a
positive drug test and banned from competing in the 2000 Summer
Olympics in Sydney, Australia, track and field's international
governing body announced.
</P>
<P>
   Sotomayor, the 1992 Olympic champion, who has jumped 8 feet {
inch, tested positive for cocaine at the 1999 Pan American Games in
Winnipeg, Manitoba, and was stripped of first place.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban sports officials declined to suspend the 32-year-old
Sotomayor, saying that his urine sample had been manipulated. But
in international sports, it is up to the athlete to prove his or
her innocence in a doping offense, which Sotomayor was unable to do
before an arbitration panel of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation, which is based in Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   The two-year suspension from international competition is
retroactive to last summer and will remain in effect until July 30,
2001.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, he would have been subjected to a four-year
suspension, but the IAAF has reduced its most severe punishment in
doping offenses to two years after losing several right-to-work
cases in court.
</P>
<P>
   Next week, another IAAF arbitration panel is expected to rule on
an appeal of a suspension by Merlene Ottey, a multiple world and
Olympic medalist from Jamaica, who tested positive for the steroid
nandrolone, Reineri said.
</P>
<P>
   The IAAF's doping commission will also probably review the case
of Dieter Baumann, the German distance runner who won the 5,000
meters at the 1992 Summer Olympics and who also tested positive for
nandrolone last year.
</P>
<P>
   Nandrolone, which has been easily detectable for years, has
surfaced in recent months in several cases. Some athletes and
scientists believe that it is being consumed in nutritional
supplements that are not properly labeled.

   JOSEPH RUVANE Jr., 75, EXECUTIVE WHO AIDED GROWTH OF GLAXO  
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joseph Jerome Ruvane Jr., a pharmaceuticals executive who capped
50 years in the industry by helping turn Glaxo Inc. into America's
fastest-growing major drug company, died June 21 at a hospital in
Durham, N.C., where he lived. He was 75.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was pancreatic cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Ruvane was recruited as Glaxo's president in 1981, and he later
served as chairman and chief executive with added responsibilities
for Central and South American operations. In 1983, he entered into
a joint agreement with Hoffmann LaRoche Inc. to introduce Glaxo's
anti-ulcer drug, Zantac, which became a runaway success.
</P>
<P>
   The undertaking tripled the company's marketing effectiveness,
the company said, and let it compete with industry giants like
SmithKline Beecham. Ruvane's strategy, it said, caused Zantac to
make the most impressive entry into the U.S. market of any drug up
to that time.
</P>
<P>
   Ruvane steered the company's move from Florida to new
headquarters and research and manufacturing centers in Research
Triangle Park, N.C. Since then the corporation has become Glaxo
Wellcome Inc., a subsidiary of Glaxo Wellcome PLC of Britain
</P>
<P>
   Ruvane was the first American to be named to the board of the
parent company, Glaxo Holdings PLC. He retired in 1989 as chairman
and chief operating officer, but continued to serve as vice
chairman of Glaxo Inc. and chairman of the Glaxo Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   He led Glaxo into becoming a substantial corporate supporter of
cultural, educational and social causes in the region, including
Duke University, the University of North Carolina, local and county
schools, and Habitat for Humanity, among others. After his
retirement he served on the boards of several startup biotechnology
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Jersey City, N.J., Ruvane graduated in biological
science from the University of Virginia in 1947 and took business
courses as he stepped into a career in pharmaceuticals. Before
taking the presidency of Glaxo in 1981, he served for 10 years as
president of Organon Inc., a pharmaceutical company based in West
Orange, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Ruvane is survived by his wife of 47 years, Joan Duncan Stewart
Ruvane; four daughters, Emily Johnston, of Tucson, Ariz., Sharon
Neison, of Stowe, Vt., and Mary B. and Patricia Ruvane, of Chapel
Hill, N.C.; two sons, Joseph III. of Henryville, Pa., and Louis S.,
of La Jolla, Calif.; a brother, John A., of Ponte Vedra Beach,
Fla.; a sister, Anne R. McKelvey. of Melbourne, Fla; and seven
grandchildren.

MOTHER AND SON RECEIVE LIFE IMPRISONMENT FOR KILLING WOMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE E. FINKELSTEIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A mother and son who were convicted of killing a New
York city woman in a plot to seize her town house proclaimed their
innocence Tuesday in bizarre, rambling, and sometimes vulgar,
statements before a judge, who then sentenced them both to life in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   A jury on May 18 had found Sante Kimes, 65, and her son,
Kenneth, 25, guilty of murdering Irene Silverman, whose body was
never found.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Judge Rena K. Uviller of State Supreme Court in
Manhattan sentenced Kimes to 120 years to life in prison, and her
son to 126 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   Uviller described Kimes as a ``sociopath'' of ``unremitting
malevolence,'' and her son as a ``vacuous dupe'' who had evolved
into a ``remorseless predator'' under his mother's influence.
</P>
<P>
   The sentence capped a bizarre day in which Sante and Kenneth
Kimes railed against their own lawyers, the police, the district
attorney and the judge in meandering statements. Kimes even accused
Uviller of using hand signals to conspire with prosecutors
throughout the trial.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our precious civil and constitutional rights were
trampled,'' Kimes said. ``Much like the witch hunts of old Salem,
the police planted and planted and planted evidence to fool the
jury,'' she said, adding, ``No one has been told the truth in this
case.''
</P>
<P>
   The grandiosity and self-pity of their statements came as little
surprise to more than a dozen detectives who sat in the jury box
Tuesday to watch the sentencing. They had searched for Silverman's
body without success, but had uncovered what they have called a
trail of fraud, theft, arson, identify theft and murder that
stretched from Hawaii to Las Vegas to the Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
   Police also turned up 14 notebooks in which Kimes, whose son had
rented an apartment in Silverman's house in 1998, wrote of her plan
to murder the wealthy socialite, dispose of her body, then assume
her identity and steal her townhouse, valued at $7.7 million. The
notebooks, along with a forged deed to the house, allowed
prosecutors to build a successful murder case, even without a body.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses' legal battles do not end in New York. They are
expected to stand trial in Los Angeles on charges that they killed
a former business associate, David Kazdin, whose body was found in
a garbage bin near Los Angeles International Airport. A spokeswoman
for Gil Garcetti, the Los Angeles district attorney, said that
extradition proceedings would begin this week.
</P>
<P>
   Kimes' lawyer, Michael Hardy, argued before the sentencing
Tuesday that his client was not so evil that she deserved to die in
jail. ``Is Kimes a Hitler?'' he asked. ``Is she a Mussolini? Is she
a Jack the Ripper?''
</P>
<P>
   Kimes' own statement did little to soften her image as she
criticized almost everyone who participated in her trial, then
proclaimed it was ``the first time in United States history that an
innocent mother and son have been convicted of a crime that didn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Uviller urged her to come to the point, but as Hardy intervened
in an effort to stop her from speaking further, Kimes went on to
say that ``the only murderers in this case are the prosecutors, for
murdering our Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kimes finally exceeded her allotted time, Uviller
interrupted her and said, ``Ms. Kimes, your performance, I mean
your statement, is over,'' at which point jurors and friends of
Silverman cheered.
</P>
<P>
   Mel Sachs, the lawyer for Limes' son, then tried to distinguish
his client from Kimes by saying that the son did not have the
luxury in life of choosing his own mother and that unlike her, the
son felt remorse.
</P>
<P>
   But Kenneth Kimes then gave a long, disjointed. He began by
saying that his mother was scared of law enforcement officials. He
then turned to the detectives in the jury box and said, ``No
offense, but you're spooky.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to accuse a witness in the California case of
murdering Silverman, claim that he had been illegally interrogated,
and complained about the exclusion of Court TV from the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   In sentencing, Uviller first spoke of Silverman as someone who
embodied the best of New York City and was interested in its
``buzz,'' opening her home to boarders without regard to ``class,
education or wealth.'' Then she described Kimes as ``the most
degenerate defendant who has ever appeared in this courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   As the judge made her remarks and imposed the maximum sentences,
the mother and son sat silently. As they were led from the
courtroom, detective Anthony Vasquez called out from the jury box,
``You have plenty of time to tell us where Irene Silverman is.''

DEAL KEEPS L.A. COUNTY HEALTH CARE FROM COLLAPSE, FOR NOW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY ANDERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Narrowly averting bankruptcy of Los Angeles
County's public hospitals and clinics, federal, state and county
officials agreed to a $1.2 billion bailout, with penalties for
failing to cut inpatient care.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking an impasse in negotiations, Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky
said federal, state and county officials in Washington, D.C.,
reached an 11th- hour accord Tuesday designed to wean the health
care system off outside money over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost immediately, the county will have to seriously begin to
position itself for restructuring. There is some real pain
associated with this waiver,'' Yaroslavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich said he is concerned about
whether the health care system can become self-sufficient after
five years, calling the pact potentially a ``five-year meltdown''
for Los Angeles County, the nation's largest with nearly 10 million
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The state has agreed to contribute $300 million, while the
federal government will contribute $900 million. The county will
spend $80 million a year $60 million in tobacco revenues - for a
total of $400 million in the next five years, Yaroslavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The contributions in the form of a waiver from Medicaid rules
are modeled after a deal the county won five years ago to save the
sprawling health care system from financial collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The difference this time is the county is on its own come 2005,
and it must log 3 million patients a year at its 170 outpatient
clinics or face large fines. About $96 million in state and federal
money could be withheld if the county fails to keep those numbers
up, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``While preserving health care treatment for low-income
residents, this agreement institutes tough new accountability
measures to assist Los Angeles in moving away from emergency room
care and toward community health clinics,'' California Gov. Gray
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Projections for the year ending June 30 show the county is
meeting the 3 million mark, said John Wallace, spokesman for the
county Department of Health Services. ``The county is committed to
maintaining those numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   For the uninsured people and clinic and hospital workers, news
of the agreement brought happiness and relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hallelujah!'' exclaimed Gretchen McGinley, who oversees eight
Valley Care Health Centers. ``The closer we came to July 1 the
higher everyone's anxiety level was.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ricardo Puertas, a physician at El Proyecto del Barrio
Family Health Care Clinic in the working-class Pacoima neighborhood
of Los Angeles, said the agreement eases worries for many patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``This last week we had patients who didn't know what they were
going to do. Some of them planned to rely on their families to pay
for their medications,'' he said.

   Under the proposed agreement, which must be ratified by the
federal government, the Governor's Office and county supervisors,
Wallace said the health department does not expect any cuts in
services.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is we'll be able to keep the service level
that currently exists,'' Wallace said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement also commits up to $40 million in state and county
funds to train or retrain workers affected by the county's efforts
to restructure its health care system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some difficult times ahead of us,'' Supervisor Don
Knabe said. ``For us to become self-sustaining is going to be very
difficult.''

<P>
   Yaroslavsky said he had conversations with U.S. Sen. Dianne
Feinstein, D-Calif., and President Clinton over the weekend about
the waiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I laid out an idea on how we could break the logjam, which she
(Feinstein) endorsed and today we have a deal,'' Yaroslavsky said.
``The president heard our plea. We were so close for so many weeks
to a deal that it made no sense for this to go on.''

SUBWAY PLAN STALLS FOR ROCKER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ John Rocker may not be riding the No. 7 train to Shea
Stadium after all, but his pending four-day visit remains a
headache, and police officials said Tuesday that undercover police
officers would be in the stands to protect the Atlanta Braves
pitcher from unruly fans.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of undercover officers is one in a series of
strategies the police are planning to ensure that Rocker is not
assaulted or injured during a four-game series between the Braves
and the Mets, which begins Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the moves under discussion are designed to protect
Rocker should he go through with his avowed plan to travel to Shea
on the No. 7 subway line, whose riders are among the New Yorkers he
has chosen to belittle.
</P>
<P>
   But doubt was cast on Rocker's plan Tuesday night. In Montreal,
Braves manager Bobby Cox said the Braves had made it clear to
Rocker that they did not want him riding the No. 7 train, and Cox
seemed to think Rocker would comply. And one of Rocker's teammates
_ catcher Javier Lopez _ said flat out that Rocker, who was not
talking, would not be on the subway.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, Bud Selig, the baseball commissioner, who
suspended and fined Rocker for his remarks about foreigners, gays
and members of minorities, said he was confident that everything
surrounding Rocker's stay in New York would be handled properly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to the mayor,'' Selig said, referring to Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani. ``I've talked to the Braves. The Braves are
talking to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Rocker announced his intention to take the train to
the game, baseball officials have said privately they do not
believe he will.
</P>
<P>
   Rocker himself did not want to discuss anything on Tuesday.
Especially not his anti-New York diatribe to Sports Illustrated, in
which he said that he could never live in New York because riding
the No. 7 train was like riding through Beirut. Rocker also made
derogatory comments about immigrants, gays, young mothers,
Asian-American women, ex-convicts and even people with purple hair,
causing him to be deemed a racist by some and helping to create a
tense and rowdy atmosphere in New York this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got burned by you guys too many times,'' Rocker told
reporters in the Braves' locker room in Montreal, where the Braves
were playing the Expos.
</P>
<P>
   When a dozen reporters persisted in asking questions, Rocker
said he ``was not going to say another word'' and then asked them
to find another spot to stand in the clubhouse. He pulled on his
socks and stared away from reporters while he batted away
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you would exit my locker space,'' he said, ``I would
greatly appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocker reignited the controversy about his comments when he
confronted Jeff Pearlman, who wrote the Sports Illustrated article,
earlier this month, and again when he told Baseball Weekly that he
would ride the No. 7 train.
</P>
<P>
   If Rocker does somehow ed up on the No. 7 train, police
officials said his trip will definitely not feature face-to-face
encounters with angry straphangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing he will be seeing in his car will be police
officers,'' Police Commissioner Howard Safir said. ``This is like
protecting the Ku Klux Klan. You don't want to do it but you have
an obligation to protect people from themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said Rocker would be guarded around the clock
while he is in New York. During discussions Monday, the police and
baseball officials talked of assigning a team of nine police
officers to travel with Rocker during any subway trip, but police
officials said Tuesday that the actual number remained fluid.
</P>
<P>
   Other security arrangements being discussed included posting an
officer at every station of the No. 7 train between Grand Central
Terminal and Shea and possibly converting whatever train Rocker got
on into an express for the rest of its journey. But many of these
preparations now seem moot unless Rocker surprises the Braves and
baseball and does end up on a train.
</P>
<P>
   At the stadium, the police are planning to have as many as 600
officers _ as many as usually patrol a playoff game _ on hand,
including several mounted officers to keep fans off the field after
the game. Usually the police detail at Shea consists of 45 to 60
officers, depending on attendance, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one of the undercover officers will be an Atlanta
police lieutenant who is traveling with the Braves and will be
working at field level in a team uniform to provide an extra level
of security for Rocker, the police said. In addition, Mets
officials have said they plan to erect a covered fence around the
bullpen to prevent fans from throwing things at Rocker during the
game.

BID TO KEEP APPLE TOURS CLOSED IS REJECTED

<P>
   NEW YORK _ New York Apple Tours' red double-decker buses, which
have been banished from this city's streets for nearly a month, may
be rolling again as early as this weekend. On Monday, a panel of
state appellate judges rejected an attempt by the city and state to
sideline the buses while they try to shut the company down
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which has racked up hundreds of regulatory and
safety violations and accidents in its nine years of ferrying
tourists around the city, has been under siege by the authorities
and residents since May 22, when one of its buses struck and killed
a 71-year-old pedestrian in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the accident, the state Department of Motor Vehicles
and the city Department of Consumer Affairs had started
administrative hearings to revoke New York Apple's licenses. But on
May 31, Gov. George Pataki issued an order pulling the registration
of the company's 63 buses pending the outcome of the hearings.
</P>
<P>
   New York Apple challenged the order, saying it violated its
rights to due process, and on June 14, a state Supreme Court judge
in Manhattan agreed. Judge Phyllis Gangel-Jacob reversed the
governor's order, although she also appointed a former city
official to monitor the company.
</P>
<P>
   The city and state immediately appealed the ruling, forcing the
buses to stay off the road until the appellate ruling on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The state and city both said Tuesday that they would abide by
the appellate panel's ruling, which rejected their appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We disagree with the decision, but we will comply and will
work closely with the monitor to ensure the safety of the
pedestrians and motorists of New York City,'' said Suzanne Morris,
a spokeswoman for Pataki, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   New York Apple's president, Hayim Grant, said the buses would
roll again as soon as the company did two things: demonstrated to
the court-appointed monitor, Ross Sandler, a former city
transportation commissioner, that its buses and drivers are in
compliance with safety laws; and found enough employees to get back
in business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to call over 350 employees that were laid off to
convince them to come back to work,'' Grant said Tuesday. ``I'm
sure many have already gotten replacement employment. But we are
hopeful that we'll be back on the road by this weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant said New York Apple officials planned to meet with Sandler
on Tuesday night to ``to determine what steps we need to take
before we can operate again.'' Sandler could not be reached for
comment Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   New York Apple's problems with the authorities escalated on May
22, when one of its drivers, who was not licensed to operate a bus,
made an illegal turn onto West 45th Street and ran over and killed
Randolph Walker, an actor walking home from an audition.
</P>
<P>
   The accident galvanized neighborhood opposition, which had been
building for years, and the authorities reacted by pulling the
company's licenses.
</P>
<P>
   But in her ruling last week, Gangel-Jacob said letting the buses
continue to operate would ``not do any harm to any public
interest,'' while shutting the company without a full trial would
hurt the company and its employees and could damage the city's
tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said he was pleased with the ruling, which was not
accompanied by any comments from the justices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that we're entitled to a proper defense before we're
shut down,'' he said. ``We've been serving visitors to New York for
close to 10 years now, we're the leader in the industry, and to
shut us down without a proper hearing and defense we felt was not
constitutional.''
