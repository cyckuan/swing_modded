Calls mount in South Korea to fire head coach 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Following a restless night after
watching their World Cup team suffer a humiliating defeat, many
South Koreans called Sunday for the ouster of national soccer team
head coach Cha Bum-keun.
	   One day after South Korea was routed 0-5 by the Netherlands in a
World Cup finals Group-E match in France, top South Korean soccer
officials will begin discussions on whether to fire Cha, the Yonhap
national news agency reported in a dispatch from Paris.
	   ``It was an expected defeat. Coach Cha killed the fighting
spirit of the players by declaring in advance that South Korea
would fight for a draw with the Netherlands,'' said Shin Moon-sun,
a soccer commentator.
	   Television stations reported that a record number of viewers
watched Saturday's game.
	   The defeat followed a 3-1 defeat by Mexico a week earlier. South
Korea cannot advance to the second round regardless of the result
of its last first-round match Belgium, slated for Thursday.
	   Most soccer experts blamed coach Cha for mismanaging the team.
Only days before the finals, its key players suffered injuries,
they noted.
	   ``I strongly advise Mr. Cha to pack up right now and return home
immediately before causing more humiliation to the country,''
soccer fan Yoo Byung-hee said in a computer bulletin board posting,
summarizing widespread popular sentiment.
	   South Koreans were particularly upset by the lopsided defeat
because traditional rival Japan was able to limit Croatia to a
single goal in its 0-1 loss Saturday.
	   South Korea and Japan will co-host the 2002 World Cup finals.
	   ``It was a crushing, humiliating defeat. South Korea was
defeated in physical strength, strategy, spirit, and even game
manners,'' Yonhap said.
	   This year marks South Korea's fifth appearance in the World Cup
finals, but the national team has never won a match enabling it to
advance to the second round.
	   With their economy mired in a severe financial crisis that
forced tens of thousands of people out of work, South Koreans had
hoped their soccer team would provide a sorely needed boost to the
country's national pride.

<TEXT>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ David Wells struck out nine in eight strong
innings, and Scott Brosius homered for the second straight game as
the New York Yankees beat the Cleveland Indians 5-3 on Saturday.
	   The Yankees have taken three of four from Cleveland in the past
week after getting knocked out of the AL division series by the
Indians last fall. New York improved to a major league-leading
50-17.
	   Wells (9-2) allowed eight hits, didn't walk a batter and struck
out David Justice and Geronimo Berroa three times apiece. Mariano
Rivera allowed an RBI single in the ninth before picking up his
16th save.
	   Brosius homered off Dave Burba (8-5) in the fifth.
 &UR; Angels 8, Rangers 3 &QC; 
	   In Anaheim, California, Steve Sparks overcame Juan Gonzalez's
two-run homer in the first inning as Anaheim beat Texas.
	   Sparks (2-0) rebounded from a three-run first to blank the
Rangers on three hits over the next 5 1-3 innings as the Angels won
for the 17th time in 20 games to increase their AL West lead over
Texas to 1 1/2 games.
	   Gonzalez hit his 23rd homer to increase his major league-RBI
total to 88. Darrin Erstad hit his 17th homer for the Angels.
	   Todd Van Poppel (0-1) took the loss in his first appearance in
the majors since Sept. 27, 1996.
 &UR; Athletics 6, Mariners 2 &QC; 
	   In Seattle, Jimmy Haynes pitched shutout ball for 7 1-3 innings
before being knocked out of the game by a line drive and A.J. Hinch
and Jason Giambi hit home runs as Oakland beat Seattle.
	   Haynes (5-3) allowed four singles, walked two and struck out
six. He left the game after being hit in the right forearm by Joey
Cora's line drive. The ball ricocheted to first baseman Jack Voight
who made the putout.
	   Ken Cloude (3-6) took the loss.
 &UR; Orioles 11, Blue Jays 3 &QC; 
	   In Baltimore, Lenny Webster hit the first of three homers off
Woody Williams and Baltimore's Scott Erickson pitched his fifth
complete game as the Orioles beat Toronto.
	   Webster's three-run drive in the second inning put Baltimore
ahead to stay. Eric Davis and Rafael Palmeiro added two-run homers,
and Brady Anderson tied a career high with four hits, including two
doubles.
	   Erickson (8-6) allowed 12 hits, walked two and struck out eight
to earn his fourth straight victory. Williams (7-3) gave up six
earned runs and 11 hits in seven innings in losing for the first
time since May 8.
	   Mark Dalesandro homered for Toronto.
 &UR; Devil Rays 8, Red Sox 5 &QC; 
	   In St. Petersburg, Florida, Paul Sorrento hit a two-run homer
and Dave Martinez doubled with the bases loaded to drive in two
runs as Tampa Bay stopped Boston's four-game winning streak.
	   Julio Santana (2-0) allowed seven hits over 5 2-3 innings to get
his first victory as a starter for the Devil Rays, who scored six
runs off Boston starter Bret Saberhagen (8-5).
	   Roberto Hernandez pitched the ninth for his 15th save.
	   Tampa Bay's Wade Boggs singled in the fourth to extend his
club-record hitting streak to 13 games. Scott Hatteberg homered for
the Red Sox.
 &UR; Tigers 4, Royals 3 &QC; 
	   In Detroit, Bobby Higginson and Luis Gonzalez hit first-inning
homers and Brian Moehler improved to 7-0 at Tiger Stadium as
Detroit beat Kansas City.
	   The victory was Detroit's third in its last 11 home games, and
ended Kansas City's three-game winning streak.
	   Moehler (7-5) allowed one run on eight hits over 6 1-3 innings.
Todd Jones pitched the ninth for his 11th save. Tim Belcher (5-7)
lost for the first time since May 20, allowing four runs and 10
hits over seven innings.
	   Jeff King homered for Kansas City.
 &UR; White Sox 8, Twins 7, 11 innings &QC; 
	   In Chicago, pinch-hitter Wil Cordero and Greg Norton hit RBI
singles with two outs to cap an 11th-inning rally as Chicago
outlasted Minnesota.
	   The Twins scored four runs in the ninth to tie it at 5, and took
a 6-5 lead in the 10th, but Mike Cameron's two-out single in the
bottom half tied it.
	   Minnesota again took the lead in the 11th on Orlando Merced's
RBI grounder. But the White Sox came back to end a four-game losing
streak with four straight two-out singles off Rick Aguilera (3-4).
	   Bill Simas (2-2) won despite allowing two runs in 2 1-3 innings.
	   The Twins trailed 5-1 going into the ninth, but Ron Coomer's
sacrifice fly, Todd Walker's two-run single and Terry Steinbach's
RBI triple with two outs tied it. Norton homered for Chicago in the
fifth.

China to boost export tax rebates 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China will increase tax rebates paid to exporters
in a move to shield its economy from declining export volumes as a
result of the recent Asian financial crisis, the official China
Business Weekly financial newspaper said Sunday.
	   The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
plans to announce later this month a list of export goods that will
qualify for higher tax rebates, including coal, ships, electric and
machinery products and some high-tech items, the report said.
	   It said the change would bring China's policies closer to those
of the World Trade Organization, the worldwide trade watchdog
Beijing is seeking to join.
	   China's exports in May fell 1.5 percent on the year due to
shrinking demand from other markets in Asia.
	   With much of Asia forecast to remain in the doldrums, China will
be hard pressed to keep exports high enough to support its economic
growth target of 8 percent for this year.
	   Textile export tax rebates were raised to 11 percent from 9
percent at the beginning of the year. Rebates of cotton and steel
also were boosted, the report said.

UNDATED: the loss. Cubs 9, Phillies 4 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In Chicago, Sammy Sosa hit two home runs for the second straight
day and set a major league record with 16 homers in June, leading
Kerry Wood and Chicago past Philadelphia.
	   Sosa had a two-run homer in the third and a towering three-run
blast in the sixth that landed on the roof deck of a building
across Waveland Avenue behind the left-field bleachers.
	   Sosa has 20 home runs in his last 21 games, and 29 for the
season. He hit three home runs Monday, and has 28 career
multi-homer games.
	   Babe Ruth (1930), Bob Johnson (1934), Roger Maris (1961) and
Pedro Guerrero (1985) also had hit 15 homers in June. The major
league record in any month is 18, set by Detroit's Rudy York in
August 1937.
	   Wood (7-3), who turned 21 on Tuesday, hit his first big league
home run and struck out 11 in 7 1-3 innings. Matt Beech (3-4) took
the loss.
 &UR; Cardinals 4, Diamondbacks 2 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Manny Aybar pitched six strong innings in his
first start in nearly a month and Ray Lankford hit a two-run homer
as St. Louis beat Arizona to reach .500 for the first time since
June 4.
	   Mark McGwire had a quiet night, leaving the bases loaded in the
sixth when he grounded out for the final out against Clint
Sodowsky. He was hit by a pitch for the second time this season by
Arizona starter Amaury Telemaco in the second, walked and struck
out. He fouled out in the eighth inning.
	   Aybar (3-3) gave up four hits, including an RBI double by Karim
Garcia in the fourth that ended Arizona's 21-inning scoreless slump
against St. Louis. Rick Croushore got the last six outs for his
second save, giving up Kelly Stinnett's homer in the ninth. Willie
Banks (0-1) took the loss.
 &UR; Rockies 7, Dodgers 6 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Ellis Burks homered and drove in four runs as
Colorado beat Los Angeles to snap a four-game losing streak.
	   Burks' three-run homer gave Colorado a 3-1 lead in the fourth,
and he added an RBI single in a four-run fifth. Eric Karros,
continuing to punish Colorado pitching, had a three-run double in
the seventh.
	   Mike Munoz (1-0) pitched two innings for the victory. Jerry
Dipoto allowed a one-out, RBI double to Gary Sheffield in the
ninth, and Dave Veres got two outs for his first save. Dennis Reyes
(0-3) took the loss.
 &UR; Pirates 4, Brewers 2 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Pittsburgh's Jon Lieber limited Milwaukee to four
hits in eight innings and hit a tiebreaking double in the seventh
inning.
	   Lieber (5-8) broke a 2-2 tie when he hit Cal Eldred's fastball
into the gap in right-center, where it bounced into the stands,
scoring Doug Strange from third. Strange had reached on a two-base
error by center fielder Marquis Grissom, a ball that also bounced
over the wall.
	   Ricardo Rincon finished for his eighth save. Eldred dropped to
2-5.
 &UR; Braves 5, Expos 1 &QC; 
	   In Montreal, John Smoltz allowed four hits over seven innings in
his return from the disabled list and Javy Lopez hit a three-run
homer as Atlanta beat Montreal, snapping the Expos' three-game
winning streak.
	   Smoltz (5-1), who has been on the disabled list twice after
undergoing elbow surgery in December, struck out eight and set down
11 straight after allowing a one-out double to Jose Vidro in the
first inning.
	   The win was Atlanta's 50th of the season, making the Braves the
first NL club to reach that figure. The New York Yankees reached it
earlier Saturday.
	   Carlos Perez (6-6) took the loss.

China stepping up consolidation of petrochemical industries 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China's petrochemical industries are to be
consolidated as part of the government's effort to revamp
inefficient state-owned firms, the official China Business Weekly
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Two petrochemical conglomerates _ which oversee production
mainly in North China and South China, respectively _ will
vertically integrate other firms involved in all phases of
production, from exploration to marketing, the report said.
	   As part of a sweeping bureaucratic overhaul, the State
Petrochemical Industry Bureau was set up to oversee the
reorganization of the industry.
	   Under the plan, the China Petrochemical Corp., also known as
Sinopec, will own and operate enterprises in east and southeast
China, including the Beijing Yanshan Petrochemical Group and the
Tianjin Petrochemical Co., in the nearby port city of Tianjin.
	   Its focus will be on industrial production and marketing.
	   The other oil conglomerate, China National Petroleum Corp., or
CNPC, will take over exploration and extraction of oil from
Heilongjiang in the northeast to Xinjiang in the northwest and
Tibet and Sichuan in the southwest. It will also handle some
petrochemical production, it said.
	   The report said the government would forbid each company from
restricting sales by rival firms in its production region, but that
local oil companies and gas stations would be incorporated into the
larger industrial groups.
	   Some 7,500 petroleum and petrochemical firms controlled by three
different government agencies account for roughly 14 percent of the
country's gross domestic product.
	   With oil production barely holding steady, domestic exploration
failing to live up to expectations and imports soaring to meet the
demand, China has become anxious about how it will fuel future
economic growth. As state industries revamp, the petrochemicals
industry is receiving top priority.
	   The Chinese government is continuing with ambitious plans to
develop extremely large conglomerates similar to those operating in
South Korea and Japan, despite the financial crises now affecting
those two countries.
	   The reorganization of the industry ``is a strategic option for
the two petrochemical super-companies to participate in global
competition,'' the newspaper quoted bureau director Li Yongwu as
saying.
	   While it is allowing the sale of many small and medium-size
state firms, the government intends to retain control over
strategic industries like petrochemicals. Meanwhile, larger groups,
such as Sinopec and CNPC, are expected to expected to join the
ranks of the world's top corporations.
	   Both firms should be among the world's 500 largest companies by
later this year, Sheng Huaren, minister of the State Economic and
Trade Commission, was cited as saying.
	   The China Business Weekly report also cited officials saying the
groups would have to develop new managerial and information systems
in order to work efficiently.
	   Company headquarters would function as investment centers, while
individual enterprises within the groups would be responsible for
controlling their production costs, it said.

Swedish woman sets record in Mount Washington road race 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOUNT WASHINGTON, New Hampshire (AP) _ Magdalena Thorsell of
Sweden, who lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, set a new women's
record during the 38th annual 7.6-mile (12.2-kilometer) Race to the
Clouds on Saturday.
	   Thorsell, 33, set a new record of 1 hour, 10 minutes and 8.2
seconds, beating J'ne Day Lucore's 1992 record of 1:11:45.5.
	   ``I've never done anything like this before,'' said Thorsell, a
former member of Sweden's cross-country team. ``Everybody scared me
about how steep it was. Actually, I thought it would be a lot
harder than it was. I think I can run faster.''
	   Lucore, of Denver, came in second Saturday, trailing Thorsell by
more than 10 minutes with a run of 1:20:58. She has won the road
race three times, in 1992, 1993 and 1995. Barbara Remmers of New
York was third in 1:22:16.
	   In the men's race, Matt Carpenter of Manitou Springs, Colorado,
won his third Mount Washington road race.
	   Carpenter, 33, finished the race up the Northeast's tallest
mountain in one hour and 23.1 seconds. The record is 58:20.
	   Carpenter also came in first in 1992 and in 1993. He said he was
disappointed he did not break the 1-hour mark.
	   ``I just didn't have another gear that wanted to hurt today,''
Carpenter said.
	   Carpenter won dlrs 1,250 _ dlrs 750 for first prize plus a dlrs
500 bonus for being the first U.S. finisher. Thorsell won dlrs
1,750 _ dlrs 750 for first prize plus dlrs 1,000 for breaking the
course record for women.
	   Eric Morse of Montpelier, Vermont, surprised race officials by
placing second. Officials said Morse's previous times made him
appear slow on paper. He finished in 1:02:31.
	   Thorsell's husband, Simon Gutierrez, 32, also did well during
his debut Saturday, coming in third place with a time of 1:03:23.
	   About 1,000 men and women ran the annual race in dry weather,
starting in mild temperatures in the 60s Fahrenheit (upper teens
Celsius) and running through light clouds to the summit above the
clouds.

Hong Kong airport railway starts service 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's Airport Railway, an important piece
of a new airport construction project costing a total of U.S. dlrs
202.1 billion, began service Sunday, two weeks before the airport
opens.
	   The 34-kilometer (21-mile) railway links downtown Hong Kong to
the new Chek Lap Kok airport, built on a man-made islet at the tip
of the outlying Lautau Island and the nearby town of Tung Chung.
	   Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa was the railway's first
passenger Sunday. Tung said the railway is ``an illustration of our
strength _ reliability, efficiency, and above all, quality. These
are attributes which not only apply to the railway but also to our
community.''
	   The Airport Railway is composed of two lines _ a six-stop local
line linking downtown to Tung Chung and a four-stop express line
going directly to the airport.
	   The local line came into service Sunday, while the express train
will open with the new airport on July 6.
	   Authorities earlier this year had to postpone the airport's
opening from April to July because of a delay in the completion of
the railway.
	   Jack So, chairman of the Mass Transit Railway, said at the
opening ceremony the Airport Railway was the first-ever train
system to have been designed specifically to serve an airport.
	   Passengers will be able to board the express train at the
airport terminal. Flight information will be available in the train
carriages, which resemble first-class flight cabins.
	   The journey takes 23 minutes, compared with over one hour by
bus. Passenger check-in will be available at the railway's downtown
terminal.
	   One-way tickets are 100 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 12.8), but
a 30-percent discount will be given until Oct. 6.
	   Still, ticket prices have been criticized as too steep.
	   The new airport will replace Kai Tai International Airport,
situated in the heart of Hong Kong. Operating round-the clock, it
will be able to handle 35 million passengers a year, and is
expected to eventually be able to deal with 87 million passengers
annually.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin will officiate the airport's
opening on July 2, although it will not be open for commercial use
until July 6.

Cambodian opposition leader holds pre-election rally, defying ban

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Defying a government ban on
demonstrations during the run-up to elections, thousands of
Cambodians joined opposition leader Sam Rainsy on Sunday in a
public rally calling for the July 26 vote to be free and fair.
	   About 2,500 protesters marched through the streets of Phnom Penh
carrying blue-and-white banners that said, ``we want a free and
fair election,'' ``the election is being rigged,'' and ``stop
election killings.''
	   The demonstration, which began at the Olympic Stadium and ended
at the Sam Rainsy Party headquarters, went ahead despite repeated
state-run television and radio broadcasts warning that rallies in
Phnom Penh are prohibited until after the election.
	   Sam Rainsy ignored the ban, calling it ``unconstitutional.''
	   The authorities, apparently unwilling to give him more
ammunition to criticize the political environment as not being
conducive to free and fair polls, allowed the rally to go ahead.
	   However, about 100 people coming to the demonstration by bus and
truck from a southwestern suburb of the capital were stopped and
detained for two hours by local officials, according to a U.N.
human rights worker.
	   They were released unharmed only to be temporarily detained a
second time just outside the city.
	   Sam Rainsy said Friday his party would not participate in the
upcoming campaign unless measures are implemented to ensure
conditions are conducive for free and fair elections.
	   He indicated Sunday that the government's willingness to let him
go ahead with the rally was a good sign.
	   His participation in the elections, he said Sunday, depends in
part on ``how free we can be to express our opinion'' as the
election date approaches. Such freedoms should be applied
nationwide, he said.
	   ``We will push hard for free and fair elections,'' he said. ``If
we have a fair chance to ensure that the vote is free and fair then
we will participate.''
	   Critics of the election preparations say that Cambodian
strongman Hun Sen has used violence, intimidation and control of
the state machinery to ensure a victory for his Cambodian People's
Party. The main opposition party, FUNCINPEC, did not join in his
boycott, however.
	   Sam Rainsy is an outspoken critic of the government and was the
apparent target of an assassination attempt last year, when a
grenade attack on a demonstration was leading killed at least 16 of
his supporters and injured over 100.
	   It is widely believed that Hun Sen was behind the attack.
	   FUNCINPEC leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh was ousted by Hun Sen,
his co-premier, in a coup d'etat a year ago which shattered a
strained coalition government formed after U.N.-brokered elections
in 1993.
	   In an effort to win back international legitimacy and foreign
aid that had been lost after the coup, Hun Sen agreed to proceed
with a new election this year.

North Koreans living on bark, wild plants, aid officials say 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ The virtual shutdown of North Korea's food
distribution system is forcing many of its people, especially women
and children, to survive on bark and wild plants until the summer
harvest, aid officials said Sunday.
	   Aid programs have helped to save many North Koreans from
outright starvation, but film footage taken by the World Food
Program during a visit to the isolated nation showed children
suffering from poor health and stunted growth. They no longer
appeared to be desperately thin, however.
	   ``I think it's possible that we've prevented a famine,'' said
Abigail Spring, a WFP official who just returned from a weeklong
visit to North Korea.
	   Spring noted, however, that hunger and malnutrition remained
serious problems and after several consecutive years of poor
harvests due to bad weather and ineffective management, North Korea
remains on famine's edge.
	   Hospitals were reporting an increase in patients suffering from
intestinal problems caused by the consumption of substitute foods,
she said.
	   As North Korea's economy has stagnated, water and sewage systems
have broken down and the medical system is failing, said Jean
Jacques Graisse, WFP deputy executive director, who also traveled
to North Korea to meet with senior officials.
	   The severity of the food shortages will depend on how much rain
the country gets in the coming, usually wet, months. Last year,
severe drought withered crops.
	   In the long term, the country is likely to face severe erosion
problems because crops have been planted almost everywhere _
including steep hillsides _ by farmers desperate to grow more food,
he said.
	   Next month, UNICEF, the World Food Program and the European
Union plan a countrywide assessment of children aged six-months to
seven-years-old in North Korea that will be used to plan future
humanitarian programs.
	   Some will involve helping North Korean medical staff
rehabilitate malnourished children, who are at risk of suffering
permanent damage to their physical and mental development.
	   The food aid program has been hindered by the North Korean
government's refusal to allow foreign aid workers to monitor
distribution of food in all areas to ensure it reaches those most
in need.
	   The World Food Program officials said they were temporarily
cutting back and would distribute 55,000 tons less food than
originally planned due to the restrictions on access to 39 of the
country's 210 counties.
	   The reduction would affect 765,000 North Koreans, mostly women
and children, they said.
	   So far, 534,442 tons of food have been distributed or confirmed
as contributed through the World Food Program and other groups
since the beginning of the year.

Japan's embattled prime minister focus of ad campaign 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Facing criticism at home and abroad for allowing
the world's second-largest economy to slip into recession, Japan's
ruling party moved to bolster its image Sunday with full-page ads
featuring a radiant Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto.
	   The advertisements, which were placed in Japan's top three
national newspapers ahead of upper house elections July 12, attempt
to counter naysayers with an optimistic appraisal of the country's
current situation.
	   ``This nation is overflowing with negative talk. But is Japan
really that bad of a country?'' the caption of the ads asks
readers. It goes on to state that Japanese know-how and ideas
provide the nation with ``incredible possibilities.''
	   The public relations effort comes at a time of growing unease in
Japan about the prospects for the economy. Japanese have been
shaken by record high unemployment and the yen's recent plunge to
an eight-year low against the U.S. dollar.
	   Public support for Hashimoto's administration has fallen to 29.9
percent, its lowest level ever, according to a survey published
last week in the Yomiuri newspaper, Japan's largest daily.
	   The survey was conducted just after the government announced
figures showing the economy posted its worst year of growth in more
than two decades and has fallen into recession.
	   But the poll also showed that Hashimoto's Liberal Democratic
Party remains by far the most popular party in Japan.
	   In one of the ads, Hashimoto is shown smiling warmly while
seated upright at desk strewn with official-looking papers. A
Jupiter-like orb on which the word ``plus'' is written hovers above
his head.
	   The July polls will be the first upper house elections since
Hashimoto came to power in early 1996 and will give his Liberal
Democratic Party a chance to regain a majority in the body, which
it lost in 1989.

Singapore's premier won't rule out recession 
</HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN DRAKE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's prime minister has declined to rule
out the possibility that his nation's economy is headed into
recession, becoming the latest victim of the Asian crisis.
	   ``Some analysts forecast that Singapore would get into recession
this year. I think it's too early to predict,'' Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong said in a speech, portions of which were broadcast late
Saturday on state-run television.
	   But Goh added that ``we must be prepared for slower growth this
and next year.''
	   Goh's remarks appear to be an admission that Singapore could
stray into negative growth this year. It was the latest signal from
the government that previous rosy forecasts will have to be
abandoned.
	   For months, the government had staunchly stood by a February
forecast for growth between 2.5 and 4.5 percent this year. That
estimate was made, however, before a clear picture of the severity
of Asia's economic crisis had emerged.
	   But recent statements by the authorities indicate that the
government is backing away from the February forecast.
	   On June 1, Finance Minister Richard Hu told Parliament the
government backed its earlier predictions, but would introduce
off-budget measures to stimulate the economy if it began to stray
into recession.
	   A week later, the Prime Minister's Office revealed that the
forecast would be revised soon, once data for the second quarter
was available.
	   Meanwhile, five private investment houses have predicted
outright recession at some point in 1998, while most others have
forecast lower growth than the government.
	   Singapore remains highly vulnerable to external economic
developments. It is a regional center for financial services, which
have been hit hard during the crisis, and relies heavily on its
electronics sector, which has slowed amid a world slump in computer
components.
	   Trade figures released Saturday showed the economy continuing
its downward drift. The country's non-oil domestic exports, a key
measure of overall economic performance, fell 4.8 percent in May
compared to a year earlier.
	   The government has repeatedly warned Singaporeans that wage
increases will drop or even freeze as layoffs and unemployment
rise. It has predicted a record number of layoffs this year, to
exceed the 20,000 during a recession in the mid-80's.
	   Goh was equally pessimistic about the regional economic
situation: ``Japan is the world's second largest economy, and it is
now in recession. If the Japanese yen weakens further, that is
going to have an effect on the U.S. economy, on Europe, on the
region, on China.''
	   He said that further weakness in the Japanese yen could trigger
a second wave of damaging currency devaluations beyond those
experienced in the region last year.
	   If that happens, he added, ``the likelihood of Asia melting down
is quite real.''

Gates, the world's only dlrs 50 billion man, tops Forbes' billionaires list With Forbes-Billionaires-List; Forbes-Billionaires-Alphabetical AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Bill Gates has one monopoly the government can't
try to stop.
	   Microsoft's chairman topped Forbes magazine's rankings of the
world's richest billionaires for the fourth straight year, as his
net worth jumped 40 percent from a year ago to dlrs 51 billion.
	   Forbes tightened the criteria for its rankings this year by
including only the ``working rich.'' Listed are billionaires who
have built their own fortune or are working with their inheritance
rather than the silver-spoon set that is living off its wealth,
Forbes said in its July 6 issue, which was released Sunday.
	   While fighting a government antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft,
the world's largest software company, Gates easily fended off
rivals to his billionaires' throne. The combined riches of five
people _ the heirs of Wal-Mart founder Sam Walton _ still fell dlrs
3 billion short to rank No. 2 with dlrs 48 billion.
	   The wealthiest individual on the list behind Gates was sage
investor Warren Buffett, No. 3 at dlrs 33 billion. Rounding out the
top five were Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen at dlrs 21 billion
and Canada's Kenneth Thomson, head of publishing giant Thomson
Corp., at dlrs 14.4 billion.
	   One notable new member of this year's list was the family of
former Indonesian President Suharto, whose 32 years in power
enabled him to amass stakes in about 3,200 Indonesian companies and
a family fortune of about dlrs 4 billion, Forbes said.
	   The new criteria dropped several billionaires from the list,
including the dlrs 15.3 billion Quandt family of Germany, a
majority shareholder of BMW who ranked No. 10 last year; L'Oreal's
founding Bettencourt family of France, worth dlrs 11.4 billion; and
sisters Barbara Cox Anthony and Anne Cox Chambers, dlrs 7.1 billion
heirs of the U.S. media company Cox Enterprises.
	   The 12th annual list, which excludes dictators and royalty, is a
companion to Forbes' oft-quoted rankings of the 400 richest
Americans, which is slated for its Oct. 12 issue.
	   If royalty were included among the top billionaires, the Sultan
of Brunei would have ranked third at dlrs 36 billion. The oil-rich
Sultan was richer than Gates until this year.
	   Suharto became eligible after quitting under pressure last month
amid the economic crisis in Indonesia. Asia's financial retreat
reduced its representation among the top 200 billionaires to 44
from 56 last year. American billionaires on the list rose to 70
from 60, while Europeans accounted for 52, up from 44.
	   Among business kingpins who made the list were media tycoon
Rupert Murdoch at dlrs 5.3 billion; British entrepreneur Richard
Branson at dlrs 1.9 billion; and Japanese real estate and
transportation mogul Yoshiaki Tsutsumi, once the world's richest
businessman, at dlrs 5.7 billion.
	   The average net worth of the top 200 billionaires was dlrs 4.7
billion, up from dlrs 3.9 billion in 1997.

At least five killed as freak storm hits Moscow 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least five people were killed and more than 100
were injured when a violent thunderstorm driven by raging winds
pummeled the Russian capital late Saturday night and Sunday
morning.
	   Svetlana Arkhanova, duty officer in the Moscow health
department, said five people died as a direct result of the storm.
The Interfax news agency said 121 had been hospitalized.
	   The storm struck just before midnight and raged for about 30
minutes, with nearly constant lightning flashes, heavy downpours
and howling wind. Thousands of trees were downed, causing power
outages and traffic jams.
	   Falling trees crushed parked cars and some of the many kiosks
lining the on the city's streets. Chunks of metal kiosks and wooden
billboards were littered throughout the city.
	   Sporadic power outages were reported. Cable television service
was also affected.
	   The city had mobilized fleets of trucks Sunday morning to begin
picking up the debris, which blocked major roads and made driving
hazardous.

Grewcock suspended for five weeks

<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ England lock Danny Grewcock, sent
off for kicking in Saturday's rugby union test against New Zealand,
was suspended Sunday for five weeks.
	   The independent judiciary cleared All Blacks forward Ian Jones
of stomping England prop Graham Rowntree after he had been cited by
the match's independent commissioner, David Gray.
	   The first two weeks of Grewcock's suspension start Sunday,
ruling him out of Saturday's second test in Auckland and against
South Africa a week later.
	   The remaining three weeks will be served at the start of the
England club rugby season later this year.
	   Grewcock was ordered off in the 30th minute by Australian
referee Wayne Erickson for kicking All Blacks hooker Anton Oliver's
head. The All Blacks won the first test 64-22. (djp)

Jailed Timorese rebel rejects Indonesian president's offer 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An imprisoned rebel chief from East
Timor on Sunday rejected an offer from Indonesia's president for
freedom in exchange for worldwide recognition of the disputed
territory as part of Indonesia.
	   ``In principle, I don't agree,'' separatist rebel commander Jose
Xanana Gusmao said in Jakarta's Cipinang jail, where he is serving
a 20-year sentence for fighting Indonesian forces. He was arrested
in 1992.
	   Gusmao briefly commented on the proposal by President B.J.
Habibie in response to a question from an Associated Press reporter
who entered the prison during visiting hours.
	   Gusmao, who is revered by many East Timorese, has said the
former Portuguese colony should be allowed to determine if it wants
independence in a referendum.
	   Portugal and other East Timorese advocates of a vote on
self-determination were quick to criticize Habibie's proposal
Saturday to end the conflict in the half-island territory.
	   Habibie, who took office last month, said he would free Gusmao,
withdraw thousands of Indonesian troops from East Timor and grant
it special status and development funding.
	   Under Habibie's proposal, the United Nations, Portugal and the
world community would then accept East Timor as Indonesia's 27th
province.
	   Indonesia invaded East Timor in 1975 and annexed it a year
later. Tens of thousands of people died in fighting and ensuing
famine and disease.

Grewcock suspended for five weeks

EDs: adds England management reaction
<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ England lock Danny Grewcock, sent
off for kicking in Saturday's rugby union test against New Zealand,
was suspended Sunday for five weeks.
	   The independent judiciary cleared All Blacks forward Ian Jones
of stomping England prop Graham Rowntree after he had been cited by
the match's independent commissioner, David Gray.
	   The first two weeks of Grewcock's suspension start Sunday,
ruling him out of Saturday's second test in Auckland and against
South Africa a week later.
	   The remaining three weeks will be served at the start of the
England club rugby season later this year.
	   Grewcock was ordered off in the 30th minute by Australian
referee Wayne Erickson for kicking All Blacks hooker Anton Oliver's
head. The All Blacks won the first test 64-22.
	   England's management, without coach Clive Woodward who was on
his way home Sunday to attend his father's funeral, will study the
full report of the judicial committee before deciding whether to
appeal its decision against Grewcock on Monday.
	   ``We do not condone any violence on the field of play, but we do
consider that the five-week suspension is inconsistent with the
nature of the incident as outlined by the referee,'' said England
manager Roger Uttley. (djp)

Wainwright unhappy as Scotland leaves Australia 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Scotland rugby union captain Rob
Wainwright left Australia on Sunday upset that comments made by
Australian coach Rod Macqueen may have influenced the refereeing in
Saturday's loss to Australia.
	   Wainwright, a highly respected international forward, was
angered by comments Macqueen made about the Scots prior to Saturday
night's 33-11 second loss to the Wallabies at Ballymore.
	   Macqueen suggested Scotland was expert at subtle infringing in
the rucks and reiterated those concerns after the match when he
said his team had enormous trouble with the Scots at the breakdown.
	   ``It does rile me, some of the comments of Rod Macqueen,'' said
Wainwright.
	   ``Normally at the end of a game I'm polite about refs, but I'm
just getting a little bit sick to be honest. Scotland are babes at
killing the ball and slowing the ball compared to some of the
oppositions we play.
	   ``Rod Macqueen's hype got to the ref. A lot of decisions went
against us which were perfectly fair but anytime we got anywhere
near the wrong side of the ruck we were heavily penalized.''
	   Wainwright twice spoke to Campsall about what he thought was
unfair treatment against his side for offenses Australia got away
with.
	   ``I discussed it in the first and the second half but we decided
it was better just get on with the game,'' he said.
	   ``It's not just a problem with an individual referee. The
difference between a tackle and a ruck is a blur these days. It's
got to be sorted out.''
	   Scotland fullback Glenn Metcalfe suffered a suspected broken jaw
from the game but was able to return home with his team-mates
Sunday. (djp)

At least five dead as freak storm hits Moscow

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least five people were killed and more than 100
were injured when a violent summer thunderstorm driven by raging
winds pummeled the Russian capital, officials said Sunday.
	   Svetlana Arkhanova, duty medical officer at the Moscow
Department of Health, said five people died as a direct result of
the storm. The Interfax news agency, quoting city health officials,
said 121 had been hospitalized for injuries, mostly people hit by
falling trees or flying debris.
	   The storm struck just before midnight and raged for about 30
minutes, with nearly constant lightning flashes, heavy downpours
and howling wind. Thousands of trees were downed, causing power
outages and traffic jams.
	   ``It was worse than a hurricane,'' said Mikhail Gordunov, the
night manager of a kiosk on Kutuzovsky Prospect, a wide boulevard
leading toward the Kremlin. ``I was trying to bring an umbrella in,
and was afraid of being swept away.''
	   Mikhail Orlov, manager of a nearby shop, said the wind shifted
suddenly, sending rooftop ventilators and advertising signs
tumbling to the streets below. ``The wind was blowing in one
direction, then five minutes later, it was blowing in the opposite
direction. It was incredibly strong,'' he said.
	   Raisa Yeliseyeva, duty officer at the Moscow weather center,
said the storm was triggered by a collision of two air masses over
the capital.
	   ``Temperatures in Moscow and east of the capital were very high,
32-35 degrees (90-95 F), while air masses with temperatures of
20-22 (68-72 F) were approaching the city from the west,'' she
said.
	   Winds were recorded at 90 kilometers per hour (60 mph), with
whirlwinds gusting much higher, she said. The streets looked like
they had been hit ``by veritable military hostilities,'' she said.
	   Falling trees crushed parked cars and some of the many kiosks
lining the on the city's streets. Chunks of metal kiosks and wooden
billboards were littered throughout the city. Advertising banners
were ripped to shreds.
	   ``I ran from my apartment to check on my car, and found the
trunk caved in under a tree,'' said Viktor Kalushkin, who was
walking his dog among the debris and tree branches littering
Kutuzovsky Prospect.
	   The storm seriously damaged the roof of the Bolshoi Theater and
smashed windows at the Moskva Hotel, adjacent to Red Square, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   About 200 trees were uprooted in the Kremlin gardens, and
several turrets atop the Kremlin wall were knocked down by falling
trees. Cafes and outdoor restaurants along Tverskaya Street, the
city's main shopping street, were smashed beyond repair, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Sporadic power outages were reported throughout the night, and
cable television service was also affected.
	   The city had mobilized fleets of trucks Sunday morning to pick
up the debris and remove fallen trees, which blocked major roads
and side streets and made driving hazardous.

One Nation makes Asian Australians feel ``unwelcome:'' Howard 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: INSERTS One Nation spokesman comment, grafs 10-11
By ALAN THORNHILL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia, (AP) _ Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said Sunday that he will not endorse the One Nation party in
upcoming elections, saying the anti-immigration party has made some
Asian immigrants feel they are unwelcome in Australia.
	   ``No party should behave in a way that makes any group in
Australia feel unwelcome,'' Howard said in a television interview.
	   Howard said he will put the name of the One Nation candidate
last on the voting ticket he recommends, sending a strong signal to
his conservative Liberal party that all branches should do
likewise.
	   The ruling Liberal-National coalition has been agonizing over
where the place One Nation on its how-to-vote cards since the party
won about 23 percent of the vote at a June 13 state election.
	   Australia's preferential voting system requires all major
parties to list candidates from other groups in a descending order
of preference, to give their own candidates the best chance of
victory.
	   One Nation leader Pauline Hanson has been criticized as racist
for claiming Australia is in danger of being ``swamped by Asians''
and opposing immigration. She also opposes special welfare benefits
for Aborigines and advocates protectionist economics.
	   Howard has previously been criticized for refusing to say where
One Nation should be listed on the Liberal party's how-to-vote
cards.
	   The prime minister said Australia has ``some bigots,'' but that
overall it is a racially tolerant country that has nothing to
apologize for.
	   ``Sure, we have some bigots, all countries do. But compared with
countries elsewhere, we are a shining example and it is about time
we were more assertive about that,'' he said.
	   One Nation chief adviser David Oldfield said pressure within the
federal coalition forced Howard's hand.
	   ``I think John Howard is just in a pressured position, having a
whole lot of people who are not very sensible and who are trying to
be emotional rather than logical and he now finds himself in a
position where he is being forced into it,'' Oldfield said.
	   The Queensland Liberal party gave its preferences to One Nation
in the recent state elections, a decision which helped One Nation
win at least nine seats in the 89-seat legislature.

Woodward criticizes opposite number and referee after loss 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ Hours after his team was defeated
64-22 by New Zealand in the first rugby union test, England coach
Clive Woodward had lost little of his desire to criticize opposing
coach John Hart and the referee.
	   Woodward, who flew home to England on Sunday to attend his
father's funeral, accused All Blacks coach Hart of ``haranguing''
Australian referee Wayne Erickson at halftime, which he claimed
influenced Erickson's second-half control of the game.
	   Hart explained later that he had informed Erickson the All
Blacks would adopt a safety-first policy to avoid serious injury.
	   As England was a man down from the 30th minute after Danny
Grewcock was sent off for stomping Anton Oliver's head _ Grewcock
was suspended for five matches Sunday for the infraction _ Hart
said he told Erickson his team would not attack England's
underpowered scrum but concentrate on clearing the ball quickly.
	   ``I was very concerned with eight on seven that we would end up
with injury risk,'' Hart said. ``I have no regret doing that
because it was in the interest of the game and safety.
	   ``The game could have degenerated had we attacked their scrum
with seven. I think we have a responsibility, it's a safety issue.
We could have absolutely smashed the scrum and if someone had got
injured I wouldn't want to be sitting here today.''
	   Woodward, under pressure to produce results following a winless
tour so far and a record 76-0 humiliation by Australia, went on the
offensive after Saturday's nine-tries-to-three hammering at
Dunedin's Carisbrook.
	   ``I don't think he (Hart) was right to go and harangue the
referee at halftime,'' said Woodward. ``It's totally against the
spirit of the game. I'm just amazed he (Erickson) allowed it.''
	   ``It's the second time it's happened. It happened at Old
Trafford (during last year's All Black tour) _ he (Hart) tried to
get into the referee's room. The referee slammed the door in his
face. I know the guy (Hart) rates himself pretty highly, but you
don't have to condone that.
	   ``The referee had a totally bad day. I thought he refereed the
game appallingly.'' (djp)

Mahathir emerges winner, at least for now 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad appeared to have emerged the winner Sunday at a party
convention electrified by allegations of nepotism and corruption in
his government.
	   In a conference hall buzzing for three days with talk of
corruption and cronyism in the upper echelons of the governing
United Malays National Organization party, Mahathir on Saturday
released a list of people awarded government contracts and promised
more names.
	   On that list were some of the very people who have accused his
leadership of cronyism.
	   ``This is a pattern Mahathir has followed whenever he has been
challenged,'' said Chandra Muzzafar, a professor of politics at
University of Malaysia.
	   Mahathir also met his critics head-on in 1987, when he faced a
challenge from within his party regarding the country's recession,
said Chandra.
	   On Saturday, Mahathir, 72, Asia's longest-serving leader since
President Suharto's recent ouster in Indonesia, described the list
as ``just a start.''
	   ``We are preparing the details and maybe we will release more,
and the press can have a look,'' he said on the penultimate day of
the UMNO convention. ``We will see from the list who benefited,
whether they are cronies or the sons and daughters of the
leaders.''
	   Among the prominent names listed was that of Ahmad Zahid Hamidi,
the powerful leader of the UMNO Youth wing, whom the local press
described as ``No. 1 Antagonist'' for spearheading the campaign
against corruption in UMNO.
	   Before the delegates gathered Thursday for the annual
convention, Zahid had threatened to do what Mahathir did Saturday _
provide a list of benefactors of cronyism.
	   Zahid's list never materialized, though he called for an end to
cronyism and nepotism in his speech before the UMNO Youth wing
Thursday, drawing some cheers and applause.
	   Now, Zahid appears on the defensive, and state-backed newspapers
criticized him Sunday for raising the issues.
	   ``Dr. Mahathir is all too aware of this tactic, having been
given many labels _ good or bad _ in his six decades of political
life,'' Kadir Jasin, editor of The New Straits Times, said in an
editorial Sunday.
	   ``Mahathir has secured his position for now and immediate
future,'' said Jomo Sundram, professor of economics at the
University of Malaya.
	   ``The scenario of a change in the leadership, following the
change of leadership in other Asian countries affected by the
economic crisis, appears unlikely.''
	   Jomo was referring to Thailand, South Korea and Indonesia, where
economic turmoil triggered political upheaval and the downfall of
leaders.
	   But question marks still remain on Mahathir's longevity, as
responsibility still needs to be fixed for the country's miserable
economy, which shrank by 1.8 percent in the first quarter of this
year.
	   In his main speech Friday, Mahathir portrayed the attack on
corruption and favoritism as an assault on Malaysia's affirmative
action policy, which fixed quotas for the dominant Malays in
business, jobs and education. Benefits had gone to all Malays, not
hand-picked favorites, he said.
	   By doing so, Mahathir tried to deflect the criticism from
himself and his 17-year leadership.
	   ``It remains to be seen whether his explanations are being
widely accepted,'' said Jomo. ``Increasing numbers of Malays are
not going to buy this argument that the attack on crony capitalism
is an attack on New Economic Policy.''
	   The 1971 National Economic Policy was designed to give Malays _
``Bumiputera,'' or ``sons of the soil'' _ a bigger role in
business, once dominated by ethnic Chinese. Critics have alleged
misuse of the quota system by powerful politicians to benefit their
cronies.

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Hong Kong's Airport Railway, an important piece
of a new airport construction project costing a total of U.S. dlrs
20.1 billion, began service Sunday, two weeks before the airport
was to open.
	   The 34-kilometer (21-mile) railway links downtown Hong Kong to
the new Chek Lap Kok airport, built on a manmade islet at the tip
of outlying Lautau Island and the nearby town of Tung Chung.
	   Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa was the railway's first
passenger Sunday. Tung said the railway is ``an illustration of our
strength _ reliability, efficiency, and above all, quality. These
are attributes which not only apply to the railway but also to our
community.''
	   The Airport Railway is composed of two lines _ a six-stop local
line linking downtown to Tung Chung and a four-stop express line
going directly to the airport.
	   The local line began service Sunday, while the express train
will start with the new airport July 6.
	   Authorities earlier this year had to postpone the airport's
opening from April to July because of a delay in completing the
railway.
	   Jack So, chairman of the Mass Transit Railway, said at the
opening ceremony the Airport Railway was the first-ever train
system to have been designed specifically to serve an airport.
	   Passengers will be able to board the express train at the
airport terminal. Flight information will be available in the train
carriages, which resemble first-class flight cabins.
	   The journey takes 23 minutes, compared with more than one hour
by bus. Passenger check-in will be available at the railway's
downtown terminal.
	   One-way tickets are 100 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 12.80), but
a 30 percent discount will be given until Oct. 6.
	   Still, ticket prices have been criticized as too steep.
	   The new airport will replace Kai Tai International Airport,
situated in the heart of Hong Kong. Operating round-the clock, it
will be able to handle 35 million passengers a year, and is
expected to eventually be able to deal with 87 million passengers
annually.
	   Chinese President Jiang Zemin will officiate at the airport's
opening on July 2, although it will not be open for commercial use
until July 6.

Disappointing start for annual Great Singapore Sale 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ An annual event to drum up business in affluent
Singapore got off to a disappointing start as the economic downturn
continued to curb consumer spending, a Sunday newspaper reported.
	   Shoppers along Orchard Road, the country's central retail
district, said Saturday they were not buying much on the first day
of the Great Singapore Sale, an annual event featuring discounts at
stores throughout the island republic.
	   Consumers said they were watching their wallets because of the
economic slump, The Sunday Times reported.
	   ``I used to spend about 500 Singapore dollars (dlrs 310) on
clothes but this year, I'm going to spend around 200 Singapore
dollars (dlrs 120),'' Nazhirah Rahim, a 16-year old student, told
the newspaper. ``I will only buy things that I need.''
	   The monthlong sale, extended to five weeks this year, has
experienced mixed results since it began in 1994. In the last few
years, retailers have enjoyed only marginally higher turnover
during the much-publicized nationwide sale, with much of the
increased revenue at the start of the event.
	   Earlier this year, the Singapore Retailers Association said it
expected a 30 percent decline in retail sales from April through
September, because of declining tourist arrivals and the Asian
economic crisis.

Pope to beatify three Austrians, including nun be led after beatification ceremony begins at 0730 GMT.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Midway through his visit, Pope John Paul
II has failed to address the increasing split between conservative
Austrian Catholics and those who want the church to become more
progressive.
	   On Sunday, the pope will beatify three Austrians, including a
nun beheaded by the Nazis, in a nationally televised ceremony on
Vienna's sweeping Heldenplatz, or Heroes' Square, where Adolf
Hitler was cheered by tens of thousands after annexing his native
Austria in 1938.
	   On Saturday, the pope held an open air Mass at St. Poelten, some
60 kilometers (37 miles) west of Vienna, and the seat of Austria's
most controversial bishop, conservative Kurt Krenn.
	   Krenn is at the center of a storm rocking the Austrian church.
Many Austrian Catholics object to the pope's conservative policies
on naming bishops, priestly celibacy and refusing to ordain women.
	   No protests disturbed the Mass, attended by some 25,000 people.
But Krenn opponents stood at the edges of the crowd, holding black
balloons and slogans such as ``Krenn, a shepherd without a flock,''
and handing out anti-Krenn leaflets.
	   Krenn has insisted on supporting Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer,
accused of sexually molesting trainee priests. Groer, another
conservative, was replaced as Archbishop of Vienna after the first
allegations surfaced in 1995.
	   This spring, Groer was sent into exile at a monastery in Germany
after the Vatican launched an inquiry into new allegations of
sexual abuse.
	   Krenn mentioned Groer by name as someone who should be included
in Catholics' prayers _ a gesture that is sure to deepen the
church's divisions.
	   John Paul did not mention Groer, or appointments in the Austrian
church. Many Austrian Catholics had hoped for some papal apology.
	   Austrians were waiting for ``that redeeming little phrase ...
`I'm sorry that I sent you many a bishop without listening to your
wishes and requirements. I'm sorry that I caused divisions in your
church,''' the main daily in Salzburg wrote in a front-page
editorial Saturday.
	   When he met with diplomats in Vienna's former Imperial Palace on
Saturday, John Paul had a strong message for the diplomats and
politicians gathered in the Hofburg palace, and Europeans beyond _
seek reconciliation with the Jews for the ``unspeakable suffering''
inflicted on them.
	   ``Don't forget the history of Europe is closely intertwined with
the history of that people from which the Lord Jesus came,'' John
Paul said. ``The Jewish people have been inflicted with unspeakable
suffering in Europe, and we can't affirm that all the roots of
these injustices have been cut.''
	   ``Reconciliation with the Jews is one of the fundamental duties
of Christians in Europe,'' John Paul said.
	   John Paul has spoken out often against anti-Semitism and the
horrors of the Holocaust, when an estimated six million Jews
perished at the hands of the Nazis.
	   But Saturday was believed to be the first time he put the burden
specifically on Europeans to make amends.
	   John Paul also noted the aspirations of the former communist
countries in Europe as the 15-nation European Union _ of which
Austria assumes the presidency July 1 _ considers taking them in.
The pope insisted that Western Europe cannot remain an ``island of
Western well-being on the continent.''
	   ``The richer countries, inevitably, will have to make concrete
sacrifices'' to overcome the ``inhuman'' economic differences, the
pope said.

Jones wins 100, long jump in quest for three titles AP Track Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with late events and quotes; CORRECTS Jones' time in
3rd graf to 22.46 sted 23.46.
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Marion Jones, attempting a feat not
accomplished in 50 years, got off to a rousing start Saturday night
by winning the women's 100 meters and long jump in the USA Track
and Field Championships.
	   Jones, trying to sweep the 100, 200 and long jump _ done only by
Stella Walsh, with the last of her four times in 1948 _ was clocked
in a sparkling 10.72 seconds in the 100 despite a slow start and
won the long jump with a wind-aided 23 feet, 8 inches (7.21
meters), despite jumping only twice.
	   She completed an exhausting day by winning her 200 semifinal
heat in 22.46. Only she has run faster this year. The 200 final is
Sunday.
	   Jones' 100 time was the seventh-fastest in history and only .01
seconds off her career best, which she ran in Friday night's
semifinals and earlier in the season. Only Florence Griffith
Joyner, the world record-holder at 10.49, has run faster than
Jones, clocking 10.70 or better four times.
	   ``She's one of the greatest female athletes ever to walk on this
planet,'' Jones' coach, Trevor Graham, said. ``She is very
competitive, eager to learn and to understand her sport more. She
is going to be great in all three events in the next couple of
years.''
	   Many would say she already is great.
	   In 1997, her first year in track and field after playing
basketball for North Carolina, she was the only woman to win two
gold medals in the world championships, in the 100 and 400 relay.
	   In the 100 final, Jones did not come out of the blocks quickly
and trailed early. But by 30 meters, she had surged into the lead,
then accelerated in the middle of the race and won comfortably over
Chryste Gaines, runner-up in a career-best 10.89.
	   ``I'm very excited with the time, but I thought I would run a
little faster,'' Jones said. ``But I have two more events to go
today.''
	   In the first of those other events, she produced her winning
jump, then fouled and passed her final four jumps before racing to
victory in her 200 heat, which was switched to a semifinal from a
quarterfinal because of the lack of entrants.
	   Jones said she was attempting the rare triple because ``to keep
myself excited about the sport, I have to set goals. Not everyone
can do it.''
	   The men's 100 final became anticlimactic when Maurice Greene,
the world champion, withdrew because of stomach and leg cramps.
	   ``I'm sad,'' said Greene, who had hoped to break the world
record of 9.84. ``I'm disappointed. I had big plans for this
championship meet.
	   ``I misjudged the heat and my body's dehydrated and keeps
cramping up. I've depleted my body of all its minerals. It wouldn't
help the sport if I got out there and quit.''
	   With Greene and 1992 Olympic bronze medalist Dennis Mitchell
also withdrawing because of a leg cramp during warmups, Tim Harden
won in a wind-aided 9.88, with Brian Lewis second at 9.98 and Tim
Montgomery third at 9.99. The wind was a strong 4.9 meters per
second, or 10.96 mph, well over the allowable 2.0 meters per
second, or 4.473 mph, for record purposes.
	   John Godina completed the first shot put-discus double in the
nationals in 43 years by winning the shot at 71-2 3/4 (21.71
meters). For the two-time world champion, it was his first national
shot put title. He won his second straight discus championship
Friday night.
	   The last to win both was Parry O'Brien in 1955.
	   ``I've never had a better year,'' Godina said. ``This has been
the best preparation of my life. I've worked harder, more
consistently and gotten much stronger.
	   ``It was nice to see it pay off.''
	   Oft-injured Mary Slaney again got hurt. Slaney, 39, pulled up
with two laps remaining in the 5,000 with a tendon injury to her
lower right leg. She was helped out of the stadium and treated in
the medical tent.
	   ``I heard something pop,'' the grief-stricken Slaney said. ``I
can't put any weight on it.''
	   Chris Huffins produced the best decathlon score in the world
this year and the best of his career with 8,694 points in the 10
events over two days of suffocating heat.
	   LaMark Carter won his second national triple jump title with a
leap of 57-2 3/4 (17.44 meters), the longest of his career and
longest in the world this year.
	   Bryan Bronson, bronze medalist in the world championships, ran
the fastest time in the world this year in the 400 hurdles, 47.81
in a semifinal heat. Derrick Adkins, the 1996 Olympic champion who
has been bothered by a hamstring injury for six weeks, finished
last in his hurdles semifinal and failed to reach the final.
	   Butch Reynolds, the world record-holder in the 400, failed to
advance to the final, finishing fifth in his semifinal heat in
45.40, more than two seconds slower than his best of 43.29.
	   Other winners included Regina Jacobs in the women's 5,000 at
15:32.31, Tisha Waller in the women's high jump at 6-4 1/4 (1.94
meters), Lance Deal in the men's hammer throw at 256-6 (78.18
meters), Kelly Blair-LoBounty in the heptathlon with 6,402 points,
the best by an American in 1998, and Dan Browne in the men's 10,000
in 29:46.06.

Albanian local elections a test for coalition government

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Albanians voted Sunday in local elections
expected to show if the Socialist-led coalition government still
has popular support after a year of rule.
	   About 20 political parties, grouped in three major coalitions,
were taking part in the elections in nine districts and seven
municipalities.
	   The ruling Socialists and their allies formed the Alliance for
the State, while opposition parties, including the Democratic Party
of former President Sali Berisha, were grouped in the Unity for
Democracy.
	   Right-wing parties were united around the United Right.
	   The hot spot of the elections was expected to be the southern
town of Vlora _ the cradle of the insurgency that spread last year
after pyramid schemes collapsed, causing most Albanians to lose
their life savings.
	   Vlora residents remain angry with Berisha and his party, whom
they blame for the lost money and the hundreds of deaths during the
insurgency. But they also are unhappy with the ruling Socialists,
whom they accuse of incompetence and corruption.
	   Twenty of about 40 foreign observers were stationed in Vlora, in
addition to over 100 Albanian monitors distributed throughout the
voting centers.
	   Official results are expected to be made public in a week.

Iran's parliament starts impeachment proceedings against interior minister 
</HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's interior minister, accused of
jeopardizing the Islamic nation's stability, appeared in Parliament
Sunday to respond to questions by 31 hard-line deputies demanding
his impeachment.
	   The deputies signed the motion earlier this month asking for the
impeachment of Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri for allowing a
rally last month to protest the influence of the hard-line clergy
in Iran.
	   The impeachment motion was the latest attempt by conservative
members of Iran's ruling clergy to discredit officials loyal to
reformist President Mohammad Khatami, who took power last August.
	   The motion accuses Nouri, a clergyman, of ``creating tension in
the society, making provocative interviews and speeches in
different provinces and appointing inexperienced people to
managerial posts at the ministry.''
	   In Sunday's hearing, Nouri was also criticized for being quoted
on Israeli radio.
	   But Nouri countered by saying he was not responsible where his
comments appeared.
	   ``I've given dozens of press conferences and interviews and some
parliament members go looking for a couple of words here and there
... to use against me. That's not fair,'' he told a packed
parliament hall.
	   Several hard-line deputies claimed drug-smuggling, kidnappings
and violence had increased since Nouri assumed power. They also
accused Nouri of hiring people who were not entirely committed to
the ideals of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution and for firing people
who were not liberals.
	   ``Through uncalculated and unwise moves, Nouri, instead of
promoting democracy, created tension, anarchy and violence in the
society,'' said Parliament member Mohammad Reza Bahonar, one of the
deputies who initiated the proceedings against the interior
minister.
	   The Parliament session was broadcast live on national radio.
	   The motion will be later put to the 270-member body for a vote.
	   Khatami's landslide victory in May 1997 shook the foundations of
Iran's clerical rule and was considered a triumph for civil
liberties in this Islamic republic.
	   Khatami still struggles, however, with hard-line opponents who
accuse him of betraying the 1979 Islamic revolution led by the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   Ali Khamenei, who succeeded Khomeini, remains Iran's powerful
spiritual leader.

	   LYON, France (AP) _ Iranians partied on the streets Sunday,
working themselves up to a happy frenzy for their World Cup match
with the United States, and they were joined by Americans caught up
in spirit of a friendly rivalry.
	   Police watched carefully for any signs of trouble, but nothing
suggested politics would mar the big game Sunday night.
	   The Lyonnais, an easy-going sort of Frenchmen who inhabit
France's second city, were not rattled. ``Things should be fine,''
shrugged Andre Rannaud, a waiter at Le Regent Cafe, with large
glass windows overlooking the Place Bellecour, where fans will
party. ``It's a sporting event.''
	   Feri Eftekhari, a London surgeon in a white truck full of Iran
T-shirts, handed them out to anyone, Americans included, who wanted
to join the party.
	   ``Nothing but sports could do this,'' he said, looking at a
Rhone River bridge where U.S. and Iranian flags snapped
side-by-side in the wind. ``Governments want to make something
political of this match, but it is only about people getting
along.''
	   American fans shared his sentiments.
	   Douglas Logan, a New Yorker who is commissioner of Major League
Soccer, alighted from a special train Saturday with 350 Americans
in subdued dress. Except for the odd American flag hat, they might
have coming to sample Lyon's fabled restaurants.
	   ``I think too much has been made of the political aspects,''
Logan said. ``There is enough pressure already on these kids. This
is an athletic event.''
	   But French police were taking no chances. Discreet
reinforcements were ready in case of demonstrations. About a half
million Iranians live in Europe within easy driving distance of
Lyon. Other organizations might also seize the occasion.
	   On Saturday, 50 members of the Association for Women's Rights
Against Fundamentalism marched through downtown. They paused every
few minutes to lie in the street and cover themselves with black
chadors to protest what they said was tyranny in Iran.
	   But despite the bitter rivalry between their governments,
American and Iranian fans were in a relaxed mood before a game that
might take the winner past the first World Cup round.
	   Saied Nili, a telecommunications consultant with U.S. West in
England, unloaded the car that brought him and three other Iranians
to town. He laughed at the suggestion of disturbances.
	   ``If you want trouble, you'll have to go see the English, or the
Dutch, one of those civilized European countries,'' he said.
``We'll give you carnival.''
	   His friend, who preferred to be named only as Feridoon, added,
``It'll be very friendly. What the two governments couldn't do in
10 years, the two nations will fix.''
	   James Appleby, a 33-year-old Washington, D.C., pharmacist and
self-confessed soccer addict, echoed that thought.
	   ``It's unfair to the team to put such pressure on them,'' he
said. ``Their careers are at stake. If they do well, they'll get
contracts with European clubs. We should keep politics out of it.''
	   For most Iranians, the important thing was less the opponent
than the fact that they were there at all. They were the last to
qualify, squeaking past Australia, for their first World Cup
competition since 1978.
	   ``This gives the world a chance to see another side of Iran, and
it gives us a chance to get together,'' Dr. Eftekhari said.
Iranians were coming from as far away as Australia.
	   ``We're scattered around the world,'' he said. ``This is when we
can get together, sing a song, and have some love for each other.''
	   Farzin Hashemi, president of an umbrella group called the
International Council of Resistance of Iran, took the occasion to
condemn the Islamic leadership in Iran.
	   ``The huge crowds of people waving flags will be supporting the
players and the team and their culture, not the government,''
Hashemi said. ``It is important to make that distinction.''
	   Leaders in Tehran wanted badly to win, he added, but in the end
it is only a soccer game. ``The concept that this is like ping-pong
diplomacy with China is just an illusion. Change can only come from
within Iran.''

	   But French police were taking no chances. Discreet
reinforcements were ready in case of demonstrations. About a half
million Iranians live in Europe within easy driving distance of
Lyon. Other organizations might also seize the occasion.
	   On Saturday, 50 members of the Association for Women's Rights
Against Fundamentalism marched through downtown. They paused every
few minutes to lie in the street and cover themselves with black
chadors to protest what they said was tyranny in Iran.
	   But despite the bitter rivalry between their governments,
American and Iranian fans were in a relaxed mood before a game that
might take the winner past the first World Cup round.
	   Saied Nili, a telecommunications consultant with U.S. West in
England, unloaded the car that brought him and three other Iranians
to town. He laughed at the suggestion of disturbances.
	   ``If you want trouble, you'll have to go see the English, or the
Dutch, one of those civilized European countries,'' he said.
``We'll give you carnival.''
	   His friend, who preferred to be named only as Feridoon, added,
``It'll be very friendly. What the two governments couldn't do in
10 years, the two nations will fix.''
	   James Appleby, a 33-year-old Washington, D.C., pharmacist and
self-confessed soccer addict, echoed that thought.
	   ``It's unfair to the team to put such pressure on them,'' he
said. ``Their careers are at stake. If they do well, they'll get
contracts with European clubs. We should keep politics out of it.''
	   For most Iranians, the important thing was less the opponent
than the fact that they were there at all. They were the last to
qualify, squeaking past Australia, for their first World Cup
competition since 1978.
	   ``This gives the world a chance to see another side of Iran, and
it gives us a chance to get together,'' Dr. Eftekhari said.
Iranians were coming from as far away as Australia.
	   ``We're scattered around the world,'' he said. ``This is when we
can get together, sing a song, and have some love for each other.''
	   Farzin Hashemi, president of an umbrella group called the
International Council of Resistance of Iran, took the occasion to
condemn the Islamic leadership in Iran.
	   ``The huge crowds of people waving flags will be supporting the
players and the team and their culture, not the government,''
Hashemi said. ``It is important to make that distinction.''
	   Leaders in Tehran wanted badly to win, he added, but in the end
it is only a soccer game. ``The concept that this is like ping-pong
diplomacy with China is just an illusion. Change can only come from
within Iran.''

Japanese credit bank denies merger talks 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with banks denying merger talks
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese bank that has rejected gloomy rumors
about its economic health denied reports Sunday that it is in
merger negotiations.
	   The national newspaper Asahi said talks bad begun about merging
the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd.,
a major Tokyo-based commercial lender.
	   LTCB issued a statement calling the article ``not true.'' It
also denied the Asahi's report that it was considering pulling out
of its overseas operations.
	   Dai-Ichi Kangyo also issued a statement denying that it is in
merger negotiations with LTCB.
	   Dai-Ichi Kangyo is LTCB's largest single shareholder, owning
about 3.6 percent of its stock.
	   The Asahi said a merger between Dai-Ichi Kangyo and LTCB would
create Japan's second-largest bank after the Bank of
Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd.
	   On Friday, the Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended trading in shares
of LTCB after a downgrade by Moody's Investors Services sparked
frantic selling.
	   An LTCB spokesman called the move unfortunate and said he
couldn't understand what prompted Moody's downgrade. He said the
bank would try to persuade the U.S.-based agency to reverse its
rating.
	   The Finance Ministry also tried to allay fears the bank was in
trouble.
	   ``The LTCB has a concrete financing plan for the coming month,
and the ministry doesn't see any problems after that,'' said a
senior ministry official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   In March, LTCB announced problem loans amounting to 1.4 trillion
yen (dlrs 10 billion). Most of those were made to property buyers
during the land price bubble of the late 1980s.
	   Last week, shares in LTCB lost about 40 percent of their value
last week on rumors that the bank was struggling to stay afloat.
	   Separately, the newspaper Mainichi reported Sunday that Japanese
financial authorities are considering a plan to transform the
private Long-Term Credit Bank into a state-funded repository
designed to absorb bad loans from across the banking sector.
	   Hobbled by billions of dollars in bad loans resulting from the
collapse of a speculative real estate bubble, Japan's banking
industry has only begun to be been shaken out of complacency.
	   In May, the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. announced a tie-up
with top Japanese brokerage house Nomura Securities Co. Last
November, leading commercial lender Hokkaido Takushoku Bank Ltd.
failed due to its massive bad loan burden.

O'Davis undergoes voluntary drug test 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby league international
Robbie O'Davis volunteered to take part in a drug test Sunday even
though he did not play in a match involving his National Rugby
League club Newcastle.
	   Australian Sports Drug Agency officials tested O'Davis and all
players involved in the match, won 22-12 by Canberra, with the
exception of Newcastle's Glenn Grief who had been taken to hospital
with a rib injury.
	   O'Davis attended the match even though he was not selected after
suffering a back injury in Friday night's State of Origin game won
by Queensland over New South Wales.
	   He had been at the center of controversy for the past week after
escaping a drug hearing on Monday night on a technicality after
tests found he had elevated levels of epitestosterone.
	   Despite two positive drug tests, O'Davis escaped a possible
two-year suspension because it was found the NRL tribunal did not
have the legal jurisdiction to hear his case.
	   All 34 players in the Manly-Penrith game at Brookvale Oval were
also tested Sunday.
	   On Saturday, the National Rugby League and O'Davis agreed to
hold a new hearing of his case under the jurisdiction of the
Australian Rugby League's Doping Policy and Procedure.
	   In a joint statement both O'Davis and the NRL said they wanted
the matter heard.
	   New South Wales fullback Tim Brasher predicted Sunday that any
players who were taking drugs would stop because the NRL would take
a harder line.
	   Brasher was responding to questions about a survey in Sydney's
Sunday Telegraph newspaper which claimed up to 100 first-grade
players could be using performance-enhancing drugs without being
detected.
	   The survey also showed 23 percent of the 100 players polled
believed almost one out of three players used body-building drugs
regularly.

Iraq says Annan shrugging obligations under arms deal 
</HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has done
nothing to fulfill his promise to get the eight-year sanctions
lifted, an Iraqi newspaper said Sunday.
	   The ruling Baath Party newspaper al-Thawra said Annan had
promised to work for the removal of the embargo in a deal he signed
with Iraqi leaders February 23.
	   ``Mr. Annan is legally and morally responsible for the sanctions
file... and under the February deal he is under obligation to bring
this matter to the attention of the Security Council,'' the paper
said in a front-page editorial.
	   The February deal gave U.N. arms inspectors _ charged with
overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _
unconditional access to all sites in Iraq, including presidential
compounds.
	   The United States and Britain had threatened air and missile
strikes if Iraq did not allow the monitors into President Saddam
Hussein's palaces.
	   The al-Thawra editorial reflects Iraq's frustration over the
continued U.N. sanctions which were imposed following Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait. It was the first time that Iraq claims Annan is
shrugging off promises he made in the deal.
	   On Friday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously agreed to allow
Baghdad to spend dlrs 300 million using its oil-for-food revenues
to boost exports. The oil plan skirts U.N. trade sanctions. It
originally allowed Iraq to export dlrs 2 billion each six months.
The figure was raised to dlrs 5.2 billion early this year.

Crew 2, MetroStars 1 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) _ Billy Thompson's goal in the 63rd minute
gave Columbus a 2-1 victory over New York-New Jersey on Saturday
night as the Crew moved past the MetroStars and into second place
in the MLS's Eastern Division.
	   Brian Kelley gave the MetroStars the lead with a volley from six
yards out off an assist by Eduardo Hurtado in the seventh minute.
	   But for the first time this season New York gave up a lead.
	   Columbus' Stern John fought off two defenders and ran down a
loose ball in the box and put a shot over a diving Tony Meola to
tie the game in the 29th minute. John, who was assisted by Andrew
Gregor, scored his ninth goal of the season.
	   Thompson broke the tie with a low right-footed shot from 10
yards out. He was assisted by Marcelo Carrera and Brian West.
	   New York almost tied the game in the 71st minute when Hurtado
bounced a hard shot from 15 yards out off goalkeeper Mark
Dougherty. Hurtado directed the rebound back towards the goal but
defender Todd Yeagley blocked his shot.
	   Both teams have 8-7 records, but the Crew have 24 points, two
more than the MetroStars.
 &UR; United, Wizards, postponed
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, severe weather forced the postponement
of Saturday night's game between D.C. United and the Kansas City
Wizards, the first time a Major League Soccer game has been called
off.
	   The game was stopped with 37:46 left in the second half with the
teams tied 0-0. After an 84-minute delay, officials postponed the
game, which was delayed seven minutes at the start of the second
half because of lightning.
	   A makeup date has not been set.
	   Thunderstorms moving through the area Saturday night produced
high winds and hail of up to golf-ball size, the National Weather
Service said.

World Cup: Dutch treat as entire Netherlands squad pitches in 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS club affiliations of Bergkamp and Cocu
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ It was a Dutch treat at the World Cup,
with all of the Netherlands players pitching in for a 5-0 win over
South Korea.
	   Phillip Cocu and Mark Overmars shot the Netherlands into a 2-0
halftime lead Saturday night before Dennis Bergkamp, Pierre van
Hooijdonk and Ronald de Boer added three more in the final 18
minutes to restore the Dutch team's second round hopes, and destroy
the South Koreans'.
	   With the result, the Netherlands moved to the top of Group E.
That means the team needs only a draw with Mexico to qualify for
the next round.
	   ``We had many goals and it is good to know you don't have to
depend on just one player to score goals,'' said Netherlands coach
Guus Hiddink. ``Our first goal by Cocu was an important one. It
broke the impasse, and the other players then began scoring.''
	   Hiddink's starting lineup raised a few eyebrows, with an
unexpected shuffling of positions that saw Cocu promoted to striker
from midfield, Ronald De Boer shifting to right wing and the
addition of midfielders Edgar Davids and Wim Jonk.
	   But the role swapping hardly appeared to ruffle the squad, as
the team went on to record the biggest score of the tournament, and
further whittle down South Korea's hopes for a first win in five
World Cup appearances.
	   ``Our strength is that we have 22 very good players, all very
talented with many qualities,'' said Frank de Boer, brother to
Ronald, who scored the fifth and final goal of the match.
	   The slick and speedy South Koreans caused a few problems for the
Dutch in the first half, but the Netherlands maintained control and
finally took the lead in the 38th minute when Cocu broke the ice.
	   Cocu was only promoted to the striker's role after Patrick
Kluivert's was suspended for two matches for elbowing Lorenzo
Staelens during the Dutch team's 0-0 draw with Belgium.
	   ``It was the first time in two and a half years that I played
this position,'' said Cocu. ``It was a big change but we have so
much talent on our team I was just happy to be playing all the
time.
	   ``At first I underestimated what I had to do,'' said Cocu.
``With Bergkamp not at the top of his physical level, I had to work
harder. I had to for the team, as the more time Bergkamp spent in
the pitch, the more chances we had.
	   ``I suffered for it but in the end it paid off,'' added the
Dutch star, who is moving from PSV Eindhoven to Barcelona.
	   Arsenal midfielder Bergkamp was starting his first match since
April when he was sidelined with a hamstring injury.
	   ``At first we had difficulty scoring but we played well,'' said
Bergkamp. ``In the end the South Koreans went down mentally and
that was the difference.''
	   Indeed, as the South Koreans appeared to give way under
pressure, most of the second-half action took place in front of Kim
Byong-ji's net.
	   ``It was very tense in the second half and I was under a lot of
pressure,'' said the South Korean netminder. ``Of course as a
goalkeeper I'm always ready to stop goals, but it was still a lot
of hard work and quite stressful.''

World Cup: England coach likes underdog role 
</HEADLINE>
By MORLEY MYERS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) - On the back of winning starts, England
and Romania clash at the 37,000-capacity Municipal Stadium on
Monday night knowing victory will virtually ensure a place in the
last 16 of the World Cup.
	   Security has been stepped up in this southwestern city to
prevent street violence of the kind that erupted in Marseille last
weekend before the England-Tunisia match. Several hundred English
hooligans were blamed for triggered the disturbances.
	   With scouts from each side sizing up the opposition, England
opened its Group G campaign June 15 by defeating Tunisia 2-0 and
Romania clipped Colombia 1-0.
	   What they saw resulted in words of mutual respect from England
manager Glenn Hoddle and his Romanian counterpart Anghel Iordanescu
regarding the quality on display.
	   England impressed with its defensive steel, supplemented by the
midfield industry of Paul Ince and David Batty in the engine room.
Up front, team captain Alan Shearer added to his impressive scoring
record and newcomer Paul Scholes weighed in with England's other
goal.
	   Romania, for its part, showed that reports its team had died
from old age were exaggerated. Star playmaker Gheorghe Hagi, 33,
demonstrated he was still a force to be reckoned with alongside the
other 30-pluses, Dan Petrescu and Gheorghe Popescu. Meanwhile,
23-year-old striker Adrian Ilie proved his lethal finishing touch
with the winning goal.
	   ``Romania are a smashing side and they have an impressive
pedigree,'' said Hoddle, pointing out that the Romanians made the
World Cup quarterfinals four years ago in the United States and won
nine of their 10 World Cup qualifying matches for France.
	   While confident of England's ability, Hoddle regarded Romania as
the favorite for Monday's match.
	   ``They are the seeded team in the group and qualified for the
World Cup finals far easier than any other side in Europe,'' he
said. ``They also have a lot more World Cup experience than England
as we haven't a single player in the squad who has previously taken
part in the finals.''
	   He stressed, however, that ``we are not bad when we go into
games as underdogs.''
	   England official Peter Taylor, who saw the Romania-Columbia
match and prepared a dossier on Romania for Hoddle, was full of
praise for the Romanians.
	   ``They are a very talented team with very good individuals. They
have good movement and are a very good passing team. I looked at
Hagi for that and to see how his legs were.''
	   Taylor said the veteran midfielder, who has made more than 100
international appearance, was still an eye-catching player.
	   ``I was still quite impressed with his pace. People perhaps
think he can't run as much as he could, but whenever he wanted to
get anywhere quickly he did. He's a big threat and still very much
the governor of the team. The boss (Iordanescu) either gives him a
free role, or he goes where he fancies anyway.''
	   Iordanescu, like Hoddle, is looking for a win, even though he
must feel confident of Romania's chances against Tunisia in their
final match.
	   ``It would be a mistake to aim for a draw with England,'' he
said. ``They are strong and we cannot match their strength or their
efficient playing style, but we can counter them with our tactics
and technique. Our team is in great spirit and we are hopeful of
getting a good result. Trying to secure qualification at the last
moment against Tunisia would be a huge risk.''
	   The Romanian manager singled out Shearer as the main threat.
``He has a very good scoring record and is very consistent,'' he
said.
	   Iordanescu's has relied heavily on Chelsea defender Dan
Petrescu's first-hand knowledge of the England players in drawing
up his battle plans.
	   ``He has been a great help. Playing in the English league he
knows the players well,'' Iordanescu said.
	   Both managers are expected to keep the same starting lineups
from the opening matches. England's central defender Gareth
Southgate has been suffering from an ankle injury, but is likely to
get the go-ahead, while second-string goalkeeper Dumitru Stingaciu
is the only Romanian casualty.

Communist rebels threaten to seize Imelda Marcos, children, cronies 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Communist rebels, angered by a plan
to bury the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos in a heroes' cemetery,
said Sunday they would seize his wife, children and cronies to
answer for crimes.
	   A rebel spokesman condemned President-elect Joseph Estrada for
deciding to allow the burial of Marcos' remains at the Heroes'
Cemetery in metropolitan Manila next month. Workers have began to
construct a tomb there for the late president.
	   ``This is a hard slap on a country which suffered much and was
wantonly abused by the fascist Marcos dictatorship,'' spokesman
Gregorio Rosal said in a statement sent to The Associated Press and
also read over Manila radio station DZMM.
	   Rosal said administrations that followed the 1986 overthrow of
Marcos, headed by Corazon Aquino and incumbent President Fidel
Ramos, abandoned the quest for justice for thousands of victims of
human rights abuses under Marcos.
	   ``But it appears the incoming Estrada regime will do worse than
the criminal negligence of the past two administrations,'' said the
statement, written in Pilipino. Estrada takes office June 30.
	   ``In the face of this long and continuing assault on justice,
the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People's Army
declare its strong determination to have the relatives and cronies
of the fascist dictator answer for their crimes to the people,''
the statement said.
	   Rosal said special rebel units have been ordered to arrest
Marcos' wife, Imelda, and his children and cronies so they could
face trial in a rebel court. He did not specify any charges against
the Marcoses but mentioned human rights violations.
	   The Philippine government is claiming more than dlrs 500 million
in Marcos' Swiss bank accounts, alleging that it is part of funds
he amassed illegally during his 20-year rule.
	   His government also has been accused of torturing and murdering
political dissidents. Marcos' widow has been convicted of graft and
sentenced to 12 years in prison but is free on bail pending her
final Supreme Court appeal.
	   A court in Hawaii found Marcos liable for numerous human rights
abuses, and ordered his estate to pay dlrs 2 billion to 9,539
Filipinos who suffered under his strongman rule. No payment has yet
been made.
	   Opponents say Marcos, who died in exile in Hawaii in 1989, three
years after he was toppled in a ``people power'' revolt, would
``desecrate'' the burial ground.
	   Mrs. Aquino, who was swept into power by the 1986 revolt, said
Marcos does not deserve to be buried in the cemetery because ``he
is not a hero.''
	   Marcos' supporters say his burial there is appropriate because
he was a decorated veteran who fought during World War II.
	   Estrada, who was close to the Marcos family when he served as a
suburban mayor in the 1970s through the 1980s, said burying Marcos
would end the bitter conflict between Marcos' supporters and
opponents.
	   He also said the former president will not be given state honors
at the funeral, set for July 11.
	   Both Mrs. Aquino and Ramos refused to allow Marcos to be buried
at Heroes' Cemetery, partly because of possible clashes between
Marcos loyalists and opponents.
	   His body was allowed back in the Philippines in 1993, when it
was flown to his hometown of Batac in northern Ilocos Norte
province and placed in a glass casket inside an air-conditioned
crypt.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Over American protests, Israel's Cabinet was
expected to approve a plan Sunday that would extend Jerusalem
municipal authority over eight Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
	   The United States called the plan ``provocative'' and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in a telephone call to have the Cabinet reconsider.
	   The plan outraged Palestinians, who said Israel was unilaterally
annexing the settlements, the status of which is supposed to be
determined in negotiations on a final peace agreement. The
Palestinians hope to establish an independent state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   ``This plan is de facto annexation of all these Jewish
settlements to Israel,'' Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Ziad told
The Associated Press. ``It's another annexation of Palestinian
territories to the jurisdiction of Israel.''
	   The Palestinian Authority has filed a formal complaint with the
United Nations Security Council.
	   The plan, which was being debated Sunday afternoon by the
Cabinet, would also extend Jerusalem's boundaries westward into
Israel proper, annexing several suburbs in order to expand the
city's economic base.
	   But the part of the plan that came under fire would set up an
``umbrella authority'' over West Bank settlements surrounding
Jerusalem to the north, south and east _ putting them under the
city's authority for certain services, most notably building and
planning. Settlements normally have to get approval for any
construction from the defense ministry.
	   The United States has called for a ``time-out'' on any expansion
of Jewish settlements in an effort to help re-start the stalled
peace talks.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, speaking Sunday on Israel
Radio, called the American objections to the plan, which he said
was intended to streamline and improve municipal services such as
garbage collection, ``absurd.''
	   ``We are not talking about changing the status of any
settlement,'' he said, accusing the Palestinians of ``political
manipulation ... to create a crisis over nothing.''
	   David Bar-Illan, a top adviser to Netanyahu, insisted that the
plan would not change the status of the settlements in question.
	   ``If anything at all will happen in this area, there will be an
improvement of services which will originate in Jerusalem,'' he
said. ``But that has absolutely nothing to do with the status of
these areas.''
	   Hundreds of Israelis demonstrated at the entrance to the city on
Sunday morning, protesting the proposed annexation of their
suburbs, which they said would raise their taxes.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Pope John Paul II, addressing a crowd of
50,000 Sunday on Heroes' Square in downtown Vienna, beatified three
Austrians, including a nun beheaded by the Naizis.
	   It was that square where Nazi Germany's dictator Adolf Hitler
was cheered by at least 250,000 people after annexing his native
Austria in March 1938.
	   It was also the square where the pontiff presided over a church
service attended by 130,000 on his first of three pastoral visits
to this predominantly Catholic country in 1983.
	   The three Austrians beatified were Sister Restituta Kafka, who
was executed by the Nazis in 1943 on a charge of high treason,
Father Anton Schwartz, dubbed a ``workers' apostle, and Jakob Kern,
a Catholic monk who died at age 27.
	   Protest signs seen on the pope's route to the square, and some
of them on the square itself, hinted at the crisis in the Austrian
Catholic church, brought on by the appointment of conservative
bishops and a sex scandal involving a cardinal temporarily banished
by the Vatican to a German monastery.
	   ``We demand an end to discrimination against women in the Roman
Catholic church,'' said one sign
	   The signs were carried by members of ``We are the Church,'' a
group of laymen that collected a half-million signatures on a
petition urging thorough reforms in the Catholic church.
	   While invited to take a prominent place among the guests of
honor, the group's leader, Thomas Plankensteiner stayed among the
crowd.
	   As on the previous two days, the pontiff did not address the
conflict in the Austrian church.
	   To the applause of young people, he gave ``a special salute to
the youth,'' saying ``I am glad that you are present in such great
numbers.''
	   However, attendance was only about half of the 100,000 expected
by organizers.
	   Unlike the pope, Austrian Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, the
archbishop of Vienna, addressed the tense situation in his church.
	   Schoenborn spoke of ``the conflicts in our church, which in some
(people) have shaken the trust in the pope and the bishops.''
	   ``Not few feel that they are not being understood by the
shepherd and neglected in their concerns,'' he said. ``All this
calls for a turnabout, forgiveness, conciliation and renewal.''
	   On Saturday, the pope held an open-air Mass west of Vienna at
St. Poelten, seat of Austria's most controversial bishop,
conservative Kurt Krenn.
	   Krenn is at the center of a storm rocking the Austrian church.
Many Austrian Catholics object to the pope's conservative policies
on naming bishops, priestly celibacy and refusing to ordain women.
	   Krenn has insisted on supporting Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer,
accused of sexually molesting trainee priests. Groer, another
conservative, was replaced as archbishop of Vienna after the first
allegations surfaced in 1995.

Watts wins rain-shortened Yomiuri Open title 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NISHINOMIYA, Japan (AP) _ Overnight leader Brian Watts won his
first victory of the season Sunday as rain forced cancellation of
the final round of the Yomiuri Open.
	   The American won with a total of 10-under-par 134 for the 36
holes that could be played. Rain also washed out the second round
on Friday.
	   Total prize money was cut in half, to 50 million yen (dlrs
365,000), leaving a first prize of 9 million yen (dlrs 65,700) for
Watts, the 1986 and 1987 U.S. amateur golf champion.
	   Watts, now a regular on the Japan tour, had not won since the
Philip Morris Championship last November.
	   Kaname Yokoo placed second with 135, followed by Satoshi
Higashi, Katsumasa Miyamoto and Shigeki Maruyama, tied for third at
136.

Palestinian Authority arrests suspected Islamic militants 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ The Palestinian Authority arrested
35 suspected supporters of the militant Islamic Jihad group over
the past week, Israel Radio said Sunday.
	   Islamic Jihad spokesman Nafez Azzam confirmed that several
members of his organization had been summoned for interrogation,
but said they were not expected to remain in detention beyond a few
days. He could not give an exact number of those detained.
	   ``The Palestinian intelligence sent orders for the interrogation
of Islamic Jihad members in Khan Yunis,'' Azzam said. ``Some have
been released and some are still in detention.''
	   Palestinian officials said they were looking into the report.
	   The arrests began Tuesday, after Israeli soldiers shot and
killed Mohammed Bardawil, a former Islamic Jihad activist who was
discovered while planting a roadside bomb near an Israeli
settlement in the Gaza Strip. Bardawil was from Khan Yunis.
	   Azzam said Bardawil was working alone. ``There were no contacts
between him and the Islamic Jihad,'' he said.
	   Most of the Gaza Strip is under Palestinian control, while
Israel retains control of the areas around Jewish settlements and
the strip's borders with Israel and Egypt.

Communist rebels threaten to seize Imelda Marcos, children, cronies spokeswoman, grafs 13-14

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Communist rebels, angered by a plan
to bury the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos in a heroes' cemetery,
said Sunday they would seize his wife, children and cronies to
answer for crimes.
	   A rebel spokesman condemned President-elect Joseph Estrada for
deciding to allow the burial of Marcos' remains at the Heroes'
Cemetery in metropolitan Manila next month. Workers have began to
construct a tomb there for the late president.
	   ``This is a hard slap on a country which suffered much and was
wantonly abused by the fascist Marcos dictatorship,'' spokesman
Gregorio Rosal said in a statement sent to The Associated Press and
also read over Manila radio station DZMM.
	   Rosal said administrations that followed the 1986 overthrow of
Marcos, headed by Corazon Aquino and incumbent President Fidel
Ramos, abandoned the quest for justice for thousands of victims of
human rights abuses under Marcos.
	   ``But it appears the incoming Estrada regime will do worse than
the criminal negligence of the past two administrations,'' said the
statement, written in Pilipino. Estrada takes office June 30.
	   ``In the face of this long and continuing assault on justice,
the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People's Army
declare its strong determination to have the relatives and cronies
of the fascist dictator answer for their crimes to the people,''
the statement said.
	   Rosal said special rebel units have been ordered to arrest
Marcos' wife, Imelda, and his children and cronies so they could
face trial in a rebel court. He did not specify any charges against
the Marcoses but mentioned human rights violations.
	   The Philippine government is claiming more than dlrs 500 million
in Marcos' Swiss bank accounts, alleging that it is part of funds
he amassed illegally during his 20-year rule.
	   His government also has been accused of torturing and murdering
political dissidents. Marcos' widow has been convicted of graft and
sentenced to 12 years in prison but is free on bail pending her
final Supreme Court appeal.
	   A court in Hawaii found Marcos liable for numerous human rights
abuses, and ordered his estate to pay dlrs 2 billion to 9,539
Filipinos who suffered under his strongman rule. No payment has yet
been made.
	   Opponents say Marcos, who died in exile in Hawaii in 1989, three
years after he was toppled in a ``people power'' revolt, would
``desecrate'' the burial ground.
	   Mrs. Aquino, who was swept into power by the 1986 revolt, said
Marcos does not deserve to be buried in the cemetery because ``he
is not a hero.''
	   Marcos' supporters say his burial there is appropriate because
he was a decorated veteran who fought during World War II. About
200 supporters, carrying portraits of Marcos, demonstrated in
Manila Sunday to back the burial plan.
	   Sol Vanzai, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Marcos, appeared daunted by
the rebel threat. ``Imelda has never faced anything like this,''
she said, adding that the former first lady was still unaware of
the threat.
	   Estrada, who was close to the Marcos family when he served as a
suburban mayor in the 1970s through the 1980s, said burying Marcos
would end the bitter conflict between Marcos' supporters and
opponents.
	   He also said the former president will not be given state honors
at the funeral, set for July 11.
	   Both Mrs. Aquino and Ramos refused to allow Marcos to be buried
at Heroes' Cemetery, partly because of possible clashes between
Marcos loyalists and opponents.
	   His body was allowed back in the Philippines in 1993, when it
was flown to his hometown of Batac in northern Ilocos Norte
province and placed in a glass casket inside an air-conditioned
crypt.

Hong Kong activists depart for disputed islands 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A group of Hong Kong activists set out in a
trawler Sunday to join a protest armada to challenge Japanese
control over an uninhabited island group in the East China Sea.
	   With their boat bedecked with flags reading ``Chinese territory,
Diaoyu Islands,'' and ``Down with Japanese militarism,'' the 25
activists were seen off with cheers by families and well-wishers.
	   The Diaoyu, known in Japanese as the Senkaku, are controlled by
Japan but claimed by both Taiwan and China. Hong Kong returned to
Chinese rule last July.
	   ``Every Chinese has the responsibility to fight for what belongs
to us,'' said Zhang Likun, a mainland Chinese worker, on board the
10-ton Diaoyu Tai boat.
	   The group plans to plant a Chinese flag on one of the islands to
protest Japan's claim, expedition leader Albert Ho said.
	   Ho said they wanted to show ``the determination of the Chinese
people that we continue to protest against the Japanese ... for
their persistent refusal to confess all crimes committed against
the Chinese people.''
	   Two years ago, a Hong Kong activist jumped overboard and drowned
on a similar expedition when Japanese coast guard vessels prevented
him from landing on the islands.
	   On a later protest expedition, several activists from Taiwan and
Hong Kong succeeded in planting a flag briefly on one of the
islands.
	   Ho, a Democrat elected to the legislature last month, denied
earlier media reports that the group was armed with crossbows. He
said the group is unarmed and will avoid confrontation with the
Japanese.
	   ``We have no weapons, no sticks, no knives, no guns. All we have
is passion for our country,'' he said. ``We must emphasize that
this is a peaceful, rational and non-violent protest.''
	   The activists will meet with a group of right-wing Taiwanese
nationalists, led by Taipei County counselor Kin Chieh-shou, off
Keelung Island, just north of Taiwan, later this week before
proceeding to the Diaoyu Islands, Ho said.
	   The Hong Kong activists will return home before June 30, weather
permitting, Ho said.
	   The disputed islands lie amid rich fishing grounds and possible
oil and gas deposits midway between Taiwan and Japan's Okinawa
Island.
	   Japan originally claimed the chain in 1895, but China and Taiwan
say the islands have been Chinese for centuries. The United States
administered them after World War II, but turned over control to
Japan in 1972.

Workers call off six-week bank strike 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Workers at the nation's fourth-largest
bank voted early Sunday to return to work, ending a tense six-week
strike that tested the government's resolve to reform the economy.
	   During a general assembly, Ionian Bank employees decided to use
legal channels to press their demands for job and pension
guarantees.
	   Workers walked off the job May 8 to protest the bank's
privatization, and frequently clashed with riot police in the
following weeks. The sale of a 51.4 percent stake in the bank was
finalized Friday.
	   The general assembly voted to challenge the sale in court,
claiming it was decided illegally. They also asked the government
to withdraw riot police that have been stationed at the bank's
control center.
	   The six-week strike paralyzed the bank's operations, with 45,000
civil servants unable to receive their salaries.
	   The showdown over Ionian's privatization was widely seen as a
key test of the government's resolve to join Europe's single
currency club by 2001.
	   Violent clashes colored the six-week-long strike, culminating
Friday when workers stormed a shareholders meeting, overturning
tables, dismantling microphones, and physically assaulting the
bank's management.
	   Despite widespread social unrest and internal dissent within the
ruling Socialist party, Premier Costas Simitis appeared determined
to follow its privatization policy.
	   ``No small group armed with violence is going to sway the
country from its course toward modernization,'' he told reporters
Saturday.

Extreme rightists hold anti-foreigner rally in Berlin 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: REPEATING for European wires
<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ With the anti-foreigner slogan ``Jobs for Germans
first,'' about 300 neo-Nazis rallied against unemployment this
weekend at a communist-era housing project in eastern Berlin.
	   Dozens of police guarded the protest in the Hellersdorf
neighborhood on Saturday, primarily to prevent fighting between the
extreme-right National Democratic Party of Germany, or NPD, and
leftist punks who had planned a counter-demonstration.
	   The NPD had wanted to protest in front of the Brandenburg Gate,
a Berlin landmark, but police persuaded them to move the location
outside the city center and to keep it secret.
	   About 200 leftists gathered Saturday morning outside the local
government office in the neighborhood of Spandau, believing the
neo-Nazis might be meeting there. By noon, they had discovered the
protest site and moved to Hellersdorf.
	   Police reported no violence. They arrested 10 neo-Nazis for
carrying weapons. They also took seven neo-Nazis into custody
before the demonstration to prevent their attending.
	   German unemployment _ at 10.9 percent nationwide _ is twice as
severe in the former eastern states than in the west, because the
eastern states are still completing the transition from communism
to capitalism.
	   The NPD, which says foreigners are stealing jobs from Germans,
held a protest May 1 in the eastern city of Leipzig which drew
3,000-4,000 participants, one of the biggest neo-Nazi gatherings in
years.
	   An estimated 5,000 leftists marched through Leipzig to protest
right-wing extremism, and police used water cannons on dozens of
rioting leftists to keep them away from the neo-Nazis.

German foreign minister praises Kosovo-Albanian leader

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel on Saturday
invited Kosovo Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova to visit
Bonn, praising him for his peaceful efforts to end violence in
Kosovo province.
	   Kinkel urged Rugova to ``use all his influence'' to curb
fighting between Serb forces and the militant Kosovo Liberation
Army, which seeks independence from the Serb Republic that makes up
most of Yugoslavia.
	   Rugova also wants secession, but his longtime pacifism has put
him at odds with the KLA.
	   More than 300 people have died in fighting since March, when
Serbian police began a crackdown on the militants they call
``terrorists.'' Most Kosovo Albanians, who outnumber Serbs nine to
one in the province, want independence.
	   Kinkel, who called for an end to the violence, emphasized that
the international community has not only condemned the Serbs but
also urged the KLA to cease its attacks.
	   He said the German government was committed to a solution which
``secures the legitimate interests of the Kosovo Albanians without
calling into question the territorial interests of Yugoslavia.''
	   He warned Rugovo that ``only he who is prepared to carry out
dialogue on this basis can receive our support.''

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Communist rebels, angered by a plan
to bury the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos in a heroes' cemetery,
said Sunday they would seize his wife, children and cronies to
answer for crimes.
	   A rebel spokesman condemned President-elect Joseph Estrada for
deciding to allow the burial of Marcos' remains at the Heroes'
Cemetery in metropolitan Manila next month. Workers have began to
construct a tomb there for the late president.
	   ``This is a hard slap on a country which suffered much and was
wantonly abused by the fascist Marcos dictatorship,'' spokesman
Gregorio Rosal said in a statement sent to The Associated Press and
also read over Manila radio station DZMM.
	   Rosal said administrations that followed the 1986 overthrow of
Marcos, headed by Corazon Aquino and incumbent President Fidel
Ramos, abandoned the quest for justice for thousands of victims of
human rights abuses under Marcos.
	   ``But it appears the incoming Estrada regime will do worse than
the criminal negligence of the past two administrations,'' said the
statement, written in Pilipino. Estrada takes office June 30.
	   ``In the face of this long and continuing assault on justice,
the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People's Army
declare its strong determination to have the relatives and cronies
of the fascist dictator answer for their crimes to the people,''
the statement said.
	   Rosal said special rebel units have been ordered to arrest
Marcos' wife, Imelda, and his children and cronies so they could
face trial in a rebel court. He did not specify any charges against
the Marcoses but mentioned human rights violations.
	   The Philippine government is claiming more than dlrs 500 million
in Marcos' Swiss bank accounts, alleging that it is part of funds
he amassed illegally during his 20-year rule.
	   His government also has been accused of torturing and murdering
political dissidents. Marcos' widow has been convicted of graft and
sentenced to 12 years in prison but is free on bail pending her
final Supreme Court appeal.
	   A court in Hawaii found Marcos liable for numerous human rights
abuses, and ordered his estate to pay dlrs 2 billion to 9,539
Filipinos who suffered under his strongman rule. No payment has yet
been made.
	   Opponents say Marcos, who died in exile in Hawaii in 1989, three
years after he was toppled in a ``people power'' revolt, would
``desecrate'' the burial ground.
	   Mrs. Aquino, who was swept into power by the 1986 revolt, said
Marcos does not deserve to be buried in the cemetery because ``he
is not a hero.''
	   Marcos' supporters say his burial there is appropriate because
he was a decorated veteran who fought during World War II. About
200 supporters, carrying portraits of Marcos, demonstrated in
Manila Sunday to back the burial plan.
	   Sol Vanzi, a spokeswoman for Mrs. Marcos, appeared daunted by
the rebel threat. ``Imelda has never faced anything like this,''
she said, adding that the former first lady was still unaware of
the threat.
	   Police superintendent Napoleon de los Santos said police would
consider deploying policemen to protect Mrs. Marcos and her
children.
	   Estrada, who was close to the Marcos family when he served as a
suburban mayor in the 1970s through the 1980s, said burying Marcos
would end the bitter conflict between Marcos' supporters and
opponents.
	   He also said the former president will not be given state honors
at the funeral, set for July 11.
	   Both Mrs. Aquino and Ramos refused to allow Marcos to be buried
at Heroes' Cemetery, partly because of possible clashes between
Marcos loyalists and opponents.
	   His body was allowed back in the Philippines in 1993, when it
was flown to his hometown of Batac in northern Ilocos Norte
province and placed in a glass casket inside an air-conditioned
crypt.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Pope John Paul II, addressing a crowd of
50,000 Sunday on Heroes' Square in downtown Vienna, beatified three
Austrians, including a nun beheaded by the Nazis.
	   It was the square where the pontiff presided over a church
service attended by 130,000 in 1983 on his first of three pastoral
visits to this predominantly Roman Catholic country.
	   The three Austrians beatified were Sister Restituta Kafka, who
was executed by the Nazis in 1943 on a charge of high treason;
Father Anton Schwartz, dubbed a ``workers' apostle,'' and Jakob
Kern, a Catholic monk who died at age 27.
	   The sweeping Heldenplatz, or Heroes' Square, was where Adolf
Hitler received the cheers of tens of thousands after annexing his
native Austria in 1938.
	   Protest signs on the pope's route to the square and on the
square itself hinted at the crisis in the Austrian Catholic Church,
brought on by the appointment of conservative bishops and a sex
scandal involving a cardinal temporarily banished by the Vatican to
a German monastery.
	   There is an increasing split between conservative Austrian
Catholics and those who want the church to become more progressive.
Atho
	   ``We demand an end to discrimination against women in the Roman
Catholic Church,'' one sign said.
	   The signs were carried by members of ``We are the Church,'' a
group of laymen who collected a half-million signatures urging
reforms in the church.
	   While invited to take a prominent place among the guests of
honor, the group's leader, Thomas Plankensteiner, stayed among the
crowd.
	   As on the previous two days, the pontiff did not address the
conflict in the Austrian church.
	   To the applause of young people, he gave ``a special salute to
the youth,'' saying ``I am glad that you are present in such great
numbers.''
	   However, attendance was only about half of the 100,000 expected
by organizers.
	   Unlike the pope, Austrian Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn, the
archbishop of Vienna, addressed the tense situation in his church.
	   Schoenborn spoke of ``the conflicts in our church, which in some
(people) have shaken the trust in the pope and the bishops.''
	   ``Not few feel that they are not being understood by the
shepherd and neglected in their concerns,'' he said. ``All this
calls for a turnabout, forgiveness, conciliation and renewal.''
	   On Saturday, the pope held an open-air Mass west of Vienna at
St. Poelten, seat of Austria's most controversial bishop,
conservative Kurt Krenn.
	   Krenn is at the center of a storm rocking the Austrian church.
Many Austrian Catholics object to the pope's conservative policies
on naming bishops, priestly celibacy and refusing to ordain women.
	   Krenn has also insisted on supporting Cardinal Hans Hermann
Groer, accused of sexually molesting trainee priests. Groer,
another conservative, was replaced as archbishop of Vienna after
the first allegations surfaced in 1995.
	   This spring, Groer was sent into exile at a monastery in Germany
after the Vatican launched an inquiry into new allegations of
sexual abuse.

Taiwanese favor lifting ban on direct links with China 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ More than 69 percent of Taiwanese
responding to a recent survey supported lifting the official ban on
direct communications, transportation and business links with
China, the poll-takers said Sunday.
	   Support was highest for direct telecommunications links with
China, followed by direct flights, shipping and financial
transactions, said the private Rising People Foundation.
	   The foundation polled 1,095 persons by telephone June 5-8. The
survey's margin of error was given as plus or minus 3 percent.
	   Taiwan imposed the ban in 1949, when Communist forces in
mainland China forced the Nationalist government into exile on this
island. The current leadership insists the ban is necessary because
China still refuses to recognize Taiwanese sovereignty.
	   Despite the ban, Taiwanese have invested an estimated U.S. dlrs
30 billion in China, mostly via Hong Kong-based intermediaries, and
make almost a million trips there a year. But businessmen traveling
to China must change planes in Hong Kong or another third point,
and mail, phone calls and other forms of communication must be
routed through other countries.
	   China repeatedly urges Taiwan to lift the ban, and last year the
sides inaugurated limited direct shipping. Cargoes can be shipped
to and from two Chinese ports and Taiwan's Kaohsiung harbor, but
must be shipped on to other destinations. Cargoes are not allowed
to originate in Taiwan or pass through customs here.
	   Another scheme allows ships to sail between the sides with only
a brief stop in at some third point.

Government may require local companies to use Malaysian ports 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ To increase the use of Malaysian
ports, the government may set quotas for local companies, a news
report said Sunday.
	   Minister of Transport Ling Liong Sik said the cost of using
facilities at local ports had declined by 30 percent due to the
depreciation of the ringgit.
	   Many local companies use Singapore port to export as well as
import their products. They complain of congestion in Malaysian
ports and delays in loading their goods on and off ships.
	   Malaysia says its ports are just as good as Singapore's.
	   Setting quotas was among proposals to be submitted by several
committees set up to study optimum use of Malaysian ports by local
companies, the national news agency Bernama quoted Ling as saying
in Malacca, 140 kilometers (90 miles) south of Kuala Lumpur.
	   The committees are expected to send their proposals to the
Transport Ministry within two weeks, he said.
	   He said port authorities had been directed to step up efforts to
woo more foreign shipping lines to use Malaysian ports.

Albanian local elections pose a test for coalition government 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Local elections Sunday in Albania are
expected to show if the Socialist-led coalition government still
has popular support after a year of rule.
	   About 20 political parties, grouped in three major coalitions,
were taking part in the elections in nine districts and seven
municipalities.
	   The ruling Socialists and their allies formed the Alliance for
the State, while opposition parties, including the Democratic Party
of former President Sali Berisha, were grouped in the Unity for
Democracy.
	   Right-wing parties were joined in the United Right.
	   The hot spot of the elections was expected to be the southern
town of Vlora _ the cradle of the insurgency that spread last year
after pyramid schemes collapsed, causing many Albanians to lose
their life savings.
	   Vlora residents remain angry with Berisha and his party, who
they blame for the lost money and the hundreds of deaths during the
insurgency. But residents also are unhappy with the ruling
Socialists, accusing them of incompetence and corruption.
	   Twenty of about 40 foreign observers were stationed in Vlora, in
addition to over 100 Albanian monitors distributed throughout the
voting centers.
	   Official results were expected to be made public in a week.

Czech socialists win elections, fear tough coalition talks ahead victory

Eds: UPDATES with final results confirming Social Democrats'
By ONDREJ HEJMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The opposition Social Democrats
won the country's early parliamentary elections, final results
Sunday confirmed, but their toughest task still awaits in coalition
talks.
	   Parties planned private discussions Sunday on possible
alliances, before the first negotiations are held with President
Vaclav Havel.
	   The president has invited the leaders of the Social Democrats,
the Civic Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Party and the
Freedom Union to Prague Castle on Monday.
	   All four parties, along with the Communists, cleared the 5
percent hurdle necessary for representation in the 200-seat lower
house of parliament.
	   Final results announced Sunday showed the Social Democrats, led
by Milos Zeman, winning 32.3 percent _ a clear victory, but far
short of a parliamentary majority.
	   The center-right Civic Democratic Party of ex-premier Vaclav
Klaus was second with 27.7 percent, according to the Central
Election Committee.
	   About 74 percent of the country's 8.09 million eligible voters
cast ballots in the elections Friday and Saturday, which were held
two years ahead of schedule after Klaus' coalition fell apart in
November 1997.
	   Zeman is expected to be the first to attempt formation of the
next government.
	   ``It will be a very difficult process,'' Zeman said in a
discussion aired on Czech television Saturday night.
	   In a bitter campaign before the election, Zeman ruled out
cooperation with Klaus' party, the Freedom Union, as well as the
Communists. That leaves the Christian Democrats as his only
coalition partner.
	   But such a two-party coalition would still fall short of a
majority needed to end political instability, a carry-over from the
1996 election.
	   Josef Lux, leader of the Christian Democrats said Saturday he
could imagine a three-party coalition led by Social Democrats, with
his party and the Freedom Union.
	   The proposal was immediately rejected by Jan Ruml, leader of the
Freedom Union, arguing his party's program was incompatible with
that of the Social Democrats.
	   Other Social Democrat leaders wasted no time in voicing their
skepticism about the d(me/dc)

Cabinet voting on plan to extend Jerusalem authority to settlements 
</HEADLINE>
AP photos planned
By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Over American protests, Israel's Cabinet was
expected to approve a plan Sunday that would extend Jerusalem
municipal authority over eight Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
	   The United States called the plan ``provocative,'' and Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright urged Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
in a telephone call to have the Cabinet reconsider.
	   The plan outraged Palestinians, who said Israel was unilaterally
annexing the settlements, the status of which is supposed to be
determined in negotiations on a final peace agreement. The
Palestinians hope to establish an independent state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   ``This plan is de facto annexation of all these Jewish
settlements to Israel,'' Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Ziad told
The Associated Press. ``It's another annexation of Palestinian
territories to the jurisdiction of Israel.''
	   The Palestinian Authority has filed a formal complaint with the
U.N. Security Council.
	   The plan, which was being debated Sunday afternoon by the
Cabinet, also would extend Jerusalem's boundaries westward into
Israel proper, annexing several suburbs in order to expand the
city's economic base.
	   But the part of the plan that came under fire would set up an
``umbrella authority'' over West Bank settlements surrounding
Jerusalem to the north, south and east _ putting them under the
city's authority for certain services, most notably building and
planning. Settlements normally have to get approval for any
construction from the defense ministry.
	   The United States has called for a ``time-out'' on any expansion
of Jewish settlements in an effort to help re-start the stalled
peace talks.
	   Netanyahu, speaking Sunday on Israel Radio, called the American
objections to the plan, which he said was intended to streamline
and improve municipal services such as garbage collection,
``absurd.''
	   ``We are not talking about changing the status of any
settlement,'' he said, accusing the Palestinians of ``political
manipulation ... to create a crisis over nothing.''
	   David Bar-Illan, a top adviser to Netanyahu, insisted that the
plan would not change the status of the settlements in question.
	   ``If anything at all will happen in this area, there will be an
improvement of services which will originate in Jerusalem,'' he
said. ``But that has absolutely nothing to do with the status of
these areas.''
	   Hundreds of Israelis demonstrated at the entrance to the city on
Sunday morning, protesting the proposed annexation of their suburbs
because they said it would raise their taxes.

World Cup: Italy's shy Vieri overshadowing Del Piero, Baggio 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Christian Vieri doesn't like attention.
	   Yet with three goals in two World Cup matches, Italy's shy
striker with explosive power in his feet is overshadowing star
teammates Alessandro Del Piero and Roberto Baggio.
	   ``The less you write about me the better,'' Vieri said. ``If I
can stay in the shade, I can hope to score more goals. Keep talking
of Alessandro and Roberto.''
	   The 24-year-old forward, who scored once in the 2-2 draw with
Chile and twice in the 3-0 victory over Cameroon, shares the World
Cup scoring lead with Chile's Marcelo Salas and Thierry Henry of
France.
	   ``I took advantage of the opportunities I had in the two
previous matches,'' Vieri said. ``It's my job to kick the ball in.
But the important point is to give it my all on the field.''
	   Considered by some critics as too rough in technique, Vieri can
score with both feet, is clever in aerial play and can either
explode powerful drives or knock soft shots past goalkeepers. He
moves quickly on the attacking front and can press rival defenders
when needed.
	   ``He's powerful, fearless and determined. He can become the
Gunnar Nordahl of the '90s.'' said coach Cesare Maldini, who has
been directing Vieri since his debut in the Italian Under-21 team.
Nordahl, a Swede, was a powerful, high-scoring center-forward for
AC Milan in the 1950s.
	   Vieri, who plays for Atletico Madrid, was the top Spanish league
scorer with 24 goals last season. He has five goals in 11 matches
with the national team.
	   ``I have three goals (at the World Cup), but Ronaldo still is
the strongest of all strikers. And Brazil is the team to beat
here,'' Vieri said.
	   Son of an Italian player-turned-coach and a French mother, Vieri
refined his soccer skills in Australia where he lived for 11 years.
	   With that international background, he transferred with no
hesitation to Spain last year when Atletico Madrid made a 34
billion lire (dlrs 19 million) bid to sign him from Juventus of
Turin, where had had teamed with Del Piero.
	   U.S. basketball star Michael Jordan and actor Sylvester Stallone
are Vieri's heroes outside the soccer fields.
	   ``Jordan is the sports figure I admire most,'' said Vieri.
	   Asked if he was dreaming of celebrating his 25th birthday in
Paris _ the day of the World Cup final on July 12 _ Vieri said that
he does not like to dream.
	   ``I'm realistic,'' he said. ``We had a bad start with Chile, but
we are growing form and confidence. Italy is in the running. We can
hope.''

India willing to discuss Kashmir with Pakistan anytime, minister says 
</HEADLINE>
By HEMA SHUKLA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's hard-line Interior Minister, in
charge of formulating policy on Kashmir, said his government is
willing to discuss the disputed territory with neighboring Pakistan
any time.
	   ``We have never shied away from talking about Kashmir. Never. We
are willing to talk about Kashmir,'' said Lal Krishna Advani in an
interview with the private Home TV channel to be broadcast Monday
night. Excerpts of the interview were made available to the press
Sunday.
	   Just last month, Advani warned Pakistan not to interfere in
Indian-held Kashmir, saying that India's newly demonstrated nuclear
capability had introduced a new element in the simmering regional
conflict. This sparked a war of words with Pakistan in which Advani
was accused of brandishing a nuclear sword.
	   India and Pakistan have fought three wars in the last 50 years,
two of them over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir that is now
divided between them. Both countries lay claim to the whole area.
	   India has repeatedly accused Pakistan of arming and training
Muslim militants in Kashmir who want independence or union with
Islamic Pakistan. Pakistan says it provides only moral support to
the militants in Kashmir, the only Muslim-majority state in
predominantly Hindu India.
	   Advani described India's five nuclear tests _ three on May 11
and two on May 13 _ as one of the biggest achievements of his
three-month old Bharatiya Janata Party-led ruling coalition.
Pakistan responded with its own tests a few weeks later.
	   ``For a long time ... ever since China's first nuclear tests, I
have been longing to see India become a nuclear power,'' he said.
	   Advani, who only recently stepped down as president of the Hindu
right-wing BJP, said the talks on Kashmir also should include
alleged Pakistan-sponsored terrorism in Kashmir.
	   Last month's nuclear tests by India and Pakistan heightened
tensions in one of the world's most volatile regions. The tests
also brought the Kashmir dispute into international focus with the
world community pressing for its early resolution.
	   Advani said India did not mind international pressure to discuss
the Kashmir issue because New Delhi was '' willing to do it
anyway.''
	   But he reiterated India's stand that it will not accept any
outside mediation to help resolve the dispute. Pakistan wants
outside involvement on the Kashmir issue, believing it is at a
disadvantage in talks with its much larger and more powerful
neighbor.
	   Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee is scheduled to meet
his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif during a regional summit in
the Sri Lankan capital Colombo next month, but officials refused to
say whether the two would have any bilateral talks.

Israeli man dies after taking Viagra pill 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A 75-year old Israeli man died after taking the
popular impotence pill Viagra, hospital officials said Sunday.
	   The Tel Hashomer Hospital in central Israel confirmed that the
man, whose name was not made public, died there over the weekend.
The man lost consciousness soon after having sex with his wife, and
a few hours after taking the pill, a hospital spokeswoman
confirmed.
	   The Israeli newspaper Maariv said the man, who had suffered a
heart attack in the past, got the pill from a friend and took it
over his wife's objections.
	   It was the first documented Viagra-related death in Israel. In
the United States, 16 men have died after taking the drug since it
was put on the market earlier this year.
	   Viagra became a drug industry phenomenon by working about as
well as previous anti-impotence drugs without the discomfort of
penile injections or suppositories.
	   Besides potential vision and headache problems, the side effects
include an incompatibility with some heart drugs, which may have
been a factor in the deaths.

Japan balking at early trade liberalization proposal 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Japan, already under attack for not
retooling its economy and bolstering the yen, is now under intense
pressure from Asia-Pacific trade officials to stand by a commitment
to throw open its markets.
	   Some dlrs 1.5 trillion worth of goods and services are at stake
as talks among 18 countries in the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum begin Monday.
	   In negotiations leading up to the two-day talks on Borneo
Island, senior-level officials said Japan was holding up a plan to
immediately liberalize trade in nine key industries. APEC's aim is
free trade among member countries by 2020.
	   Negotiators are striving to eliminate tariffs and other trade
barriers in the areas of environmental products and services,
energy, fisheries, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical
products and telecommunications.
	   The liberalization process is slated to begin in 1999, based on
an ``early voluntary sectoral liberalization'' agreement reached at
last year's APEC summit in Vancouver and expected to be ready for
final signatures by the APEC gathering of world leaders in Kuala
Lumpur in November.
	   Japan, which has just fallen into full-blown recession, said it
is committed to accelerating trade liberalization, including tariff
reductions. But it wants flexibility in setting its own free-market
schedule and feels the United States is forcing its hand.
	   The United States, Japan notes, ultimately intends to make the
list of rapid liberalization sectors binding, with specific time
targets to cut tariffs, with an eye on the next round of talks at
the World Trade Organization in 2000.
	   ``The U.S. is trying to take advantage of this APEC exercise to
increase the momentum in the WTO process,'' said a senior Japanese
official who asked not to be named.
	   The official said the United States was losing sight of the
original philosophy of APEC: voluntary consultation.
	   ``We're trying to maintain the APEC spirit,'' the official said.
``We will engage in the more binding trade negotiations in the
WTO.''
	   For Japan, the official said, six of the nine sectors _ fish,
forestry, toys, jewelry, energy and environment _ are seen as
``sensitive'' industries. In particular, the forestry and fish
industries are heavily subsidized and seen vulnerable to foreign
competition.
	   ``We may be able to overcome sensitivity in some sectors, but
with fish and forest it's very difficult,'' the official said.
	   Those are precisely the areas that big commodity exporting
countries, such as the United States, Canada and New Zealand, would
like to see opened up.
	   The United States, which helped to stabilize the Japanese
currency last week by buying up dlrs 6 billion in yen, has said a
majority of the most powerful economies were crucial to making EVSL
work.
	   ``The idea of critical mass comes from leaders and ministers
last year,'' said John S. Wolf, U.S. Ambassador for APEC. ``Leaders
also agreed to consider the nine sectors as a package. Clearly, if
that package is to be meaningful, Japan, as the second largest
economy in the world, is going to need to be part of that critical
mass.''
	   A South Korean delegate also said his country ``had
reservations'' about opening its forestry and fishing industries to
the APEC marketplace. Taiwan, said one APEC official, also is
reluctant to open those two markets.
	   Chile and Mexico have opted not to participate in the early
liberalization process, saying they intend to reduce tariffs across
the board instead of for individual industries.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru, scheduled for admission in November,
have sent their ministers as observers.

tons this year as it tries to reduce stockpiles and streamline the
loss-making industry, the China Daily's Business Weekly said
Sunday.
	   China currently holds coal stockpiles of more than 130 million
tons. Its 93 top coal companies reported deficits of dlrs 1.53
billion in the first quarter of this year, the report said.
	   Last year, the industry produced 1.33 billion tons of coal, but
China consumed only 1.29 billion tons, it added.
	   Much of the excess supply is produced by unregistered rural and
township coal mines, some of which the government plans to close,
cutting their total production by 150 million tons in the coming
two or three years, the report quoted a State Coal Industry Bureau
official as saying.
	   Last year, township and village coal mines produced 581 million
tons of coal, or 44 percent of the country's total.
	   In April, the government announced plans to lay off 150,000 coal
workers as part of an industry consolidation program.

Iran's parliament starts impeachment proceedings against interior minister 
</HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's interior minister, accused of
jeopardizing the Islamic nation's stability, appeared in Parliament
Sunday to respond to questions by 31 hard-line deputies demanding
his impeachment.
	   The deputies signed the motion earlier this month asking for the
impeachment of Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri for allowing a
rally last month to protest the influence of the hard-line clergy
in Iran.
	   The impeachment motion was the latest attempt by conservative
members of Iran's ruling clergy to discredit officials loyal to
reformist President Mohammad Khatami, who took power last August.
	   The motion accuses Nouri, a clergyman, of ``creating tension in
the society, making provocative interviews and speeches in
different provinces and appointing inexperienced people to
managerial posts at the ministry.''
	   In Sunday's hearing, Nouri was also criticized for being quoted
on Israeli radio.
	   But Nouri countered by saying he was not responsible where his
comments appeared.
	   ``I've given dozens of press conferences and interviews and some
parliament members go looking for a couple of words here and there
... to use against me. That's not fair,'' he told a packed
parliament hall.
	   Several hard-line deputies claimed drug-smuggling, kidnappings
and violence had increased since Nouri assumed power. They also
accused Nouri of hiring people who were not entirely committed to
the ideals of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution and for firing people
who were not liberals.
	   ``Through uncalculated and unwise moves, Nouri, instead of
promoting democracy, created tension, anarchy and violence in the
society,'' said Parliament member Mohammad Reza Bahonar, one of the
deputies who initiated the proceedings against the interior
minister.
	   The Parliament session was broadcast live on national radio.
	   The motion will be put later to the 270-member body for a vote.
	   Khatami's landslide victory in May 1997 shook the foundations of
Iran's clerical rule and was considered a triumph for civil
liberties in this Islamic republic.
	   Khatami still struggles, however, with hard-line opponents who
accuse him of betraying the 1979 Islamic revolution led by the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   Ali Khamenei, who succeeded Khomeini, remains Iran's powerful
spiritual leader.

Huang wins first career title in Dunlop Ladies Open 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HIKAMI, Japan (AP) _ Taiwan's Huang Yu-chen won her first career
title Sunday, shooting a 1-over-par 73 in the rain that gave her a
four-shot victory in the Dunlop Ladies Open.
	   Huang, who led by two strokes overnight, scored three birdies
against a double bogey and two bogeys, and finished with the only
sub-par total, a 3-under 213.
	   For her first victory since joining the Japan tour in 1995, the
1994 Asian Games golf champion earned 9 million yen (dlrs 65,700)
from a purse of 50 million yen (dlrs 365,000).
	   ``It was rough and tough because of the rain today,'' said
Huang. ``I just tried to play at a real consistent pace.''
	   In 12 tournaments so far this season, the 25-year-old Huang was
the first Taiwanese to win.
	   Akiko Fukushima, the earnings leader last season, shot the day's
best score, a 69, and shared second place at 1-over 217 with Mayumi
Inoue, South Korean Kim Man-soo and Chieko Nishida.

	   TIRANA, Albania (AP) _ Local elections Sunday in Albania are
expected to show if the Socialist-led coalition government still
has popular support after a year of rule.
	   About 20 political parties, grouped in three major coalitions,
were taking part in the elections in nine districts and seven
municipalities.
	   The ruling Socialists and their allies formed the Alliance for
the State, while opposition parties, including the Democratic Party
of former President Sali Berisha, were grouped in the Unity for
Democracy.
	   Right-wing parties were joined in the United Right.
	   The hot spot of the elections was expected to be the southern
town of Vlora _ the cradle of the insurgency that spread last year
after pyramid schemes collapsed, causing many Albanians to lose
their life savings.
	   Vlora residents remain angry with Berisha and his party, who
they blame for the lost money and the hundreds of deaths during the
insurgency. But residents also are unhappy with the ruling
Socialists, accusing them of incompetence and corruption.
	   Twenty of about 40 foreign observers were stationed in Vlora, in
addition to over 100 Albanian monitors distributed throughout the
voting centers.
	   Official results were expected to be made public in a week.

Report: Philippine President-elect fathered seven love children 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President-elect Joseph Estrada, a
confessed womanizer, has fathered seven children with five women
out of wedlock, a Philippine newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The former movie star provides well for the mothers and
children, whom he refuses to describe as illegitimate, the widely
circulated Philippine Daily Inquirer said.
	   Estrada has three children with his wife, Eloisa, a
psychiatrist.
	   ``All told, Estrada has 10 children, eight boys and two girls.
As of last count,'' the newspaper said.
	   Icasiano Gutierrez, a spokesman for Estrada, refused to comment
on the article but said the president-elect has openly admitted to
being a womanizer in the past.
	   Another official close to Estrada confirmed the existence of the
love children but declined to elaborate.
	   Estrada, 61, has acknowledged he once was a drunkard and
womanizer, but said it was part of a carefree lifestyle while he
still was in the movies. He never disclosed how many children or
lovers he had.
	   Estrada gained a devoted following, particularly among the
country's many poor, during several decades as an actor in B
movies, playing tough guys who stood up against injustice.
	   He parlayed his popularity into a successful political career,
first as mayor of a Manila suburb, then as a senator and vice
president.
	   Stung by his womanizing ways, Estrada's wife and three children
left him in the 1980s but later reconciled with him, the newspaper
said.
	   It said one of Estrada's love children was born in the United
States two years ago, ``right bang on the birth date of his
father.'' The mother is the daughter of a police official, it said.
	   The newspaper said the Presidential Security Group, which
protects Philippine presidents and their families, likely will have
to guard the homes of all of Estrada's other families, who mostly
live near his house in an upper-class district in Manila.
	   Estrada is to be inaugurated June 30.

As Iranians party in Lyon, dissidents charge French bar countrymen AP Special Correspondent

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ As Iranians partied on the streets before
Sunday's World Cup game with the United States, dissidents charged
that thousands more who wanted to come were turned away at the
border by French authorities giving in to pressure from Tehran.
	   Iranian resistance leaders said France had also allowed in
Tehran government secret police to scour the crowd for exiles they
consider to be enemies.
	   France ``let in the torturers but kept out the victims,'' said
Farzin Hashemi, spokesman for the Mujahedeen Khalq, a resistance
group operating abroad.
	   He said Moslem Filabi, a national sports hero who competed in
three Olympics on the wrestling team, was refused a visa to watch
Iran play.
	   Independently, Iranians living in Germany said their group of
200 was turned back at the French border with Belgium. At the Place
Bellecour in Lyon, men identified by exiles as government agents
filmed joyful Iranians warming up for the big game.
	   ``Is this the meaning of the claim that football is not
political?'' Mohammad Mohadessin, Mujahedeen Khalq foreign affairs
chairman, asked rhetorically at a crowded news conference. ``It
seems that so long as football serves the interests of the
murderous mullahs in Iran, it can be political.''
	   Mohadessin accused the French government of trying to gain
influence with Iran by allowing Revolutionary Guards to identify
dissidents so they could be arrested as hooligans.
	   ``They are making a mistake to cast their lot with the mullahs,
who are about to fall,'' he said, comparing the situation to French
support for Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, swept out in the early
1980s by the Islamic revolution.
	   In the streets of Lyon, however, politics took second place to
partying.
	   Iranians celebrated in the Place Bellecour, working themselves
up to a happy frenzy for their World Cup match with the United
States, and they were joined by Americans whose curiosity overrode
the friendly rivalry.
	   Police watched carefully for any signs of trouble, but nothing
suggested politics would mar the big game.

Technology flops, replaced by man in air pollution hunt 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Human ``sniffers'' will be employed
where technology has failed to trace the source of toxic fumes
plaguing a school in Thailand's Eastern Seaboard industrial area, a
newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The team will try to determine which factories at the Mab ta
Phud industrial estate, 75 kilometers (45 miles) southeast of
Bangkok, are responsible for polluting the air of the surrounding
community, sickening dozens of students daily at a school there,
the newspaper The Nation reported. The school hopes to move soon.
	   ``As scientific instruments have failed to prove the source of
the pollution, we have chosen to return to the basic natural
instrument by using humans to prove it,'' the deputy governor of
the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand was quoted saying.
	   Sarawoot Chayovan said Friday that a yearlong investigation
failed because there were no standards by which to gauge the
problem and scientific instruments had trouble distinguishing
smells, the newspaper reported.
	   The report did not say how team members would be chosen or
whether they would be given any special training.

	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Voters in the West African country of Togo
went to the polls Sunday for the first round of presidential
elections expected to be dominated by former dictator President
Gnassigbe Eyadema.
	   Electoral officials reported no irregularities after polls
opened at 6:30 a.m. (0630 GMT) but opposition party leaders
complained that officials at a few stations had prevented party
party observers from entering.
	   Under rules governing the elections, polling is to be monitored
by representatives of each of the five opposition candidates vying
to end 31 years of Eyadema's rule in this French-speaking country
wedged between Ghana and Benin.
	   In the capital of Lome, thousands of people waited patiently in
long queues at polling stations. Thousands of military troops and
police stood sentry outside elections offices and silently
patrolled the streets.
	   Few people doubt whether Eyadema will make it past the first
round of voting. If a candidate wins more than 50 percent of the
vote, he automatically becomes president. If not, the two with the
most votes face off in the second round.
	   Most voters refused to speak to journalists, saying they feared
reprisals from soldiers or government officials. An unemployed
31-year-old man declined to give his name said he was voting for
change.
	   ``We need something new in our country. We have suffered much in
the past,'' he said.
	   Eyadema, who ruled for 26 years as a military dictator before
winning the country's first presidential elections five years ago,
is accused of unfairly dominating the state-run media with a
massive two-month television and radio campaign.
	   Opponents were relegated to occasional air time.
	   While exiled opposition leader Gilchrist Olympio is the
best-known contender of the five, he fears for his life and lives
in neighboring Ghana. He is not expected to win the lion's share of
opposition votes.
	   Leopold Gnininvi, a university professor with wide support among
Togo's intellectual class and Yaovi Agboyibo, a lawyer with support
in the country's south, are considered the two with the best chance
to face Eyadema in a head-to-head second round.
	   Agboyibo said opposition observers were not given proper
accreditation in several villages, including Oti in the country's
north where Eyadema draws much of his support, had been denied
accreditation to polling stations.
	   International observers from the Organization of African Unity
and the Francophonie _ a loose grouping of the world's
French-speaking countries _ were also monitoring voting.
	   A representative for the foreign observers, Isaac Nguema, on
Saturday urged Eyadema to ensure free, transparent voting under
peaceful conditions.

	   LYON, France (AP) _ As Iranians partied on the streets before
Sunday's World Cup game with the United States, dissidents charged
that thousands more who wanted to come were turned away at the
border by French authorities giving in to pressure from Tehran.
	   Iranian resistance leaders said France had also allowed in
Tehran government secret police to scour the crowd for exiles they
consider to be enemies.
	   France ``let in the torturers but kept out the victims,'' said
Farzin Hashemi, spokesman for the Mujahedeen Khalq, a resistance
group operating abroad.
	   He said Moslem Filabi, a national sports hero who competed in
three Olympics on the wrestling team, was refused a visa to watch
Iran play.
	   Independently, Iranians living in Germany said their group of
200 was turned back at the French border with Belgium. At the Place
Bellecour in Lyon, men identified by exiles as government agents
filmed joyful Iranians warming up for the big game.
	   ``Is this the meaning of the claim that football is not
political?'' Mohammad Mohadessin, Mujahedeen Khalq foreign affairs
chairman, asked rhetorically at a crowded news conference. ``It
seems that so long as football serves the interests of the
murderous mullahs in Iran, it can be political.''
	   Mohadessin accused the French government of trying to gain
influence with Iran by allowing Revolutionary Guards to identify
dissidents so they could be arrested as hooligans.
	   ``They are making a mistake to cast their lot with the mullahs,
who are about to fall,'' he said, comparing the situation to French
support for Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, swept out in the early
1980s by the Islamic revolution.
	   In the streets of Lyon, however, politics took second place to
partying.
	   Iranians celebrated in the Place Bellecour, working themselves
up to a happy frenzy for their World Cup match with the United
States, and they were joined by Americans whose curiosity overrode
the friendly rivalry.
	   Police watched carefully for any signs of trouble, but nothing
suggested politics would mar the big game.

Iraq blames foreigners for the killing of senior Iranian cleric 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq has blamed the killing of a senior
Iranian cleric in southern Iraq on foreign elements, newspapers
reported Sunday.
	   Iran, meanwhile, summoned Iraq's charge d'affaires in Tehran to
protest Thursday's assassination of Ayatollah Mirza Ali Gharavi and
warned it could have negative impact on relations between the two
countries.
	   ``This vicious crime, behind which a malicious foreign party
stands, is aimed to harm the faithful seeking virtue and truth,''
Iraqi newspapers quoted a statement by the Iraqi Ministry of
Religious Affairs as saying. It did not elaborate.
	   Describing Gharavi as a ``noble clergyman,'' the Iraqi statement
said authorities will do their best to apprehend those responsible
for the killing.
	   Gharavi, 70, his son-in-law and chauffeur were fatally shot by
gunmen as they were driving from the Muslim Shiite holy city of
Karbala to Najaf, 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of the
capital, Baghdad.
	   No one claimed responsibility for the assassination, the second
such killing in two months.
	   The Iranian Foreign Ministry summoned Iraq's Charge d'affaires
Salah Samarmad and condemned the killings, Tehran radio said.
	   Ministry official Ali-Asghar Haji said such incidents ``will
have an adverse effect on relations between the two countries.''
	   ``The Iraqi government is responsible for safeguarding the
security and lives of ayatollahs and (Iranian) nationals in Iraq,''
the radio quoted Haji as saying.
	   Gharavi's office in London and the Iraqi opposition group, the
Damascus-based Islamic Dawa Party, blamed the Baghdad government
for the killing.
	   Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called on the
Iraqi government to take action for Gharavi's killing and that of
another Najaf-based Iranian cleric, Ayatollah Murtadha Ali Mohammed
Ibrahim Borujerdi, on April 21.
	   ``I ask the Iraqi government seriously to understand its duty
regarding this great disaster and to fulfill its Islamic,
humanitarian and international duties regarding these two
incidents, and to alleviate the concerns of the Iranian nation,''
Khamenei said in a statement read out on Iranian radio Saturday
night.
	   He said that ``enemies of Islam'' were targeting the Shiite
seminary in Najaf in a ``malicious conspiracy.''
	   Gharavi and Borujerdi worked as prayer leaders at Najaf's Imam
Ali Mosque. Hundreds of Iranian clerics study and teach in Najaf
and Karbala, holy Shiite cities.

Mujahedeen: Iran-France prevent refugees from attending 
</HEADLINE>
By ANWAR FARUQI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) - An exile Iranian opposition group on Sunday
accused French authorities of working hand-in-hand with the Iranian
government to prevent Iranian refugees from attending the big World
Cup match between Iran and the United States.
	   Mohammad Mohadessin, head of the foreign relations committee of
the Mujahedeen Khalq, said that the French government had turned
down a visa request for one of its members on political grounds.
	   He said that Eskandar Filabi, a popular wrestling champion who
left Iran after its 1979 Islamic revolution, had applied for a visa
in the United States.
	   ``This is part of the political dealing with the mullahs in
Iran,'' Mohadessin told reporters in Lyon, where media attention is
focused on a big game later Sunday between the United States and
Iran.
	   ``Isn't this an act of politically staining sports?'' said
Mohadessin.
	   FIFA has said it has received calls and written statements from
Iranian opposition groups threatening to disrupt the Iran-US match.
The Mujahedeen have said they do not intend to do so.
	   Mohadessin said that, at the request of the Iranian government,
French authorities also had denied entry to thousands of Iranian
refugees. He said many were waiting at French borders to get in.
	   ``Is this the claim that `football is not political,' '' said
Mohadessin.
	   ``It seems, that so long as football serves the interest of the
murderous mullahs in Iran, it can be political,'' said Mohaddesin.
	   French and Iranian authorities were not immediately available
for comment.
	   The Mujahedeen, the largest Iranian opposition group with
headquarters in Iraq, is committed to the overthrow of Iran's
religious government.
	   The Mujahedeen have claimed that French authorities are working
with Iranian intelligence agents to arrest opponents of the Tehran
government at the games.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Over American protests, Israel's Cabinet
approved a plan Sunday that would extend Jerusalem municipal
authority over eight Jewish settlements in the West Bank. The
United States had called the plan ``provocative'' and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu in a telephone call to have the Cabinet reconsider. The
plan outraged Palestinians, who said Israel was unilaterally
annexing the settlements, the status of which is supposed to be
determined in negotiations on a final peace agreement. The
Palestinians hope to establish an independent state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip.
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Japan, already under attack for not
retooling its economy and bolstering the yen, is now under intense
pressure from Asia-Pacific trade officials to stand by a commitment
to throw open its markets. Some dlrs 1.5 trillion worth of goods
and services are at stake as talks among 18 countries in the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum begin Monday. In
negotiations leading up to the two-day talks on Borneo Island,
senior-level officials said Japan was holding up a plan to
immediately liberalize trade in nine key industries. APEC's aim is
free trade among member countries by 2020. Negotiators are striving
to eliminate tariffs and other trade barriers in the areas of
environmental products and services, energy, fisheries, forestry,
toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical products and
telecommunications.
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The opposition Social Democrats
won the Czech Republic's early parliamentary elections, final
results Sunday confirmed, but their toughest task still awaits in
coalition talks. Parties planned private discussions Sunday on
possible alliances, before the first negotiations are held with
President Vaclav Havel. The president has invited the leaders of
the Social Democrats, the Civic Democratic Party, the Christian
Democratic Party and the Freedom Union to Prague Castle on Monday.
All four parties, along with the Communists, cleared the 5 percent
hurdle necessary for representation in the 200-seat lower house of
parliament.
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's interior minister, accused of
jeopardizing the Islamic nation's stability, appeared in Parliament
Sunday to respond to questions by 31 hard-line deputies demanding
his impeachment. The deputies signed the motion earlier this month
asking for the impeachment of Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri for
allowing a rally last month to protest the influence of the
hard-line clergy in Iran. The impeachment motion was the latest
attempt by conservative members of Iran's ruling clergy to
discredit officials loyal to reformist President Mohammad Khatami,
who took power last August.
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Communist rebels, angered by a plan
to bury the late dictator Ferdinand Marcos in a heroes' cemetery,
said Sunday they would seize his wife, children and cronies to
answer for crimes. A rebel spokesman condemned President-elect
Joseph Estrada for deciding to allow the burial of Marcos' remains
at the Heroes' Cemetery in metropolitan Manila next month. Workers
have began to construct a tomb there for the late president.

German found drowned, Briton missing after raft accident 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ A German man has drowned and his
British companion is missing and presumed dead following a river
rafting accident in northern Sweden, police said Sunday.
	   The German, Marcus Gaertner, 27, was found dead last week in the
Kalix River, police said.
	   His missing companion, cameraman Christopher Reeves, 36, was
filming for the British Broadcasting Corp. their 435-mile (700-km)
rafting adventure from the Norwegian port of Hillesoy, through
Sweden to the Finnish border, the British news agency Press
Association reported.
	   The pair, who were within two days of the end of the eight-week
trip, were last seen June 21 when they had a Sauna and a meal in
Taerendo, 745 miles (1,200 km) north of Stockholm. Later that
evening their raft was spotted floating upside down in the fast
flowing water in the Kalix River. Searchers found Gaertner's body
early Monday.
	   In Luleaa, Sweden, police spokesman Kurt Nilsson said there was
no hope that Reeves had survived.
	   ``Without survival suits there is no chance of to stay alive in
the swift, icy water,'' said Nilsson.
	   Police expect his body to be washed up when the Kalix subsides.
It was swollen by late spring floods when the raft overturned.
	   Reeves, whose camera equipment, personal possessions and
passport have already been found washed ashore, was an experienced
adventurer and completed a 2,300-mile (3,680 km) trip across Alaska
for charity last year.
	   In London, Reeves' family said his wife, Fiona, 28, a floor
manager with BBC television, and his 18-year-old daughter from a
previous relationship, Sarah, were going to Sweden.

Rafter gears up for Wimbledon with grass court tourney win 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ROSMALEN, Netherlands (AP) _ A fluid and agile Patrick Rafter
breezed through the final of Heineken Trophy grass court tennis
tournament Sunday, downing Czech Martin Damm 7-6 (7-2), 6-2.
	   But the Australian, ranked six in the world and seeded No.6 at
Wimbledon, only got his serve and return working at full strength
in the closing games.
	   There were no break points in the first set but unseeded Damm's
service appeared to be weakened and he recieved treatment for an
injury to is upper right arm.
	   The turning point of the match was a line call on the first
point of the tiebreaker, with top-seeded Rafter serving.
	   Rafter chased a lob almost into the boards at the back of the
court and presented Damm with an easy high overhead.
	   But the 85th-ranked Czech missed the shot by a fraction, then
complained bitterly to the umpire that he had seen chalk rise.
	   Rafter then stormed into a 5-0 lead, wrapped up the tiebreaker
7-2, and then forced a 0-40 lead in the first game of the second
set.
	   The Australian converted the third break point and never again
looked in trouble as Damm continued to dispute the tiebreaker line
call and received more treatment on his arm.
	   Rafter broke to love in the seventh game to lead 5-2, then at
30-30 serving for the championship produced two aces to finish Damm
off.
	   It was the fourth tournament win of the 25-year-old Australian's
career, including last year's U.S. Open, and earned him dlrs 66,400
and 170 ATP tour points.

Libyan minister hands Mubarak letter from Gadhafi 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A visiting Libyan minister handed President
Hosni Mubarak Sunday a letter from Libya's leader Moammar Gadhafi
that dealt with mutual relations and recent developments in the
Arab world.
	   Secretary for Unity Jumaa al-Fazzani, who arrived in Cairo
Saturday, said the letter focused on the horizons of
Egyptian-Libyan ties, especially the ``strengthening of relations
between the two brotherly people in all fields,'' and recent
developments concerning the Arab world. He did not elaborate.
	   Al-Fazzani's visit comes two weeks after Gadhafi canceled a
scheduled nine-day visit to Egypt. No explanation was given by
Libya for the cancellation. However, President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt said it was put off because Gadhafi had tonsillitis.
	   Al-Fazzani said Gadhafi will visit Egypt when ``he finds it
suitable.''

Fighting carries on in Kosovo despite calls for peace 
</HEADLINE>
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting flared anew Sunday in
Serbia's restive Kosovo province, with ethnic Albanian militants
apparently trying to expand the territory under their control,
Serbian sources said.
	   Armed Albanians opened fire early Sunday against a Serb village
along Kosovo's main east-west road, connecting the capital Pristina
with the western town of Pec, the pro-Serb Media Center said.
	   No one was reported injured in the attack on Kijevo, home to
about 60 Serb families, some of whom fired back, but the Albanian
militants took control of another stretch of the strategic road.
	   The government-affiliated media center also claimed the
Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army attacked another Serb village in
the area late Saturday, after which two Serbs went missing. Serb
women, children and the elderly evacuated the village of Jelovac,
leaving men armed with hunting rifles to ``defend the village,''
the center said.
	   Late Saturday, Albanian sources claimed that three Serbian
policemen were killed in fighting in the Decani area, further west
in the province, close to the border with Albania.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year between government forces and guerrillas who enjoy
increasing support among ethnic Albanians, a 90 percent majority in
the province of 2.2 million people.
	   World powers have accused Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
of excessive brutality against pro-independence ethnic Albanians.
Despite threatened NATO intervention, Milosevic has refused to
comply with demands to pull out his forces from the province.
	   Two top officials from Russia's foreign ministry were expected
to arrive Sunday in Belgrade for talks with top government
officials and later for talks in Kosovo with the Albanians.
	   The Albanian leaders, while agreeing with the KLA that Kosovo
must become independent, hold little if any sway over the
militants.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel urged ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova on Saturday to use what influence he may have
to get the militants to cease their attacks.

Cabinet approves plan to extend Jerusalem authority to settlements Palestinian speaker

By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Over American protests, Israel's Cabinet
approved a plan Sunday that would extend Jerusalem municipal
authority over eight Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
	   The United States had called the plan ``provocative'' and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had urged Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in a telephone call to have the Cabinet
reconsider.
	   But Netanyahu rejected that criticism Sunday. ``Israel is
working to strengthen Jerusalem,'' he said.
	   The plan outraged Palestinians, who said Israel was unilaterally
annexing West Bank land and changing the status of Jerusalem _
items on the agenda for negotiations on a final peace agreement.
The Palestinians want to establish an independent state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip with east Jerusalem as its capital.
	   ``This plan is de facto annexation of all these Jewish
settlements to Israel,'' Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Ziad told
The Associated Press. ``It's another annexation of Palestinian
territories to the jurisdiction of Israel.''
	   Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Council, said the
Cabinet was ``firing the bullet that will put the peace process out
of its misery.''
	   The Palestinian Authority has filed a formal complaint with the
United Nations Security Council.
	   The plan, which was approved after a five-hour debate Sunday in
the Israeli Cabinet, would also extend Jerusalem's boundaries
westward into Israel proper, annexing several suburbs in order to
expand the city's economic base.
	   But the part of the plan that came under fire would set up an
``umbrella authority'' over West Bank settlements surrounding
Jerusalem to the north, south and east _ putting them under the
city's authority for certain services, most notably building and
planning. Settlements normally have to get approval for any
construction from the defense ministry.
	   The United States has called for a ``time-out'' on any expansion
of Jewish settlements in an effort to help re-start the stalled
peace talks.
	   Netanyahu, speaking Sunday on Israel Radio, called the American
objections to the plan, which he said was intended to streamline
and improve municipal services such as garbage collection,
``absurd.''
	   ``We are not talking about changing the status of any
settlement,'' he said, accusing the Palestinians of ``political
manipulation ... to create a crisis over nothing.''
	   David Bar-Illan, a top adviser to Netanyahu, insisted that the
plan would not change the status of the settlements in question.
	   ``If anything at all will happen in this area, there will be an
improvement of services which will originate in Jerusalem,'' he
said. ``But that has absolutely nothing to do with the status of
these areas.''
	   The settlements around to Jerusalem are widely expected to be
annexed by Israel in any final peace settlement.
	   Hundreds of Israelis demonstrated at the entrance to the city on
Sunday morning, protesting the proposed annexation of their
suburbs, which they said would raise their taxes.

World Cup: FIFA aims to keep politics out of World Cup 
</HEADLINE>
By ANDREAS EVAGORA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ FIFA said Sunday it is determined to keep politics
out of the World Cup after a Croatian diplomat protested that a
translator at a soccer news conference spoke with a Serb accent.
	   The dispute erupted in Nantes on Saturday when a Croat diplomat
interrupted a post-match interview with manager Miroslav Blazevic
to complain that FIFA's translator was speaking with a Serb accent.
	   Officials of the world soccer federation insisted that the
interview continue with the same translator, angering the Croatian
government representative.
	   Despite their differences, Serbs and Croats can easily
understand each other's tongue.
	   FIFA insisted that the Croats were wrong to interfere.
	   ``A FIFA press conference is not the place for a political
intervention of this kind,'' spokesman Keith Cooper said.
``Afterwards there was a discussion with the ambassador and it was
made clear that this was not their patch.''
	   The translator was successfully carrying out her duties, and
Blazevic was happy with her performance, Cooper added.
	   The translator was a Serb woman from Belgrade, now living in
France, who volunteered her services to the tournament. She asked
that her name not be used by news media following the incident.
	   FIFA conceded that politics and soccer are inextricably linked.
	   ``This is a demonstration of how difficult and delicate it can
be when sports and politics collide,'' Cooper said. ``But if you
want soccer to grow it is also going to take on political
overtones, whether you like it or not.''
	   ``We would like to think that national federations are
apolitical but sometimes they come under pressure from political
authorities,'' he added. ``When they do, we have absolute sympathy
for them.''

Amy Frurwirth comes from behind to take lead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AGAWAM, Massachusetts (AP) _ Amy Fruhwirth stormed from behind
with birdies on the last three holes to take a three-stroke lead in
the weather-delayed LPGA Friendly's Classic.
	   Fruhwirth, a six-year pro looking for her first victory on the
LPGA tour, shot a 4-under-par 68 Saturday for an 8-under 208
through 54 holes.
	   Fruhwirth prospered as the 36-hole leaders had bad days. Marilyn
Lovander, who had a one-shot lead after two rounds, struggled to a
74. She fell back to 211 with Heather Daly-Donofrio, who opened the
round only a stroke off the lead but shot a 73. Christy Erb, who
was tied with Daly-Donofrio after Friday's round, had an even worse
day, plummeting seven strokes off the lead after a 77.
	   Brandie Burton's whose 67 was the best round of the day, grabbed
a share of second at 211 along with Kim Saiki (68), Chris Johnson
(70) and Pamela Kometani (70).
	   ``I don't ever watch the leaderboard; that makes me too
nervous,'' said Fruhwirth, a 29-year-old Scottsdale, Ariz.,
resident. ``I just try to play my own game.
	   ``I'm putting pretty great right now; everything is going in,''
she said. ``Putting is really the common denominator. You have to
putt in order to score well.''
	   Fruhwirth had only 25 putts during a Saturday round marred by
two long rain delays.
	   Burton, one of the first to complete the third round, had six
birdies and one bogey.
	   ``The rain delay may have helped me,'' she said. ``I was on the
11th green when they called and after I three-putted, I finished
with four birdies in the last six holes.
	   ``You just have to let Mother Nature do her thing. This season,
everybody out here has had their share of rain delays,'' Burton
added.

Singapore's premier says country may enter recession Singapore 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Sunday quotes by prime minister on recession in
By JONATHAN DRAKE
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Singapore's prime minister has conceded for the
first time that the country may enter a recession this year,
joining the ranks of other troubled Southeast Asian economies
suffering shrinkage.
	   ``If we are unlucky, if we are unable to stimulate demand in
Singapore, we can't carry the load of the regional recession.
Singapore too may go into recession,'' Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong
said at a community gathering Sunday.
	   Falling short of openly predicting contraction, Goh would only
say that ``slower growth'' was expected.
	   ``Some analysts forecast that Singapore would get into recession
this year. I think it's too early to predict,'' Goh had said in a
speech Saturday.
	   His comments over the weekend were the latest signal from the
government that previous rosy forecasts will have to be abandoned.
	   For months, the government had staunchly stood by its forecast
of growth between 2.5 and 4.5 percent this year. That prediction
was made in February, however, before a clear picture of the
severity of Asia's economic crisis had emerged.
	   Recent statements by authorities indicated that the government
was cautiously backing away from the February forecast.
	   On June 1, Finance Minister Richard Hu told Parliament the
government stood by its earlier predictions, but would introduce
off-budget measures to stimulate the economy if it began to stray
into recession.
	   A week later, the Prime Minister's Office revealed that the
forecast would be revised soon, once data for the second quarter
were available.
	   Meanwhile, five private investment houses have predicted
outright recession at some point in 1998, while most others have
forecast lower growth than has the government.
	   Singapore remains highly vulnerable to external economic
developments. It is a regional center for financial services, which
have been hit hard during the crisis, and relies heavily on its
electronics sector, which has slowed amid a world slump in computer
components.
	   Trade figures released Saturday showed the economy continuing
its downward drift. The country's non-oil domestic exports, a key
measure of overall economic performance, fell 4.8 percent in May
from a year earlier.
	   The government has repeatedly warned Singaporeans that wages
will grow more slowly or even freeze as layoffs and unemployment
rise. It has predicted a record number of layoffs this year,
exceeding the 20,000 during a recession in the mid-1980s.
	   In his Saturday comments, Goh was equally pessimistic about the
regional economic situation: ``Japan is the world's second largest
economy, and it is now in recession. If the Japanese yen weakens
further, that is going to have an effect on the U.S. economy, on
Europe, on the region, on China.''
	   He said further weakness in the Japanese yen could trigger a
second wave of damaging currency devaluations beyond those
experienced in the region last year.
	   If that happens, he added, ``the likelihood of Asia melting down
is quite real.''

Iraq blames foreigners for the killing of senior Iranian cleric 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iran has warned of an ``adverse effect'' on
its relations with Iraq after the killing of a senior Iranian
cleric in southern Iraq _ an assassination Iraq blamed on a
``foreign party.''
	   Iran summoned Iraq's charge d'affaires in Tehran on Saturday
night to protest last week's assassination of Ayatollah Mirza Ali
Gharavi and warned it could have negative impact on relations
between the two countries, Iranian radio reported.
	   Ministry official Ali-Asghar Haji said such incidents ``will
have an adverse effect on relations between the two countries,''
the radio reported Sunday.
	   Gharavi's office in London and the Iraqi opposition group, the
Damascus-based Islamic Dawa Party, blamed the Baghdad government
for the killing.
	   Iraqi newspapers on Sunday quoted a statement by the Iraqi
Ministry of Religious Affairs as saying ``This vicious crime,
behind which a malicious foreign party stands, is aimed to harm the
faithful seeking virtue and truth.'' It did not further identify
the foreign party.
	   Describing Gharavi as a ``noble clergyman,'' the Iraqi statement
said authorities will do their best to apprehend those responsible
for the killing.
	   Gharavi, 70, his son-in-law and chauffeur were fatally shot by
gunmen on Thursday as they were driving from the Muslim Shiite holy
city of Karbala to Najaf, 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of
the capital, Baghdad. No one claimed responsibility.
	   Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called on the
Iraqi government to take action on Thursday's killing, as well as
the killing of another Najaf-based Iranian cleric, Ayatollah
Murtadha Ali Mohammed Ibrahim Borujerdi, on April 21.
	   ``I ask the Iraqi government seriously to understand its duty
regarding this great disaster and to fulfill its Islamic,
humanitarian and international duties regarding these two
incidents, and to alleviate the concerns of the Iranian nation,''
Khamenei said in a statement read out on Iranian radio Saturday
night.
	   He said that ``enemies of Islam'' were targeting the Shiite
seminary in Najaf in a ``malicious conspiracy.''
	   Gharavi and Borujerdi worked as prayer leaders at Najaf's Imam
Ali Mosque. Hundreds of Iranian clerics study and teach in Najaf
and Karbala, holy Shiite cities.

Libyan minister hands Mubarak letter from Gadhafi 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A visiting Libyan minister handed President
Hosni Mubarak Sunday a letter from Libya's leader Moammar Gadhafi
that dealt with mutual relations and recent developments in the
Arab world.
	   Secretary for Unity Jumaa al-Fazzani, who arrived in Cairo
Saturday, said the letter focused on the horizons of
Egyptian-Libyan ties, especially the ``strengthening of relations
between the two brotherly people in all fields.'' He did not
elaborate.
	   Al-Fazzani's visit comes two weeks after Gadhafi canceled a
scheduled nine-day visit to Egypt. Mubarak said it was put off
because Gadhafi had tonsillitis.
	   Al-Fazzani said Gadhafi will visit Egypt when ``he finds it
suitable.''

Israeli man dies after taking Viagra pill 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A 75-year old Israeli man died after taking the
popular impotence pill Viagra, hospital officials said Sunday.
	   The Tel Hashomer Hospital in central Israel confirmed that the
man, whose name was not made public, died there over the weekend.
The man lost consciousness soon after having sex with his wife, and
a few hours after taking the pill, a hospital spokeswoman
confirmed.
	   The Israeli newspaper Maariv said the man, who had suffered a
heart attack in the past, got the pill from a friend and took it
over his wife's objections.
	   It was the first documented Viagra-related death in Israel. In
the United States, 16 men have reportedly died after taking the
drug since it was put on the market earlier this year.
	   Viagra became a drug industry phenomenon by working about as
well as previous anti-impotence drugs without the discomfort of
penile injections or suppositories.
	   Besides potential vision and headache problems, the side effects
include an incompatibility with some heart drugs, which may have
been a factor in the deaths.

Iraq's Aziz off to Madrid to lobby for lifting of sanctions 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Iraq's top diplomat left here Sunday for
Madrid to campaign for the lifting of U.N. sanctions on his
country, Iraqi Embassy officials said.
	   Tariq Aziz, Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister, will explain in his
meetings with Spanish officials that Iraq has fulfilled the
conditions set by the United Nations for lifting the sanctions
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, said the officials,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The United Nations will only lift the sanctions when Iraq
verifies it has eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has sent envoys to Arab, African,
Asian and European countries seeking support to have the sanctions
lifted.
	   Aziz arrived in neighboring Jordan earlier Sunday en route to
Spain. It was not clear if he will visit other countries during his
trip.

Czech socialists win elections, fear tough coalition talks ahead victory 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with final results confirming Social Democrats'
By ONDREJ HEJMA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The opposition Social Democrats
won the Czech Republic's early parliamentary elections, according
to final results Sunday, but their toughest task still awaits in
coalition talks.
	   Parties planned private discussions Sunday on possible
alliances, before the first negotiations are held with President
Vaclav Havel.
	   The president has invited the leaders of the Social Democrats,
the Civic Democratic Party, the Christian Democratic Party and the
Freedom Union to Prague Castle on Monday.
	   All four parties, along with the Communists, cleared the 5
percent hurdle necessary for representation in the 200-seat lower
house of parliament.
	   Final results announced Sunday showed the Social Democrats, led
by Milos Zeman, winning 32.3 percent _ a clear victory, but far
short of a parliamentary majority.
	   The center-right Civic Democratic Party of ex-premier Vaclav
Klaus was second with 27.7 percent, according to the Central
Election Committee.
	   About 74 percent of the country's 8.09 million eligible voters
cast ballots in the elections Friday and Saturday, held two years
ahead of schedule after Klaus' coalition fell apart in November
1997.
	   Zeman is expected to be the first to attempt formation of the
next government.
	   ``It will be a very difficult process,'' Zeman said in a
discussion aired on Czech television Saturday night.
	   In a bitter campaign before the election, Zeman ruled out
cooperation with Klaus' party, the Freedom Union, as well as the
Communists. That leaves the Christian Democrats as his only
coalition partner.
	   But such a two-party coalition would still fall short of a
majority needed to end political instability, a carry-over from the
1996 election.
	   Josef Lux, leader of the Christian Democrats said Saturday he
could imagine a three-party coalition led by Social Democrats, with
his party and the Freedom Union.
	   The proposal was immediately rejected by Jan Ruml, leader of the
Freedom Union, arguing his party's program was incompatible with
that of the Social Democrats.
	   Other Social Democrat leaders wasted no time in voicing their
skepticism about the difficulties in forming a majority government.
	   ``We've suffered a victory,'' said Jaroslav Basta, Zeman's
security adviser.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least six people were killed and more than 100
were injured when a violent summer thunderstorm driven by raging
winds pummeled the Russian capital, officials said Sunday.
	   Svetlana Arkhanova, duty medical officer at the Moscow
Department of Health, said five people died as a direct result of
the storm. The Interfax news agency, quoting city health officials,
said 121 had been hospitalized for injuries, mostly people hit by
falling trees or flying debris.
	   Interfax later reported that a sixth person had died as a result
of the storm.
	   The thunderstorm struck just before midnight and raged for about
30 minutes, with nearly constant lightning flashes, heavy downpours
and howling wind. Thousands of trees were downed, causing power
outages and traffic jams.
	   ``It was worse than a hurricane,'' said Mikhail Gordunov, the
night manager of a kiosk on Kutuzovsky Prospect, a wide boulevard
leading toward the Kremlin. ``I was trying to bring an umbrella in,
and was afraid of being swept away.''
	   Mikhail Orlov, manager of a nearby shop, said the wind shifted
suddenly, sending rooftop ventilators and advertising signs
tumbling to the streets below. ``The wind was blowing in one
direction, then five minutes later, it was blowing in the opposite
direction. It was incredibly strong,'' he said.
	   Raisa Yeliseyeva, duty officer at the Moscow weather center,
said the storm was triggered by a collision of two air masses over
the capital.
	   ``Temperatures in Moscow and east of the capital were very high,
32-35 degrees (90-95 F), while air masses with temperatures of
20-22 (68-72 F) were approaching the city from the west,'' she
said.
	   Winds were recorded at 90 kilometers per hour (60 mph), with
whirlwinds gusting much higher, she said. The streets looked like
they had been hit ``by veritable military hostilities,'' she said.
	   Falling trees crushed parked cars and some of the many kiosks
lining the on the city's streets. Chunks of metal kiosks and wooden
billboards were littered throughout the city. Advertising banners
were ripped to shreds.
	   ``The damage done to the city is huge, and it will take more
than a day or two to clear the Russian capital of debris,'' a
spokesman for Mayor Yuri Luzhkov told the Interfax news agency.
	   The storm seriously damaged the roof of the Bolshoi Theater and
smashed windows at the Moskva Hotel, adjacent to Red Square, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   About 200 trees were uprooted in the Kremlin gardens, and
several turrets atop the Kremlin wall were knocked down by falling
trees. Cafes and outdoor restaurants along Tverskaya Street, the
city's main shopping street, were smashed beyond repair, ITAR-Tass
said.
	   Sporadic power outages were reported throughout the night, and
cable television service was also affected.
	   The city had mobilized fleets of trucks Sunday morning to pick
up the debris and remove fallen trees, which blocked major roads
and side streets and made driving hazardous.

Iraq says Annan shrugging obligations under arms deal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An official Iraq newspaper on Sunday
accused U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan of doing nothing to
fulfill his promise to get eight-year sanctions against Iraq
lifted, and held him legally responsible for the sanctions.
	   The ruling Baath Party newspaper al-Thawra said Annan had
promised to work for the removal of the embargo in a deal he signed
with Iraqi leaders February 23.
	   ``Mr. Annan is legally and morally responsible for the sanctions
file... and under the February deal he is under obligation to bring
this matter to the attention of the Security Council,'' the paper
said in a front-page editorial.
	   U.N. officials have recently indicated that Iraq is closer than
ever to meeting the requirements to lift the sanctions.
	   The February deal gave U.N. arms inspectors _ charged with
overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _
unconditional access to all sites in Iraq, including presidential
compounds.
	   The United States and Britain had threatened air and missile
strikes if Iraq did not allow the monitors into President Saddam
Hussein's palaces.
	   The U.N. sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has done
nothing to fulfill his promise to get the eight-year sanctions
lifted, an Iraqi newspaper said Sunday.
	   The ruling Baath Party newspaper al-Thawra said Annan had
promised to work for the removal of the embargo in a deal he signed
with Iraqi leaders February 23.
	   ``Mr. Annan is legally and morally responsible for the sanctions

unconditional access to all sites in Iraq, including presidential
compounds.
	   The United States and Britain had threatened air and missile
strikes if Iraq did not allow the monitors into President Saddam
Hussein's palaces.
	   The al-Thawra editorial reflects Iraq's frustration over the
continued U.N. sanctions which were imposed following Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait. It was the first time that Iraq claims Annan is
shrugging off promises he made in the deal.
	   On Friday, the U.N. Security Council unanimously agreed to allow
Baghdad to spend dlrs 300 million using its oil-for-food revenues
to boost exports. The oil plan skirts U.N. trade sanctions. It
originally allowed Iraq to export dlrs 2 billion each six months.
The figure was raised to dlrs 5.2 billion early this year.

Seven Italian tourists freed in Yemen 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Yemeni tribesmen on Sunday released seven
Italian tourists they had been holding hostage for three days, a
security source said.
	   The tribesmen had demanded the financing of local projects in
return for their release. It was not immediately clear if their
demands were met.
	   The identities and ages of the tourists were not revealed.
Officials from the Italian Embassy were not available for comment.
	   Five armed tribesmen kidnapped the tourists on Thursday while
the group was traveling through Shabwa, 530 kilometers (329 miles)
southeast of the capital San`a, the security officials said on
customary condition of anonymity.
	   The abductors, from the al-Marazeeq tribe, initially kidnapped
nine Italian tourists in total _ 5 men and 4 women _ but later
freed two of the women who had fallen ill, the officials said.
	   The women received medical attention and were transported to
San`a.
	   The kidnapping was planned by Mohammed Haidarah Mashhour, a
prominent member of the tribe, and the tourists were held in a
mountainous area in Shabwa, the officials said.
	   Yemeni tribes have frequently kidnapped tourists, oil workers
and diplomats to demand money or government financing of projects.
The tourists have all been released unharmed.
	   Yemen, a country on the southwest corner of the Arabian
Peninsula, is one of the Arab world's poorest countries.

Hussain and Stewart delay the South Africans 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ South Africa let England off the hook Sunday as
the visitors pushed for victory in the second cricket test at
Lord's on the fourth day.
	   Nasser Hussain and Alec Stewart were both dropped in the space
of four balls in successive Lance Klusener overs.
	   England, forced to follow on after shot out for 110, was 200 for
three at lunch with Hussain and Stewart unbeaten on 97 and 43
respectively.
	   The home side faces an uphill battle to save the test and needs
another 50 runs to avoid an innings defeat.
	   Resuming the day on 105 for two, England soon lost night
watchman Dean Headley to left-arm wrist spinner Paul Adams (2-51).
	   The home side overcame some unsettling bowling as Hussain and
skipper Stewart buckled down to defy the South Africans of any
further success before the break.
	   Stewart, having survived two confident shouts for lbw, pushed
tentatively at medium paceman Klusener, but Darryl Cullinan at
first slip failed to hang on to a catch to his left.
	   In Klusener's next over, three balls later, Hussain miscued a
hook and Allan Donald running in from long leg grassed a difficult
catch.
	   Hussain, who shared 94 runs with Mike Atherton (44) on the third
evening, has helped Stewart add 94 runs for the fourth wicket in
five minutes under two hours.
	   South Africa took the second new ball as soon as it became
available. But Hussain and Stewart hit eight boundaries between
them in six overs as they took 40 runs off Donald and Shaun
Pollock.
	   Hussain, three short of his seventh test century has hit 17
boundaries off 258 balls in his 328-minute stay at the crease.

Cambodia's guerrilla intellectuals brush off bloody past 
</HEADLINE>

By ROBIN McDOWELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Five important ``intellectual''
defectors from the Khmer Rouge met the press Sunday but had little
to say about the brutal past of the fading guerrilla group.
	   ``Let bygones be bygones,'' Mak Ben, 54, the former Khmer Rouge
finance minister, said when he and others were asked about policies
that led to the deaths of as many as 2 million Cambodians when the
group held power in the late 1970s.
	   ``We want to work for peace and national reconciliation.''
	   Mak Ben, Chan Youran, Thiounn Thieounn, In Sopheap and Kor Bun
Heng are the latest group of guerrilla leaders to come over to the
government side.
	   With their movement in a state of collapse and, since April,
without even a fixed base to operate from, they had few options.
	   Most of the group are professionals _ doctors, lawyers and
engineers, holding degrees from some of the best schools in France.
Several speak English and French.
	   Although few, if any, dirtied their hands fighting, experts say
they could hardly have been unaware of the Khmer Rouge's
activities, and as part of its inner circle should share
culpability for its atrocities.
	   They agreed earlier this month to cut ties with their old
comrades and to give up their fight against the government. They
also signed an agreement recognizing Cambodia's constitution and
the reign King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   In exchange _ to the dismay of human right activists and many of
the guerrillas' victims - the government agreed to forgive and
forget in the name of peace.
	   On Saturday, the five met for two hours with Cambodian leader
Hun Sen, their longtime archenemy, at his home to discuss their
futures and to share a bite to eat. They insisted Sunday that the
past was never discussed.
	   ``We met Hun Sen to express our gratitude because he welcomed us
to return to the national fold,'' said 62-year-old Chan Youran, the
Khmer Rouge's former deputy premier, who graduated from law school
and holds a doctorate.
	   ``We discussed national reconciliation and the necessity to end
the war,'' he said, adding that despite their tumultuous relations
in the past, ``we are all Cambodian.''
	   The five, now living in the former western guerrilla stronghold
of Pailin, have already registered to vote in elections scheduled
for July 26. Pailin is governed by other prominent former Khmer
Rouge guerrillas.
	   As many as 2 million Cambodians died of overwork, starvation,
illness and execution as a result of the Khmer Rouge's
Maoist-inspired policies.
	   The group was toppled in 1979 by a Vietnamese invasion but
continued to wage guerrilla warfare against successive governments.
	   Thousands of defections to the government since 1996 crippled
the group as a fighting force but a handful of veteran leaders
remain in the jungle, along with perhaps several hundred followers.

U.S. official arrives in Jakarta for talks on Indonesian economy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A senior U.S. official arrived in
Jakarta Sunday for talks with Indonesian officials on efforts to
haul the nation's shattered economy out of a yearlong crisis.
	   U.S. Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers was expected to
meet President B.J. Habibie and key economic advisers Monday before
heading back to Washington.
	   Summers flew to Jakarta from Tokyo, where he urged Japanese
officials to take steps to revive their stagnant economy.
	   The United States is an influential player in the International
Monetary Fund, which set up a dlrs 43 billion bailout package to
help the Indonesian economy recover. However, aid was suspended
because of political turmoil last month that led to the resignation
of President Suharto after 32 years in power.
	   Inflation and unemployment are rising fast in Indonesia, raising
fears of more unrest like the riots over price increases that
killed as many as 1,200 in Jakarta last month. Some experts predict
the economy will shrink by as much as 15 percent this year.

North Korea denounces South Korea over Independence Day festival 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ North Korea accused rival South Korea
Sunday of impeding plans to launch a border-area festival to
jointly celebrate their liberation from Japanese colonial rule in
1945.
	   For the historic event to proceed, South Korea must first allow
representatives of its outlawed student group, Hanchongryon, to
participate in the celebration, said Rodong Sinmun, the newspaper
of the North's ruling Workers Party.
	   The student group is outlawed for its support of key North
Korean demands, including the withdrawal of 36,000 U.S. troops from
the South. Last week, Seoul reconfirmed that it will not let the
students meet North Koreans.
	   ``This is an obtrusive act,'' Rodong Sinmun said in a commentary
carried by the North's official Korean Central News Agency.
	   Both Koreas mark their Aug. 15 Independence Day with
celebrations.
	   On Wednesday, North Korea proposed that the two sides celebrate
together at the border village of Panmunjom inside the 4-kilometer
(2.5-mile)-wide demilitarized zone separating the two Koreas.
	   The South Korean government accepted the proposal ``in
principle'' Friday and said it would propose working-level talks
this week to discuss details.
	   But on Sunday, North Korea accused the South Korean government
of ``putting its nose into the non-governmental reunification
festival.''
	   North Korea does not recognize the South, which it calls a U.S.
puppet. When it proposed the festival last week, it sent letters
outlining the plan only to South Korean political, social,
cultural, religious and student leaders, excluding any government
representatives.
	   The two Koreas fought a devastating, three-year war that ended
without a peace treaty in 1953 and mutual distrust remains deep.
Their border is the world's most heavily guarded, with 2 million
men on both sides.
	   South Korea's new government of President Kim Dae-jung is trying
to induce North Korea's reclusive government toward reconciliation
by allowing more civilian exchanges.

	   LENS, France (AP) _ German neo-Nazis clashed with French police
before Sunday's match against Yugoslavia.
	   More than 20 German skinheads were detained in this small north

Government soldiers capture rebel defense post 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   EDITOR'S NOTE _ The Sri Lankan military censor made cuts in the
following story.
	   ___
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Government soldiers captured a Tamil
Tiger rebel defense post near the besieged town of Mankulam after
heavy fighting, the military said Sunday.
	   Soldiers found 13 rebel bodies after the fighting Saturday, the
military said. It did not say how many of its own troops were
killed or wounded.
	   ``Troops backed by armor captured an enemy bunker line south of
Mankulam causing heavy casualties among the terrorists,'' the
statement said, adding that war planes bombed rebel targets north
of Mankulam.
	   Government troops are trying to capture Mankulam, a fortified
rebel town abreast a vital 70 kilometer (43 mile) highway which the
military has been fighting to control since May 1997.
	   The soldiers have so far gained control of about two thirds of
the highway.
	   Control of the highway will allow the government to transport
supplies to the isolated northern Jaffna peninsula by road. The
area, under government control, is presently accessible only by air
and sea.
	   Mankulam is 250 kilometers (156 miles) north of Colombo, the Sri
Lankan capital.
	   Tamil Tiger rebels Sunday said they had handed over four bodies
of Sri Lankan soldiers to the International Committee of the Red
Cross on Friday, a day after they successfully pushed back a
military attack in rebel-controled northern Sri Lanka. The
announcement was made in a statement faxed to news agencies from
its London office.
	   Independent confirmation of reports is not possible since
journalists are barred from the battle zones. The government has
also imposed censorship on military news from Sri Lanka.
	   The rebels are fighting for a separate homeland for minority
Tamils in the country's north and east, claiming that they are
discriminated against by the majority Sinhalese who control the
government and the military.

Germany mourns victims of high-speed train disaster 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CELLE, Germany (AP) _ One hundred candles flickered at the altar
_ one for each victim _ as President Roman Herzog led a memorial
service Saturday for those killed in the high-speed train crash
that was Germany's deadliest postwar rail disaster.
	   About 700 mourners packed the main church in Celle, a northern
town near the village of Eschede where InterCity Express train 884
derailed on June and crashed into the concrete supports of an
overpass.
	   ``More than two weeks have passed since the accident, but the
shock is even deeper and the pain even stronger,'' Herzog told
mourners who included 230 relatives of the dead.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his cabinet ministers attended the
service, as did Gerhard Schroeder, Kohl's challenger in national
elections Sept. 27 and the governor of Lower Saxony state, where
the accident happened.
	   The crash injured dozens of passengers _ 73 crash victims were
still hospitalized Sunday _ and deeply shook a society that has
prided itself on the safety and speed of its high-speed trains.
	   Inaugurated in 1991, the InterCity Express network had been
running at top speeds of 175 mph for seven years without major
technical failures. Now, German rail officials are investigating
how a wheel could have broken and caused the train to derail.
	   All of Germany was devastated by the accident, Herzog said.
Technology makes our lives easier, he said, but accidents like the
one in Eschede remind us that we can never overcome our mortality.
	   Roman Catholic Bishop Josef Homeyer echoed that sentiment in his
address to the mourners, saying: ``We turn around and suddenly, in
the middle of the accelerated tempo of life, were are reminded of
our humanity _ reminded of the vulnerable human being and his
fragile hopes.''
	   Right before the service started at 11 a.m., between 2,000 and
3,000 trains of Deutsche Bahn, the Germany rail company, blew their
whistles. Loudspeakers in trains and stations asked travelers to
observe a minute of silence. Flags nationwide flew at half staff.
	   The memorial service was broadcast on local television. In
Eschede, 20 kilometers (13 miles) north of Celle, about 300
mourners watched the service on screens set up in a tent in the
center of the village.
	   After the memorial, Herzog visited the crash site and thanked
Eschede residents and rescuers who worked round the clock to aid
the injured and recover the dead.
	   ``It is not true that our country has only selfish people,'' the
president said. ``Your town has set an example for all of
Germany.''

Guinea-Bissau loyalists demand ceasefire before talks 
</HEADLINE>
By IAN STEWART
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ As Guinea-Bissau's warring factions waged
gunbattles in the nearly deserted capital on Sunday, the government
ruled out peace talks with renegade forces unless they declare an
immediate ceasefire.
	   Malal Sane, Guinea-Bissau's Minister for the Presidency of the
Council of Ministers, said another pre-condition for talks was that
the rebels explain their motives for staging a takeover attempt,
the Portuguese news agency Lusa reported.
	   There was no immediate reaction to the demands from the rebels,
who under the command of former army chief of staff Ansumane Mane,
launched a coup attempt from a military garrison in Bissau on June
7.
	   The mutiny has sparked two weeks of fierce fighting in this
former Portuguese colony on Africa's western tip and has drawn in
troops from neighboring Senegal and Republic of Guinea coming to
the government's aid.
	   Mane has called for the ouster of President President Joao
Bernardo Vieira, whom the renegades accused of gross corruption.
Mane, a Gambian-born hero of Guinea-Bissau's war of independence
against Portugal, was fired from the army early this year for
allegedly running guns to Senegalese separatists.
	   Senegalese military officials said Sunday fighting continued
around Bissau's international airport, where the breakaway army
faction dug in after retreating from the military garrison last
week.
	   Reports that the rebels controlled all roads into the seaside
city could not be immediately confirmed.
	   The number of casualties from the fighting remains unclear
although more than a hundred rotting corpses littered the streets
of the capital.
	   Most of Bissau's 300,000 people have fled and many were
reportedly without food in tiny villages throughout the country.
	   Attempted talks headed by a Gambian envoy disintegrated last
week as rebels demanded the discussions be led by their hand-picked
mediator, a Senegalese opposition figure.
	   The rebel forces said in a radio broadcast that their positions
in the town of Ingore on Guinea-Bissau's northern border with
Senegal, had been shelled last week by Senegalese artillery.
	   Specially-trained Portuguese soldiers arrived Saturday in Bissau
to protect the country's embassy, Lusa reported.
	   Portuguese ambassador Francisco Henriques da Silva said he had
met with the government, Red Cross and Catholic aid workers to plan
a relief effort for the tens of thousands of refugees left without
food.
	   Although most foreigners left by sea, the ambassadors of France,
Brazil, Cuba and Senegal were still in Bissau, the Portuguese
ambassador said.
	   Food and water shortages have been reported in Bissau and
elsewhere. All telephone communication with the West African
country had been cut by Saturday.
	   The United Nations relief agency World Food Program said
Guinea-Bissau's government ``requisitioned'' two storage complexes
containing 2,700 metric tons (2,970 tons) of U.N. food, much of it
intended for hungry refugees.
	   The U.N. agency was worried the food would be used to feed
fighters although the government told Portuguese media it will be
used to feed the people and not the military.

Japan balking at early trade liberalization proposal 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Japan, already under attack for not
retooling its economy and bolstering the yen, is now under intense
pressure from Asia-Pacific trade officials to stand by a commitment
to throw open its markets.
	   But Japanese officials said Sunday they weren't likely to open
market doors any time soon and indicated the future of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum could hinge on talks that
open Monday.
	   ``I think it's a very critical moment for APEC, whether it will
change or not,'' said a senior Japanese official.
	   Some dlrs 1.5 trillion worth of goods and services are at stake
during the talks among 18 countries attending the two-day APEC
trade ministers forum.
	   In negotiations leading up to the talks on Borneo Island,
senior-level officials said Japan was holding up a plan to
immediately liberalize trade in nine key industries. APEC's aim is
free trade among member countries by 2020.
	   Negotiators are striving to eliminate tariffs and other trade
barriers in the areas of environmental products and services,
energy, fisheries, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical
products and telecommunications.
	   The liberalization process is slated to begin in 1999, based on
an ``early voluntary sectoral liberalization'' agreement reached at
last year's APEC summit in Vancouver and expected to be ready for
final signatures by the APEC gathering of world leaders in Kuala
Lumpur in November.
	   Japan, which has just fallen into full-blown recession, said it
is committed to accelerating trade liberalization, including tariff
reductions. But it wants flexibility in setting its own free-market
schedule and feels the United States is forcing its hand.
	   The United States, Japan notes, ultimately intends to make the
list of rapid liberalization sectors binding, with specific time
targets to cut tariffs, with an eye on the next round of talks at
the World Trade Organization in 2000.
	   ``The U.S. is trying to take advantage of this APEC exercise to
increase the momentum in the WTO process,'' said a senior Japanese
official who asked not to be named.
	   The official said the United States was losing sight of the
original philosophy of APEC: voluntary consultation.
	   ``We're trying to maintain the APEC spirit,'' the official said.
``We will engage in the more binding trade negotiations in the
WTO.''
	   For Japan, the official said, six of the nine sectors _ fish,
forestry, toys, jewelry, energy and environment _ are seen as
``sensitive'' industries. In particular, the forestry and fish
industries are heavily subsidized and seen vulnerable to foreign
competition.
	   ``We may be able to overcome sensitivity in some sectors, but
with fish and forest it's very difficult,'' the official said.
	   Those are precisely the areas that big commodity exporting
countries, such as the United States, Canada and New Zealand, would
like to see opened up.
	   The United States, which helped to stabilize the Japanese
currency last week by buying up dlrs 6 billion in yen, has said a
majority of the most powerful economies were crucial to making EVSL
work.
	   ``The idea of critical mass comes from leaders and ministers
last year,'' said John S. Wolf, U.S. Ambassador for APEC. ``Leaders
also agreed to consider the nine sectors as a package. Clearly, if
that package is to be meaningful, Japan, as the second largest
economy in the world, is going to need to be part of that critical
mass.''
	   A South Korean delegate also said his country ``had
reservations'' about opening its forestry and fishing industries to
the APEC marketplace. Taiwan, said one APEC official, also is
reluctant to open those two markets.
	   Chile and Mexico have opted not to participate in the early
liberalization process, saying they intend to reduce tariffs across
the board instead of for individual industries.
	   With a growing trade surplus and weak yen blamed for further
destabilizing other Asian economies, Japan still said it felt no
pressure to be the driving force behind the APEC accord under
discussion.
	   ``I think we are doing our share,'' the official said.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru, scheduled for admission in November,
have sent their ministers as observers.

Explosion near U.S. Embassy in Lebanon, no casualties 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Bombs exploded near the fortified U.S.
Embassy compound in a suburb north of Beirut Sunday, but there were
no reports of casualties, state-run Beirut radio reported.
	   The explosions occurred in the early afternoon about one
kilometer (.6 miles) from the U.S. Embassy compound in the
Christian suburb of Aukar, the radio said.
	   It said three rocket-propelled grenades attached to a detonator
exploded at 1:20 p.m. (1020GMT) and targeted a contractor's
business near the embassy compound.
	   Police and Lebanese army troops stationed in the area sealed off
the site and an investigation was under way.
	   U.S. diplomats could not be reached for comment and there was no
indication that the embassy was the target.
	   Sunday's blast came three days after a bomb exploded in a car in
a neighborhood east of the capital Beirut, killing the driver and
another person, police officials said. The motive behind Thursday's
bombing in Dora was also not clear.
	   Although bombings were common during the 1975-90 civil war when
militias ruled the streets, they have become rare in Beirut since
the end of the conflict and the government's reassertion of its
authority.
	   The U.S. State Department last year lifted a decade-old ban on
U.S. travel to Lebanon.
	   The U.S. Embassy at Aukar was severely damaged in September 1984
when a Muslim suicide bomber blew up a vehicle in front of the main
building. A total of 14 people were killed.
	   The embassy had relocated to Aukar in 1984 after a suicide
bombing destroyed the original embassy in Beirut, killing 63
people.
	   The embassy resembles a fortress, protected by barbed wire,
metal detectors and swinging gates.
	   It is protected by a detachment of Marine guards and a dozens
local guards who also patrol the vicinity, where Lebanese troops
are also deployed.

Cabinet approves plan to extend Jerusalem authority to settlements Palestinian speaker 
</HEADLINE>

By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Over U.S. protests, Israel's Cabinet approved a
plan Sunday that would extend Jerusalem municipal authority over
eight Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
	   The United States had called the plan ``provocative'' and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had urged Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in a telephone call to have the Cabinet
reconsider.
	   Netanyahu rejected that criticism Sunday, saying ``Israel is
working to strengthen Jerusalem.''
	   The plan outraged Palestinians, who said Israel was unilaterally
annexing West Bank land and changing the status of Jerusalem _
items on the agenda for negotiations on a final peace agreement.
The Palestinians want to establish an independent state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip with east Jerusalem as its capital.
	   ``This plan is de facto annexation of all these Jewish
settlements to Israel,'' Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Ziad told
The Associated Press. ``It's another annexation of Palestinian
territories to the jurisdiction of Israel.''
	   Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Council, said the
Cabinet was ``firing the bullet that will put the peace process out
of its misery.''
	   The Palestinian Authority has filed a formal complaint with the
United Nations Security Council.
	   The plan, approved after a five-hour debate Sunday in the
Israeli Cabinet, would also extend Jerusalem's boundaries westward
into Israel proper, annexing several suburbs in order to expand the
city's economic base.
	   The part of the plan that came under fire would set up an
``umbrella authority'' over West Bank settlements surrounding
Jerusalem to the north, south and east _ putting them under the
city's authority for certain services, most notably building and
planning. Settlements normally have to get approval for any
construction from the defense ministry.
	   The United States has called for a ``time-out'' on any expansion
of Jewish settlements in an effort to help re-start the stalled
peace talks.
	   Netanyahu, speaking Sunday on Israel Radio, called the U.S.
objections to the plan, which he said was intended to streamline
and improve municipal services such as garbage collection,
``absurd.''
	   ``We are not talking about changing the status of any
settlement,'' he said, accusing the Palestinians of ``political
manipulation ... to create a crisis over nothing.''
	   David Bar-Illan, a top adviser to Netanyahu, insisted that the
plan would not change the status of the settlements in question.
	   ``If anything at all will happen in this area, there will be an
improvement of services which will originate in Jerusalem,'' he
said. ``But that has absolutely nothing to do with the status of
these areas.''
	   The settlements around to Jerusalem are widely expected to be
annexed by Israel in any final peace settlement.
	   Hundreds of Israelis demonstrated at the entrance to the city on
Sunday morning, protesting the proposed annexation of their
suburbs, which they said would raise taxes.

Polish railway strike ended, traffic returns to normal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Most Polish passenger trains were running
on schedule Sunday, one day after engineers ended a four-day strike
for higher pay and earlier retirement.
	   The drivers agreed to return to work after the government-run
railway promised not to punish them for their strike. Full train
service was expected by Monday.
	   The strike, which idled half of Poland's passenger trains and
about 90 percent of freight traffic, cost the railroad an estimated
50 million zlotys (dlrs 15 million), the Polish news agency PAP
reported.
	   Jan Zaborowski, head of the train engineers union, vowed to keep
up pressure for a 300-zloty (dlrs-88) monthly pay raise and an
agreement to allow engineers with more than 20 years of service to
retire at age 55. Drivers currently earn about 1,600 zlotys (dlrs
470) a month.
	   During negotiations, which broke off Friday, the government
refused to discuss retirement in deference to a federal parliament
reform plan.
	   Lawmakers are working on a government-proposed pension reform
package that calls for strict, uniform retirement limits _ 65 years
for men and 60 for women _ and to curtail earlier retirement.
	   The leftist Union of Train Engineers represents 14,000 of
Poland's 22,000 drivers. The right-wing Solidarity trade union,
which represents more than 60,000 of all railway workers, did not
join the strike, which it said was politically motivated.

	   PARIS (AP) _ The World Cup marked Fair Play Day to underline
sportsmanship in the globe's most popular game. One gesture: joint
group photographs _instead of one per team_ before Sunday's three
matches, including the United States-Iran.
	   Also photographed together just before kickoffs: Germany and
Yugoslavia in Lens and Argentina and Jamaica in the Parc des
Princes in Paris. The Americans and Irans meet in their politically
charged match in Lyon.
	   ``The impact of this visual image will be quite substantial,
especially for the U.S.A.-Iran game,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper
said.
	   In another Fair Play initiative, all 32 teams were asked to sign
three copies of the Fair Play charter written by Parisian school
children and read at the opening ceremony June 10 at the Stade de
France.
	   FIFA plans to auction one of the copies to raise money for
S.O.S. children's villages, said Rosemary Reed of FIFA.
	   Among the worldwide initiatives on Fair Play Day are shake-hands
ceremonies in local games, youth tournaments, Fair Play flags,
messages, awards and community projects. FIFA said it dispatched
distinctive yellow and blue Fair Play promotional materials
globally to encourage these efforts.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka made a spirited fight-back
to restrict New Zealand to 200 for 9 in 50 overs in their 3-nation
Independence Cup day-night cricket encounter at the Premadasa
Stadium in Colombo on Sunday.
	   New Zealand was comfortably placed at 107 for the loss of just
one wicket at one stage, but failed to capitalize in the face of a
five-man Sri Lankan spin squad which accounted for seven of the
nine wickets to fall.
	   The tourists lost eight wickets for just 93 runs as off-cutter
Kumara Dharmasena and leg-spinner Upul Chandana took three wickets
each.
	   New Zealand earlier in the innings had a solid start when
openers Bryan Young and Nathan Astle shared in a 71-run stand in
14.4 overs.
	   Young batted with authority and stroked the ball with confidence
as he dispatched seven deliveries to the fence while reaching his
half century in only 46 balls.
	   He was caught at deep mid-wicket off Kumara Dharmasena.
	   Except for Stephen Fleming who made 47 in 75 balls before being
run out, the rest of the New Zealand batsmen just caved in without
a fight.

Czech socialists win elections, fear tough coalition talks ahead byline. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with fresh quotes from Zeman, Klaus, Lux. Changes
By NADIA RYBAROVA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The opposition Social Democrats
won the country's early parliamentary elections, final results
Sunday confirmed, but their toughest task still awaits them in
coalition talks.
	   Parties discussed all possible alliances on television programs
_ and most likely later behind closed doors _ on Sunday, the eve of
the first negotiations with President Vaclav Havel.
	   The Social Democrats, the Civic Democratic Party, the Christian
Democratic Party and the Freedom Union are all invited to meet with
Havel at Prague Castle on Monday.
	   All four parties, along with the Communists, cleared the 5
percent hurdle necessary for representation in the 200-seat lower
house of parliament.
	   Final results announced Sunday showed the Social Democrats, led
by Milos Zeman, winning 32.3 percent of the vote _ a clear victory,
but far short of a parliamentary majority.
	   The center-right Civic Democratic Party of ex-premier Vaclav
Klaus earned 27.7 percent of the vote for a strong second-place
showing, according to the Central Election Committee.
	   About 74 percent of the country's 8.09 million eligible voters
cast ballots in the elections Friday and Saturday, which were held
two years ahead of schedule after Klaus' coalition fell apart in
November 1997.
	   Zeman expects to be the first to attempt formation of the next
government, but admits it will be a very difficult process.
	   ``A stable coalition should be a coalition with clear program,''
Zeman said in a discussion aired on private NOVA television Sunday.
	   While he noted that would be no problem in terms of foreign
policy _ as all elected parties except for the communists support
joining NATO and the European Union _ ``in terms of domestic
policy, it would be more complicated.''
	   A ``grand coalition'' of the Social Democrats and the Civic
Democratic party has been ruled out by both Klaus and Zeman.
	   The Social Democrat leader has also said he refuses to join with
the Freedom Union, leaving the Christian Democrats as his only
coalition partner.
	   But such a two-party, minority government risks running into the
same problems of instablity that ultimately led to the early
elections.
	   Should Zeman fail to form a stable government, Klaus may be
asked to attempt the same.
	   Klaus has said he could see a coalition led by his party, with
the Freedom Union and the Christian Democrats _ not differing
greatly from his government which collapsed last winter.
	   But Lux says such an option seems unlikely.
	   ``Voters wanted a change,'' he said. ``Any return to what we
already had is impossible.''

Hookers fight outside hotel 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DUNEDIN, New Zealand (AP) _ England rugby union hooker Richard
Cockerill and New Zealand counterpart Norm Hewitt were seen trading
punches outside a hotel early Sunday, but accounts differ as to
whether the pair were serious.
	   One witness described Hewitt's blows as ``probably the best
five-punch combo I've ever seen,'' but an English team spokesman
dismissed the incident as a play fight.
	   However, team management would probably be speaking to Cockerill
about play fighting in a public place, media liaison officer Martin

World Cup: Italy's shy Vieri overshadowing Del Piero, Baggio 
</HEADLINE>
By PIERO VALSECCHI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SENLIS, France (AP) _ Christian Vieri doesn't like attention.
	   Yet with three goals in two World Cup matches, Italy's shy
striker with explosive power in his feet is overshadowing star
teammates Alessandro Del Piero and Roberto Baggio.
	   ``The less you write about me the better,'' Vieri said. ``If I
can stay in the shadows, I can hope to score more goals. Keep
talking of Alessandro and Roberto.''
	   The 24-year-old forward, who scored once in the 2-2 draw with
Chile and twice in the 3-0 victory over Cameroon, shares the World
Cup scoring lead with Chile's Marcelo Salas and Thierry Henry of
France.
	   ``I took advantage of the opportunities I had in the two
previous matches,'' Vieri said. ``It's my job to kick the ball in.
But the important point is to give it my all on the field.''
	   Vieri belies critics who considered him too unpolished in
technique. He can score with both feet, is clever in aerial play
and can either explode powerful drives or knock soft shots past
goalkeepers. He moves quickly on the attacking front and can press
rival defenders when needed.
	   ``He's powerful, fearless and determined. He can become the
Gunnar Nordahl of the '90s,'' said coach Cesare Maldini, who has
been directing Vieri since his debut in the Italian Under-21 team.
Nordahl, a Swede, was a powerful, high-scoring center-forward for
AC Milan in the 1950s.
	   Vieri, who plays for Atletico Madrid, was the top Spanish league
scorer with 24 goals last season. He has five goals in 11 matches
with the national team.
	   ``I have three goals (at the World Cup), but Ronaldo still is
the strongest of all strikers. And Brazil is the team to beat
here,'' Vieri said.
	   Son of an Italian player-turned-coach and a French mother, Vieri
refined his soccer skills in Australia where he lived for 11 years.
	   With that international background, he transferred with no
hesitation to Spain last year when Atletico Madrid made a
34-billion-lire (dlrs 19 million) bid to sign him from Juventus of
Turin, where had had teamed with Del Piero.
	   U.S. basketball star Michael Jordan and actor Sylvester Stallone
are Vieri's heroes outside the soccer fields.
	   ``Jordan is the sports figure I admire most,'' said Vieri.
	   Asked if he was dreaming of celebrating his 25th birthday in
Paris _ the day of the World Cup final on July 12 _ Vieri said that
he does not like to dream.
	   ``I'm realistic,'' he said. ``We had a bad start with Chile, but
we are growing form and confidence. Italy is in the running. We can
hope.''

German foreign minister urges end to Kosovo-Albanian violence 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel has urged
Kosovo Albanian political leader Ibrahim Rugova to do ``all he
can'' to stop attacks by the separatist militant Kosovo Liberation
Army.
	   Kinkel, in comments Saturday, stressed that while the
international community has condemned Serb oppression in Kosovo
province, it also has urged the KLA to end its violent push for
autonomy.
	   More than 300 people have died in fighting since March when
Serbian police began a crackdown on the militants they call
``terrorists.'' The province is located in the Serb Republic that
makes up most of Yugoslavia. Most Kosovo Albanians, who outnumber
Serbs nine to one, want independence.
	   Rugova also wants secession, but his longtime pacifism has put
him at odds with the KLA. Kinkel praised Rugova for his attempts at
peaceful negotiation with the Serb leadership and invited him to
visit Bonn.
	   ``Please, do use all your influence to convince those who now
rely on the force of arms that what they do is meaningless,''
Kinkel told Rugova, referring to the KLA militants.
	   He said the German government was committed to a solution which
``secures the legitimate interests of the Kosovo Albanians without
calling into question the territorial interests of Yugoslavia.''
	   He warned Rugova that ``only he who is prepared to carry out
dialogue on this basis can receive our support.''

Fighting carries on in Kosovo despite calls for peace 
</HEADLINE>
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Fighting flared anew Sunday in
Serbia's Kosovo province, with ethnic Albanian militants apparently
trying to expand the territory under their control, Serbian sources
said.
	   Armed Albanians opened fire early Sunday on a Serb village along
Kosovo's main east-west road, connecting the capital Pristina with
the western town of Pec, the pro-Serb government-affiliated Media
Center said.
	   No one was reported injured in the attack on Kijevo, home to
about 60 Serb families, some of whom fired back, but the Albanian
militants captured another stretch of the strategic road.
	   The media center also claimed the Kosovo Liberation Army
attacked Jerovac, another Serb village in the area late Saturday,
and two Serbs were subsequently missing.
	   Serb women, children and the elderly had evacuated the village,
leaving men armed with hunting rifles to ``defend the village,''
the center said.
	   Late Saturday, Albanian sources claimed that three Serbian
policemen were killed in fighting in the Decani area, further west
in the province, close to the border with Albania.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year between government forces and guerrillas who enjoy
increasing support among ethnic Albanians, a 90 percent majority in
the province of 2.2 million people.
	   World powers have accused Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
of excessive brutality against pro-independence ethnic Albanians.
Despite threatened NATO intervention, Milosevic has refused to
comply with demands to pull out his forces from the province.
	   Two top officials from Russia's foreign ministry were expected
to arrive Sunday in Belgrade for talks with top government
officials and later for talks in Kosovo with the Albanians.
	   The Albanian leaders, while agreeing with the KLA that Kosovo
must become independent, hold little if any sway over the
militants.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel urged ethnic Albanian
leader Ibrahim Rugova on Saturday to use what influence he may have
to get the militants to cease their attacks.

Italian man with gun pulls plug to kill sick wife

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A man distraught about his comatose wife
pulled a pistol on a doctor Sunday, demanded to be taken to the
woman's bedside and then pulled the respirator plug, surrendering
when he was assured she was dead.
	   After the man was taken into custody, police discovered the gun
was unloaded, the Italian news agency ANSA said.
	   News reports identified the husband as a 49-year-old teacher of
engineering in a school in Brianza, near Milan. They said the wife,
46, also a teacher, went into a coma following brain surgery Friday
at Monza's San Gerardo hospital. She had been suffering from a
tumor.
	   According to a hospital statement, the husband came to the
hospital shortly after dawn, asked about her condition and then
requested to see her. The man then pulled out the gun and forced
the doctor to accompany him, and once inside the woman's room,
demanded to be left alone with her, the hospital said.
	   The man, threatening to kill himself with the gun, then held
police at bay for an hour, until a friend of his who is a doctor
was summoned and assured him the woman had died, news reports said.
	   The couple, married for 25 years, had no children. They were
identified in the news reports only by initials.

Ld-Writethru Reports: South Korea fires head coach 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with news media reporting Cha fired
<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ South Korea fired head coach Cha
Bum-keun on Sunday after its World Cup soccer team's humiliating
5-0 loss to the Netherlands, news media reported.
	   The national MBC-TV said top officials of the Korean Football
Association called a special meeting in Paris and fired Cha,
``reflecting mounting criticism'' back home over the national
team's dismal performance and its early exit from the finals.
	   Cha, 45, will be replaced by coach Kim Pyong-sok, the report
said. Other South Korean news media carried similar reports,
quoting South Korean soccer officials in Paris.
	   It was the first time South Korea had fired its head coach
during an international tournament.
	   Television stations reported that a record number of viewers
stayed up well past midnight, only to see their team routed by the
Netherlands in a World Cup Group E match. On Sunday, many Koreans
called for Cha's ouster.
	   ``It was an expected defeat. Coach Cha killed the fighting
spirit of the players by declaring in advance that South Korea
would fight for a draw with the Netherlands,'' said Shin Moon-sun,
a soccer commentator.
	   The defeat followed a 3-1 loss to Mexico a week earlier. South
Korea cannot advance to the second round regardless of the result
of its last first-round match, on Thursday against Belgium.
	   Most soccer commentators blamed coach Cha for mismanaging the
team. Only days before the finals, its key players suffered
injuries, they noted.
	   ``I strongly advise Mr. Cha to pack up right now and return home
immediately before causing more humiliation to the country,''
soccer fan Yoo Byung-hee said in a computer bulletin board posting,
summarizing widespread popular sentiment.
	   South Koreans were particularly upset by the lopsided defeat
because traditional rival Japan was able to limit Croatia to a
single goal in its 1-0 loss Saturday.
	   South Korea and Japan are co-hosts for the 2002 World Cup
finals.
	   ``It was a crushing, humiliating defeat. South Korea was
defeated in physical strength, strategy, spirit, and even game
manners,'' the Yonhap national news agency said.
	   This is South Korea's fifth appearance in the World Cup finals,
but the national team has never won a match or advanced to the
second round.
	   With their economy mired in a severe financial crisis that has
forced tens of thousands of people out of work, South Koreans had
hoped their soccer team would provide a sorely needed boost to the
country's national pride.

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO warplanes fly into action on short
notice to intimidate Yugoslavia and protect allied interests in
Albania and Macedonia. Imagine reading that in a newspaper just a
few years ago.
	   NATO rushing to the aid of Albania? Who could even find
Macedonia on a map? And wasn't Yugoslavia one of those ``friendly''
communist countries?
	   ``If NATO is to survive, NATO has to stay relevant, and to be
relevant means to be relevant to the conflict that pops up on the
news channels every day,'' said Staele Ulriksen of the Norwegian
Foreign Policy Institute.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a speech in Berlin last
month that the new NATO has to do its old job as well as the new
one.
	   ``Yesterday's NATO guarded our borders against direct military
invasion,'' he said. ``Tomorrow's NATO must continue to defend
enlarged borders and defend against threats to our security from
beyond them _ the spread of weapons of mass destruction, ethnic
violence and regional conflict.''
	   In Bosnia, NATO warplanes helped end the fighting three years
ago, and NATO troops now work with old friends and former foes to
keep the peace. The Nordic-Polish brigade in Bosnia is made up of
soldiers from Poland, Sweden, Finland, Norway and Denmark _ an old
NATO enemy, two neutrals and two members of NATO.
	   ``A few years ago, anybody who said Russia could become a member
of NATO was crazy,'' said Foreign Minister Halldor Asgrimsson of
Iceland, the only NATO member without an army. ``But we shouldn't
exclude that. It might happen sometime in the future.''
	   NATO's role used to be pretty straightforward: Defend against
any onslaught of Warsaw Pact tanks across the plains of central
Europe. That was based on NATO's Article 5, which says an attack on
one member is an attack against all.
	   The debate today is over what the limits of the new NATO should
be, geographical and political.
	   ``We touch upon so many things, but it is after all just one
thing, it's the security, stability and prosperity of the
Euro-Atlantic area,'' said NATO's secretary-general, Javier Solana.
``Historically, it had one manifestation, which was Russia. Now it
has many manifestations.''
	   He gave two examples of possible limits: Bosnia in the Balkans
and Chechnya in the Caucasus region of southern Russia. ``Bosnia is
our business, and we solved it. Chechnya is not our business, and
we have not solved it,'' Solana said.
	   The debate inside NATO is how far to go. In a sense, it's the
old French-American rivalry again.
	   The United States is leading the fight for a more flexible, more
outreaching NATO, emphasizing new threats from rogue states to the
danger of the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
	   France remains a partisan of a more classic concept.
	   ``It is already difficult to maintain the cohesion of NATO with
its classic mission,'' said Hubert Vedrine, the French foreign
minister. ``If we want to enlarge all at once its membership, its
area of action, its decision mechanism, we'll end up with something
that loses its sense.''
	   France is not alone in fearing NATO could be transformed into a
mere tool of American foreign policy. But Alexander Vershbow, the
U.S. ambassador to NATO, says the alliance is equipped to deal with
a full spectrum of threats and shouldn't be afraid to do so.
	   ``I don't think NATO is overextended,'' he said. ``It has taken
this Cold War institution and built on it ... preserving the
foundation for collective defense and building on that.''
	   Less clear is just what NATO membership means today.
	   The 27 members of the Partnership for Peace, a loose association
with NATO, can if they desire get virtually everything NATO has to
offer except the Article 5 benefit of automatic defense against
outside attack. A majority of the countries, from as far away as
Uzbekistan, already have offices at NATO headquarters and are
consulted by NATO on matters of concern to them.
	   ``I like to think that nobody is out, everybody is in to some
extent,'' Vershbow said.
	   One of the risks of this proliferation of associated
organizations, such as the 45-nation Euro-Atlantic Partnership
Council, is that much of the important business may no longer be
done at NATO. It may get too complicated.
	   ``NATO will be slowed up by the bureaucracy,'' said Philip
Gordon, senior fellow at the International Institute for Strategic
Studies in London. ``You'll get deals among Germany, France and the
United States.''
	   Many experts feel a new NATO already is emerging, even if it has
not quite jelled.
	   ``Is NATO changing its nature?'' asked Ulriksen. ``I think it
already has.''

	   LYON, France (AP) _ As Iranians partied on the streets before
Sunday's World Cup game with the United States, dissidents charged
that thousands more who wanted to come were turned away at the
border by French authorities giving in to pressure from Tehran.
	   French authorities confirmed that groups of Iranians who were
considered a threat to national security were turned away at the
border between France and Belgium earlier Sunday.
	   An interior ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press that they were linked to the
the Mujahedeen. He said they did not meet standard requirements for
entry into the country.
	   The official did not say how many Iranians were turned away, but
said many did not have tickets for the match. He said they had come
from Germany and the Netherlands.

Low-key service marks second anniversary of Papandreou's death 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Hundreds of people gathered in Athens'
main cemetery Sunday for a memorial service marking the second
anniversary of the death of Andreas Papandreou, the dynamic former
Socialist premier who dominated Greek politics for more than a
decade.
	   The religious grave-side service marked the beginning of a round
of tributes and memorials to the founder of the Socialist party,
whose legacy still causes major divisions within the government.
	   Premier Costas Simitis, who has been accused by party dissenters
of betraying Papandreou's populist policies, praised the late
leader and deposited a white rose on his grave.
	   Leading politicians and family members crammed into the small
cemetery chapel. Hundreds of people, including labor union leaders,
gathered outside the chapel chanting, ``Andreas, you live, get up
and see what they're doing!''
	   Papandreou died of a heart attack in 1996 at age 77 after a
prolonged illness. He was active in the fight against a right-wing
military junta from 1967 to 1974. He formed the Socialist party in
1974 and led it with an iron grip until his death.
	   Elected Greece's first socialist premier in 1981, Papandreou's
first eight-year administration changed the face of Greece with
social welfare policies that liberally distributed funds among the
Greek lower classes.
	   He brought the Socialists back to power in 1993, but stepped
down as premier in January 1996 because of ill health.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan and Libya agreed to intensify
efforts to further economic integration, increase trade between the
two countries, and carry out joint investment projects, officials
said Sunday.
	   The new agreement, which was concluded between the two Arab
states in the Libyan capital of Tripoli on Friday, aims to promote
joint cooperation in the industrial, agricultural, health and
pharmaceutical fields. It also aims at promoting cooperation in
education, vocational training and information affairs, raising the
volume of trade exchange to dlrs 100 million annually, state-run
Jordanian radio said.
	   Health Minister Ashraf Kurdi said Jordan and Libya agreed to
upgrade medical cooperation by increasing the volume of exports to
dlrs 30 million this year, against dlrs six million last year.

	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) - The United Arab Emirates'
Thuraya Satellite Telecommunications Co. is seeking to borrow dlrs
500 million from banks to finance a regional mobile satellite
system, the daily Gulf News reported Sunday.
	   It cited Yousuf al-Sayed, Thuraya's chief executive, as saying
the company already has approached local banks to get the loan.
	   The lead arrangers are thought to be the National Bank of Abu
Dhabi, Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and Emirates Bank International.
	   Al-Sayed said the response from banks for the debt finance
proposals has been enthusiastic and ``we're hopeful that the
modalities such as appointing underwriters and fixing debt
servicing schedules will all be worked out, and finance will start
flowing in by October.''
	   Thuraya is a new company promoted by regional investors and
telecommunications companies, including Emirates' Itisalat. The
company's capital currently stands at dlrs 500 million.
	   The company is planning to launch a geosynchronous satellite in
May 2000 in an ambitious project worth dlrs 1 billion.
	   The project's contract has been awarded to U.S. Hughes Space and
Communication International as the main contractor and Ascom Corp.
of Switzerland as a technology partner.
	   The company is also planning to launch a second satellite at a
later stage to make available 13,750 satellite channels that will
serve 1.8 million users.
	   Thuraya's satellites will cover most of Asia, Africa and part of
Europe with services including voice, fax and data offered via
hand-held, vehicle-based and fixed terminals.
	   The company is currently holding talks with national service
providers and customers as part of efforts to market and service
the products, in a sweep that will cover 70 countries, the Khaleej
Times newspaper said.
	   the Gulf News quoted al-Sayed as saying the company is expected
to finalize a deal in the near future with the local provider for
the local market, Itisalat, and by August will work out
arrangements with seven other providers in the region.

	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A joint Jordanian-Iraqi company will soon
start drilling for oil and gas near the countries' borders, and in
particular the Jordanian side.
	   Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources Mohammed Hourani told
the mass circulation al-Ra'i newspaper that drilling operations
will start after talks between both countries take place next
month.
	   Ministry officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   Hourani said that a Jordanian delegation, including officials
and experts from the Ministry of Energy, Jordan's refinery and the
National Petroleum Co. will leave for Baghdad early next month to
set a date for the start of drilling operations.
	   Discussions will also include the construction of a 1.7 foot
pipeline from oil wells near Baghdad to Jordan's oil refinery in
Zerqa, 28 kilometers (18 miles) northeast of Amman.
	   Jordan imports from Iraq 4.5 million tons of crude oil annually,
worth dlrs 500 million.

	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi Arabia has approved a
resolution by the Gulf Cooperation Council that allows banks from
the council's six states to open branches anywhere in the GCC, the
official Saudi Press Agency reported Sunday.
	   The GCC is an economic and defense alliance which includes Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar and Bahrain.
	   Until now, markets in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar were
restricted to locally incorporated banks, while the other GCC
states allowed foreign banks.
	   Oman and the Emirates accepted the resolution earlier this
month. The decision to allow local banks to open inter-GCC branches
was approved at the GCC's last summit in Kuwait in December.
 &UR; ___
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ The Kuwait Development Fund on Sunday
gave Syria dlrs 26.3 million loan to finance a water project in
northern Syria.
	   The loan will cover about 39 percent of the total cost of the
project estimated at dlrs 68 million. The project is expected to be
completed by 2001, the official Syrian Arab News Agency said.
	   According to the agreement signed between Syrian and the Fund's
officials, the loan carries a 3 percent rate of interest and will
be repaid in 24 years, including a five-year grace period.
	   Syria has received 23 loans from the Fund totaling dlrs 962.45
million since 1992.

Czech socialists win elections, fear tough coalition talks ahead byline. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with fresh quotes from Zeman, Klaus, Lux. Changes
By NADIA RYBAROVA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The opposition Social Democrats
won the country's early parliamentary elections, according to final
results Sunday, but their toughest task still awaits them in
coalition talks.
	   Parties discussed possible alliances on television programs on
Sunday, the eve of the first negotiations with President Vaclav
Havel.
	   The Social Democrats, the Civic Democratic Party, the Christian
Democratic Party and the Freedom Union are all invited to meet with
Havel at Prague Castle on Monday.
	   All four parties, along with the Communists, cleared the 5
percent hurdle necessary for representation in the 200-seat lower
house of parliament.
	   Final results announced Sunday showed the Social Democrats, led
by Milos Zeman, winning 32.3 percent of the vote _ a clear victory,
but far short of a parliamentary majority.
	   The center-right Civic Democratic Party of ex-premier Vaclav
Klaus earned 27.7 percent of the vote for a strong second-place
showing, according to the Central Election Committee.
	   About 74 percent of the country's 8.09 million eligible voters
cast ballots in the elections Friday and Saturday, held two years
ahead of schedule after Klaus' coalition fell apart in November
1997.
	   Zeman expects to be the first to attempt formation of the next
government, but admits it will be a very difficult process.
	   ``A stable coalition should be a coalition with clear program,''
Zeman said in a discussion aired on private NOVA television Sunday.
	   While he noted that would be no problem in terms of foreign
policy _ as all elected parties except for the communists support
joining NATO and the European Union _ ``in terms of domestic
policy, it would be more complicated.''
	   A ``grand coalition'' of the Social Democrats and the Civic
Democratic party has been ruled out by both Klaus and Zeman.
	   The Social Democrat leader has also said he refuses to join with
the Freedom Union, leaving the Christian Democrats as his only
coalition partner.
	   But such a two-party, minority government risks running into the
same problems of instablity that ultimately led to the early
elections.
	   Should Zeman fail to form a stable government, Klaus may be
asked to attempt the same.
	   Klaus has said he could see a coalition led by his party, with
the Freedom Union and the Christian Democrats _ not differing
greatly from his government which collapsed last winter.
	   But Christian Democrats leader Josef Lux says such an option
seems unlikely.
	   ``Voters wanted a change,'' he said. ``Any return to what we
already had is impossible.''

Romanian president heads home to assess flood damage 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ President Emil Constantinescu cut
short a visit to Austria on Sunday and was headed home to visit
regions badly damaged by flooding after a week of torrential rains.
	   Constantinescu, who was in Salzburg for an upcoming economic
summit of top officials from Central and Eastern Europe, will visit
the stricken regions by helicopter early Monday, the official news
agency Rompres reported.
	   Thousands of people evacuated their flooded homes last week, and
at least one person died when his temporary shelter collapsed. The
Red Cross has appealed for urgent supplies of food and money.
	   Crops throughout a wide area were ruined, and roads, railway
lines and bridges were blocked or made impassable from the
flooding.
	   No damage estimate was immediately available.
	   The flooding was worst in Transylvania, in Romania's northwest
and Moldova, in the poor and isolated northeast. The rain stopped
Saturday after eight days.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile, also preparing to visit flood
victims, told national radio: ``I am with those who have suffered
in the floods.''
	   He was due to leave Bucharest to inspect parts of Transylvania.
He was to be joined by the head of the army and two government
ministers.

World Cup: Denilson has chance for first Cup start 
</HEADLINE>
By PETER MUELLO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   OZOIR-LA-FERRIERE, France (AP) _ Crowds shout his name from the
grandstands. Fans turn out just to see him practice. Sportswriters
compare him to the great Garrincha.
	   Now, Denilson at last may get a chance to start in the World
Cup.
	   He still isn't certain. Brazilian coach Mario Zagallo refused to
confirm the lineup change for the game with Norway on Tuesday,
saying he wanted to ``confuse the head of our adversary's coach.''
	   But this week, Denilson trained on the starting team for the
first time after weeks practicing with the scrubs.
	   ``That's a good sign, isn't it?'' he said, flashing an enormous
grin.
	   His chance came when midfielder Cesar Sampaio got his second
yellow card in Brazil's last game against Morocco and drew an
automatic one-game suspension.
	   The logical substitute was Emerson, Sampaio's backup. But with
Brazil already qualified in first place in Group A, Zagallo had a
chance to experiment with a bolder, more offensive formation. And
there was one name on his list.
	   ``Denilson alters the way we play,'' Zagallo said. ``He is an
important component because he can change our movement by his very
characteristics.''
	   Movement is what Denilson does best. His tight, sinuous dribbles
and wizardly ball control a match even for Ronaldo. Brazilians
compare him to Garrincha, a star of Brazil's World Cup champions in
1958 and 1962.
	   One of his biggest admirers is Zagallo. A world champion with
Pele and Garrincha, Zagallo has said that Denilson would have
started in his place had he played back then.
	   It's been a meteoric rise for the 20-year-old midfielder. As a
boy, he honed his skills playing against older kids on an empty lot
in Sao Bernardo do Campo, a gritty industrial suburb of Sao Paulo.
	   A scout saw him darting and weaving through the field and urged
Denilson to try out for Sao Paulo, where he caught the eye of
veteran coach Tele Santana. In 1994, barely 16, he was on a luxury
second-string squad dubbed ``the little express'' that won the
Conmebol Cup.
	   In 1996, Zagallo named him to the national team. A year later,
summoned for the Tournoi de France and the Copa America, he played
brilliantly and won a starting berth.
	   More glory followed. He helped his club to the Sao Paulo state
championship and signed a transfer reportedly worth near dlrs30
million to Spain's Betis.
	   But just when he seemed a sure starter at the World Cup,
Denilson was back on the bench. Zagallo chose to start FC Barcelona
teammates Rivaldo and Giovanni in the midfield, using Denilson as a
12th man.
	   Still, he made the most of his playing time. His entrance in the
second half against Scotland changed the pace of the game, and
Brazil got the winning goal in a 2-1 victory. Against Morocco, fans
chanted his name from the stands, although he played only a few
minutes.
	   His boyish enthusiasm and good humor make him popular on the
team. And his skill is recognized by all.
	   ``Brazil has some great attackers, and Denilson is one,'' said
Ronaldo.
	   ``This is good for us,'' added Bebeto. ``On the attack, the more
the better.''
	   Some question whether Denilson can adapt to Zagallo's game plan,
which requires him to play defense and restricts his freedom,
unlike on Sao Paulo. But Denilson isn't worried.
	   ``I will correspond'' to expectations, he said. ``I want to make
those dribbles that drive the 'gringos' crazy.''
	   And even in his first World Cup, Denilson hasn't lost sight of
priorities. He spoke of his pride at buying a house for his family
back in Sao Bernardo.
	   ``We were very poor. We faced necessity,'' he said. ``Now,
that's in the past. Soccer has given me that.''

World Cup: Germans detained after clashes with Lens police at police 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: UPDATES with five German fans detained for throwing beer cans
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ At least 25 German soccer fans were detained
Sunday after clashes with French riot police before their country's
match against Yugoslavia, news reports said.
	   In the most serious incident, more than 20 German skinheads were
detained in this small north French town and outside the stadium.
	   Police used sticks to battle the Germans, who reportedly
included known groups of neo-Nazis who had arrived by train.
	   Riot police brought in reinforcements and sealed off the
downtown area.
	   Shortly after, five other fans were detained for throwing beer
cans at riot police near the stadium. They were being held at the
town's police headquarters, radio reports said.
	   Many German fans who were victims of a ticket swindle had come
to Lens despite not being able to get into the match.

	   Nouri was accused of jeopardizing the Islamic nation's stability
and appeared in Parliament Sunday to respond to questions by 31
hard-line deputies demanding his impeachment.
	   The deputies signed the motion earlier this month asking for the
impeachment, accusing him among other things of allowing a rally
last month to protest the influence of the hard-line clergy in
Iran.
	   Nouri's impeachment is a victory for conservative members of
Iran's ruling clergy aiming to discredit officials loyal to
reformist President Khatami, who took power last August.
	   The motion accused Nouri, a clergyman, of ``creating tension in
the society, making provocative interviews and speeches in
different provinces and appointing inexperienced people to
managerial posts at the ministry.''
	   Nouri defended all his appointments and said there was a plot to
divide the new generation of leaders and the clergy.
	   ``I do not claim that I have never made a mistake. However, you
should realize there is a plot afoot to separate the young, bright
university generation from the revolution and the clergy,'' he told
a packed parliament hall.

Germans detained after clashes with Lens police 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: Has also moved on sports wires.
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ At least 25 German soccer fans were detained
Sunday after clashes with French riot police before their country's
match against Yugoslavia, news reports said.
	   In the most serious incident, more than 20 German skinheads were
detained in this small north French town and outside the stadium.
	   Police used sticks to battle the Germans, who reportedly
included known groups of neo-Nazis who had arrived by train.
	   Riot police brought in reinforcements and sealed off the
downtown area.
	   Shortly after, five other fans were detained for throwing beer
cans at riot police near the stadium. They were being held at the
town's police headquarters, radio reports said.
	   Many German fans who were victims of a ticket swindle had come
to Lens despite not being able to get into the match.

	   The impeachment will require Nouri to resign, but there was no

for where his comments appeared.
	   ``I've given dozens of press conferences and interviews and some

... to use against me. That's not fair,'' he said.
	   Several hard-line deputies claimed drug-smuggling, kidnappings
and violence had increased since Nouri assumed power. They also
accused Nouri of hiring people who were not entirely committed to
the ideals of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution and for firing people
who were not liberals.
	   ``Through uncalculated and unwise moves, Nouri, instead of
promoting democracy, created tension, anarchy and violence in the
society,'' said Parliament member Mohammad Reza Bahonar, one of the
deputies who initiated the impeachment proceedings.
	   The Parliament session was broadcast live on national radio.
	   Khatami's landslide victory in May 1997 shook the foundations of
Iran's clerical rule and was considered a triumph for civil
liberties in this Islamic republic.
	   Khatami still struggles, however, with hard-line opponents who
accuse him of betraying the 1979 Islamic revolution led by the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   Ali Khamenei, who succeeded Khomeini, remains Iran's powerful
spiritual leader.

World Cup: Defeating Italy _ part skill, part luck, part psychology 
</HEADLINE>
By GEORGE JAHN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MARGAUX, France (AP) _ The winning formula against Italy for
Austria consists of improving the offense, a hard-nosed ``we can
win'' attitude _ and the kind of luck that has kept the underdogs
in contention sofar.
	   Three days before the World Cup soccer match against the favored
Italians, the leaders in Austria's group, some on the Austrian
squad do not lack confidence.
	   Reserve goalkeeper Franz Wohlfahrt, for instance, considers his
underdog team every bit as good as Tuesday's opponent after
watching videos of its performance against Chile and Cameroon,
which share group B with Italy and Austria.
	   Although Austria drew against both Chile and Cameroon while
Italy came away with a draw and and a tie, ``Italy ... played no
better than Austria,'' Wohlfahrt asserted Sunday.
	   ``We have to have a little more self-confidence,'' Wohlfahrt
said. ``We always consider Italy better, and that's nonsense.''
	   But believing that Austria can win Tuesday at St. Dennis,
outside Paris, is not enough.
	   ``The problem is that once we play the ball up about 60 meters
from the back, we start with our failed passes,'' said coach
Herbert Prohaska, alluding to mistakes made against Chile and
Cameroon.
	   ``We'll have to take more chances than before,'' Prohaska said,
suggesting that Austria will have to play more aggressive soccer,
even at the risk of weakening its defense, the squad's strong point
in its previous two World Cup matches. ``We have to be more precise
in our offensive game.''
	   Austria scored two injury-time goals to come up with draws
against Cameroon and Chile. But with a draw against Italy unlikely
to advance the Austrians past the first round, Prohaska said his
squad ``would open everything up in the last 20 minutes and risk
everything'' to avoid another tie.
	   ``Italy will try to set up a solid defense and then play long
balls to the front,'' he said of the opponent's likely strategy.
``That's going to be dangerous.''
	   Maybe the Austrians will be lucky a third time, getting a
another crucial goal in injury time. In any case, says Prohaska,
the pressure is more on the Italians because they are expected to
win.
	   ``It would be a huge disappointment for them if they did not
advance,'' he said.

IMF official gives positive assessment of Ukraine's reform steps 
</HEADLINE>
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine is doing a better job of managing
its economy and might qualify for a resumption of aid from the
International Monetary Fund, the IMF's deputy director was quoted
as saying Sunday.
	   Ukraine is currently negotiating a dlrs 2.5 billion loan from
the IMF and the resumption of a dlrs 542 million stand-by credit.
The IMF suspended the release of a planned credit installment
earlier this year.
	   In 1997, it rejected the larger loan, citing Ukraine's stalled
reforms and the need for structural changes.
	   However, the IMF official, Stanley Fisher, said during Sunday's
meeting with Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko that he was
``pleasantly surprised'' by Ukraine's progress since.
	   Fisher said latest economic developments provided some hope
``that the IMF would be able to make a contribution to Ukraine's
economic reforms,'' according to a statement from the government's
press service carried by the Interfax news agency.
	   The talks with the IMF mission, which arrived in Ukraine several
days ago, were ``tense but very constructive,'' it said.
	   The government has moved to slash budget spending, a key IMF
demand. The decision, however, has yet to be endorsed by the
largely leftist parliament.
	   On Thursday, President Leonid Kuchma also signed a series of
economic decrees meant to overcome his stalemate with parliament,
ease tax rules and boost production to overcome Ukraine's
near-critical financial situation.
	   Economy Minister Vasyl Rogovoi, who took part in the talks,
described the negotiations as ``very successful'' and said Fisher
noted a ``significant progress'' in the fulfillment of IMF
conditions toward approval of the larger loan.
	   ``We would like very much to speed up the release of these
funds, since they could greatly improve the situation on Ukraine's
financial market,'' said Rogovoi.
	   Another IMF mission is expected in Kiev in July, he said.
	   The optimistic tone of Sunday's statements contrasted sharply
with the remarks by Pustovoitenko over the past week, in which he
said Ukraine found it ``very, very complex'' to work with the IMF,
which has its own vision of the nation's economic development.
	   A prominent American economist suggested recently that the IMF
ease some of its 87 conditions for the dlrs 2.5 billion loan.
Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University economist who advises Ukraine,
suggested that the fund make only the 10 most important conditions
mandatory.
	   Fisher was due to meet with Kuchma, National Bank head Viktor
Yushchenko and other officials before leaving for Moscow Monday
night.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Pope John Paul II fired parting shots
Sunday at his quarreling Austrian bishops, but steered clear of
directly addressing a sex scandal and dampened any hopes he would
change his positions on church policy.
	   The country's top churchman, Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn,
acknowledged that the conflicts buffeting the Austrian church
``have caused some people to lose confidence in the pope and the
bishops.''
	   ``All this calls for a change of ways, forgiveness,
reconciliation and renewal,'' Schoenborn said in welcoming the pope
at his final Mass in Austria.
	   A smaller-than-expected crowd of about 50,000 people turned out
in the Heldenplatz, or Heroes' Square, the vast plaza designed by
the Hapsburg emperors where hundreds of thousands poured in to
welcome Adolf Hitler in 1938.
	   John Paul beatified three people, including a nun, Sister
Restituta Kafka, who was arrested by the Gestapo for putting up
crosses in a hospital in a challenge to the Nazis. She was beheaded
in 1943.
	   Beatification is the last step before possible sainthood.
	   The three-day visit, John Paul's third to Austria, was aimed at
calming the waters in this traditional Catholic bastion that has
been rocked by accusations that a cardinal sexually abused young
boys, divisions among bishops and demands for reform signed by a
half-million Austrians.
	   John Paul issued his verdict in a private meeting of Austrian
bishops following Sunday's Mass. The Vatican released the text.
	   ``A bishop by himself does not realize the project of Christ,''
the pope said in a clear reference to Bishop Kurt Krenn, a
conservative who has angered many by his staunch support for
Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer. The cardinal was forced by the Vatican
to relinquish his duties following accusations of pedophilia.
	   The pope also scolded the bishops for going public with their
conflicts, saying that ``like every house that has special rooms
that are not open to all guests,'' the church too needs ``rooms for
talks that require privacy.''
	   In his only possible reference during the trip to the Groer
case, the pope said he knew his bishops had been ``put through
trials of various types'' and that they were ``particularly
present'' in his prayers.
	   The pope made no mention in his speeches in Austria of such
demands by the group We are the Church that the Vatican drop its
celibacy reqirement for priests and allow women into the
priesthood. But he has often indicated he had no intention of
changing policy.
	   The Vatican estimates that 78 percent of the 8 million Austrians
are Catholics, but only 20 percent are regular church-goers and
40,000 drop out of the church each year.

World Cup: Stankovic goal gives Yugoslavia 1-0 halftime lead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Dejan Stankovic struck early to give
Yugoslavia a 1-0 halftime lead over Germany on Sunday.
	   With Germany and Yugoslavia having won their opening games, both
teams knew that victory would mean a near certain place in the next
round.
	   Yugoslavia dominated the early exchanges between the two Group F
favorites, and opened the scoring after 13 minutes.
	   Real Madrid striker Predrag Mijatovic, 30 meters from goal,
drove in a left wing cross, and Stankovic got the faintest of
touches as the ball bounced over German goalkeeper Andreas Kopke.
	   Though Mijatovic looked to have scored directly, Stankovic, the
19-year- old midfielder who recently agreed a move from Red Star
Belgrade to Lazio of Rome, was credited with the goal.
	   Yugoslavia had nearly scored after just five minutes, when
Dragan Stojkovic collected the ball on the edge of the penalty area
and fired a powerful right foot shot just wide of Kopke's right
hand post.
	   Andy Moller posed the biggest threat for Germany, and the
Borussia Dortmund midfielder came closest for Germany in the first
half when he hit a powerful right foot free kick from 25 meters
just over the bar.
	   But Germany's twin strikeforce of Oliver Bierhoff and Jurgen
Klinsmann struggled to get a clear chances against a determined
Yugoslav back four.
	   Yugoslavia continued to dominate and after 26 minutes, Zeljko
Petrovic fired a right foot shot from 20 meterss that Kopke did
well to keep out.
	   Yugoslav captain Dragan Stojkovic, playing his 65th
international, was the game's most influential player.
	   After 33 minutes, he played a a superb pass that beat the German
offside trap.
	   Darko Kovacevic was first to the ball, but his close range shot
was blocked by Kopke.
	   Minutes later Mijatovic fired in a dangerous cross from the
right, and Germany needed a desperate challenge from Jurgen Kohler
to clear the danger in front of an onrushing Stankovic.
	   Germany, which beat Yugoslavia on its way to lifting the world
crown in 1954, 1974 and 1990, struggled against a Yugoslav side
looking to improve on a narrow 1-0 win over Iran in its opening
match.
	   Lineups:
	   Germany _ Andreas Kopke; Christian Worns, Jurgen Kohler, Olaf
Thon; Jorg Heinrich, Andy Moller, Jens Jeremis, Dietmar Hamann,
Christian Zige; Jurgen Klinsmann, Oliver Bierhoff.
	   Yugoslavia _ Ivica kralj; Sinisa Mihajlovic, Slobodan
Komljenovic, Zeljko Petrovic, Goran Djorovic; Slavisa Jokanovic,
Dragan Stojkovic, Dejan Stankovic, Vladimir Jugovic; Darko
Kovacevic, Predrag Mijatovic.
	   Referee _ Kim Milton Nielsen, Denmark.

BayStars beat Carp 7-4 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Robert Rose drove in two runs and Kazuhiro Sasaki
set a record for consecutive saves Sunday, helping the Yokohama
BayStars beat the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 7-4 at Hakodate and keep a
share of the Central League lead.
	   Kazuhiro Sasaki held the Carp hitless in the last inning in
picking up his 19th consecutive save, breaking the league record of
18 set by South Korean Sun Dong-yol of the Chunichi Dragons last
season.
	   Japan's professional baseball record is 21 consecutive saves,
set by Moroyuki Akahori of the Pacific League's Kintetsu Buffaloes
in 1994.
	   Rose, formerly with the California Angels, singled home a run in
the three-run first inning and drove in another with a single in
the fourth.
	   The BayStars extended their winning streak to five and the Carp
suffered their fifth straight defeat.
	   The Dragons also kept a share of the league lead with a 3-1
victory over the Yakult Swallows at Sapporo, where Kazuki Inoue hit
a home run in the first inning and Lee Jong Beom singled home
another run in the second.
	   Inoue has four homers. Lee formerly played for the Hai Tai
Tigers of South Korea's professional baseball league.
	   The Swallows ended their winning streak at four.
	   The BayStars and the Dragons are 1 1/2 games ahead of the
Yomiuri Giants, whose scheduled game with the Hanshin Tigers at
Koshien Stadium was rained out.
	   In the Pacific League, Nigel Wilson hit a grand slam home run in
the six-run third inning and Yukio Tanaka smashed the winning
two-run homer in the bottom of the ninth as the Nippon Ham Fighters
edged the Chiba Lotte Marines 11-10 at Tokyo Dome.
	   Tanaka has 16 homers and leads the league. Wilson, formerly with
the Cleveland Indians, has 11.
	   The Fighters are 1 1/2 games ahead of the Kintetsu Buffaloes,
who beat the Fukuoka Daiei Hawks 6-2 at Fukuoka Dome.
	   The Buffaloes' Takashi Mutoh singled home a run in the two-run
second inning and drove in another run with a sacrifice bunt.
	   At Nagoya Dome, Harvey Pulliam belted a home run in the second
inning and Ichiro Suzuki went 4-for-4 and drove in four runs with
two homers as the Orix BlueWave blanked the Seibu Lions 6-0.
	   Pulliam, formerly with the Colorado Rockies, has nine homers and
Suzuki has five.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Pope John Paul II fired parting shots
Sunday at his quarreling Austrian bishops, but steered clear of
directly addressing a sex scandal and dampened any hopes he would
change his positions on church policy.
	   The country's top churchman, Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn,
acknowledged that the conflicts buffeting the Austrian church
``have caused some people to lose confidence in the pope and the
bishops.
	   ``All this calls for a change of ways, forgiveness,
reconciliation and renewal,'' Schoenborn said in welcoming the pope
at his final Mass in Austria.
	   A smaller-than-expected crowd of about 50,000 people turned out
in the Heldenplatz, or Heroes' Square, the vast plaza designed by
the Hapsburg emperors where hundreds of thousands poured in to
welcome Adolf Hitler in 1938.
	   John Paul beatified three people, including a nun, Sister
Restituta Kafka, who was arrested by the Gestapo for putting up
crosses in a hospital in a challenge to the Nazis. She was beheaded
in 1943.
	   Beatification is the last step before possible sainthood.
	   The three-day visit, John Paul's third to Austria, was aimed at
calming the waters in this traditional Catholic bastion that has
been rocked by accusations that a cardinal sexually abused young
boys, divisions among bishops and demands for reform signed by a
half-million Austrians.
	   John Paul issued his verdict in a private meeting of Austrian
bishops following Sunday's Mass. The Vatican released the text.
	   ``A bishop by himself does not realize the project of Christ,''
the pope said in a clear reference to Bishop Kurt Krenn, a
conservative who has angered many by his staunch support for
Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer. The cardinal was forced by the Vatican
to relinquish his duties following accusations of pedophilia.
	   The pope also scolded the bishops for going public with their
conflicts, saying that ``like every house that has special rooms
that are not open to all guests,'' the church too needs ``rooms for
talks that require privacy.''
	   In his only possible reference during the trip to the Groer
case, the pope said he knew his bishops had been ``put through
trials of various types'' and that they were ``particularly
present'' in his prayers.
	   The pope made no mention in his speeches in Austria of such
demands by the group We are the Church that the Vatican drop its
celibacy reqirement for priests and allow women into the
priesthood. But he has often indicated he had no intention of
changing policy.
	   The Vatican estimates that 78 percent of the 8 million Austrians
are Catholics, but only 20 percent are regular church-goers and
40,000 drop out of the church each year.

Landmine blast kills five in Kashmir 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SRINAGAR, India (AP) _ Suspected Muslim rebels blew up a jeep
using a land-mine in troubled Kashmir province on Sunday, killing
at least five pro-government militants, United News of India news
agency said.
	   The five died on the spot and the other three occupants of the
jeep were seriously wounded in Sumbal, a township 30 kilometers (20
miles) north of Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir
state, UNI quoted police as saying.
	   No group has so far claimed responsibility for the blast.
	   Several pro-government militants have broken ranks with the
separatists in the past three years and have helped Indian
authorities combat militancy in the northern Himalayan territory,
India's only Muslim-majority state.
	   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir. India
controls two-thirds of Kashmir and Pakistan the remaining one-third
since they won independence from the British colonialists in 1947.
	   India accuses Pakistan of arming and training separatist
guerrillas. Pakistan denies the charge and says it only provides
political and diplomatic support.
	   More than 15,000 people have been killed in the eight-year-old
rebellion in the Himalayan region.

<TEXT>
	   NOVI TRAVNIK, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ In life, Zoran Trklja _
the son of a Bosnian Serb and a Bosnian Croat, the husband of a
Muslim _ was a living mosaic of Bosnian diversity, representing the
potential for the country's three ethnic groups to coexist.
	   In death, Trklja laid bare how far his country still needs to go
to achieve real peace, and how far it has already come.
	   During the bloody civil war that swept across Bosnia in 1992,
Novi Travnik, like many other Bosnian towns, was wracked with
conflict as Bosnian Croats and Muslims fought against each other,
as well as against their common enemy, the Serbs.
	   Zoka _ as Trklja was known _ gained local renown for fighting in
the Muslim-led government army.
	   When the fighting ended in late 1995, Zoka tried to build a
better future for his wife and three children in Novi Travnik, a
town divided along ethnic lines. He waited tables in the Kogo
coffee bar, scraping together money to realize his dream: starting
a sales company with his former comrades-in-arms.
	   Last Tuesday, a local Muslim, whose son was charged with
harassing workers at several cafes and demanding after-hours
drinks, walked into Kogo and ordered an espresso.
	   When Zoka, who was to testify against the son, brought the
drink, the man shot the waiter through the heart from point-blank
range.
	   The man then calmly sipped his coffee, vowing that no Serb would
testify against his son, witnesses said. He is awaiting trial for
the killing.
	   Zoka's mother, Ruza, wanted to bury her son close to her home,
at the old city cemetery in the Croat part of town. Local Croat
leaders agreed, but changed their minds after Croat hard-liners,
angry at Zoka's wartime allegiance to the Muslims, threatened to
dig up his body.
	   Zoka's father-in-law, Halid Fusko, then tried to organize a
funeral in a new cemetery in the Muslim part of town.
	   But the Islamic Community, which runs the cemetery, said only
Muslims can be buried there. Instead of a plot in the huge, nearly
empty cemetery, they offered to clear a part of a neighboring
forest for Zoka's grave.
	   ``They wanted to bury him in the woods, like a stray dog,'' said
Fusko, tears of rage and sorrow streaming down his cheeks. ``In
that case, I told them, I'll bury him in the garden in front of my
house.''
	   Word of the dispute spread, shocking Bosnians, regardless of
their ethnic loyalties.
	   On Friday, angry friends and neighbors stormed the new Muslim
cemetery, ordered the grave outside the fence filled in and
themselves dug Zoka a new resting place.
	   ``They said he was a Serb, but he was only a human being,'' said
Almir Sabanovic, 27, a friend from Zoka's military unit. ``I ask
myself how much our authorities represent us and how much they care
for their own people.''
	   More than 1,500 people _ Serbs, Croats and Muslims _ came
together at the funeral, one of the biggest ever in the town of
20,000.
	   Zoran's former military police unit was there in full force,
ready to intervene if authorities tried to stop the burial.
	   The Islamic Community relented and approved the service, after
the fact.
	   ``One may say that this time, ordinary people and Bosnia, the
multiethnic and multicultural country we once knew, have won over
the local leaders and divisions,'' Fusko said. ``But right now,
there is nothing left in me but bitterness and rage, and I've
started thinking about leaving this country for good.''

IMF official gives positive assessment of Ukraine's reform steps 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS spelling of Fischer thruout
By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine is doing a better job of managing
its economy and might qualify for a resumption of aid from the
International Monetary Fund, the IMF's deputy director was quoted
as saying Sunday.
	   Ukraine is currently negotiating a dlrs 2.5 billion loan from
the IMF and the resumption of a dlrs 542 million stand-by credit.
The IMF suspended the release of a planned credit installment
earlier this year.
	   In 1997, it rejected the larger loan, citing Ukraine's stalled
reforms and the need for structural changes.
	   However, the IMF official, Stanley Fischer, said during Sunday's
meeting with Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko that he was
``pleasantly surprised'' by Ukraine's progress since.
	   Fischer said latest economic developments provided some hope
``that the IMF would be able to make a contribution to Ukraine's
economic reforms,'' according to a statement from the government's
press service carried by the Interfax news agency.
	   The talks with the IMF mission, which arrived in Ukraine several
days ago, were ``tense but very constructive,'' it said.
	   The government has moved to slash budget spending, a key IMF
demand. The decision, however, has yet to be endorsed by the
largely leftist parliament.
	   On Thursday, President Leonid Kuchma also signed a series of
economic decrees meant to overcome his stalemate with parliament,
ease tax rules and boost production to overcome Ukraine's
near-critical financial situation.
	   Economy Minister Vasyl Rogovoi, who took part in the talks,
described the negotiations as ``very successful'' and said Fischer
noted a ``significant progress'' in the fulfillment of IMF
conditions toward approval of the larger loan.
	   ``We would like very much to speed up the release of these
funds, since they could greatly improve the situation on Ukraine's
financial market,'' said Rogovoi.
	   Another IMF mission is expected in Kiev in July, he said.
	   The optimistic tone of Sunday's statements contrasted sharply
with the remarks by Pustovoitenko over the past week, in which he
said Ukraine found it ``very, very complex'' to work with the IMF,
which has its own vision of the nation's economic development.
	   A prominent American economist suggested recently that the IMF
ease some of its 87 conditions for the dlrs 2.5 billion loan.
Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard University economist who advises Ukraine,
suggested that the fund make only the 10 most important conditions
mandatory.
	   Fischer was due to meet with Kuchma, National Bank head Viktor
Yushchenko and other officials before leaving for Moscow Monday
night.

Soccer fans angered by power outage turn violent 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _Thousands of soccer fans took to the
streets and attacked cars and buses in two Bangladesh cities after
a power outage disrupted live television coverage of the
Japan-Croatia match in the World Cup, police said Sunday.
	   Riot police used bamboo sticks to disperse the protesters in
Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital, and the sea town of Cox's Bazar on
Saturday night.
	   The power crisis in this South Asian nation has seen angry
soccer fans blocking roads and railroad traffic and forcing shops
and offices to close since the start of the World Cup this month.
	   Bangladeshi authorities have deployed riot police at power
stations across the country to avert violence.
	   On Saturday night, the national grid near the Bangladesh capital
shut down and plunged the entire country into darkness for at least
two hours.

Cabinet approves plan to extend Jerusalem authority to settlements quotes 
</HEADLINE>

By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Over American protests, Israel's Cabinet
unanimously approved a plan Sunday that would extend Jerusalem
municipal authority over eight Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
	   The United States had called the plan ``provocative'' and U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had urged Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu in a telephone call to have the Cabinet
reconsider.
	   But Netanyahu rejected that criticism Sunday, and disputed
Palestinian charges that Israel was violating the
Israel-Palestinian peace accords by expanding Jerusalem's borders
and annexing West Bank land.
	   ``This is an important decision aimed at strengthening
Jerusalem,'' he said in a news conference.
	   ``We are not changing the status of any one of these communities
or of Jerusalem. ... There is no violation of the
Israel-Palestinian accords.''
	   Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of creating an ``artificial
storm'' for political gain, and said they were the ones violating
the peace accords by trying to establish authority in Jerusalem.
	   Palestinian officials, however, said Israel was pre-empting
negotiations on a final peace agreement, which is supposed to
address the status of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, and final
borders. The Palestinians hope to establish an independent state in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel occupied in 1967, with
east Jerusalem as its capital.
	   ``They are dictating the outcome of the permanent status
talks,'' said Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Council.
	   ``This is the most dangerous step taken by the Israeli
government. They are firing the bullet that will put the peace
process out of its misery.''
	   Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Ziad called the plan ``de facto
annexation'' of the settlements to Israel.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority will do what it can to confront this
challenge,'' he said. ``The people must stand up to defend
Jerusalem.''
	   The Palestinian Authority has filed a formal complaint with the
United Nations Security Council.
	   The plan, which was approved after a five-hour debate Sunday in
the Israeli Cabinet, would also extend Jerusalem's boundaries
westward into Israel proper, annexing several suburbs in order to
expand the city's economic base and help ensure its Jewish
majority.
	   Hundreds of Israelis demonstrated against the plan on Sunday
morning, protesting that the annexation of their suburbs would lead
to higher taxes.
	   But the part of the plan that drew fire from the Palestinians
and Americans would set up an ``umbrella authority'' over West Bank
settlements surrounding Jerusalem to the north, south and east _
putting them under the city's authority for certain services,
notably building and planning. Settlements normally have to get
approval for any construction from the defense ministry.
	   The United States has called for a ``time-out'' on any expansion
of Jewish settlements in an effort to help re-start the stalled
peace talks.
	   David Bar-Illan, a top adviser to Netanyahu said the plan was
intended to streamline and improve municipal services such as
garbage collection, and insisted that the plan would not change the
status of the settlements in question.
	   ``If anything at all will happen in this area, there will be an
improvement of services which will originate in Jerusalem,'' he
said. ``But that has absolutely nothing to do with the status of
these areas.''
	   The settlements around to Jerusalem are widely expected to be
annexed by Israel in any final peace settlement.
	   But the Israel-Palestinian interim accords call on the two sides
to refrain from unilateral measures that ``change the status of the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip pending the outcome of the permanent
status negotiations.''
	   Those negotiations are supposed to be completed by next May but
have not yet begun.
	   Israel has charged that the Palestinians are violating that
section of the accords by trying to upgrade their observer status
at the United Nations.

World Cup: Saudi coach, players miss sacked Brazilian coach 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MELUN-SENART, France (AP) - A day after coach Carlos Alberto
Parreira's dismissal, Saudi coach and players said Sunday they were
``not happy'' with the decision and that they hoped Parreira could
return as their trainer in the future.
	   Saudi Arabia, which reached the second round in their world cup
debut in 1994, was eliminated from the 1998 championships after
losing 1-0 to Denmark and 4-0 to France in the first round matches
of the 1998 championship.
	   Parreira was fired by the Saudis Saturday for the team's early
exit.
	   ``I was not very happy when to hear about Parreira's
dismissal,'' said Saudi coach Mohammed al-Kharashi, who took charge
of the world cup squad after Parreira's sacking on Saturday.
	   ``Surely we will miss him. He's not only a great coach but also
a great person,'' said Saudi coach Mohammed al-Karashi, who was a
student of Parreira 12 years ago.
	   Al-Karashi, 45, who declined to speculate on Parreira's
dismissal, said: ``He did his best for the team.''
	   Saudi players, some of whom were seen hugging Parreira before he
left the hotel Saturday to get the ``bad news'' also expressed
sorrow over Parreira's firing and hoped he could return as their
coach in the future.
	   ``He meant a lot to me. He was just like a big brother,'' said
26 year-old Saudi forward Sami al-Jaber.
	   ``He had a big hand in bringing me in the opening lineup and he
paid equal attention to all the players,'' he said. ``For sure we
are going to miss him and i hope he will return as our coach in the
future.''
	   Early Sunday after returning from training without Parreira,
Saudi players bid farewell to Parreira and thanked him for his
guidance.
	   The team later Sunday were headed for Bordeux, south of Paris,
to prepare for their last match against South Africa.
	   ``We are eliminated from the championship so we don't have all
that pressure on us,'' said al-Karashi, who been a Saudi coach for
18 years. ``However, we hope to give our best for this match.''

Japan balking at early trade liberalization proposal

<TEXT>
	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ Japan, already under attack for not
retooling its economy and bolstering the yen, is now under intense
pressure from Asia-Pacific trade officials to stand by a commitment
to throw open its markets.
	   But Japanese officials said Sunday they weren't likely to open
market doors anytime soon and indicated the future of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum could hinge on talks that
open Monday.
	   ``I think it's a very critical moment for APEC, whether it will
change or not,'' said a senior Japanese official.
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky, upon arrival in
Kuching late Sunday, told reporters she had ``every confidence
we'll move forward.''
	   Some dlrs 1.5 trillion worth of goods and services are at stake
during the talks among 18 countries attending the two-day APEC
trade ministers forum.
	   In negotiations leading up to the talks on Borneo Island,
senior-level officials said Japan was holding up a plan to
immediately liberalize trade in nine key industries. APEC's aim is
free trade among member countries by 2020.
	   Negotiators are striving to eliminate tariffs and other trade
barriers in the areas of environmental products and services,
energy, fisheries, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical
products and telecommunications.
	   The liberalization process is slated to begin in 1999, based on
an ``early voluntary sectoral liberalization'' agreement reached at
last year's APEC summit in Vancouver and expected to be ready for
final signatures by the APEC gathering of world leaders in Kuala
Lumpur in November.
	   Japan, which has just fallen into full-blown recession, said it
is committed to accelerating trade liberalization, including tariff
reductions. But it wants flexibility in setting its own free-market
schedule and feels the United States is forcing its hand.
	   The United States, Japan notes, ultimately intends to make the
list of rapid liberalization sectors binding, with specific time
targets to cut tariffs, with an eye on the next round of talks at
the World Trade Organization in 2000.
	   ``The U.S. is trying to take advantage of this APEC exercise to
increase the momentum in the WTO process,'' said a senior Japanese
official who asked not to be named.
	   The official said the United States was losing sight of the
original philosophy of APEC: voluntary consultation.
	   ``We're trying to maintain the APEC spirit,'' the official said.
``We will engage in the more binding trade negotiations in the
WTO.''
	   For Japan, the official said, six of the nine sectors _ fish,
forestry, toys, jewelry, energy and environment _ are seen as
``sensitive'' industries. In particular, the forestry and fish
industries are heavily subsidized and seen vulnerable to foreign
competition.
	   ``We may be able to overcome sensitivity in some sectors, but
with fish and forest it's very difficult,'' the official said.
	   Those are precisely the areas that big commodity exporting
countries, such as the United States, Canada and New Zealand, would
like to see opened up.
	   The United States, which helped to stabilize the Japanese
currency last week by buying up dlrs 6 billion in yen, has said a
majority of the most powerful economies were crucial to making EVSL
work.
	   ``The idea of critical mass comes from leaders and ministers
last year,'' said John S. Wolf, U.S. Ambassador for APEC. ``Leaders
also agreed to consider the nine sectors as a package. Clearly, if
that package is to be meaningful, Japan, as the second largest
economy in the world, is going to need to be part of that critical
mass.''
	   A South Korean delegate also said his country ``had
reservations'' about opening its forestry and fishing industries to
the APEC marketplace. Taiwan, said one APEC official, also is
reluctant to open those two markets.
	   Chile and Mexico have opted not to participate in the early
liberalization process, saying they intend to reduce tariffs across
the board instead of for individual industries.
	   With a growing trade surplus and weak yen blamed for further
destabilizing other Asian economies, Japan still said it felt no
pressure to be the driving force behind the APEC accord under
discussion.
	   ``I think we are doing our share,'' the official said.
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru, scheduled for admission in November,
have sent their ministers as observers.

17 Thai police officers to be charged with murder 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ An internal police investigation has
concluded that Thai officers executed six alleged drug dealers
after they had been taken into custody, Thai newspapers reported
Sunday.
	   The attorney-general will be asked to prosecute 17 officers who
took part in the November 1996 killings, the newspaper The Nation
reported.
	   The commander of the operation in Suphanburi province, 100
kilometers (62 miles) north of Bangkok, widely believed to have
given a shoot-to-kill order, was not among the 17 suspects named by
investigators.
	   Police Gen. Salang Bunnag, deputy-general of the police
department, nonetheless blasted the findings, saying they were
inspired by politics and would demoralize police in their fight
against drugs.
	   He said he would compensate any officers suspended from duty and
pay their children's school fees, the Bangkok Post reported.
	   In full view of reporters, police had led six handcuffed
suspects into a small house, where shots then rang out.
	   The suspects' bodies were carried out wrapped in white cloth.
Bloodstains indicated they had been shot in the head.
	   Police claimed they had taken the men back into the house and
removed the handcuffs so they could point out the location of their
hidden weapons. The suspects reportedly tried to pick up their guns
and police shot and killed them.
	   Salang, well-known for his ultra-conservative views, has
frequently defended the operation.
	   ``The police action this time was action against evildoers,
against people selling amphetamines, people who were destroying the
future of the country,'' Salang said soon after the killings.
	   ``These people were not saints,'' he was quoted as saying.
``They had killed so many people and arrest warrants were issued
for all of them. Today we have closed all their cases.'' It remains
unclear if his allegations were true.
	   Press reports said the six were on their way to kill a rival in
Thailand's flourishing amphetamines trade when police were alerted.
	   The six took refuge in a house and took a family of three
hostage. After an initial exchange of gunfire, the police and
gunmen settled into a 15-hour siege. A police officer known to one
of the gunmen eventually persuaded them to surrender.
	   In its latest review of human rights conditions around the
world, the U.S. State Department said this year that police
brutality in Thailand is a serious problem, and that there were
``credible reports that some officers summarily executed
suspects.''
	   ``The courts rarely convict police officers involved in summary
execution cases, in part because witnesses are often intimidated or
bribed to withhold evidence,'' said the report, which also noted
the police have a reputation for corruption.
	   The Suphanburi case was reopened when a new government led by
the Democrat Party came to power last November. The new interior
minister, Sanan Kachornprasart, took the action on the basis of
complaints by the victim's families.

Family of released dissident Wang Dan given passports 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Family members of dissident Wang Dan, who
recently was released into exile from a Chinese prison, have been
granted passports and plan to visit the United States, family
members said Sunday.
	   Wang's mother, Wang Lingyun, had earlier said she planned to
visit her son once she had permission to go. Now that she and her
husband have acquired passports, they need U.S. visas to visit
their son.
	   Wang, 29, is one of China's best-known political exiles. He
spent four years in prison for his role in the 1989 democracy
protests at Tiananmen Square. Jailed again in 1995 and sentenced to
11 years for alleged subversion, he was freed on ``medical parole''
on April 19 on condition that he leave the country.
	   Wang recently announced he would attend Harvard University to
further his studies, which were interrupted by the 1989 protests
and subsequent crackdown.

World Cup: Suspended player says he didn't deserve red card 
</HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ Alfred Phiri's timing was all wrong. In his
first World Cup game, he got the first red card of his career and a
subsequent three-match suspension that he fears could hound him
forever.
	   ``It's the worst thing that ever happened in my life,'' said the
Vanspor F.C. midfielder who turns 24 on Monday. ``It was the first
time I ever got the red card, and it happened in the World Cup. I
couldn't believe it.''
	   Phiri came on after halftime of Thursday's 1-1 draw with Denmark
and picked up yellow card from Colombian referee John Jairo Toro
during a scrap for the ball.
	   Then Toro sent off Denmark's Miklos Molnar in the 67th minute
for knocking over South African captain Lucas Radebe. Two minutes
later, Phiri battled with defender Thomas Helveg for the ball and
Helveg went down.
	   ``I had the ball on my left so the guy pulled my right arm,''
Phiri said Sunday in describing the play. ``I was off-balance and I
was fighting back.''
	   Toro pulled out the red card and Phiri was gone.
	   ``I think he thought I elbowed the guy,'' Phiri said. ``After he
(Helveg) fell down, all the (Danish) guys came to me and he (Toro)
thought I'd done it.''
	   When Phiri saw the red card, he buried his anguished face in his
shirt for several seconds before slowly walking off the field.
Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel put his arm on Phiri's shoulder
and whispered in his ear.
	   ``He said, `Don't worry, it happens,' '' Phiri recalled. ``I
didn't even listen to him. I was a little confused because I didn't
know where the tunnel was.''
	   Things got even worse on Saturday, when FIFA announced a
three-match suspension for Phiri for dangerous play. That meant a
5,000 Swiss franc fine and the almost certain end of his World Cup.
	   South Africa needs to beat Saudi Arabia in its last Group C
match, which Phiri will miss, and hope France beats Denmark at the
same time to have any chance to advance. Then the South Africans
would have to win two more matches to make the semifinals before
Phiri could play again.
	   Phiri called the suspension unfair, noting he got the longest
ban of the five players sent off in two matches on Thursday.
	   His biggest concern now is that people will only remember him as
the guy who got banned for three games at the 1998 World Cup. The
only way to overcome that, he said, was another chance.
	   ``If they call me again,'' he said, ``I have to play better to
convince people I didn't deserve it.''

Libyan minister hands Mubarak letter from Gadhafi league, background; departure

Eds: UPDATES in grafs 3-7 with Libyan official meeting head of Arab
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A visiting Libyan minister handed President
Hosni Mubarak Sunday a letter from Libya's leader Moammar Gadhafi
that dealt with mutual relations and recent developments in the
Arab world.
	   Secretary for Unity Jumaa al-Fazzani, who arrived in Cairo
Saturday, said the letter focused on Egyptian-Libyan ties,
especially the ``strengthening of relations between the two
brotherly people in all fields,'' and recent developments
concerning the Arab world. He did not elaborate.
	   Later in the day, al-Fazzani met with Esmat Abdel-Meguid, the
secretary-general of the 22-nation Arab League, who briefed the
Libyan official on his recent talks with British officials, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported.
	   MENA quoted Abdul-Meguid as saying that Britain's Foreign Office
is closely watching the Arab League to see whether its members will
reject U.N. sanctions imposed on Libya the way African countries
have done.
	   On June 9, African countries, including nine Arab nations,
meeting in Burkina Faso, rejected the United Nations travel ban
imposed on Libya since 1992 and asked the United States and Britain
to relax an economic blockade against the North African country.
	   Abdul-Meguid said other non-African Arab countries will consider
whether to support the African initiative during an Arab League
meeting in September, MENA said.
	   The economic blockade was imposed after Libya refused to hand
over two suspects linked to the 1988 bombing of a Pan-Am Boeing 747
over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   MENA quoted al-Fazzani as saying that the African decision was
``historic and courageous.'' The Libyan officials left Egypt after
his meeting with Abdel-Meguid.
	   Al-Fazzani's visit comes two weeks after Gadhafi canceled a
scheduled nine-day visit to Egypt. No explanation was given by
Libya for the cancellation. However, President Hosni Mubarak of
Egypt said it was put off because Gadhafi had tonsillitis.
	   Al-Fazzani said Gadhafi will visit Egypt when ``he finds it
suitable.''

World Cup: South Korea team official confirms head coach fired Sports-Soccer-Skorea-Netherlands-Reaction

	   SAINT-QUENTIN, France (AP) _ Cha Bum-kun was fired Sunday as
South Korea's national soccer coach after the crushing 5-0 loss to
the Netherlands in the World Cup, a team official said.
	   ``Technical committee members held a meeting on Sunday and
decided it. Somebody had to take responsibility,'' Chun Hanjin, the
team vice manager said.
	   ``It ends right here, right now for him,'' Chun told The
Associated Press by telephone from the team's headquarters in
suburban Paris.
	   Cha was replaced by the assistant coach, Kim Pyung-seok, Chun
said.
	   Just before a press conference for Korean reporters to announce
his dismissal, Cha talked to the players in private.
	   ``He basically said he was sorry and disappointed that he cannot
spend time and the rest of the tournament with the players any
more. And he said don't take it too hard,'' Chun said.
	   The decision to dismiss Cha was not a surprise in view of the
team's performance at the World Cup, Chun said.
	   South Korea lost 3-1 to Mexico in its first match last week. The
humiliating loss to the Netherlands in Marseille left it without
hope of advancing to the second round.
	   South Korea has one more Group E match, against Belgium on
Thursday in Paris.
	   Many soccer commentators blamed coach Cha for mismanaging the
team. Only days before the finals, its key players suffered
injuries, they noted.
	   South Koreans were particularly upset by the lopsided defeat by
the Netherlands because traditional rival Japan was able to limit
Croatia to a single goal in its 1-0 loss Saturday.
	   South Korea and Japan are co-hosts for the 2002 World Cup
finals.
	   This is South Korea's fifth appearance in the World Cup finals,
but the national team has never won a match or advanced to the
second round.
	   With their economy mired in a severe financial crisis that has
forced tens of thousands of people out of work, South Koreans had
hoped their soccer team would provide a sorely needed boost to the
country's national pride.

French pay tribute to late yachtsman Eric Tabarly 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BREST, France (AP) _ About 500 boats took to the sea Sunday
during ceremonies to pay tribute to Eric Tabarly, France's
best-known yachtsman who died last week.
	   While the boats, ranging from three-masters to small dinghies,
sailed in a light breeze, some 1,000 people, including President
Jacques Chirac, attended a religious service at the Lanveoc-Poulmic
naval base.
	   Shortly after, another ceremony was held at sea, and a wreath
was thrown into the water.
	   Tabarly, who crisscrossed oceans to win numerous solo titles,
was declared dead June 14 after falling overboard near Wales. He
was 66.
	   He was knocked into the sea two days earlier while changing the
main sail as his century-old sailboat _ the Pen Duick _ headed
toward Scotland in rough seas. Air and sea searches failed to
locate him.
	   ``The sea isn't malicious,'' Tabarly's wife, Jacqueline, said in
a speech Sunday. ``It took him, it didn't steal him. It was a means
for him to return to the house of God.''
	   Tabarly shot to fame in 1964 when he won England's Transat solo
race across the Atlantic.
	   He is survived by his wife, and his 14-year-old daughter, Marie.

World Cup: Two South African players in disciplinary hearing 
</HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ Two South African players could be sent
home for violating team discipline, the chief executive of the
South African Football Association said Sunday.
	   The players, who were not identified, allegedly violated team
rules by going out to a night club on Saturday, according to SAFA
chief executive Danny Jordaan and coach Philippe Troussier.
	   They spoke after a training session missed by starter Brendan
Augustine of Lask Linz. Team officials said they didn't know why
Augustine missed the practice.
	   Troussier told the South African Press Association he was
recommending that two players be sent home. Jordaan said he would
hold a hearing for the two players on Sunday afternoon ``to hear
their side of the story.''
	   South Africa is in third place in Group C and needs some help to
qualify for the second round in its first World Cup.
	   To make it, South Africa must beat winless Saudi Arabia and
France must beat Denmark in the final Group C matches on Wednesday,
and South Africa must overcome Denmark's four-goal advantage in
scoring differential.
	   Augustine, a defensive midfielder, was replaced at halftime of
Thursday's 1-1 draw with Denmark. He played Saturday with
non-starters in a training match against local players.
	   Troussier, known as a disciplinarian, has complained that some
players don't want to accept his rules. He said he doesn't mind
some rebellion, preferring what he called a ``live team'' to one
that never questions the coach, but he also insists on training
rules that include a midnight curfew.
	   Before news of the disciplinary hearing came out, players said
Sunday they feared Saudi Arabia's decision to fire coach Carlos
Alberto Parreira could motivate the Saudi players, who have lost
their first two matches and have no chance to advance.

Mujahedeen: Iran and France prevent refugees from attending 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with French confirmation; protest on French border
By ANWAR FARUQI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) - An exile Iranian opposition group on Sunday
accused French authorities of working hand-in-hand with the Iranian
government to prevent Iranian refugees from attending the big World
Cup match between Iran and the United States.
	   The French Interior Ministry confirmed that a number of Iranians
had been turned back as security threats Sunday while trying to
enter by road from Belgium.
	   Mohammad Mohadessin, head of the foreign relations committee of
the Mujahedeen Khalq, said that the French government had turned
down a visa request for one of its members on political grounds.
	   He said that Eskandar Filabi, a popular wrestling champion who
left Iran after its 1979 Islamic revolution, had applied for a visa
in the United States.
	   ``This is part of the political dealing with the mullahs in
Iran,'' Mohadessin told reporters in Lyon, where media attention is
focused on a big game later Sunday between the United States and
Iran.
	   ``Isn't this an act of politically staining sports?'' said
Mohadessin.
	   FIFA has said it has received calls and written statements from
Iranian opposition groups threatening to disrupt the Iran-US match.
The Mujahedeen have said they do not intend to do so.
	   Mohadessin said that, at the request of the Iranian government,
French authorities also had denied entry to thousands of Iranian
refugees. He said many were waiting at French borders to get in.
	   ``Is this the claim that `football is not political,' '' said
Mohadessin.
	   ``It seems, that so long as football serves the interest of the
murderous mullahs in Iran, it can be political,'' said Mohaddesin.
	   French authorities said that groups of Iranians who were
considered a threat to national security were turned away at the
border between France and Belgium earlier in the day.
	   An interior ministry official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, told The Associated Press that they were linked to the
The Mujahedeen. He said they did not meet standard requirements for
entry into the country.
	   The official did not say how many Iranians were turned away, but
said many did not have tickets for the match. He said they had come
from Germany and the Netherlands.
	   French radio reported that a group of Iranians blocked a highway
in Luxembourg near the border with France on Sunday to protest
France's refusal to let them into the country to see the match.
	   The Mujahedeen, the largest Iranian opposition group with
headquarters in Iraq, is committed to the overthrow of Iran's
religious government.
	   The Mujahedeen have claimed that French authorities are working
with Iranian intelligence agents to arrest opponents of the Tehran
government at the games.

Mahathir denies helping family, lashes out at foreigners 
</HEADLINE>
With BC-Malaysia-Mahathir
By ALVIN UNG
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Rebutting charges that top
politicians had helped their friends with lucrative contracts,
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad on Sunday denied using his position
to enrich his family.
	   ``I have been prime minister for 17 years. If I gave privileges
to my family, all of them would have been filthy rich,'' Mahathir,
72, said at the end of the annual convention of his United Malays
National Organization party.
	   Since delegates began meeting Thursday, the convention has been
gripped by talk of government corruption.
	   A youth leader, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who spoke out against
corruption was silenced when his name figured in a list that
Mahathir released Saturday of people who had been awarded
government contracts.
	   Responding to accusations that lucrative government contracts
went to hand-picked cronies of powerful politicians, Mahathir
released additional hundreds of names Sunday of people who had won
such contracts.
	   ``If you look at the list, you'll see that some of them get more
contracts because of their ability, not because of nepotism and
cronyism,'' Mahathir said. ``Cronyism and nepotism are used by
foreigners to undermine the NEP.''
	   He was referring to the New Economic Policy, introduced in 1971.
It favors Malays and other indigenous races in Malaysia over
Chinese and Indians in jobs, business deals and universities.
	   The affirmative action plan prescribes that all big companies
must allocate 30 percent of their shares to Bumiputeras, or ``sons
of the soil.'' This has resulted in more Malay tycoons and a
broader middle class.
	   ``Foreigners find it difficult to swallow what we've done,
helping our poor to be more like the other races,'' he said in the
nationally televised speech, to the cheers of nearly 2,000
delegates at the convention.
	   He told leaders of UMNO, who represent constituencies of about
2.7 million members, to remain united against foreigners who harbor
ill will against the party, the Malay race and all Malaysians.
	   Warning party members not to ape the West, he said that
foreigners have persistently sought to ``colonize'' the nation by
destroying its economy and tarnishing the nation's cultural and
religious landscape.
	   ``They say that we devotees of Islam don't respect women. But to
them, women are merely sex objects. I believe that it will only be
a while that we will hear of old men raping children. It's now
possible. They have Viagra.''
	   Besides lashing out against Western lifestyles, Mahathir has
constantly blamed foreign currency speculators for ravaging
Malaysia's currency, the ringgit, which has plummeted more than 35
percent against the U.S. dollar since last July.
	   Speaking to reporters after the UMNO assembly, he complained
that global ``market forces'' have undermined his ability to arrest
the economic slide in Malaysia, which faces a full-blown recession.
	   ``If I am in full control, I can assure that within three
months, we can recover. However, with outside forces fiddling
around with the currency and selling shares, it's difficult,'' he
said.

Former East German soldier, photographed while fleeing, has died 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photo NY194
<TEXT>
	   INGOLSTADT, Germany (AP) _ It is one of the best-known images
from the Cold War: an East German soldier, in uniform, leaping to
freedom over the early, barbed-wire Berlin Wall that he should have
been guarding.
	   Thirty-seven years after his famous flight to the west, the
former soldier, Conrad Schumann, has committed suicide. Schumann,
56, was found hanging from a tree Saturday near his home in
Kipfenberg, a village outside the southern town of Ingolstadt.
	   The reason for his suicide was not known.
	   Schumann fled East Berlin on Aug. 15, 1961, two days after East
German leaders ordered construction of the Berlin Wall. He was the
first East German soldier or official to escape.
	   The famous photograph captures the 19-year-old soldier from the
front, just as he clears the tangle of barbed wire. He wears a
helmet and knee-high boots, and holds his rifle in his right hand.
	   Today, posters of the image are a best-selling item at the
Berlin Wall museum at the former Checkpoint Charlie border
crossing. Just a month ago, Schumann made an appearance at the
museum to sign the poster.
	   ``The people stood in line for his autograph,'' a museum
spokesperson said.
	   At the time, Schumann said he fled to join family members who
had already escaped to the West. He eventually settled in
Kipfenberg, in the southwestern state of Bavaria, and worked as a
machine operator.
	   Information about survivors and funeral arrangements was not
immediately available.
	   East German authorities built the Berlin Wall to stop the
hemorrhage of people fleeing the communist state.
	   They closed the border on Aug. 13, 1961, and erected temporary
barbed-wire barriers between Soviet-occupied East Berlin and the
rest of the city. Over the next four years, the communists built
the concrete wall that became a symbol of the Iron Curtain.
	   Germans demolished the wall in 1989. East and West Germany were
reunified the next year.

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Bombs exploded near the fortified U.S.
Embassy compound in a suburb north of Beirut Sunday, but there were
no casualties, security officials said.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the
explosions, which occurred about one kilometer (a half mile) from
the U.S. Embassy compound. Security officials said the embassy was
not the target. The motive of the blasts was not clear.
	   State-run Beirut radio said three rocket-propelled grenades
attached to a detonator exploded at 1:20 p.m. (1020GMT) in the
Christian suburb of Aukar, causing minor damage to a contractor's
business.
	   The security officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said the RPGs were detonated by a timer in a bush.
	   Aukar residents said they heard at least one explosion.
	   Police and Lebanese army troops sealed off the site and barred
journalists from approaching. U.S. diplomats could not be reached
for comment.
	   The blast came three days after an explosion killed two people
in a neighborhood east of the capital Beirut. The motive behind
Thursday's bombing in Dora was also not known.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was in the United States last week.

Airlines to collect airport tax; operators ask for visa cut 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Travellers leaving Kenya will no longer
pay the dlrs 20 departure tax to government employees, and tour
operators are asking the government to abolish visa fees to attract
scarce foreign tourists, the Daily Nation said Sunday.
	   Beginning September, airlines will collect the departure tax,
according to Kenya Revenue Authority Chairman Hillary Ng'weno, the
newspaper said.
	   It was not clear at what point the airlines would collect the
tax, but Ng'weno told reporters in the port of Mombasa Saturday the
move was intended to stem corruption within the tax-collecting
authority. He did not explain how airlines would be less prone to
siphoning off the taxes than the authority's own employees.
	   Also in Mombasa, tour operators called on the government to
abolish tourist visa fees altogether for at least a year or reduce
the charge to dlrs 10.
	   Mombasa Mayor Najib Balala, who is also chairman of the Mombasa
and Coast Tourist Association, also called on the government to
grant landing rights at Mombasa airport to international carriers
and to upgrade the airport at the Indian Ocean resort of Malindi so
it could receive charter flights.
	   Mombasa and Indian Ocean coast hotel owners last week asked the
government to stop protecting Kenya Airways from competion by
barring international flights from Mombasa's Moi International
Airport. The airline was privatized two years ago, although the
government still owns a quarter of the shares.
	   At present only Nairobi's Jomo Kenyatta International Airport
and Eldoret Airport in western Kenya near the hometown of President
Daniel arap Moi are authorized to receive international flights.
	   Before a steep decline in tourism to Kenya brought about by
politically motived ethnic violence and reports of armed attacks on
tourists, the bulk of foreign tourists spent their vacations on the
Kenyan coast.

World Cup: Saudi coach, players miss sacked Brazilian coach

<TEXT>
	   MELUN-SENART, France (AP) _ Saudi players said Sunday they were
``not happy'' with the decision to fire coach Carlos Alberto
Parreira and hoped Parreira could return in the future.
	   Saudi Arabia, which reached the second round in its World Cup
debut in 1994, was eliminated from the 1998 championships after
losing 1-0 to Denmark and 4-0 to France in the first round.
Parreira was fired by the Saudis Saturday for the team's early
exit.
	   ``I was not very happy to hear about Parreira's dismissal,''
said Mohammed al-Kharashi, who took charge of the World Cup squad
after Parreira's sacking. ``Surely we will miss him. He's not only
a great coach, but also a great person. He did his best for the
team.''
	   Al-Karashi was a student of Parreira's 12 years ago.
	   Saudi players, some of whom were seen hugging Parreira before he
left the hotel Saturday to get the ``bad news.''
	   Early Sunday, after training without Parreira, Saudi players bid
farewell to the former coach and thanked him for his guidance.

Iraq says Annan shrugging obligations under arms deal optimism on sanctions 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES to correct fourth graf to show UN qualifies its
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ An official Iraq newspaper on Sunday
accused U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan of doing nothing to
fulfill his promise to get eight-year sanctions against Iraq
lifted, and held him legally responsible for the sanctions.
	   The ruling Baath Party newspaper al-Thawra said Annan had
promised to work for the removal of the embargo in a deal he signed
with Iraqi leaders February 23.
	   ``Mr. Annan is legally and morally responsible for the sanctions
file... and under the February deal he is under obligation to bring
this matter to the attention of the Security Council,'' the paper
said in a front-page editorial.
	   U.N. officials have said if Iraq fulfills the requirements of a
two month plan of work for inspections, then they will be closer
than ever to ending sanctions.
	   The February deal gave U.N. arms inspectors _ charged with
overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _
unconditional access to all sites in Iraq, including presidential
compounds.
	   The United States and Britain had threatened air and missile
strikes if Iraq did not allow the monitors into President Saddam
Hussein's palaces.
	   The U.N. sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990 invasion
of Kuwait.

British newspaper report: South Africa and Libya make arms-for-oil deal 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ South Africa has concluded a secret 300-million
pound (dlrs 495 million) deal to supply Libya with weapons and
spare parts in return for cut-price oil, London's Sunday Telegraph
reported.
	   The newspaper said the deal was approved by President Nelson
Mandela, straining relations with the United States and raising
fears that Libya's Moammar Gadhafi may acquire details of South
African chemical and bacteriological weapons built up during
apartheid.
	   Mandela 's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, said he would know if
Mandela had approved such a deal.
	   ``I know nothing about it,'' Mankahlana told The Associated
Press in Johannesburg, adding he believed South Africa imported no
oil from Libya, and relied mainly on Iran and, more recently, Saudi
Arabia, for supplies.
	   Mandela's visited Libya twice last October, and has vigorously
defended his loyalty to Gadhafi and urged an end to sanctions
against Libya. The sanctions were prompted by the United States and
Britain.
	   The pro-conservative Sunday Telegraph said the arms-for-oil deal
was negotiated by South African secret service officials. The
report, by the newspaper's foreign editor Con Coughlin, gave no
date for the deal.
	   Under the agreement, South Africa will supply spare parts for
Libya's aging Mirage jet-fighter and attack helicopters, the
newspaper said. South Africa has also ``held out the possibility''
of supplying Libya with the helicopter it makes, the Rooivalk.
	   Any such deal would violate U.N. sanctions, imposed to pressure
Libya into surrendering two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of
a Pan American jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, in which 270 people
were killed. Sanctions bar flights to Libya and arms sales to the
north African nation.
	   Mandela has long been defensive about ties with countries that
the West regards as sponsoring or encouraging terrorism. In March,
during a visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton, he said critics of
his ties with Cuba and Libya should ``throw themselves into a
pool.''
	   The Sunday Telegraph noted that South Africa's Truth and
Reconciliation Commission heard evidence last week that apartheid
leaders planned to develop toxins that could single out blacks, and
to spread anthrax, AIDS and cholera in black townships.
	   Gadhafi has confronted the United States over attempts to build
a chemical weapons plant outside the capital, Tripoli.

Six mourners die in Algerian cemetery bombing 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Six women mourners died when a bomb exploded at a
cemetery south of Algiers, French radio reported Sunday.
	   The attack, which took place Saturday, was at a cemetery in the
region of Medea, about 70 kilometers (44 miles) south of the
Algerian capital, France Info reported.
	   The victims were praying at the tombs of relatives killed in
recent massacres.
	   It was the second time in four days that a cemetery had been
targeted in Algeria.
	   Last Wednesday, four people died and four others were injured at
a cemetery near Tipaza, a coastal town west of Algiers.
	   There was no claim of responsibility for either bombing, but
such attacks are usually blamed on Muslim militants waging a
6-year-old insurgency against the military-backed government.
	   At least 75,000 people have died in Algeria since the start of

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ City officials assessed the losses Sunday from the
most violent summer storm in recent memory: six dead, thousands of
trees lost, and damage to the Bolshoi Theater and the walls of the
Kremlin.
	   ``The damage done to the city is huge,'' a spokesman for Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov told the Interfax news agency.
	   The freak storm struck the Russian capital just before midnight
Saturday, with nearly continuous thunder and lightning, intense
downpours and shrieking winds. It lasted about 30 minutes, during
which trees snapped, billboards and street kiosks collapsed and the
air was alive with flying debris.
	   ``It was worse than a hurricane,'' said Mikhail Gordunov, the
night manager of a kiosk on Kutuzovsky Prospect, a wide boulevard
leading toward the Kremlin. ``I was trying to bring an umbrella in,
and was afraid of being swept away.''
	   Winds were recorded at 90 kilometers per hour (60 mph), but
whirlwinds in some places gusted much higher, according to Raisa
Yeliseyeva, duty officer at the Moscow weather center.
	   She said the storm was triggered by a collision of two air
masses over the capital.
	   ``Temperatures in Moscow and east of the capital were very high,
32-35 degrees (90-95 F), while air masses with temperatures of
20-22 (68-72 F) were approaching the city from the west,'' she
said.
	   They collided with a bang.
	   Luzhkov, who promised earlier in the year to cancel the city's
contract with the national weather service after it failed to
predict a heavy spring snowstorm, renewed his criticism Sunday.
	   The weather service ``failed to predict the storm once again,''
he said, according to Interfax. He reiterated his plans to cancel
the city's contract and hire new forecasters.
	   The mayor put the death toll at six, and rattled off other
statistics: 5,000 trees down, power lines down in 700 places and
electric trolley and tram lines in 500 places, damage to 2,000
roofs.
	   Interfax said 121 people had been hospitalized for injuries
suffered in the storm, most of them caused by falling trees or
flying debris.
	   The storm seriously damaged the roof of the Bolshoi Theater and
smashed windows at the Moskva Hotel, adjacent to Red Square, the
ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   About 200 trees were uprooted in the majestic Kremlin gardens,
and several turrets atop the Kremlin wall _ sections of which date
to the 15th century _ were knocked down by falling trees.
	   Cafes and outdoor restaurants along Tverskaya Street, the city's
main shopping street, were smashed beyond repair, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Sporadic power outages were reported throughout the night, and
cable television service was also affected.
	   Three thousand Interior troops and regular soldiers joined city
workers in cleaning up the debris Sunday. Luzhkov promised that the
most serious problems would be repaired by Monday morning, and
insisted that the damage would not affect the World Youth Games,
which begin in Moscow on July 11.

World Cup: Germany grabs 2-2 draw with late comeback 
</HEADLINE>
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Oliver Bierhoff headed a goal in the 80th
minute as Germany came back from a two-goal deficit Sunday to steal
a 2-2 draw against Yugoslavia.
	   In a match between the two Group F favorites, Yugoslavia looked
on course for three points just after halftime when Dragan
Stojkovic made the score 2-0.
	   Dejan Stankovic had opened the scoring for Yugoslavia early on.
	   But Germany benefited from a fortunate own goal in the 74th
minute, and 10 minutes from time Bierhoff leveled the score at 2-2.
	   With Germany and Yugoslavia having won their opening games, both
teams knew that victory would mean a near certain place in the next
round.
	   Yugoslavia dominated the early exchanges and scored after 13
minutes.
	   Real Madrid striker Predrag Mijatovic, 30 meters from goal,
drove in a left wing cross, and Stankovic got the faintest of
touches as the ball bounced over German goalkeeper Andreas Kopke.
	   Though Mijatovic looked to have scored directly, Stankovic, the
19-year- old midfielder who recently agreed a move from Red Star
Belgrade to Lazio of Rome, was credited with the goal.
	   Yugoslav captain Stojkovic, playing his 65th international, was
the first half's most influential player.
	   After 33 minutes, he played a superb pass that beat the German
offside trap. Darko Kovacevic was first to the ball, but his close
range shot was blocked by Kopke.
	   Minutes later, Mijatovic fired in a dangerous cross from the
right, and Germany needed a desperate challenge from Jurgen Kohler
to clear the danger in front of an onrushing Stankovic.
	   German coach Berti Vogts brought on Lothar Matthaus in the
second half, giving the former German captain a record 22 World Cup
appearances.
	   But Yugoslavia doubled its lead three minutes into the second
half courtesy of a blunder from Kopke.
	   Slavisa Jokanovic made a storming run through the heart of the
German defense, before knocking the ball to Kovacevic.
	   The Real Sociedad forward played what looked like a weak cross,
but Kopke fumbled the ball to present Stojkovic with a simple
tap-in from two meters.
	   Germany was struggling for inspiration, but began its unlikely
comeback with a fortunate goal after 73 minutes.
	   Substitute Michael Tarnat hit a left-footed free kick from 25
meters that struck Sinisa Mihajlovic's outstretched right boot to
give goalkeeper Ivica Kralj no chance.
	   Bierhoff then rose superbly to head a right-wing corner into the
net to salvage the draw.
 &UR; Lineups:
	   Germany _ Andreas Kopke; Christian Worns, Jurgen Kohler, Olaf
Thon; Jorg Heinrich, Andy Moller (Ulf Kirsten, 51st), Jens Jeremis,
Dietmar Hamann (Lothar Mattaus, 46th), Christian Zige (Michael
Tarnat, 62nd); Jurgen Klinsmann, Oliver Bierhoff.
	   Yugoslavia _ Ivica kralj; Sinisa Mihajlovic, Slobodan
Komljenovic, Zeljko Petrovic, Goran Djorovic; Slavisa Jokanovic,
Dragan Stojkovic, Dejan Stankovic (Dejan Govedarica 65th), Vladimir
Jugovic; Darko Kovacevic (Perica Ognjenovic, 51st), Predrag
Mijatovic.
	   Referee _ Kim Milton Nielsen, Denmark.

Cabinet approves plan to extend Jerusalem authority to settlements settlements to vote, pay taxes separately 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. UPDATES, RECASTS throughout with more details,
AP Photos JRL101-102
By HILARY APPELMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Over American protests, Israel's Cabinet
unanimously approved a plan Sunday that would extend Jerusalem
municipal authority over eight Jewish settlements in the West Bank.
	   Palestinians charged that Israel was violating the
Israel-Palestinian peace accords by unilaterally expanding
Jerusalem's borders and annexing West Bank land.
	   Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Ziad, whose views reflect
official Palestinian policy on Jerusalem, called the plan ``de
facto annexation'' of the settlements to Israel.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority will do what it can to confront this
challenge,'' he said. ``The people must stand up to defend
Jerusalem.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected those charges,
accusing the Palestinians of creating an ``artificial storm'' for
political gain.
	   ``This is an important decision aimed at strengthening
Jerusalem,'' he said in a news conference. ``We are not changing
the status of any one of these communities or of Jerusalem. ...
There is no violation of the Oslo accords.''
	   Netanyahu claimed that the Palestinians were the ones violating
the peace accords by trying to establish authority in Jerusalem.
	   The United States called the plan ``provocative,'' coming at a
delicate point when U.S. officials are trying to shepherd the two
sides to reluctant agreement on an Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Netanyahu in
a telephone call to have the Cabinet reconsider.
	   The plan does not annex the West Bank settlements in question,
which surround Jerusalem to the north, south and east _ they will
continue to pay local property taxes and vote in their own
jurisdictions, Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said.
	   But it sets up an ``umbrella authority'' _ putting the
settlements under Jerusalem municipal authority for certain
services, notably building and planning. Settlements normally have
to get approval from the defense ministry for any construction.
	   ``It's the first time that regional powers concerning a region
of the West Bank will be vested in a civilian Israeli organ,''
lawyer and peace activist Danny Seidemann said.
	   The United States has called for a ``time-out'' on any expansion
of Jewish settlements in an effort to help re-start the stalled
peace talks.
	   Palestinian officials said Israel was pre-empting negotiations
on a final peace agreement, which is supposed to address the status
of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, and final borders. The
Palestinians hope to establish an independent state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel occupied in 1967, with east
Jerusalem as its capital.
	   ``They are dictating the outcome of the permanent status
talks,'' said Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Council.
	   ``This is the most dangerous step taken by the Israeli
government. They are firing the bullet that will put the peace
process out of its misery.''
	   The Palestinian Authority has filed a formal complaint with the
United Nations Security Council.
	   The plan, which was approved after a five-hour debate Sunday in
the Israeli Cabinet, would also extend Jerusalem's boundaries
westward into Israel proper, annexing several suburbs in order to
expand the city's economic base and help ensure its Jewish
majority.
	   Hundreds of Israelis demonstrated against the plan on Sunday
morning, protesting that the annexation of their suburbs would lead
to higher taxes.
	   Bar-Illan said the plan was intended to streamline and improve
municipal services and attract new investment and industry to
Jerusalem. It ``has absolutely nothing to do with the status of
these areas,'' he said.
	   The settlements around to Jerusalem are widely expected to be
annexed by Israel in any final peace settlement.
	   But the Israel-Palestinian interim accords call on the two sides
to refrain from unilateral measures that ``change the status of the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip pending the outcome of the permanent
status negotiations.''
	   Those negotiations, which are supposed to be completed by next
May, have not yet begun.
	   Israel has charged that the Palestinians are violating that
section of the accords by trying to upgrade their observer status
at the United Nations.

Mostly sunny start predicted for Wimbledon AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Wimbledon, coming off the wettest
tournament in history, should get off to a dry start this week. But
don't look for the first week to be rain-free.
	   ``I would never bet on that,'' duty forecaster Graham Rye said
Sunday.
	   Monday should offer a sunny start with a slight chance of light
showers in the afternoon.
	   Tuesday brings the greatest chance of rain over the first three
days, with Wednesday predicted to be dry and bright.
	   Thursday and Friday bring the risk of heavy rain with bright sun
also possible in patches.
	   ``It should be a good start, nothing like the downpours of last
year,'' Rye said.
	   There were nearly three straight days of complete washouts
during the first week last year, forcing organizers to schedule
matches on the middle Sunday for only the second time in history.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SAMPRAS, HINGIS BEST BETS: &LR;  Martina Hingis is the odds-on
favorite to defend her Wimbledon title, and Pete Sampras is the
favorite on the men's side.
	   British bookmakers Ladbrokes listed Hingis on Sunday at 10-11
followed by Steffi Graf and Monica Seles, both 6-1. Other top women
include Venus Williams and Jana Novotna, 12-1; Anna Kournikova,
14-1; Lindsay Davenport and Conchita Martinez, 20-1.
	   Behind Sampras at 5-4 are Richard Krajicek and Yevgeny
Kafelnikov, 6-1; Greg Rusedski, 12-1; Jonas Bjorkman, 14-1; Patrick
Rafter, 16-1; Goran Ivanisevic, Tim Henman and Andre Agassi, 20-1.
	   The odds are 7-1 on a British man winning, which hasn't happened
since Fred Perry won in 1936.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SUPERBRAT II: &LR;  Marcelo Rios, the temperamental Chilean who was
ranked No. 1 briefly earlier this year, is good for tennis,
according to former bad boy John McEnroe.
	   ``It's more interesting for the fans to have a bad guy to root
against than every player behaving exactly the same,'' the
three-time Wimbledon champion told the Sunday Mirror newspaper.
	   The No. 2 seeded Rios has previously suggested that grass was
for cows _ not for tennis.
	   Pat Cash, the 1987 Wimbledon, also thinks Rios is good for
tennis.
	   ``There are too many robots in the game,'' Cash said.
	   Writing in The Sunday Telegraph, McEnroe ripped unmotivated
players and a system that has them playing too much tennis.
	   ``To be honest,'' he said. ``Looking down the field there are
not too many out there with greatness seared through them.''
	   ``The way the tour and the ranking system are set up, there is
too much money and the motivational forces are not as strong as
they used to be.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   VENUS WISDOM: Not everyone is excited about the clash between
former champions and teen-agers in the women's field.
	   Venus Williams declined to answer questions Sunday about the
draw, her chances and Steffi Graf's return to Wimbledon.
	   ``Those questions are kind of boring,'' Williams said. ``I have
a general statement: I'm glad to be here. Everyone is going to be
trying to win, and everyone is glad Steffi's back. And that's
all.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   EQUAL PAY: &LR;  Bart McGuire, the recently appointed chief executive
officer of the Women's Tennis Association, will be at Wimbledon
pressing the chiefs of the four Grand Slams for equal pay for
women.
	   With young WTA stars like Martina Hingis, Venus and Serena
Williams, and Anna Kournikova, McGuire says the women's game has
become more attractive than the men's.
	   Only the U.S. Open among the four Grand Slams pays the men and
women equally.
	   ``I will be addressing the issue respectfully to the Grand Slam
chairmen,'' he told The Sunday Telegraph.
	   ``The TV ratings for the Australian Open show the women getting
more viewers than the men. At Wimbledon and the French Open last
year, the U.S. TV ratings were 20 percent better for the women.''
	   ``All we are asking is for people to recognize that the
situation is changing,'' he added. ``That these changes are not
transitory but have a degree of permanence and should be reflected
in the women's prize money relative to the men.''

Former leader urges Nigeria's rulers to dialogue 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Newly released from prison, former
Nigerian ruler Gen. Olusegun Obasanjo urged the West African
country's new military leaders to defuse simmering divisions with
political opponents by engaging in talks, newspapers reported
Sunday.
	   ``With the spirit of give and take, any human problem can be
solved by dialogue instead of sweeping it under the carpet and
pretending that it does not exist,'' Obasanjo was quoted as saying
by several Lagos daily papers.
	   He called on ``all patriotic men of goodwill'' to join the
government at the negotiation table.
	   Since Nigeria's new military hierarchy led by Gen. Abdulsalam
Abubakar rose to power on June 8 following the sudden heart attack
death of dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, it has sent mixed messages to
critics.
	   Abubakar has tried to distance himself from Abacha's five-year
reign _ widely condemned as harsh and tyrannical _ by releasing 15
of the country's political prisoners.
	   However, the nation's best-known detainee, Moshood Abiola,
apparent winner of 1993's nullified presidential election, remains
behind bars.
	   And heavy-handed police tactics remain. Just days after Abubakar
was sworn in, military troops used tear gas and warning shots to
quell a pro-democracy demonstration.
	   Obasanjo, formerly a burly man who lost a great deal of his
weight in prison, lashed out at the country's former military
rulers, but made no comment about the record of Abubakar, a career
military officer who has little record in politics.
	   Abacha's minions ``parceled out (treason convictions) like
wrapped presents ... to those who were seen as too dangerous or
uncompromising for the comfort of a deceitful, Godless, corrupt,
soulless, oppressive, murderous, obstinate and wicked regime,''

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Hours after election results were
made official Sunday, one Czech politician made good on his
pre-election promise to swallow a live bug.
	   Heading into the weekend's elections, Eduard Kremlicka vowed he
would eat a June bug if his populist Pensioners for Secure Living
failed to make it into the parliament.
	   When it became clear his party had fallen short of their goal by
a clear 2 percent, he began searching for a big, brown June bug.
But there were none to be found, so instead he ingested a slightly
smaller click beetle _ still wiggling.
	   When asked by private F1 radio if he'd really eaten the bug,
Kremlicka deadpanned: ``Of course, it's full of protein.''
	   ``It's easy,'' he said. ``First you bite the head off, then you
squeeze the body _ or you can just munch on it because the legs are
still moving.''
	   Kremlicka said he had fulfilled his pre-election promise and
hoped that those parties elected would also make good on theirs.

	   Khatami, in his one-line statement, said about Nouri: ``Due to
you capabilities, I appoint you as the deputy president for
development and social affairs.''
	   Nouri was accused of jeopardizing the Islamic nation's stability
and appeared in Parliament Sunday to respond to questions by 31
hard-line deputies demanding his impeachment.
	   The deputies signed the impeachment motion earlier this month,
accusing him among other things of allowing a rally last month to
protest the influence of the hard-line clergy in Iran.
	   The conservative members of Iran's ruling clergy have been
waging a regular campaign to discredit officials loyal to Khatami,
who took power last August.
	   The motion accused Nouri, a clergyman, of ``creating tension in
the society, making provocative interviews and speeches in
different provinces and appointing inexperienced people to
managerial posts at the ministry.''
	   Nouri defended all his appointments, including that of his
deputy Tajzadeh, and said there was a plot to divide the new
generation of leaders and the clergy.
	   ``I do not claim that I have never made a mistake. However, you
should realize there is a plot afoot to separate the young, bright
university generation from the revolution and the clergy,'' he told
a packed parliament hall.
	   In Sunday's hearing, Nouri was also criticized for being quoted
on Israeli radio. But Nouri countered that he was not responsible
for where his comments appeared.
	   ``I've given dozens of press conferences and interviews and some
parliament members go looking for a couple of words here and there
... to use against me. That's not fair,'' he said.
	   Several hard-line deputies claimed drug-smuggling, kidnappings
and violence had increased since Nouri assumed power. They also
accused Nouri of hiring people who were not entirely committed to
the ideals of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution and for firing people
who were not liberals.
	   ``Through uncalculated and unwise moves, Nouri, instead of
promoting democracy, created tension, anarchy and violence in the
society,'' said Parliament member Mohammad Reza Bahonar, one of the
deputies who initiated the impeachment proceedings.
	   The Parliament session was broadcast live on national radio.
	   Khatami's landslide victory in May 1997 shook the foundations of
Iran's clerical rule and was considered a triumph for civil
liberties in this Islamic republic.
	   Khatami still struggles, however, with hard-line opponents who
accuse him of betraying the 1979 Islamic revolution led by the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   Ali Khamenei, who succeeded Khomeini, remains Iran's powerful
spiritual leader.

Security clampdown as English soccer fans fete early 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ The beer bottle slipped off the table
and crashed to the floor Sunday as alcohol flowed in a bar packed
with English fans, some of them veterans of the violence that
trashed downtown Marseille last week.
	   Many with tattoos and close-cropped hair, they insisted they're
not looking for a fight, just another good World Cup match in this
southwestern town Monday between England and Romania.
	   As long as they're not provoked.
	   ``If somebody pokes ya, you poke back,'' said Bob Wells, a
muscle-bound Folkestone construction foreman with tattoos on his
arms and chest. Wells said he did just that in Marseille last week.
	   Local youths from working glass North African immigrant families
pelted him with bottles before the England-Tunisia match last
Monday in violence that left 50 injured and 100 arrested.
	   ``The police were too late,'' Wells complained, echoing reports
in some French media.
	   Despite tightened security with hundreds of riot police, many
locals in Toulouse were nervous that Monday's match _ or the
partying around it _ could bring another riot like the one in
Marseille.
	   Over protests by bar owners, authorities hoping to keep the June
10-July 12 World Cup from again being tainted by violence ordered
bars closed at 11 p.m.
	   Officials made usually festive Toulouse the only city to
postpone France's annual Festival of Music on Sunday, with its
colorful street concerts.
	   ``We're afraid. I don't know when I'll close tonight or
tomorrow. It depends what happens,'' said You Ung, manager of a
Chinese restaurant near the train station. ``We haven't had much
business since Friday. People are afraid.''
	   Instead of a music festival, English chants echoed down
otherwise quiet streets on a hot afternoon.
	   Across from Bar One, English fans laughed, joked and sang loudly
as they sat or stood on a curb with pints of beer in their hands.
	   ``No surrender, no surrender, no surrender to the IRA!,'' sang
one group as another group cheered from down the street.
	   A worried-looking Mohammed Abdel-Loubab, 15, walked by holding a
wooden box of avocados and melons he bought from the bustling
outdoor market.
	   So far, he said, ``they're nice. But you see the English
drinking, and they drink a lot. It could heat up.''
	   Still, Loubab, who plays on a local soccer team, thinks ``The
English deserve to win. They're a good team.''
	   Delphine Bigot, 21, shrugged off any threat of violence.
	   ``OK, I saw a lot of beer cans and paper lying around,'' said
the biology student, but she noted anti-terrorism measures clamped
shut a lot of trash cans.
	   ``It's friendly here. All these people coming from around the
world make it a cosmopolitan city. I feel like I'm on vacation
without traveling,'' she said.
	   Well, a 39-year-old father of two, said the image of English
hooligans wasn't fair and that his country shouldn't be judged by
``a few bad apples.''
	   ``Every time there's a problem, the English get blamed,'' he
said. But he added: ``I'm proud to be English. Saint George is in
my heart. We won't be pushed upon.''

World Cup: Germany grabs 2-2 draw with late comeback players 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES thruout with quotes, fixes spelling of some German
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Oliver Bierhoff headed a goal in the 80th
minute as Germany came back from a two-goal deficit Sunday to steal
a 2-2 draw against Yugoslavia.
	   In a match between the two Group F favorites, Yugoslavia looked
on course for three points just after halftime when Dragan
Stojkovic made the score 2-0.
	   Dejan Stankovic had opened the scoring for Yugoslavia early on.
	   But Germany benefited from a fortunate deflection goal in the
74th minute, and 10 minutes from time Bierhoff leveled the score at
2-2.
	   ``We made possible what seemed impossible,'' German coach Berti
Vogts said. ``We turned defeat into a near victory.''
	   ``They wanted to toy with us instead of trying to score a third
goal and they got punished for that,'' Vogts said.
	   With Germany and Yugoslavia having won their opening games, both
teams knew that victory would mean a near certain place in the next
round.
	   ``I am sad and happy,'' said Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac.
``I am happy with the outcome but I am sad that we let the victory
slip away.''
	   ``We let them get back into the match and equalize,'' Santrac
said.
	   Yugoslavia dominated the early exchanges and scored after 13
minutes.
	   Real Madrid striker Predrag Mijatovic, 30 meters from goal,
drove in a left wing cross, and Stankovic got the faintest of
touches as the ball bounced over German goalkeeper Andreas Koepke.
	   Though Mijatovic looked to have scored directly, Stankovic, the
19-year-old midfielder who recently agreed a move from Red Star
Belgrade to Lazio of Rome, was credited with the goal.
	   Yugoslav captain Stojkovic, playing his 65th international, was
the first half's most influential player.
	   After 33 minutes, he played a superb pass that beat the German
offside trap. Darko Kovacevic was first to the ball, but his close
range shot was blocked by Koepke.
	   Minutes later, Mijatovic fired in a dangerous cross from the
right, and Germany needed a desperate challenge from Juergen Kohler
to clear the danger in front of an onrushing Stankovic.
	   German coach Berti Vogts brought on Lothar Matthaeus in the
second half, giving the former German captain a record 22 World Cup
appearances.
	   ``We knew they would show their real face today, they played a
very strong technical game,'' Matthaeus said. ``But our team showed
its morale by coming back.''
	   Yugoslavia doubled its lead three minutes into the second half
courtesy of a blunder from Koepke.
	   Slavisa Jokanovic made a storming run through the heart of the
German defense, before knocking the ball to Kovacevic.
	   The Real Sociedad forward played what looked like a weak cross,
but Koepke fumbled the ball to present Stojkovic with a simple
tap-in from two meters.
	   Germany was struggling for inspiration, but began its unlikely
comeback with a fortunate goal after 73 minutes.
	   Substitute Michael Tarnat hit a left-footed free kick from 25
meters that struck Sinisa Mihajlovic's outstretched right boot to
give goalkeeper Ivica Kralj no chance.
	   Bierhoff then rose superbly to head a right-wing corner from
Thon into the net to salvage the draw.
 &UR; Lineups:
	   Germany _ Andreas Koepke; Christian Woerns, Juergen Kohler, Olaf
Thon; Joerg Heinrich, Andy Moeller (Ulf Kirsten, 51st), Jens
Jeremis, Dietmar Hamann (Lothar Matthaeus, 46th), Christian Ziege
(Michael Tarnat, 62nd); Juergen Klinsmann, Oliver Bierhoff.
	   Yugoslavia _ Ivica Kralj; Sinisa Mihajlovic, Slobodan
Komljenovic, Zeljko Petrovic, Goran Djorovic; Slavisa Jokanovic,
Dragan Stojkovic, Dejan Stankovic (Dejan Govedarica, 65th),
Vladimir Jugovic; Darko Kovacevic (Perica Ognjenovic, 51st),
Predrag Mijatovic.

Iran's interior minister impeached but Khatami carries on fight 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: COMBINES urgent series; minor editing; raises context grafs
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's hard-line lawmakers impeached the
moderate interior minister Sunday but in a swift counter-blow
President Mohammad Khatami named him to a newly created post of
deputy president.
	   Khatami named the impeached Abdollah Nouri as deputy president
for development and social affairs, sending a clear message to the
hard-liners that he had every intention of keeping Nouri in the
government.
	   ``Due to you capabilities, I appoint you as the deputy president
for development and social affairs.'' Khatami said in his one-line
statement.
	   Khatami also appointed the deputy interior minister for social
affairs, Mostafa Tajzadeh, as the acting interior minister,
state-run television reported.
	   Tajzadeh's appointment is significant because he is a staunch
loyalist of both Khatami and Nouri. One of the main reasons cited
in the impeachment motion by the hard-liners was Tajzadeh's
appointment by Nouri as his deputy minister.
	   Khatami's landslide victory in May 1997 shook the foundations of
Iran's clerical rule and was considered a triumph for civil
liberties in this Islamic republic.
	   But Khatami's time in office has been rife with struggle against
hard-line opponents who accuse him of betraying the 1979 Islamic
revolution led by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   Ali Khamenei, who succeeded Khomeini, remains Iran's powerful
spiritual leader.
	   Earlier Sunday, hoping to deal a body blow to Khatami's moderate
policies, 137 members in the 270-member Majlis, or Parliament,
voted to impeach Nouri. A total of 128 supported Nouri and there
were three abstentions.
	   Nouri was not present when the results were announced after the
secret ballot.
	   The impeachment required Nouri to resign, but the unfolding
developments an hour later showed that the clash between
hard-liners and moderates was not over: Nouri's appointment as the
deputy president indicated that Khatami may be willing to go to any
length to challenge the hard-liners.
	   There were no immediate comments from the hard-liners or the
moderates.
	   Nouri was accused of jeopardizing the Islamic nation's stability
and appeared in Parliament Sunday to respond to questions by 31
hard-line deputies demanding his impeachment.

	   The conservative members of Iran's ruling clergy have been
waging a regular campaign to discredit officials loyal to Khatami,
who took power last August.
	   The motion accused Nouri, a clergyman, of ``creating tension in
the society, making provocative interviews and speeches in
different provinces and appointing inexperienced people to
managerial posts at the ministry.''
	   Nouri defended all his appointments, including that of his
deputy, Tajzadeh, and said there was a plot to divide the new
generation of leaders and the clergy.
	   ``I do not claim that I have never made a mistake. However, you
should realize there is a plot afoot to separate the young, bright
university generation from the revolution and the clergy,'' he told
a packed parliament hall.
	   Nouri was also criticized for being quoted on Israeli radio. But
Nouri countered that he was not responsible for where his comments
appeared.
	   ``I've given dozens of press conferences and interviews and some
parliament members go looking for a couple of words here and there
... to use against me. That's not fair,'' he said.
	   Several hard-line deputies claimed drug-smuggling, kidnappings
and violence had increased since Nouri assumed power. They also
accused Nouri of hiring people who were not entirely committed to
the ideals of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution and for firing people
who were not liberals.
	   ``Through uncalculated and unwise moves, Nouri, instead of
promoting democracy, created tension, anarchy and violence in the
society,'' said Parliament member Mohammad Reza Bahonar, one of the
deputies who initiated the impeachment proceedings.
	   The Parliament session was broadcast live on national radio.

World Cup: Cha fired as head coach 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Cha's comments to journalists; changes DATELINE
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Cha Bum-kun was fired Sunday as South Korea's
national soccer coach after a crushing 5-0 loss to the Netherlands
in the World Cup. The former international star said he was upset
but not embittered by his sudden dismissal.
	   ``I tried my best but the results were poor,'' Cha told Korean
journalists at a hastily called news conference in Paris.
	   Cha said he was ``upset'' about the technical committee's
decision to relieve him but not bitter, according to journalists
who attended.
	   He also thanked the team and said he hoped the player would do
their best and get a win against Belgium in their final first-round
match at this World Cup, the journalists quoted him saying.
	   Cha, 45, said he planned to depart for Seoul on Korean Airlines
flight leaving Paris on Sunday night.
	   He said he would study his stewardship of the team to see what
went wrong. Cha also said that if he ever got another chance to
coach the national team, he would achieve better results,
journalists quoted him saying.
	   Cha, a veteran of South Korea's 1986 World Cup team, spent 10
years in Germany with Bayer Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfort
between 1979 and 1989, winning the UEFA Cup with both teams.
	   The decision to fire Cha came hours after the humilating defeat
in Marseille.
	   Chun Hanjin, the team vice manager, said the team's technical
committee called a meeting Sunday in Paris and decided Cha had to
go.
	   ``Somebody had to take responsibility,'' Chun said.
	   ``It ends right here, right now for him,'' Chun told The
Associated Press by telephone from the team's headquarters in
Saint-Quentin outside Paris.
	   Cha was replaced by the assistant coach, Kim Pyung-seok, Chun
said.
	   Just before the press conference for Korean reporters to
announce his dismissal, Cha talked to the players in private.
	   ``He basically said he was sorry and disappointed that he cannot
spend time and the rest of the tournament with the players any
more. And he said don't take it too hard,'' Chun said.
	   The decision to dismiss Cha was not a surprise in view of the
team's performance at the World Cup, Chun said.
	   South Korea lost 3-1 to Mexico in its first match last week. The
rout by the Netherlands in Marseille left it without hope of
advancing to the second round.
	   South Korea has one more Group E match, against Belgium on
Thursday in Paris.
	   Many soccer commentators blamed coach Cha for mismanaging the
team. Only days before the finals, its key players suffered
injuries, they noted.
	   South Koreans were particularly upset by the lopsided defeat by
the Netherlands because traditional rival Japan was able to limit
Croatia to a single goal in its 1-0 loss Saturday.
	   South Korea and Japan are co-hosts for the 2002 World Cup
finals.
	   This is South Korea's fifth appearance in the World Cup finals,
but the national team has never won a match or advanced to the
second round.
	   With their economy mired in a severe financial crisis that has
forced tens of thousands of people out of work, South Koreans had
hoped their soccer team would provide a sorely needed boost to the
country's national pride.

Security clampdown as English soccer fans fete early also moved on news wires.

<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ The beer bottle slipped off the table
and crashed to the floor Sunday as alcohol flowed in a bar packed
with English fans, some of them veterans of the violence that
trashed downtown Marseille last week.
	   Many with tattoos and close-cropped hair, they insisted they're
not looking for a fight, just another good World Cup match in this
southwestern town Monday between England and Romania.
	   As long as they're not provoked.
	   ``If somebody pokes ya, you poke back,'' said Bob Wells, a
muscle-bound Folkestone construction foreman with tattoos on his
arms and chest. Wells said he did just that in Marseille last week.
	   Local youths from working glass North African immigrant families
pelted him with bottles before the England-Tunisia match last
Monday in violence that left 50 injured and 100 arrested.
	   ``The police were too late,'' Wells complained, echoing reports
in some French media.
	   Despite tightened security with hundreds of riot police, many
locals in Toulouse were nervous that Monday's match _ or the
partying around it _ could bring another riot like the one in
Marseille.
	   Over protests by bar owners, authorities hoping to keep the June
10-July 12 World Cup from again being tainted by violence ordered
bars closed at 11 p.m.
	   Officials made usually festive Toulouse the only city to
postpone France's annual Festival of Music on Sunday, with its
colorful street concerts.
	   ``We're afraid. I don't know when I'll close tonight or
tomorrow. It depends what happens,'' said You Ung, manager of a
Chinese restaurant near the train station. ``We haven't had much
business since Friday. People are afraid.''
	   Instead of a music festival, English chants echoed down
otherwise quiet streets on a hot afternoon.
	   Across from Bar One, English fans laughed, joked and sang loudly
as they sat or stood on a curb with pints of beer in their hands.
	   ``No surrender, no surrender, no surrender to the IRA!,'' sang
one group as another group cheered from down the street.
	   A worried-looking Mohammed Abdel-Loubab, 15, walked by holding a
wooden box of avocados and melons he bought from the bustling
outdoor market.
	   So far, he said, ``they're nice. But you see the English
drinking, and they drink a lot. It could heat up.''
	   Still, Loubab, who plays on a local soccer team, thinks ``The
English deserve to win. They're a good team.''
	   Delphine Bigot, 21, shrugged off any threat of violence.
	   ``OK, I saw a lot of beer cans and paper lying around,'' said
the biology student, but she noted anti-terrorism measures clamped
shut a lot of trash cans.
	   ``It's friendly here. All these people coming from around the
world make it a cosmopolitan city. I feel like I'm on vacation
without traveling,'' she said.
	   Well, a 39-year-old father of two, said the image of English
hooligans wasn't fair and that his country shouldn't be judged by
``a few bad apples.''
	   ``Every time there's a problem, the English get blamed,'' he
said. But he added: ``I'm proud to be English. Saint George is in
my heart. We won't be pushed upon.''

Guinea-Bissau loyalists demand ceasefire before talks ICRC removes 60 civilian bodies, reports of Senegalese troops blocking aid groups. Edits to conform. No pickup. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES to ADD mediation offer from opposition party leader,
By IAN STEWART
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's government on Sunday ruled
out peace talks with renegade forces unless they declare an
immediate ceasefire, as the warring factions waged gunbattles in
the nearly deserted capital.
	   The rebels must also explain their motives for staging a
takeover bid, said Male Sane, Guinea-Bissau's Minister for the
Presidency of the Council of Ministers, quoted by the Portuguese
news agency Lusa.
	   There was no immediate reaction to the demands from the rebels,
who launched a coup attempt from a military garrison in Bissau on
June 7 under the command of former army chief of staff Ansumane
Mane.
	   Candjura Indjai, leader of Guinea-Bissau's main opposition party
Union for Change, meanwhile, offered to mediate talks with
Portugal's ambassador Henriques da Silva and the Catholic bishop of
Bissau, Septimio Ferrazzetta, Lusa reported.
	   It was unclear if the rebels or government forces were in favor
of the proposal.
	   The mutiny has sparked two weeks of fierce fighting in this
former Portuguese colony on Africa's western tip and has drawn in
troops from neighboring Senegal and Republic of Guinea to support
the government.
	   The rebels have called for the ouster of President President
Joao Bernardo Vieira, whom the renegades accused of gross
corruption. Mane, a Gambian-born hero of Guinea-Bissau's war of
independence against Portugal, was fired from the army early this
year for allegedly running guns to Senegalese separatists.
	   Senegalese military officials said Sunday fighting continued
around Bissau's international airport, where the breakaway army
faction dug in after retreating from the military garrison last
week.
	   Reports that the rebels controlled all roads into the seaside
city could not be immediately confirmed.
	   The number of casualties from the fighting remains unclear,
although more than a hundred rotting corpses lay in the streets of
the capital.
	   Officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross said
they recently removed 60 civilian bodies from sections of the
capital held by government forces over the past two weeks,
Portuguese radio RDP-Africa reported.
	   Most of Bissau's 300,000 people have fled and many were
reportedly without food in tiny villages throughout the country. A
relative few had managed to cross the border into Senegal.
	   Senegalese troops were blocking unnamed relief groups trying to
cross into Guinea-Bissau, RDP-Africa said without elaborating. The
report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Attempted talks headed by a Gambian envoy disintegrated last
week as rebels demanded the discussions be led by their hand-picked
mediator, a Senegalese opposition figure.
	   The rebel forces said in a clandestine radio broadcast that
their positions in the town of Ingore on Guinea-Bissau's northern
border with Senegal had been shelled last week by Senegalese
artillery.
	   Specially-trained Portuguese soldiers arrived Saturday in Bissau
to protect the country's embassy, Lusa reported.
	   Portugal's ambassador said he had met with the government, Red
Cross and Catholic aid workers to plan a relief effort for the tens
of thousands of refugees left without food.
	   Although most foreigners left by sea, the ambassadors of France,
Brazil, Cuba and Senegal were still in Bissau, the Portuguese
ambassador said.
	   Food and water shortages have been reported in Bissau and
elsewhere. All telephone communication with the West African
country had been cut by Saturday.

Cabinet approves plan to extend Jerusalem authority to settlements authorized establishment of committee to work on plan

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Over American protests, Israel's Cabinet
unanimously approved a plan Sunday that would extend Jerusalem
municipal authority over nearby Jewish settlements in the West
Bank.
	   Palestinians charged that Israel was violating the
Israel-Palestinian peace accords by unilaterally expanding
Jerusalem's borders and annexing West Bank land.
	   Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Ziad, whose views reflect
official Palestinian policy on Jerusalem, called the plan ``de
facto annexation'' of the settlements to Israel.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority will do what it can to confront this
challenge,'' he said. ``The people must stand up to defend
Jerusalem.''
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected those charges,
accusing the Palestinians of creating an ``artificial storm'' for
political gain.
	   ``This is an important decision aimed at strengthening
Jerusalem,'' he said in a news conference. ``We are not changing
the status of any one of these communities or of Jerusalem. ...
There is no violation of the Oslo accords.''
	   Netanyahu claimed that the Palestinians were the ones violating
the peace accords by trying to establish authority in Jerusalem.
	   The United States called the plan ``provocative,'' coming at a
delicate point when U.S. officials are trying to shepherd the two
sides to reluctant agreement on an Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Netanyahu in
a telephone call to have the Cabinet reconsider.
	   The plan does not annex the West Bank settlements in question,
which surround Jerusalem to the north, south and east _ they will
continue to pay local property taxes and vote in their own
jurisdictions, Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said.
	   But it sets up an ``umbrella authority'' _ putting the
settlements under Jerusalem municipal authority for certain
services, notably building and planning. Settlements normally have
to get approval from the defense ministry for any construction.
	   ``It's the first time that regional powers concerning a region
of the West Bank will be vested in a civilian Israeli organ,''
lawyer and peace activist Danny Seidemann said.
	   The United States has called for a ``time-out'' on any expansion
of Jewish settlements in an effort to help re-start the stalled
peace talks.
	   Palestinian officials said Israel was pre-empting negotiations
on a final peace agreement, which is supposed to address the status
of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, and final borders. The
Palestinians hope to establish an independent state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel occupied in 1967, with east
Jerusalem as its capital.
	   ``They are dictating the outcome of the permanent status
talks,'' said Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the Palestinian Council.
	   ``This is the most dangerous step taken by the Israeli
government. They are firing the bullet that will put the peace
process out of its misery.''
	   The Palestinian Authority has filed a formal complaint with the
United Nations Security Council.
	   The plan, which was approved after a five-hour debate Sunday in
the Israeli Cabinet, would also extend Jerusalem's boundaries
westward into Israel proper, annexing several suburbs in order to
expand the city's economic base and help ensure its Jewish
majority. The Cabinet authorized the establishment of a committee
that will work finding ways to implement the plan.
	   Hundreds of Israelis demonstrated against the plan on Sunday
morning, protesting that the annexation of their suburbs would lead
to higher taxes.
	   Israeli newspapers published maps Sunday that showed the
``umbrella authority'' as encompassing eight West Bank settlements
in the Jerusalem vicinity. But Netanyahu said later that it had not
been decided which settlements would be included in the plan.
	   Bar-Illan said the plan was intended to streamline and improve
municipal services and attract new investment and industry to
Jerusalem. It ``has absolutely nothing to do with the status of
these areas,'' he said.
	   The settlements around to Jerusalem are widely expected to be
annexed by Israel in any final peace settlement.
	   But the Israel-Palestinian interim accords call on the two sides
to refrain from unilateral measures that ``change the status of the
West Bank and the Gaza Strip pending the outcome of the permanent
status negotiations.''
	   Those negotiations, which are supposed to be completed by next
May, have not yet begun.
	   Israel has charged that the Palestinians are violating that
section of the accords by trying to upgrade their observer status
at the United Nations.

Iran's interior minister impeached but Khatami carries on fight 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: COMBINES urgent series; minor editing; raises context grafs
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Just over an hour after Iran's hardline
Parliament impeached his moderate interior minister, President
Mohammad Khatami countered by naming his ally deputy president.
	   ``Due to you capabilities, I appoint you as the deputy president
for development and social affairs.'' Khatami said in his one-line
statement to Abdollah Nouri.
	   Khatami also appointed the deputy interior minister for social
affairs, Mostafa Tajzadeh, as acting interior minister, state-run
television reported _ significant, because Tajzadeh is a staunch
loyalist of both Khatami and Nouri.
	   One of the main reasons cited in the impeachment motion by the
hard-liners was Tajzadeh's appointment by Nouri as his deputy
minister.
	   Khatami's landslide victory in May 1997 shook the foundations of
Iran's clerical rule and was considered a triumph for civil
liberties in this Islamic republic.
	   But Khatami's time in office has been rife with struggle against
hard-line opponents who accuse him of betraying the 1979 Islamic
revolution led by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   Ali Khamenei, who succeeded Khomeini, remains Iran's powerful
spiritual leader.
	   Earlier Sunday, hoping to deal a body blow to Khatami's moderate
policies, 137 members in the 270-member Majlis, or Parliament,
voted to impeach Nouri. A total of 128 supported Nouri and there
were three abstentions.
	   Nouri was not present when the results were announced after the
secret ballot.
	   The impeachment required Nouri to resign, but the unfolding
developments an hour later showed that the clash between
hard-liners and moderates was not over.
	   There were no immediate comments from either side.
	   Nouri was accused of jeopardizing the Islamic nation's stability
and appeared in Parliament Sunday to respond to questions by 31
hard-line deputies demanding his impeachment.
	   Among other things, the impeachment accused Nouri of allowing a
rally last month to protest the influence of the hard-line clergy
in Iran.
	   The conservative members of Iran's ruling clergy have been
waging a campaign to discredit officials loyal to Khatami, who took
power last August.
	   The motion accused Nouri, a clergyman, of ``creating tension in
the society, making provocative interviews and speeches in
different provinces and appointing inexperienced people to
managerial posts at the ministry.''
	   Nouri defended all his appointments, including that of his
deputy, Tajzadeh, and said there was a plot to divide the new
generation of leaders and the clergy.
	   ``I do not claim that I have never made a mistake. However, you
should realize there is a plot afoot to separate the young, bright
university generation from the revolution and the clergy,'' he told
a packed parliament hall.
	   Nouri was also criticized for being quoted on Israeli radio. But
Nouri countered that he was not responsible for where his comments
appeared.
	   ``I've given dozens of press conferences and interviews and some
parliament members go looking for a couple of words here and there
... to use against me. That's not fair,'' he said.
	   Several hard-line deputies claimed drug-smuggling, kidnappings
and violence had increased since Nouri assumed power. They also
accused Nouri of hiring people who were not entirely committed to
the ideals of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution and for firing people
who were not liberals.
	   ``Through uncalculated and unwise moves, Nouri, instead of
promoting democracy, created tension, anarchy and violence in the
society,'' said Mohammad Reza Bahonar, one of the deputies who
initiated the impeachment proceedings.
	   The Parliament session was broadcast live on national radio.

World Cup: high stakes for Tunisia and Columbia in Group G match 
</HEADLINE>
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ With both Tunisia and Columbia
holding slim hopes of qualifying for the second round, their World
Cup match Monday could be a face-saving venture for underdog
Tunisia. But for Columbia, it could be lifesaving.
	   Tunisia approached its first appearance in the World Cup with
humble ambitions. Not expecting to reach the round of 16, the
team's Polish coach Henri Kasperczak dubbed the tournament just
``another ball game.''
	   But for Columbia, which lost 1-0 to Group G rivals Romania,
coach Hernan Gomez's statement earlier that the team is ``still
quite alive'' could refer to more than the team's chances of making
it to the next round.
	   Both Gomez and star striker Faustino Aspirilla _ who was kicked
off the squad for publicly criticizing Gomez after the Romania
match _ received telephone threats warning against a poor
performance in soccer's premier competition. They are threats to be
taken seriously because talented defender Andres Escobar was killed
after Colombia was ousted from the 1994 World Cup. It was Escobar's
own-goal that eliminated the team.
	   Despite criticism over the team's performance in the match
against Romania, Gomez says the team has already weathered the
worst and is ready to face Tunisia.
	   ``If the team works well together and plays with the same
attitude it showed in Friday's practice, it will beat Tunisia,''
Gomez said.
	   Colombia hopes to take advantage of a special edge. Captain
Carlos Valderrama is well liked in Montpellier, having played for
the local team of the French league from 1988 to 1991.
	   The match in Montpellier also has a special meaning for
Valderrama: Tunisia's head coach, Henry Kasperczak, was his coach
in Montpellier in the 1990-1991 season.
	   ``Kasperczak made me a confident player and even named me team
captain,'' said Valderrama.
	   For Tunisia, the match has less ominous underpinnings.
	   After a period of despondency over the team's disappointing, yet
not surprising 2-0 loss to England, the squad is ready for
Columbia. Assistant coach Ali el-Selmi says the match could be
``the last chance.''
	   If Tunisia emerges victorious, it would remain in the running
when it faces Romania on June 26. This is the best the team can
realistically hope for.
	   ``We are confident of our skills, our abilities,'' el-Selmi told
The Associated Press. ``But we've got to take the offensive early
on and keep the ball in their side of the field.''
	   ``In all honesty, this is probably our last chance. We have to
concentrate,'' he said.
	   Tunisia has maintained all along that it can defeat Columbia.
Key in turning this bold statement to fact will be three
foreign-based players: striker Adel Selmi of Spain's Jaen and the
Freiburg duo of Zoubeir Beya and Mehdi Ben Slimane. These three,
along with Brazilian Jose Clayton, are expected to provide
much-needed international experience to a relatively young and
inexperienced team.
	   Not that they were able to do much against England.
	   ``We were shaken by England's ability to reverse the course of
the match and keep the pressure on our goal,'' el-Selmi said.
	   It's a weakness the team is determined not to show again.
El-Selmi said that they have been studying not only the match
against England, but also that of Romania and Columbia.
	   Intending to play ``an open match'' against Columbia, Tunisia
hopes to exploit what el-Selmi says is ``Columbia's habit of being
slow to return to the defense, thereby leaving a wide-open space
for us.''
	   Columbia is unlikely to be that easy to beat, especially with so
much hanging on the team's performance.
	   ``We've forgotten our troubles and now we're thinking about only
Tunisia,'' Columbian midfielder Carlos Valderrama said. ``We're in
the hunt.''
	   Of this, Tunisia is well aware.
	   ``It won't be an easy match. They're a tough team, skilled,
seasoned,'' said el-Selmi. ``God willing, however, we'll come out
ahead.''

<TEXT>
	   INGOLSTADT, Germany (AP) _ It is one of the best-known images
from the Cold War: an East German soldier leaping to freedom over
the early, barbed-wire Berlin Wall that he should have been
guarding.
	   Thirty-seven years after his famous flight to the west, the
former soldier, Conrad Schumann, has committed suicide. His wife
discovered his body Saturday hanging from a tree near their home in
Kipfenberg, a village outside the southern town of Ingolstadt.
	   He was 56. The motive for his suicide was not known.
	   Schumann fled East Berlin on Aug. 15, 1961, two days after East
German leaders ordered construction of the Berlin Wall. He was the
first East German soldier or official to flee.
	   The famous photograph captures the 19-year-old soldier from the
front, just as he clears the tangle of barbed wire. He wears a
helmet and knee-high boots, and holds his rifle in his right hand.
	   ``I will never forget these minutes,'' he said of his escape
during a television interview in November 1989, just after the
Berlin Wall was torn down.

Two promiment Chechens killed during confrontation 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Two prominent Chechen leaders died Sunday
during a confrontation with each other in the capital of the
breakaway Russian republic, authorities said.
	   The men were identified as Lecha Khultygov, chief of the Chechen
National Security Service, and Vakha Dzhafarov, chief of staff of a
guerrilla army led by rebel leader Salman Raduyev.
	   Circumstances of the deaths were murky, but authorities said the
two men had confronted each other at a rally of Raduyev forces
outside the television center in Grozny, the Chechen capital.
	   The two were apparently discussing the demonstration when they
were killed.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov was expected to make a
television address on the deaths later Sunday evening.

Eds: NEW throughout with Germany-Yugoslavia, other developments
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Two of the Europe's best teams, Germany and
Yugoslavia, put on a thrilling show Sunday at World Cup, with the
Germans rallying from 2-0 down in the second half to salvage a 2-2
draw.
	   In developments away from the field, South Korea became the
second team in as many days to fire its coach, neo-Nazis clashed
with police before the Germany-Yugoslavia game, and dissident
Iranians protested ahead of Iran's politically charged match
against the United States.
	   At Lens, Oliver Bierhoff's header in the 80th minute followed
Michael Tarnat's deflected free-kick goal in the 74th to keep
Germany in first place in Group F on goal differential. Dejan
Stankovic and Dragan Stojkovic netted for the Yugoslavs.
	   ``We made possible what seemed impossible,'' German coach Berti
Vogts said. ``We turned defeat into a near victory. ... They wanted
to toy with us instead of trying to score a third goal, and they
got punished for that.''
	   Tarnat's goal, a left-footed free kick from 25 meters, was
directed into the net by the outstretched right boot of Yugoslav
defender Sinisa Mihajlovic. Mihajlovic was originally cited for an
own goal, but the official scorers later gave the credit to Tarnat.
	   ``I am sad and happy,'' Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac said.
``I am happy with the outcome, but I am sad that we let the victory
slip away.''
	   Before the game, at least 25 German fans were detained after
clashes with French riot police. More than 20 neo-Nazi skinheads
were detained in the most serious incident.
	   Later Sunday, two teams with exuberant supporters, Argentina and
Jamaica, played at Parc des Princes in Paris, but nothing could
match the unusual atmosphere surrounding the U.S.-Iran match in
Lyon.
	   Iranians partied on the streets before the game, while
dissidents charged that thousands more who wanted to come were
turned away at the border by French authorities giving in to
pressure from Tehran.
	   The French Interior Ministry confirmed that a number of
dissident Iranians had been denied entry as security threats Sunday
morning while trying to enter by road from Belgium.
	   That didn't sit well with local Iranian resistance leaders, who
also accused the French of allowing Tehran government secret police
to scour the crowd for exiles they consider to be enemies.
	   ``Is this the claim that `football is not political?' ''
Mohammad Mohadessin, head of the foreign relations committee of the
Mujahedeen Khalq, told reporters in Lyon. ``It seems, that so long
as football serves the interest of the murderous mullahs in Iran,
it can be political.''
	   On the field, Iran was seeking Asia's first victory in eight
games at this World Cup. The continent that is hosting the 2002
tournament is having a tough time, with its four representatives
going a collective 0-7 with two teams eliminated and two coaches
fired.
	   Saudi Arabia, France 98's first team to be knocked out of
second-round contention, fired Carlos Alberto Parreira on Saturday.
On Sunday, one day after a 5-0 loss to the Netherlands, the Koreans
dismissed Cha Bum-kun.
	   ``Somebody had to take responsibility,'' Chun Hanjin, the team
vice-manager said. ``It ends right here, right now for him.''
	   South Korea, co-host of the 2002 World Cup with Japan, has never
won a World Cup game in five appearance in the tournament. It lost
its opener 3-1 to Mexico before the humiliating defeat to the
Netherlands.
	   All of this happened on Fair Play Day, set aside by FIFA to
underline sportsmanship in the globe's most popular game.
	   To mark the occasion, joint group photographs _ instead of one
per team _ were taken before Sunday's three matches.
	   ``The impact of this visual image will be quite substantial,
especially for the U.S.A.-Iran game,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper
said.

Germany mourns victims of high-speed train disaster Eschede 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES penultimate graf with details from Herzog's speech in
AP Photos
By CLAUS-PETER TIEMANN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CELLE, Germany (AP) _ One hundred candles flickered at the altar
_ one for each victim _ as President Roman Herzog led a memorial
service Sunday for those killed in the high-speed train crash that
was Germany's deadliest postwar rail disaster.
	   About 700 mourners packed the main church in Celle, a northern
town near the village of Eschede where InterCity Express train 884
derailed on June and crashed into the concrete supports of an
overpass.
	   ``More than two weeks have passed since the accident, but the
shock is even deeper and the pain even stronger,'' Herzog told
mourners who included 230 relatives of the dead.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his cabinet ministers attended the
service, as did Gerhard Schroeder, Kohl's challenger in national
elections Sept. 27 and the governor of Lower Saxony state, where
the accident happened.
	   The crash injured dozens of passengers _ 73 crash victims were
still hospitalized Sunday _ and deeply shook a society that has
prided itself on the safety and speed of its high-speed trains.
	   Inaugurated in 1991, the InterCity Express network had been
running at top speeds of 175 mph for seven years without major
technical failures. Now, German rail officials are investigating
how a wheel could have broken and caused the train to derail.
	   All of Germany was devastated by the accident, Herzog said.
Technology makes our lives easier, he said, but accidents like the
one in Eschede remind us that we can never overcome our mortality.
	   Roman Catholic Bishop Josef Homeyer echoed that sentiment in his
address to the mourners, saying: ``We turn around and suddenly, in
the middle of the accelerated tempo of life, were are reminded of
our humanity _ reminded of the vulnerable human being and his
fragile hopes.''
	   Right before the service started at 11 a.m., between 2,000 and
3,000 trains of Deutsche Bahn, the Germany rail company, blew their
whistles. Loudspeakers in trains and stations asked travelers to
observe a minute of silence. Flags nationwide flew at half staff.
	   The memorial service was broadcast on local television. In
Eschede, 20 kilometers (13 miles) north of Celle, about 300
mourners watched the service on screens set up in a tent in the
center of the village.
	   After the memorial, Herzog visited the crash site and addressed
a crowd of 500 people gathered behind the town hall. He thanked
Eschede residents and rescuers who worked round the clock to aid
the injured and recover the dead.
	   ``It is not true that our country has only selfish people,'' the
president said. ``Your town has set an example for all of
Germany.''

World Cup: Americans, Iranians party together ahead of politically charged match With Sports-Soccer-US-Iran AP Special Correspondent 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Iranians and Americans in full party mode
tied together the tips of their national flags Sunday and danced
the linked colors through the streets of Lyon. Then they headed for
a World Cup soccer showdown, each wishing the other good luck.
	   Amazed Americans beamed to hear their supposed foes chant,
``USA,'' and not add, ``Down With,'' in front of it.
	   ``We've never really stopped being friends, whatever the
governments did,'' said Afsaneh, a London architect who withheld
her last name for fear of reprisals to her family. She held aloft a
huge heart, with Iran and U.S. sharing equal space.
	   Amir Hosseinzadeh, a young Sweden-based exile who studies
medicine in Hungary and dreams of returning to a more liberal Iran,
laughed easily about what national leaders labeled as a game of
political significance.
	   ``I hope the game improves relations between our countries,'' he
said, ``for business and chicks.''
	   Politics were just below the surface. Many Iranians said they
had come to Lyon not for football but to draw attention to
repression and economic suffering in the Islamic republic.
	   Leaders of the dissident Mujahadeen Khalq accused France of
keeping Iranians out while allowing in secret agents from Tehran to
scan the crowd for people they wanted to punish.
	   French officials confirmed they turned back hundreds of Iranians
at the border. Bearded men, identified by exiles as Iranian
revolutionary guards, filmed faces among the revelry.
	   But on a sunny Sunday afternoon, it was party time. A few French
municipal police watched with indulgence as cheering Iranians
spilled out of convertibles on the Place Bellecour. Riot police,
standing by in case, stayed well out of sight.
	   A few Iranian women wore black head dress to cover their hair.
But others with slashes of red and green on bare shoulders wore
skimpy clothes that pushed the lower limits of modesty, even for
France.
	   Ali Ravenshad, a London propery developer, wore an Iranian flag
as a sarong. Across the back of his Iranian soccer jersey _
numbered 69 _ was emblazoned the word, ``Viagra,'' where a player's
name ought to be.
	   Perhaps 30,000 Iranians living in Europe, North America, Asia
and Australia came to the game, far outnumbering those coming from
Iran. But almost all insisted that a different place of residence
diluted their claim to a beloved identity.
	   ``I went to school in Berkeley, I work in London, but I worship
Iran,'' Afsaneh said. ``Of course, I'd like to go back, but that is
not possible. For now.''
	   Too many foreigners confused Iran's conservative Islamic leaders
with a 7,000-year-old civilization with much wider dimensions, she
added. ``I'm not covered from head to toe.''
	   Hatif Abedi Jam, 15, left Iran for Germany when he was 2, and he
wants to go back. ``I can't go now, but maybe things will change.''
He was painted and clothed in bright Iran colors, but a small U.S.
flag flew from his hat.
	   Americans were far fewer but some were just as exuberant.
	   Andy Romhanyi, 33, a warehouse manager from Phoenix, Arizona,
painted his face as Old Glory and wore a U.S. flag as a scarf over
a flamboyant red, white and blue outfit. His friend, Nicky Carter,
wore a sequined vest and elaborate hat in American colors.
	   ``We don't give a stuff about politics,'' Romhanyi said. He
wanted a win so the U.S. team would advance to the next World Cup
round. ``It would be a huge, huge shame if we lost, but not because
it is Iran.''
	   He heaved a large arm around two Iranian fans and posed for
photographs.
	   Mostly, Americans stayed to themselves and talked soccer
strategy. Rob Ramsay, 27, an Atlanta, Georgia, accountant, plays
the game and is dead serious about it.
	   ``Most of our players are about my age, and they don't know
about the politics,'' he said. ``They say, like, 'Great Satan
what?' But it's got to be in your head if your government is all
over you about it. There's no point is putting this on them.''
	   Like many Americans, he was surprised to see an Iranian crowd
that was so far the standard stereotypes. As a result, the game
might end up being about more than soccer.
	   ``One guy came up to me and said in clumsy English that he was

all has some effect. Everything starts somewhere, so it might as
well start here.''

Australians win second regatta; Germany still leads overall 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS (AP) _ Australia, absent from the first World Cup
rowing regatta three weeks ago, won the second Sunday as Aussies
took the men's coxless four and finished with five second places.
	   Australia had 43 points to 35 each for Germany and Britain.
	   The third and final regatta in the World Cup series takes place
July 10-12 in Lucerne, Switzerland.
	   Germany won the men's coxless pair and lightweight women's
double sculls. Britain won the women's coxless pair and took two
second places.
	   In the individual events, Xeno Mueller of Switzerland destroyed
the field to win the men's single sculls.
	   The 1996 Olympic champion, competing in his first regatta after
a year off studying in the United States, moved smoothly into the
lead at the halfway mark and then won by more than a length in
front of Egypt's Ali Ibrahim Ali.
	   The Egyptian still held first place in the overall World Cup
rankings after taking third place in Munich three weeks ago.
	   Equally impressive was Russia's Irina Fedotova in the women's
single. She won in Munich and again won easily here to head the
overall standings in her first season in the event.
	   After two of three regattas, Germany tops the overall standings
with 87 points, just five points ahead of Britain. Denmark is third
with 63.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Two brothers tearfully embraced Sunday _
the younger deported to his native Eritrea from his Ethiopian home,
the older who feared the sibling he raised would become another
victim of the countries' border conflict.
	   ``I was afraid they would kill him on the way,'' said
67-year-old Berhe Gebremicael, blotting his eyes.
	   His brother, Tekle, 50, was one of 720 people of Eritrean
descent deported by Ethiopia in a dispute between one-time allies.
Many had Ethiopian citizenship.
	   Ethiopia forced another 300 Eritreans across the border Saturday
at Om Hajer, in the country's southwest, and loaded 1,500 Eritreans
aboard northbound buses for deportation, presidential adviser
Yemane Gebreab said Saturday.
	   Diplomatic efforts have failed to resolve the 6-week dispute
that has spread to three fronts, and jeopardizes the stability of
the Horn of Africa. Fighting, which has claimed hundreds of lives,
has ebbed since June 11.
	   In Addis Ababa, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said his
country was committed to trying to solve the conflict peacefully,
while preparing for war.
	   ``We are working on the basis that if war breaks out, we will
win in a way that will make Eritreans stop their adventures,''
Meles said in comments published Sunday in Al-Ahram, Egypt's
leading newspaper.
	   In a show of national defiance against a threat to their
territory, more than 100,000 Eritreans welcomed the deportees
Saturday by waving eucalyptus branches and tossing popcorn.
	   They were taken to Asmara University's dormitories, largely
empty because students are on summer holidays or at the front.
Student volunteers were helping to keep order, and women provided
vats of spicy stew to be mopped up with a traditional, tangy bread.
	   Ethiopia has said the deportees posed security risks because
they had military training or were raising funds for the Eritrean
war effort. The contention was denied by many of the deportees,
though several acknowledged being part of the Eritrean Community,
which has sent money to the Eritrean government.
	   Behre, like most Eritreans, is bewildered by the expulsions.
``The Ethiopians are sending our brothers away, while we have done
nothing to their brothers here,'' he said.
	   Ethiopia has accused Eritrea of expelling thousands of its
citizens, a charged denied by Eritrea and unsubstantiated by
independent observers.
	   Behre, a retired court clerk, raised his younger brother after
their father was killed in a 30-year war for freedom from Ethiopia.
Eritreans voted overwhelmingly for independence in a 1993
referendum backed by Meles, whom they helped to oust Ethiopia's
Marxist dictatorship in 1991.
	   ``We thought our relationship was bonded with blood and bones,''
Behre said.
	   Tekle, a contractor with Ethiopian citizenship, left behind his
home for 36 years, his wife and five children. He fears his car and
bank account may be stolen. ``The Ethiopian people are very
friendly. I'm only angry with their government,'' he said.

	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Strikes caused major delays for air
travelers across the country Sunday, while travelers prepared to
face a new round of train strikes beginning Monday.
	   Civil Aviation engineers staged a 48-hour strike scheduled to
end at midnight Sunday, forcing delays of up to six hours.
	   The engineers are demanding back pay and threatened to strike
again during the peak tourist season in August.
	   Olympic Airways, also saddled with a work-to-rule by flight
attendants, canceled 10 domestic and international flights over the
weekend.
	   In a separate action, the union of rail workers will hold
eight-hour work stoppages Monday and Tuesday, and a 24-hour strike
Wednesday. Employees are protesting plans to downsize the state
railroad.

RESENDING to CORRECT spelling of Colombia throughout World Cup: high stakes for Tunisia and Colombia in Group G match 
</HEADLINE>
By TAREK EL-TABLAWY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONTPELLIER, France (AP) _ With both Tunisia and Colombia
holding slim hopes of qualifying for the second round, their World
Cup match Monday could be a face-saving venture for underdog
Tunisia. But for Colombia, it could be lifesaving.
	   Tunisia approached its first appearance in the World Cup with
humble ambitions. Not expecting to reach the round of 16, the
team's Polish coach Henri Kasperczak dubbed the tournament just
``another ball game.''
	   But for Colombia, which lost 1-0 to Group G rivals Romania,
coach Hernan Gomez's statement earlier that the team is ``still
quite alive'' could refer to more than the team's chances of making
it to the next round.
	   Both Gomez and star striker Faustino Aspirilla _ who was kicked
off the squad for publicly criticizing Gomez after the Romania
match _ received telephone threats warning against a poor
performance in soccer's premier competition. They are threats to be
taken seriously because talented defender Andres Escobar was killed
after Colombia was ousted from the 1994 World Cup. It was Escobar's
own-goal that eliminated the team.
	   Despite criticism over the team's performance in the match
against Romania, Gomez says the team has already weathered the
worst and is ready to face Tunisia.
	   ``If the team works well together and plays with the same
attitude it showed in Friday's practice, it will beat Tunisia,''
Gomez said.
	   Colombia hopes to take advantage of a special edge. Captain
Carlos Valderrama is well liked in Montpellier, having played for
the local team of the French league from 1988 to 1991.
	   The match in Montpellier also has a special meaning for
Valderrama: Tunisia's head coach, Henry Kasperczak, was his coach
in Montpellier in the 1990-1991 season.
	   ``Kasperczak made me a confident player and even named me team
captain,'' said Valderrama.
	   For Tunisia, the match has less ominous underpinnings.
	   After a period of despondency over the team's disappointing, yet
not surprising 2-0 loss to England, the squad is ready for
Colombia. Assistant coach Ali el-Selmi says the match could be
``the last chance.''
	   If Tunisia emerges victorious, it would remain in the running
when it faces Romania on June 26. This is the best the team can
realistically hope for.
	   ``We are confident of our skills, our abilities,'' el-Selmi told
The Associated Press. ``But we've got to take the offensive early
on and keep the ball in their side of the field.''
	   ``In all honesty, this is probably our last chance. We have to
concentrate,'' he said.
	   Tunisia has maintained all along that it can defeat Colombia.
Key in turning this bold statement to fact will be three
foreign-based players: striker Adel Selmi of Spain's Jaen and the
Freiburg duo of Zoubeir Beya and Mehdi Ben Slimane. These three,
along with Brazilian Jose Clayton, are expected to provide
much-needed international experience to a relatively young and
inexperienced team.
	   Not that they were able to do much against England.
	   ``We were shaken by England's ability to reverse the course of
the match and keep the pressure on our goal,'' el-Selmi said.
	   It's a weakness the team is determined not to show again.
El-Selmi said that they have been studying not only the match
against England, but also that of Romania and Colombia.
	   Intending to play ``an open match'' against Colombia, Tunisia
hopes to exploit what el-Selmi says is ``Colombia's habit of being
slow to return to the defense, thereby leaving a wide-open space
for us.''
	   Colombia is unlikely to be that easy to beat, especially with so
much hanging on the team's performance.
	   ``We've forgotten our troubles and now we're thinking about only
Tunisia,'' Colombian midfielder Carlos Valderrama said. ``We're in
the hunt.''
	   Of this, Tunisia is well aware.
	   ``It won't be an easy match. They're a tough team, skilled,
seasoned,'' said el-Selmi. ``God willing, however, we'll come out
ahead.''

Three injured as demonstrators clash with police in Yemen 
</HEADLINE>
By AHMED AL-HAJ
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Police in Yemen's capital on Sunday fired
bullets at rock throwing demonstrators protesting against a 40
percent hike in fuel prices, injuring at least two students,
security officials said.
	   Protesters clashed with police in the southern city of Draa also
where a 15-year-old boy was injured, the officials said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
	   Hundreds of troops were deployed around San`a University in the
capital San'a after the clashes, which occurred for the third
straight day following the hikes in gasoline, kerosene and cooking
gas prices on Friday.
	   It was not clear how serious were the injuries suffered by the
demonstrators.
	   On Saturday also riot police and soldiers fired guns in the air
and tear gas to scare off the protesters, but there were no
casualties.
	   Most shops remained closed in San`a Sunday.
	   The hikes in fuel prices were in line with requirements of the
International Monetary Fund to remove subsidies on petroleum
products and other commodities like flour and sugar by the end of
1998.
	   The state-run Yemen Oil Company raised the prices from Friday.
One gallon (3.8 liters) of gasoline now costs 133 riyals (dlrs 1),
up from 95 riyals (69 cents) and 1 gallon (3.8 liters) of kerosene
sells for 57 riyals (41.8 cents), up from 42 riyals (30 cents).
	   Cooking gas bottles cost 200 riyals (dlrs 1.5), up from 150
riyals (dlrs 1.1), the company said.
	   The new hikes follow a decision by the government to raise the
price of petroleum products by 25 percent in July 1997.
	   The monthly salaries of civil servants range between 1,880
riyals (dlrs 142) and 26,500 riyals (dlrs 200), and most people
earn far lesser than that.
	   The increase in oil prices was scheduled for January, but was
never carried out because of conflicts over political and economic
policies between former Prime Minister Faraj Bin Ghanem and
President Ali Abdullah Saleh, the real power in this poor country.
	   Bin Ghanem, who spent less than one year in office, was replaced
by Abdel-Karim al-Iryani in May.
	   The government has already cut other subsidies and stepped up
privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the reforms.
	   To help Yemen recover from the effects of the 1994 civil war,
the World Bank has approved a dlrs 80 million credit to support its
economic reform program.
	   Yemen produces 380,000 barrels of oil a day, earning 31 billion
riyals (dlrs 235 million) a year from exports.

Eds: UPDATES with comments from president, disgruntled voter,
By COMBIETE COMBEY
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Voters in the West African country of Togo
went to the polls Sunday for the first round of presidential
elections expected to be dominated by former dictator President
Gnassigbe Eyadema.
	   Opposition party leaders complained that officials at a few
stations had prevented party observers from entering and voters at
opposition strongholds were kept waiting without ballots for long
periods of time.
	   Electoral officials had no irregularities to report after voting
began at 6:30 a.m. (0630 GMT).
	   Under rules governing the elections, polling is to be monitored
by representatives of each of the five opposition candidates vying
to end 31 years of Eyadema's rule in this French-speaking country
wedged between Ghana and Benin.
	   A number of polling stations in sections of the capital Lome
known to be strongholds of opposition candidates still had not
received ballot papers four hours after the elections officially
began, several radio stations reported.
	   Thousands of people waited patiently in long queues at polling
stations. Military troops and police in anti-riot gear stood sentry
outside elections offices and silently patrolled the streets.
	   Few people doubt whether Eyadema will make it past the first
round of voting. If a candidate wins more than 50 percent of the
vote, he automatically becomes president. If not, the two with the
most votes face off in the second round.
	   Most voters refused to talk to journalists, saying they feared
reprisals from soldiers or government officials.
	   Matin Glikpo, a retired tradesman in his 60s who was one of few
willing to speak out, said he was voting to ``get Eyadema out of my
village.''
	   An unemployed 31-year-old man declined to give his name also
said he was voting for change.
	   ``We need something new in our country. We have suffered much in
the past,'' he said.
	   Eyadema, who ruled for 26 years as a military dictator before
winning the country's first presidential elections five years ago,
is accused of gross human rights abuses and unfairly dominating the
state-run media with a massive two-month television and radio
campaign.
	   Opponents were relegated to occasional air time.
	   The president voted in his home village of Pya in northern Togo,
expressing hopes for a calm and transparent elections.
	   ``Let the best man win,'' he added.
	   While exiled opposition leader Gilchrist Olympio is the
best-known contender of the five challengers, he fears for his life
and lives in neighboring Ghana. He is not expected to win the
lion's share of opposition votes.
	   Leopold Gnininvi, a university professor with wide support among
Togo's intellectual class and Yaovi Agboyibo, a lawyer with support
in the country's south, are considered the two with the best chance
to face Eyadema in a head-to-head second round.
	   Agboyibo said opposition observers were not given proper
accreditation in several villages, including the northern town of
Oti, had been denied accreditation to polling stations.
	   International observers from the Organization of African Unity
and the Francophonie _ a loose grouping of the world's
French-speaking countries _ were monitoring voting.
	   Togo's first presidential elections in 1993 were boycotted by
the opposition and condemned by observers.

	   MELUN-SENART, France (AP) _ Saudi players said Sunday they were
``not happy'' with the decision to fire coach Carlos Alberto
Parreira and hoped Parreira could return in the future.
	   Saudi Arabia, which reached the second round in its World Cup
debut in 1994, was eliminated from the 1998 championships after
losing 1-0 to Denmark and 4-0 to France in the first round.
Parreira was fired by the Saudis Saturday for the team's early
exit.
	   ``I was not very happy to hear about Parreira's dismissal,''
said Mohammed al-Kharashi, who took charge of the World Cup squad
after Parreira's sacking.
	   ``Surely we will miss him. He's not only a great coach, but also
a great person. He did his best for the team,'' al-Karashi said in
an interview with The Associated Press.
	   Al-Karashi was a student of Parreira's 12 years ago.
	   Saudi players, some of whom were seen hugging Parreira before he
left the hotel Saturday to get the ``bad news'', also expressed
sadness for his dismissal.
	   Early Sunday, after training without Parreira, Saudi players bid
farewell to the former coach and thanked him for his guidance.
	   ``He meant a lot to me, He was just like a big brother,'' Saudi
forward Sami al-Jaber said.
	   ``He had a big hand in bringing me in the opening lineup and he
paid equal attention to all the players. For sure, we are going to
miss him and I hope he will return as our coach in the future,''
al-Jaber added.
	   Saudi Arabia's key striker, Saeed al-Owairan, substituted twice
by Parreira in the current tournament, also lauded the Brazilian.
	   ``Even though I was not happy about being substituted, I
respected his decision,'' al-Owairan told The AP.
	   ``He's a great coach who knows what to do in a given
situation,'' said the 30-year-old midfielder.
	   Al-Owairan rose to fame after running full-length of the field
to score a goal against Belgium in the 1994 World Cup, which lifted
Saudi Arabia to the second round of that championship.
	   The team later Sunday headed for Bordeaux, south of Paris, to
prepare for its last match against South Africa.
	   ``We are eliminated from the championship, so we don't have all
that pressure on us,'' said al-Karashi, a Saudi coach for 18 years.
``However, we hope to give our best for this match.''

World Cup: Cha fired as head coach 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: EDITS throughout

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Cha Bum-kun was fired Sunday as South Korea's
soccer coach after a crushing 5-0 loss to the Netherlands in the
World Cup.
	   The former international star said he was upset, but not
embittered by his sudden dismissal.
	   ``I tried my best, but the results were poor,'' Cha told Korean
journalists at a hastily called news conference in Paris.
	   He also thanked the team and said he hoped the players would do
their best and win against Belgium in their final first-round
match.
	   The decision to fire Cha came hours after the humilating defeat
in Marseille. Chun Hanjin, the team's assistant manager, said the
technical committee called a meeting Sunday in Paris.
	   ``Somebody had to take responsibility,'' Chun told The
Associated Press by telephone from the team's headquarters in
Saint-Quentin outside Paris. ``It ends right here, right now for
him.''
	   Cha was replaced by assistant coach Kim Pyung-seok.
	   South Korea lost 3-1 to Mexico in its first match and the rout
by the Netherlands left it without hope of advancing to the second
round. South Korea has never won a game in five visits to the World
Cup.
	   Just before the news conference to announce his dismissal, Cha
talked to the players in private.
	   ``He basically said he was sorry and disappointed that he cannot
spend time and the rest of the tournament with the players. And he
said don't take it too hard,'' Chun said.
	   Cha, 45, said he planned to return to Seoul on Sunday night, and
would study his term as coach to see what went wrong. Cha also said
if he ever got another chance to coach the national team, he would
achieve better results.
	   Cha, a player for South Korea's 1986 World Cup team, spent 10
years in Germany with Bayer Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfort
between 1979 and 1989, winning the UEFA Cup with both teams.
	   South Korea and Japan are co-hosts for the 2002 World Cup
finals. With their economy mired in a severe financial crisis that
has forced tens of thousands of people out of work, South Koreans
had hoped their soccer team would provide a sorely needed boost to
the country's national pride.

said Sunday.
	   Peter Zollinger, 36, was in good condition despite his long
captivity, the officials said.
	   Zollinger, employed by the Seibert-Stinnes AG construction
company, was kidnapped by an armed commando from an airport
building site in Nazran, in the Ingushetia region that borders
Chechnya.
	   Russian officials said they believed he was taken to Chechnya.
	   The kidnappers reportedly were demanding a ransom of dlrs 1
million.

Fighting for Kosovo roads rages despite calls for peace 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. UPDATES and RECASTS with more fighting reports

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Heavy fighting was reported south
and west of Kosovo's capital Sunday despite the latest
international efforts to calm the conflict in the secessionist
Serbian province.
	   Fierce battles were being waged for control of the two main
roads crossing Kosovo, based on reports from sources affiliated
with both warring sides _ Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
militants.
	   In another sign the situation is deteriorating, Serb and
Albanian villagers were exchanging fire northwest of the capital
Pristina, the Albanians' Kosovo Information Center reported.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year between government forces and guerrillas who enjoy
increasing support among ethnic Albanians, a 90 percent majority in
the province of 2.2 million people.
	   World powers have accused Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
of excessive brutality against pro-independence ethnic Albanians.
Despite threatened NATO intervention, Milosevic has refused to
comply with demands to pull out his forces from the province.
	   Russia, a traditional Serb ally, has promised to try to persuade
Belgrade to ease up on its attacks but says the West must get the
KLA to halt fighting, too.
	   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky flew to the
Yugoslav and Serbian capital Belgrade on Sunday and met with
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic.
	   Another top Russian diplomat, Alexander Avdeyev, went for talks
to Yugoslavia's neighbor Albania, considered a vital source of
support to the ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army, which claims to control
about 40 percent of Kosovo territory, appears to be trying to
secure a corridor along the main east-west road across the
province.
	   Fighting reportedly was raging near that artery Sunday outside
the town of Klina, where some Serb villagers have joined the police
in fighting Albanian militants.
	   Four Albanians were wounded, the Kosovo Information Center said.
A KLA commander was quoted as saying the militants had repelled an
attempt by Serbian forces to take a strategic spot.
	   The Serbs, for their part, accused the Albanians of killing one
18-year-old Serb villager Sunday and of apparently kidnapping at
least five people over the weekend.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center said armed Albanians opened fire early
Sunday against the Serb village of Kijevo along the east-west road.
	   Further west, the Serbs were alleged to be opening grenade fire
on Albanian villages in the contested Decane area, 75 kilometers
(nearly 50 kilometers) west of Pristina.
	   The Albanians' reports of fighting in the sealed-off areas, like
the Serbs', could not be verified.
	   In the south, the ethnic Albanians claimed Serb police and army
forces had opened fire on three villages _ Petestica, Beline and
Caralevo _ sending civilians fleeing to nearby woods.
	   ``It's a veritable state of war,'' ethnic Albanian official Ali
Sadriu said of the situation along the north-south road near
Stimlje, linking the main towns of Pristina and Prizren.
	   The Serbs, trying to reassert control in Kosovo and crush the
independence forces, are estimated to have 45,000 to 50,000 police
and Yugoslav army soldiers in the province.
	   Some 13 buses with police troops reportedly arrived Sunday in
Pec, Kosovo's second-largest town, to reinforce or replace existing
government forces.

Syria urges EU to be more involved in the Mideast peace 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Syria wants the European Union to play a
stronger role in the Middle East peace negotiations, the EU's envoy
to the region, Miguel Moratinos, said Sunday.
	   Emerging from a two-hour meeting with President Hafez Assad,
Moratinos told reporters that Assad is ``satisfied with the
European position, but said Europe should be much more involved.''
	   Assad did not speak with reporters and Moratinos did not
elaborate.
	   Moratinos is in Syria as part of his regular tours to the region
during which he meets with the heads of states to discuss EU's
suggestions for finding peace in the Middle East, which hinge
around Israel's relations with the Palestinians, Syria and Lebanon.
	   Syrian-Israeli talks have been deadlocked for more than a year
now over the Golan Heights, which Israel annexed from Syria in the
1967 Arab-Israeli war.
	   Moratinos is expected to travel to Israel, Lebanon and Egypt. He
said he will return to Syria in July.

Former prime minister to testify in death squad trial 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Former senior government officials,
including a former prime minister, are scheduled to testify this
week in a trial that accuses the government of complicity in a
secret war against Basque separatists.
	   Former Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez is one of dozens of
witnesses due to testify this week during the trial of 12 people on
charges of kidnapping, misappropriating public funds and belonging
to an illegal armed group.
	   The Anti-Terrorist Liberation Groups known as GAL killed 27
suspected members or sympathizers of the armed Basque separatist
group ETA in covert actions from 1983-87 in southern France. Eight
of those killed turned out to have no ties to ETA.
	   Allegations that the government set up and ran the squads have
plagued Gonzalez for years and are considered the chief reason for
his defeat in the 1995 elections that ended nearly 14 years in
office for his Socialist Party.
	   Francisco Alvarez Cascos, the deputy prime minister in the
government that ousted the Socialists is to be questioned Monday
about allegations he offered a former policeman a pardon in 1994 to
implicate Socialist top officials. Cascos has repeatedly accused
Gonzalez of being behind the death squads.
	   Gonzalez has repeatedly denied involvement with the group and
said the trial was rooted in an anti-Socialist conspiracy.
Gonzalez's former interior minister, Jose Barrionuevo, and one of
his top advisers, Rafael Vera, face charges they organized and
directed the death squads.
	   The trial, which began May 25, stems on the kidnapping of Basque
businessman Segundo Marey, who was mistaken for an ETA hitman, in
southern France in 1983.
	   Ricardo Damborenea, a renegade member of the Socialist Party who
is charged in the case, accused Gonzalez of being behind the GAL.
	   ETA has killed nearly 800 people, mostly Spanish security force
members, since beginning its campaign for the independence of the
country's northern Basque provinces in 1968.

Thousands flee Bissau fighting, only trickle find refuge

	   JEGGE, Guinea-Bissau (AP) _ A short column of Senegalese foot
soldiers trudges along a single lane road carved out of the palm
and mango tree forests that divide Senegal from war-wracked
Guinea-Bissau.
	   With assault rifles and grenade launchers slung over shoulders,
the khaki-clad troops ignore the trickle of refugees _ weary from
days of walking under a punishing sun _ that pass them on their way
to Senegal.
	   Caught in an escalating, but barely noticed civil war in an
often forgotten corner of West Africa, tens of thousands of people
have been driven from their homes in the capital Bissau and from
northern border towns.
	   This country's little war has triggered an internal exodus of as
many as 200,000 people _ or a fifth of the entire population _
though barely a few thousand have made it to safety in Senegal.
	   ``Everyone is in a very difficult condition,'' says Pedro Gomes,
a construction worker from Cape Verde who was working in
Guinea-Bissau when the fighting began. ``In the city there is no
water and not enough food.''
	   A coup attempt earlier this month in the capital, Bissau,
followed by Senegalese military intervention has this ragged little
nation of peanut and rice farmers trapped between two conflicts.
	   In the south, Brig. Ansumane Mane's failed coup against
President Joao Bernardo Vieira has escalated into an armed standoff
of street fighting and artillery barrages in the capital.
	   Bissau, a city of about 300,000 in a nation of about 1 million,
is nearly deserted. Downtown blocks are torn by explosions and
scarred by bullet holes after two weeks of artillery shelling and
ground fighting.
	   In the north, Senegal is using the Guinea-Bissau conflict as a
pretext to pound suspected safe havens used by its own separatist
rebels from the Casamance border region.
	   Somewhere in between, in the towns of Mansoa and Bafata, as many
as 200,000 people are trapped with little to live on.
	   Some of the only food reserves from the World Food Program were
commandeered by Vieira last week. The president has promised to
feed the population and not the army with the 2,970 tons of U.N.
supplies.
	   Although recent years had seen a moderate improvement in
Guinea-Bissau's battle with endemic poverty, this former Portuguese
colony has never had much more than a subsistence economy. Now,
with roads cut off, the airport in rebel hands and the capital's
harbor under threat of shelling, food is in short supply.
	   Aid agencies await a chance to haul in supplies to the hungry
and seemingly abandoned.
	   For the few that make it to Senegal, the trip is bad enough and
getting worse.
	   ``There are no more vehicles. it's very bad. Some people are so
tired they can barely walk,'' said Mohammed Abdul Fateh, a Syrian
businessman living in the northern town of Ingore.
	   Wearing a torn pair of jeans and a grubby t-shirt, Fateh managed
to grab only a handful of belongings before fleeing Ingore during a
fierce rocket barrage on the town.
	   As many as a dozen homes were hit and at least five people were
killed during the attack on Thursday, says Cheiko Lo.
	   ``Rockets came down everywhere, destroyed everything they hit,''
he said. ``A rocket landed close to my home and `BOOM!' it burst
into flames.''
	   Plodding along from Ingore to Jegge at the border and onward to
Mpak just inside Senegal, Lo and the others passed through
rebel-pervaded Casamance countryside on roads prone to ambushes and
strewn with land mines.
	   Just across the border from Jegge in the Senegalese border
checkpoint town of Mpak, Senegal's army sealed the frontier last
week while they mounted a fierce military operation against the
Casamance rebels.
	   Those rebels, with reported links to Guinea-Bissau's coup
leader, Mane, have for years been waging a war for independence
from Senegal.
	   The Senegalese Red Cross says it is concerned that civilians
from both Senegal and Guinea-Bissau may be caught in the northern
fighting while they try to escape battles in the south.
	   The United Nations says Guinea-Bissau now poses the potential
for a mass exodus.
	   ``We are concerned that thousands of internally displaced people
could lead to an influx of refugees,'' says United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees spokesman Khassim Diagne.

Participants agree to cease-fire; pledge to resolve conflict through peaceful means

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Participants in the first all-party
peace talks on Burundi agreed Sunday to a cease-fire and to resolve
the country's often bloody conflicts through peaceful means.
	   In a final communique after a week of closed-door meetings,
representatives of 17 participants, including the government of
Maj. Pierre Buyoya and a Hutu rebel group, agreed ``to bring an end
to the constant cycle of violence and fratricidal killings which
have afflicted Burundi for a long time.''
	   The communique said all armed parties agreed the cease-fire
would take effect no later than July 20, and former Tanzanian
president Julius Nyerere would remain as facilitator.
	   The Tutsi-led army and Hutu rebels have been fighting for almost
five years after Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Melchoir Ndadaye,
the country's first democratically elected president, and a Hutu,
in October 1993. At least 200,000 people, most of them civilians,
have died since then.
	   After a 10-month stalemate, Nyerere, who has a mandate from the
Organization of African Unity to mediate the conflict, managed to
get all the parties together.
	   The talks were attended by Burundi's five main political
parties, three rebel groups and civic and religious organizations.
	   Buyoya, a Tutsi and former army major who ousted a civilian
president in a July 1996 coup, said he is determined to enact
reforms aimed at ending the violence.
	   Last week he named a 22-member cabinet, which includes 12 Hutus.
He also named two vice-presidents, one of them a Hutu.
	   Although they make only 14 percent of Burundi's population of 6
million, the Tutsi dominate the government, economy, academia and
the military. Hutus make up all but 1 percent of the remainder.
	   Buyoya hopes the new political arrangement will this time
convince regional leaders to lift sanctions they imposed after he
staged the coup.
	   The final communique made no mention of the sanctions.
	   The parties also agreed to discuss:

genocide and exclusion;
	   _ democracy and good governance;

	   _ rehabilitation and resettlement of refugees and displaced
persons;
	   _ transitional institutions;
	   _ guarantees on implementing the Arusha agreement.

World Cup: Germany grabs 2-2 draw with late comeback 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional lead, recasts
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Never, ever write Germany off.
	   Completely dominated by a technically superior Yugoslavia team
for 70 minutes, the Germans stormed back in the last 20 minutes to
erase a two-goal deficit and clinch a 2-2 draw Sunday.
	   ``We knew they would show their real face today, they play a
very strong technical game and they very especially motivated
against us,'' said German captain Lothar Matthaeus said. ``But our
team showed its morale by coming back.''
	   Matthaeus, 37, made World Cup history by coming on in the second
half and contesting his 22nd World Cup match. In his fifth World
Cup, Matthaeus has more matches than any other players in World Cup
history.
	   ``We can be proud of our team,'' Matthaeus said.
	   The draw gave both teams four points in Group F, with Germany
ahead on goal difference.
	   But Yugoslavia could and should have clinched a place in the
second round, and will be left wondering what went wrong late in
the game.
	   Oliver Bierhoff, always a man for important goals, came through
with a powerful header in the 80th minute off a corner by Olaf Thon
to clinch the draw.
	   Bierhoff scored the ``golden goal'' that gave Germany the
European title in 1996 and now has 18 goals in 28 games for
Germany.
	   ``Every team in the world would be happy with this result,''
Bierhoff said. ``We were outplayed for most of the match but we
managed to turn the result.''
	   Yugoslavia looked on course for three points when Dragan
Stojkovic made the score 2-0 in the 54th. Dejan Stankovic had
opened the scoring for Yugoslavia in the 13th.
	   But Germany benefited from a fortunate deflection goal in the
74th minute and Yugoslavia's sudden collapse. So much under control
until then, the Yugoslavs began showing off their remarkable talent
and forgot about threatening the German goal. The stubborn Germans,
who are looking for their fourth World Cup title, took advantage of
the unexpected gift they were being given.
	   Michael Tarnat, a second-half substitute, fired a powerful
left-footed free kick from 25 meters that struck sweeper Sinisa
Mihajlovic's outstretched right boot to give goalkeeper Ivica Kralj
no chance. The goal was credited to Tarnat, although Yugoslav coach
Slobodan Santrac thought it was an own goal.
	   ``It really shook us up and we gave them the chance to
equalize,'' Santrac said. ``We didn't know how to preserve the
victory.''
	   German coach Berti Vogts said his team had risen from the dead.
	   ``We made possible what seemed impossible,'' Vogts said. ``We
turned defeat into a near victory.''
	   ``They wanted to toy with us instead of trying to score a third
goal and they got punished for that,'' Vogts said.
	   Yugoslavia took charge 13 minutes into the game.
	   Real Madrid striker Predrag Mijatovic, 30 meters from goal,
drove in a left wing cross, and Stankovic got the faintest of
touches as the ball bounced over German goalkeeper Andreas Koepke.
	   Though Mijatovic looked to have scored directly, Stankovic, the
19-year-old midfielder who recently agreed a move from Red Star
Belgrade to Lazio of Rome, was credited with the goal.
	   Yugoslavia doubled its lead three minutes into the second half
courtesy of a blunder from Andreas Koepke, the German goalkeeper.
	   Slavisa Jokanovic made a storming run through the heart of the
German defense, before knocking the ball to Darko Kovacevic.
	   The Real Sociedad forward fired low into the goal mouth and
Koepke fumbled the ball to present Yugoslav captain Dragan
Stojkovic with a simple tap-in from two meters in his 65th
international.
	   Germany finished the match with 10 men after Juergen Klinsmann
was knocked out by a Mihajlovic free kick that struck the German
captain in the chest. He was slow to regain consciousness.
	   ``We squandered a historic chance,'' said Perica Ognjenovic, a
Yugoslav substitute. Yugoslavia has not beaten Germany since 1973.
 &UR; Lineups:
	   Germany _ Andreas Koepke; Christian Woerns, Juergen Kohler, Olaf
Thon; Joerg Heinrich, Andy Moeller (Ulf Kirsten, 51st), Jens
Jeremis, Dietmar Hamann (Lothar Matthaeus, 46th), Christian Ziege
(Michael Tarnat, 62nd); Juergen Klinsmann, Oliver Bierhoff.
	   Yugoslavia _ Ivica Kralj; Sinisa Mihajlovic, Slobodan
Komljenovic, Zeljko Petrovic, Goran Djorovic; Slavisa Jokanovic,
Dragan Stojkovic, Dejan Stankovic (Dejan Govedarica, 65th),
Vladimir Jugovic; Darko Kovacevic (Perica Ognjenovic, 51st),
Predrag Mijatovic.

Kallis bowls South Africa victory; Ramprakash fined 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with result
By IHITHISHAM KAMARDEEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A sensational spell of medium-pace bowling by
Jacques Kallis inspired South Africa to a 10-wicket win over
England in the second cricket test at Lord's Sunday.
	   Kallis, replacing Allan Donald from the pavilion end, took a
career best 4-24 as England crashed after a defiant 116-run stand
between centurian Nasser Hussain and skipper Alec Stewart.
	   England shot out for 110 and forced to follow on, slumped from
222 for three to be bowled out for 264.
	   Openers Gary Kirsten (nine not out) and Daryll Cullinan (five
not out), knocked off the 15 runs needed for victory, taking just
seven balls to do so.
	   Cullinan flicked Dominic Cork to the mid-wicket boundary to seal
victory in South Africa's 50th test on their return to
international cricket.
	   The home side lost 6-11 in 71 balls after the fourth wicket pair
of Hussain and Stewart had thwarted Donald and Shaun Pollock for 14
overs with the second new ball.
	   Kallis, the unlikely bowling hero, triggered the collapse with
Stewart's wicket and went on add Graham Thorpe, Mark Ealham and
Dominic Cork in a 35-ball spell that cost him just three runs.
	   His efforts Sunday improved on his previous best _ 3-29 against
Australia at Port Elizabeth in 1996-97.
	   To add insult to defeat, batsman Mark Ramprakash was fined 25
percent of his match fee (850 pounds/dlrs 1,400) and given a
one-match suspension after being reported by umpire Darrell Hair
for dissent.
	   The suspension is suspended for six months.
	   The International Cricket Council's match referee Javed Burki
found Ramprakash guilty of violating clause three of the ICC Code
of Conduct.
	   Ramprakash looked unhappy as he was given out caught behind by
Australian Hair in England's first innings.
	   ``The dissent was both physical and verbal,'' Burki, a former
Pakistan skipper, said in a statement.
	   Ramprakash is only the fourth England player to appear before
the ICC match referee.
	   The collapse began 45 minutes into the post-lunch session and in
a matter of 42 minutes England had crashed from 222 for three to
233 for nine.
	   The last pair of Robert Croft and Angus Fraser avoided the
embarrassment of an innings defeat as they frustrated the South
Africans, adding 31 runs in 60 minutes.
	   England, resuming the day on 105 for two, lost night watchman
Dean Headley in the second over of the morning.
	   But two dropped catches and some bold batting by Hussain and
Stewart took England to 200 for three at lunch before disaster
struck.
	   It was a deserving seventh test century for Hussain as he
anchored the England innings for a minute over six and a half
hours.
	   He was eventually trapped leg before wicket by Lance Klusener,
who claimed two wickets alongside Kallis to finish with 2-54.
	   Donald, England's destroyer in the first innings with 5-32, went
wicketless in the second innings.
	   It is the first time he has gone wicketless in a completed
innings since March 1997 against Australia in the second innings in
Port Elizabeth.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-line lawmakers impeached Iran's
moderate interior minister Sunday, but President Mohammad Khatami
swiftly countered the blow by naming him to a newly created post of
deputy president.
	   Barely an hour after the impeachment vote, Khatami sent the
hard-liners a clear message that he would not abandon his battle to
ease some of the harsher social restrictions of Iran's 19-year-old
Islamic fundamentalist government.
	   He named his impeached ally, ex-Interior Minister Abdollah
Nouri, to the new job of deputy president for development and
social affairs.
	   ``Due to your capabilities, I appoint you as the deputy
president for development and social affairs.'' Khatami said in his
one-line statement to Abdollah Nouri.

Romanian president heads home to assess flood damage minister 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with details with damage assessment from prime
<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ President Emil Constantinescu cut
short a visit to Austria on Sunday and was headed home to visit
regions badly damaged by flooding after a week of torrential rains.
	   Constantinescu, who was in Salzburg for an upcoming economic
summit of top officials from Central and Eastern Europe, will visit
the stricken regions by helicopter early Monday, the official news
agency Rompres reported.
	   Thousands of people evacuated their flooded homes last week, and
at least one person died when his temporary shelter collapsed. The
Red Cross has appealed for urgent supplies of food and money.
	   Crops throughout a wide area were ruined, and roads, railway
lines and bridges were blocked or made impassable from the
flooding.
	   Prime Minister Radu Vasile, who visited flooded regions near the
Transylvanian city of Sibiu, gave an initial flood damage estimate
of 150 billion lei (dlrs 120,000) for that area. A nationwide
figure was not available.
	   The flooding was worst in Transylvania, in Romania's northwest
and Moldova, in the poor and isolated northeast. The rain stopped
Saturday after eight days.

Spencer says Diana TV program drained him; controversy over proceeds With Britain-Prince William 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Princess Diana's brother, Earl Spencer, noted for
accusing the press of invading his family's privacy, was back in
the news Sunday _ explaining he'd been drained by talking about his
sister for a television program which is provoking controversy even
before airing.
	   Newspapers carried a picture of Diana, aged 9, waving a scarf,
hair wet, and dancing for a home video which is part of the program
``Diana: My Sister the Princess'' to be screened Wednesday by the
British Broadcasting Corp. Spencer took part and helped edit it.
	   ``I was absolutely drained for two days after that,'' he said in
remarks released prescreening. ``It was really sad, really sad to
see this little girl running round and to know what happened to her
when she became older.''
	   The program, which includes a televised tour of the Spencer
family estate, Althorp, was made by a British production company
Planet Wild and has become part of the controversy surrounding a
memorial fund set up after Diana's death in a car crash Aug. 31.
	   London's Sunday Telegraph reported that as part of an
international sales drive, Planet Wild's parent company, Planet 24,
demanded dlrs 2 million from the U.S. network ABC for a repeat
interview with Spencer and filming at Althorp. The network refused,
the newspaper said.
	   Spencer, 34, has ordered that proceeds from the program sales go
direct to Diana's six favorite charities, and not to the memorial
fund whose president is Diana and Spencer's eldest sister, Lady
Sarah McCorquodale. The fund has been accused of tacky fundraising,
including allowing Diana's signature on a margarine tub.
	   Another British weekly, the Sunday Mirror, said Spencer, who is
divorced and lives in South Africa, cheated on his South African
girlfriend around the time of Diana's death.
	   Spencer took his then girlfriend, South African former model
Josie Borain, to Althorp when Diana was buried.
	   Another South African, Alison Yates, was quoted in the newspaper
as saying that at the time he was calling TV producer Bonnie Rodini
in Cape Town, and later dropped her saying ``sexually she didn't do
anything for him.''
	   In protracted divorce proceedings last year, Spencer's wife, the
former Victoria Lockwood, alleged that Spencer had 12 mistresses
during their eight-year marriage.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka posted an emphatic seven
wicket win over New Zealand in their three-nation Independence Cup
cricket tournament match under lights at the Premadasa Stadium in
Colombo on Sunday.
	   The winning target of 201 never looked beyond Sri Lanka whose
opener Sanath Jayasriya and Marvan Atapattu put on 82-run
partnership for the second wicket after Romesh Kaluwitharana fell
hit wicket to paceman Shayne O'Connor for two runs in the first
over.
	   Sri Lanka needed the victory after losing the opening match to
India by eight wickets on Friday.
	   Jayasuriya made 57 in 60 balls with six fours while Atpattu went
on to score an unbeaten 83 to be adjudged man-of-the-match.
Atapattu hit nine fours.
	   Sri Lanka made a spirited fight-back to restrict New Zealand to
200 for 9 in 50 overs after initially conceding 71 runs in the
first 15 overs.
	   New Zealand was comfortably placed at 107 for the loss of just
one wicket, but failed to capitalize in the face of a five-man Sri
Lankan spin attack which accounted for seven of the nine wickets to
fall.
	   The tourists lost eight wickets for just 93 runs as off-cutter
Kumara Dharmasena and leg-spinner Upul Chandana took three wickets
each.
	   New Zealand earlier had a solid start after winning the toss
when openers Bryan Young and Nathan Astle shared a 71-run stand in
14.4 overs.
	   Young batted with authority and stroked the ball with confidence
as he dispatched seven deliveries to the fence while reaching his
half century in only 46 balls.
	   He was caught at deep mid-wicket off Kumara Dharmasena.
	   Except for Stephen Fleming who made 47 in 75 balls before being
run out, the rest of the New Zealand batsmen just caved in without
a fight.

Egypt criticizes Israel's decision to extend Jerusalem With Israel-Palestinians 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Egypt on Sunday criticized an Israeli
decision to extend Jerusalem municipal authority over eight Jewish
settlements in the West Bank, saying it was an ``aggression on the
peace process.''
	   ``The matter has become a new Israeli policy, to make its
occupation firm and (to) torpedo the peace process entirely,''
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters.
	   ``We ask the Israeli government to review this policy that forms
an aggression on the peace process,'' Moussa said.
	   The United States called the plan, which was approved by
Israel's Cabinet earlier Sunday, as ``provocative.''
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin rejected the criticism.
	   The Palestinians hope to establish an independent state in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip with east Jerusalem as its capital.
Netanyahu says Jerusalem will remain the eternal undivided capital
of Israel, which occupied the areas in 1967.
	   Moussa said Israel's decision was ``another provocation to the
Arab world and Islamic and Christian world ... and a clear retreat
by the current Israeli government from the agreements'' reached
with the Palestinians.
	   Jerusalem is holy to Jews, Christians and Muslims.
	   The plan would also extend Jerusalem's boundaries westward into
Israel, annexing several suburbs in order to expand the city's
economic base and to help ensure its Jewish majority.
	   Egypt was the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel in 1979, but relations between the two countries remain
cool.

Baseball's Al Campanis dead at 81 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   FULLERTON, California (AP) _ Al Campanis, the former Los Angeles
Dodgers executive who was fired for his insensitive racial remarks
on national television, died Sunday at his home. He was 81.
	   Campanis died of natural causes at 6:30 a.m. (1330 GMT), Orange
County Supervising Deputy Coroner Rick McAnally said.
	   Campanis was the Dodgers' general manager from 1968-87. Before
that, he was the team's scouting director.
	   He was fired in 1987 shortly after he appeared on ABC's
``Nightline'' and said that blacks ``lacked the necessities'' to be
managers and front-office executives.
	   He was replaced by longtime Dodgers employee Fred Claire.
	   Services were pending.

Cabinet approves plan to extend Jerusalem authority to settlements conference, other quotes, settlements to vote, pay taxes separately 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Over U.S. protests, Israel's Cabinet
unanimously approved a plan Sunday that would extend Jerusalem
municipal authority over nearby Jewish settlements in the West
Bank.
	   Palestinians charged that Israel was violating the
Israel-Palestinian peace accords by unilaterally expanding
Jerusalem's borders and annexing West Bank land.
	   Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Ziad, whose views reflect
official Palestinian policy on Jerusalem, called the plan ``de
facto annexation'' of the settlements to Israel.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected those charges,
accusing the Palestinians of creating an ``artificial storm'' for
political gain.
	   ``This is an important decision aimed at strengthening
Jerusalem,'' he said in a news conference. ``We are not changing
the status of any one of these communities or of Jerusalem. ...
There is no violation of the Oslo accords.''
	   Netanyahu claimed that the Palestinians were the ones violating
the peace accords by trying to establish a presence in Jerusalem.
	   The United States called the plan ``provocative,'' coming at a
delicate point when U.S. officials are trying to shepherd the two
sides to reluctant agreement on an Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Netanyahu in
a telephone call to have the Cabinet reconsider.
	   The plan does not annex the West Bank settlements in question,
which surround Jerusalem to the north, south and east _ they will
continue to pay local property taxes and vote in their own
jurisdictions, Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said.
	   But it sets up an ``umbrella authority'' _ putting the
settlements under Jerusalem municipal authority for certain
services, notably building and planning. Settlements normally have
to get approval from the defense ministry for any construction.
	   ``It's the first time that regional powers concerning a region
of the West Bank will be vested in a civilian Israeli organ,''
lawyer and peace activist Danny Seidemann said.
	   The United States has called for a ``time-out'' on any expansion
of Jewish settlements in an effort to help re-start the stalled
peace talks.
	   Palestinian officials said Israel was pre-empting negotiations
on a final peace agreement, which is supposed to address the status
of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, and final borders. The
Palestinians hope to establish an independent state in the West
Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel occupied in 1967, with east
Jerusalem as its capital.
	   ``This is the most dangerous step taken by the Israeli
government. They are firing the bullet that will put the peace
process out of its misery,'' said Ahmed Qureia, speaker of the
Palestinian Council.
	   The Palestinian Authority has filed a formal complaint with the
United Nations Security Council.
	   The plan, approved after a five-hour debate Sunday in the
Israeli Cabinet, would also extend Jerusalem's boundaries westward
into Israel proper, annexing several suburbs in order to expand the
city's economic base and help ensure its Jewish majority.
	   Israeli newspapers published maps Sunday that showed the
``umbrella authority'' as encompassing eight West Bank settlements
in the Jerusalem vicinity. But Netanyahu said later that it had not
been decided which settlements would be included in the plan.
	   Bar-Illan said the plan was intended to streamline and improve
municipal services and attract new investment and industry to
Jerusalem. It ``has absolutely nothing to do with the status of
these areas,'' he said.

Newspaper: Princess Margaret had Queen Mother's historic letters destroyed 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Queen Elizabeth II's sister has had letters and
private papers belonging to their mother destroyed because she
feared they would be made public, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The Sunday Times said historians believe documents of national
interest belonging to the Queen Mother Elizabeth were destroyed in
the clear-out by Princess Margaret, younger sister of the queen.
	   ``The correspondence, largely from close friends, is understood
to cover mainly the past 10 years, which have seen the monarchy
rocked by the divorces of three of her grandchildren and the death
of Diana, Princess of Wales,'' the Sunday Times said, quoting
unidentified Buckingham Palace sources. The Queen Mother, who will
be 98 on Aug. 4, is known to have corresponded regularly with Diana
during her marriage to Prince Charles.
	   A spokeswoman for the Queen Mother refused comment Sunday on
whether papers of historical interest were destroyed, or whether
Princess Margaret was involved.
	   Personal correspondence was a private matter for the Queen
Mother, said a spokeswoman, speaking with customary anonymity.
``She is wise enough to know how what should be kept and placed in
the royal archives and what to throw out,'' she added.
	   The Sunday Times said Princess Margaret found the documents on
desks, tables and packed in attache cases in the Queen Mother's
apartment. She read them to her mother before they were packed into
plastic garbage bags, the newspaper said. It is likely they were
burnt.
	   The Sunday Times quoted unidentified royal courtiers as saying
the papers included sensitive observations on some of the events of
the past 10 years, including Charles and Diana's 1996 divorce and
the divorces of Charles's brother, Prince Andrew, and sister,
Princess Anne.
	   ``It's regrettable and a shame (the documents) have been
destroyed,'' the Sunday Times quoted constitutional historian
Kenneth Morgan as saying.
	   The monarchy had been through ``extraordinary trials and
tribulations'' in recent years, he said. ``Even if (the Queen
Mother) has not been involved with policy-making, she has been
around those who have made decisions.''
	   ``We need all the public material we can get. If you don't,
myths accumulate.''
	   Traditionally, personal royal documents are stored in the royal
archives. But some previous monarchs have chosen to destroy
personal items.
	   Queen Victoria's diaries were burned after her youngest child,
Princess Beatrice, had transcribed extracts judged suitable to
leave for posterity.
	   And King Edward VII and his wife, Queen Alexandra, stipulated
that their private papers must be burned after they died.

	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ Sri Lanka posted an emphatic seven
wicket win over New Zealand in their three-nation Independence Cup
cricket tournament match under lights at the Premadasa Stadium in
Colombo on Sunday.
	   The winning target of 201 never looked beyond Sri Lanka whose
opener Sanath Jayasriya and Marvan Atapattu put on 82-run
partnership for the second wicket after Romesh Kaluwitharana fell
hit wicket to paceman Shayne O'Connor for two runs in the first
over.
	   Sri Lanka needed the victory after losing the opening match to
India by eight wickets on Friday.
	   Jayasuriya made 57 in 60 balls with six fours while Atpattu went
on to score an unbeaten 83 to be adjudged man-of-the-match.
Atapattu hit nine fours.
	   Sri Lanka made a spirited fight-back to restrict New Zealand to
200 for 9 in 50 overs after initially conceding 71 runs in the
first 15 overs.
	   New Zealand was comfortably placed at 107 for the loss of just
one wicket, but failed to capitalize in the face of a five-man Sri
Lankan spin attack which accounted for seven of the nine wickets to
fall.
	   The tourists lost eight wickets for just 93 runs as off-cutter
Kumara Dharmasena and leg-spinner Upul Chandana took three wickets
each.
	   New Zealand earlier had a solid start after winning the toss
when openers Bryan Young and Nathan Astle shared a 71-run stand in
14.4 overs.
	   Young batted with authority and stroked the ball with confidence
as he dispatched seven deliveries to the fence while reaching his
half century in only 46 balls.
	   He was caught at deep mid-wicket off Kumara Dharmasena.
	   Except for Stephen Fleming who made 47 in 75 balls before being
run out, the rest of the New Zealand batsmen just caved in without
a fight.

<TEXT>
	   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) _ Participants in the first all-party
peace talks on Burundi agreed Sunday to a cease-fire and to resolve
the country's often bloody conflicts through peaceful means.
	   In a final communique after a week of closed-door meetings,
representatives of 17 participants, including the government of
Maj. Pierre Buyoya and a Hutu rebel group, agreed ``to bring an end
to the constant cycle of violence and fratricidal killings which
have afflicted Burundi for a long time.''
	   The communique said all armed parties agreed the cease-fire
would take effect no later than July 20, and former Tanzanian
president Julius Nyerere would remain as facilitator.
	   Negotiations are scheduled to resume July 20 in Arusha.
	   The Tutsi-led army and Hutu rebels have been fighting for almost
five years after Tutsi paratroopers assassinated Melchoir Ndadaye,
the country's first democratically elected president, and a Hutu,
in October 1993. At least 200,000 people, most of them civilians,
have died since then.
	   After a 10-month stalemate, Nyerere, who has a mandate from the
Organization of African Unity to mediate the conflict, managed to
get all the parties together.
	   The talks were attended by Burundi's five main political
parties, three rebel groups and civic and religious organizations.
	   Buyoya, a Tutsi and former army major who ousted a civilian
president in a July 1996 coup, said he is determined to enact
reforms aimed at ending the violence.
	   Last week he named a 22-member cabinet, which includes 12 Hutus.
He also named two vice-presidents, one of them a Hutu.
	   Although they make only 14 percent of Burundi's population of 6
million, the Tutsi dominate the government, economy, academia and
the military. Hutus make up all but 1 percent of the remainder.
	   Buyoya hopes the new political arrangement will this time
convince regional leaders to lift sanctions they imposed after he
staged the coup.
	   The final communique made no mention of the sanctions.
	   When they meet again, the parties also agreed to discuss:
	   _ the nature of the conflict in Burundi and the problems of
genocide and exclusion;
	   _ democracy and good governance;
	   _ peace and security for all;
	   _ rehabilitation and resettlement of refugees and displaced
persons;
	   _ transitional institutions;
	   _ guarantees on implementing the Arusha agreement.

Kuwaiti government approves sell-off of Kuwait Airways 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait's government Sunday approved a plan to sell
the state-run Kuwait Airways to the private sector, the official
Kuwait News Agency reported.
	   The privatization plan, however, will have to be approved by the
emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and the Parliament to take
effect.
	   Kuwait Airways' fleet consists of 15 Airbus, two Boeing 777-200
and two Boeing 747s aircraft. Details of the airways sell-off plan
were not immediately available.
	   The plan is part of a wider program to reduce the government's
dominant role in the economy and increase commercial activity in
the private sector.
	   The government has already sold shares in seven local companies
up to end 1997, according to latest available figures.
	   A recently-approved foreign investment law allowing 100 percent
ownership for foreign companies is also expected to come into force
soon.

World Cup: Ortega strike gives Argentina 1-0 halftime lead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Ariel Ortega finished off an expertly-constructed
move to give two-time World Cup titlist Argentina a 1-0 halftime
lead over Jamaica Sunday and leave the debutant team on the brink
of first round elimination.
	   The Valencia forward ran the ball past overworked goalkeeper
Warren Barrett in the 32nd minute at the Parc des Princes after
good approach work by Juan Veron and Diego Simeone had opened up
the Jamaican defense.
	   Jamaica ended the first half with 10 men after Darryl Powell was
expelled after his second yellow card.
	   Gabriel Batistuta could have put Argentina two goals ahead
inside the first 64 seconds as his team dominated from the very
start.
	   The game was only 20 seconds old when the Jamaican defense gave
him room to shoot for goal and was lucky that the Fiorentina star
slightly mis-hit the effort and 'keeper Barrett was able to save.
	   But Argentina won a free kick almost immediately on the right,
Batistuta rose to meet Veron's well-flighted kick and flashed a
header wide of the post.
	   In the 28th minute, Ortega went on a weaving run past four
Jamaican defenders but fired his shot over the bar from 16 meters
(yards).
	   Four minutes later the ever-dangerous Ortega put his team ahead
after an wonderfully-constructed move from just inside Argentina's
half.
	   Veron swapped passes with Simeone and then released Ortega, who
had made a perfectly-timed run down behind the Jamaican defense.
Barrett raced off his line but the Valencia forward chipped the
ball past him into en empty net.
	   To make things worse for Jamaica, midfielder Powell was sent off
in the second minute of first half injury time for clattering into
Ortega near the side line, his second yellow card of the game.
	   Lineups:
	   Argentina_Carlos Roa; Roberto Ayala, Jose Chamot, Roberto
Sensini (Nelson Vivas, 25th), Javier Zanetti; Matias Almeyda, Diego
Simeone, Ariel Ortega, Juan Veron; Claudio Lopez, Gabriel
Batistuta.
	   Jamaica_Warren Barrett; Ian Goodison, Ricardo Gardener, Frank
Sinclair; Stephen Malcolm, Christopher Dawes, Fitzroy Simpson,
Theodore Whitmore, Darryl Powell; Deon Burton, Paul Hall.

Thousands of Germans demonstrate for political change 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ About 20,000 people from all over Germany held
weekend demonstrations in Berlin urging political change, an easing
of record-high unemployment and social justice.
	   About 220 groups held protest marches on Saturday, organized by
labor unions, the unemployed, churches and students. With the
slogan ``Stand up for political change,'' they blamed Chancellor
Helmut Kohl for unemployment _ at 10.9 percent in May _ that is
Germany's highest since before World War II.
	   Protesters included Guenther Grass, Germany's best-known author;
Juergen Tritten, a leader of the liberal Green party; and Lothar
Bisky, head of the PDS party of former East German communists.
	   The groups also protested rightist and leftist extremism,
responding to Saturday's anti-foreigner rally in Berlin by
neo-Nazis and a counter rally by leftist punks. Police prevented
clashes between the two extremist groups.

Explosion near U.S. Embassy in Lebanon, no casualties 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATED with Albright comment
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Bombs exploded near the fortified U.S.
Embassy compound in a suburb north of Beirut Sunday, but there were
no reports of casualties, state-run Beirut radio reported.
	   The explosions occurred in the early afternoon about one
kilometer (.6 miles) from the U.S. Embassy compound in the
Christian suburb of Aukar, the radio said. There was no indication
that the embassy was the target.
	   ``I was notified of this this morning, and investigations are
going on,'' U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told NBC
television. ``We think everything is under control, but we will be
looking into it more.'' There was no report of injuries, she said.
	   The radio said three rocket-propelled grenades attached to a
detonator exploded at 1:20 p.m. (1020GMT) and targeted a
contractor's business near the embassy compound.

Rusedski, Kournikova ready to play 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Greg Rusedski and Anna Kournikova have
overcome injuries and plan to play at Wimbledon, official said
Sunday.
	   Rusedski, the No. 4 seed and fastest server in the game, was
rated 50-50 for Wimbledon after spraining his left ankle at the
Queen's Club tournament 10 days ago.
	   But he has been undergoing daily treatment and resumed
practicing.
	   In a statement, Wimbledon said Rusedski ``successfully completed
a practice session this morning and has indicated that he will be
playing in the Championships.''
	   Rusedski reached the quarterfinals here last year and, along
with Tim Henman, offers the best hope of a British man winning
Wimbledon for the first time since Fred Perry in 1936.
	   On the women's side, WTA Tour officials said Kournikova looks
set to play despite suffering a sprained right thumb during her
quarterfinal victory over Steffi Graf last Thursday at Eastbourne.
	   Kournikova, who reached the semifinals last year and is seeded
No. 12, withdrew from Eastbourne as a precaution and saw a medical
specialist Sunday.
	   Both Rusedski and Kournikova are scheduled to play their
first-round matches Tuesday.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ South Africa has concluded a secret 300-million
pound (dlrs 495 million) deal to supply Libya with weapons and
spare parts in return for cut-price oil, London's Sunday Telegraph
reported.
	   The newspaper said the deal was approved by President Nelson
Mandela, straining relations with the United States and raising
fears that Libya's Moammar Gadhafi may acquire details of South
African chemical and bacteriological weapons built up during
apartheid.
	   Mandela 's spokesman, Parks Mankahlana, said he would know if
Mandela had approved such a deal.
	   ``I know nothing about it,'' Mankahlana told The Associated
Press in Johannesburg. South Africa imports most of its oil from
Iran and, more recently, has obtained some supplies from Saudi
Arabia.

Battle of the ages shapes up among women at Wimbledon AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Sunny skies matched Martina Hingis'
mood Sunday on the practice court, where she mixed confident shots
with grins and giggles, enjoying life at the top and making the
game look easy.
	   It figures to become a bit more difficult this week, when the
world's best player begins defense of her Wimbledon title in a
battle of the ages.
	   Hingis, 17, has led the women's game into an exciting new era,
but a group of established stars _ led by seven-time champion
Steffi Graf _ hope to forestall the future.
	   Other players from the past with a chance to challenge Hingis
include Monica Seles, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and Jana Novotna.
Representing the teen-age vanguard are Venus Williams, Serena
Williams, Anna Kournikova and Mirjana Lucic.
	   ``It's a new generation. It's a different world these days,''
Hingis said. ``Today's players _ like me, Anna, the Williams
sisters, Mirjana Lucic too _ we all have our different style. That
makes the game so interesting, so different, so much better.''
	   Hingis, already the winner of four major titles, is the youngest
defending champion at Wimbledon in 110 years. But she seized the
spotlight in the absence of the 29-year-old Graf, who hasn't played
a Grand Slam match in more than a year.
	   Graf, a loser at the All England Club only twice since 1988,
begins her 13th Wimbledon on Monday against Gala Leon Garcia of
Spain.
	   ``There are a lot of good players among the women nowadays,''
Graf said. ``The standard is rising, especially with so many
exciting youngsters coming into the game.
	   ``I know it will be tough, but I feel quite confident.''
	   Because of the uncommon depth and variety in the women's field,
they could eclipse the men for drama during the fortnight.
	   Ten men have reached the finals of the past five Grand Slams,
meaning there's plenty of balance but a lack of star power. Almost
by default, Pete Sampras is favored to shake his slump and claim a
record-tying fifth Wimbledon title.
	   Sampras, a flop at three consecutive majors since winning
Wimbledon last year, will face Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia in the
first match on Centre Court.
	   ``There's just something about Wimbledon _ the history, the
grass, an intensity _ that seems to bring out the best in me,''
Sampras said. ``When I get onto Centre Court, I'm pumped up, and I
think the other guys do still fear me.''
	   As usual, big crowds and rain are expected at Wimbledon.
	   Queues began forming Friday for a limited number of opening-day
tickets that go on sale Monday morning. Heavy showers were in the
forecast for late this week, an ominous prospect for fans and
players who endured record rainfall last year.
	   ``If it rains, I'm going to leave,'' Serena Williams pledged.
	   Williams and the other teen queens are on one side of the
women's draw, while Graf and Seles are in the other half, making a
generation gap likely in the final.
	   Among the emerging youngsters, Kournikova poses perhaps the
biggest threat, although her health is in question because of a
thumb injury suffered last week in a tournament at Eastbourne.
	   Among the veterans, Novotna and Sanchez Vicario could be
factors. They reached the final Saturday at Eastbourne, with
Novotna winning the first grass-court title of her 13-year career.
	   ``I'm like an old wine,'' said Novotna, 29. ``The older I get,
the better I get.''
	   But the most tantalizing scenario is a final between Graf and
Hingis, who haven't squared off since Hingis became No. 1 in March
1997.
	   ``If Steffi is fit and I finally get a chance to play her, then
I would really love that,'' Hingis said.
	   Graf, plagued the past two years by knee, back, ankle and
hamstring injuries, has said this could be her final Wimbledon. She
moved well during two warmup tournaments on grass, and she'll count
on her lethal forehand to compensate for any remaining rustiness.
	   ``Whatever else might go wrong in my game,'' she said, ``my
forehand, I'm sure, will always be there.''
	   Not always. But for now, Fraulein Forehand is back, ensuring
that this Wimbledon will be special.

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Arab countries will consider whether to join
African nations in defying a U.N. travel ban on Libya, the Arab
League chief said Sunday.
	   Esmat Abdel-Meguid, the secretary-general of the 22-nation Arab
League, made the comments after meeting with a visiting Libyan
minister, Jumaa al-Fazzani.
	   Earlier, Abdel-Meguid briefed al-Fazzani on his recent talks
with British officials, who are closely watching the Arab League's
moves on Libya, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
	   On June 9, African countries, including Egypt and eight other
Arab nations, rejected the United Nations' travel ban imposed on
Libya since 1992 and asked the United States and Britain to relax
an economic blockade against the north African country.
	   Al-Fazzani, who is the secretary for unity, called the African
decision ``historic and courageous,'' MENA said.
	   It quoted Abdel-Meguid as saying that other non-African Arab
countries will consider whether to support the African initiative
during an Arab League meeting in September.
	   The economic blockade was imposed after Libya refused to hand
over two suspects linked to the 1988 bombing of a Pan-Am Boeing 747
over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
	   But the sanctions have been fading since Libya agreed to hand
over the two suspects to be tried in a neutral country according to
Scottish law. The United States and Britain rejected the offer.
	   Also in February, the World Court ruled that it had jurisdiction
to decide on where the trial of the two suspects should be held.
	   Earlier Sunday, al-Fazzani handed Egypt's President Hosni
Mubarak a letter from Libya's leader Moammar Gadhafi that dealt
with mutual relations and recent developments in the Arab world.
	   Al-Fazzani, who arrived in Cairo Saturday, said the letter
focused on Egyptian-Libyan ties, especially the ``strengthening of
relations between the two brotherly people in all fields,'' and
recent developments concerning the Arab world. He did not
elaborate.

Baseball's Al Campanis dead at 81 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with medical details, quotes; EDITS
<TEXT>
	   FULLERTON, California (AP) _ Al Campanis, who was fired by the
Los Angeles Dodgers for suggesting on national television that
blacks were unqualified to be managers or executives, died Sunday.
He was 81.
	   Campanis, the former general manager of the Dodgers, died of
coronary artery disease at 6:30 a.m. (1300 GMT), Orange County
Supervising Deputy Coroner Rick McAnally said. He had diabetes and
had nearly died of pneumonia last year.
	   ``He was just a great baseball man who loved the game, who
obviously dedicated his life to the game. ...,'' Dodgers manager
Bill Russell said. ``And he really was a good teacher, a great
general manager.''
	   Campanis was dismissed in 1987 shortly after he appeared on
ABC's ``Nightline'' TV show and said blacks ``lacked the
necessities'' to be managers and front-office executives. He was
replaced by longtime Dodgers employee Fred Claire.
	   Last year former Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda, a longtime friend,
called Campanis ``my mentor, who taught so much about the game of
baseball and life.''
	   Campanis was the team's general manager from 1968-87. Before
that, he was the team's scouting director. Under his leadership,
the Dodgers won the World Series in 1981, beating the New York
Yankees in six games.
	   Funeral services were pending.

Longshot Agassi likes his chances at Wimbledon AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ Late for a lunchtime appointment,
Andre Agassi hustles across the grounds at the All England Club,
following coach Brad Gilbert through a maze of hedges and tunnels.
	   Agassi talks as he walks, answering questions about his tennis
comeback, when suddenly he and the conversation come to a halt.
	   ``Where did Brad go?'' he asks, anxiously scanning the grounds.
``Did you see where he went?''
	   This could be an omen: Wimbledon has yet to begin, and Agassi
already looks lost.
	   It's been three years since Agassi won a match at Wimbledon. The
drought for the 1992 champion was part of an overall decline that
dropped him to 141st in the rankings last November.
	   But this year he has won a pair of tournaments and finished
second in two others, and questions about his motivation have
faded. Four-time champion Pete Sampras said Agassi is one of about
eight players with a shot at the title.
	   ``Andre has certainly been playing better this year,'' Sampras
said. ``He's going to be a threat.''
	   Sampras is the favorite, but if he's unable to shake a slump
that dates back to last year, the tournament is wide open.
	   Most observers discount those who dominated the clay-court
season, including second-seeded Marcelo Rios, who acts as though
he's allergic to grass. Australian Open champion Petr Korda, U.S.
Open champ Patrick Rafter and perennial Wimbledon threat Goran
Ivanisevic have struggled lately, while big-serving Greg Rusedski
and 1996 champion Richard Krajicek are slowed by injuries.
	   ``It's an open draw,'' Agassi said. ``There are a lot of
sections where even guys you don't expect to do well on grass could
come through.''
	   That means room for Agassi, a 20-1 longshot who has won three
Grand Slams, but none since January 1995. He plays Alex Calatrava
of Spain in the first round Monday.
	   Agassi, 28, skipped Wimbledon a year ago, his competitive zeal
overtaken by domestic bliss. But now, after settling into his
marriage to actress Brooke Shields, Agassi claims he's again eager
to play.
	   He looked sharp during workouts last week, blasting winners
during a practice match that left mild-mannered Brit Tim Henman
cursing and tossing his racket. Sampras' coach, Paul Annacone,
watched from a nearby court.
	   ``Andre went through a spell where he struggled with
motivation,'' Annacone said. ``But he's dangerous. He has won
majors, and there's no reason he can't continue to win majors.''
	   Agassi's comeback lost steam last month when he was upset by
18-year-old Marat Safin in the first round of the French Open.
Agassi blamed a sore shoulder that's now healed.
	   ``I should only get better from here,'' he said. ``I'm still a
little time away from my best tennis, but it could happen here. I
have enough confidence now that in the right situation, I can
elevate my game to win.''
	   With that, Agassi peeled off for his lunchtime appointment and
disappeared around the corner, still trying to find his way back to
the top.

World Cup: Germany grabs 2-2 draw with late comeback 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: SUBS third graf to reflect that Matthaeus is not captain
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Never, ever write Germany off.
	   Completely dominated by a technically superior Yugoslavia team
for 70 minutes, the Germans stormed back in the last 20 minutes to
erase a two-goal deficit and clinch a 2-2 draw Sunday.
	   ``We knew they would show their real face today, they play a
very strong technical game and they were very especially motivated
against us,'' said German midfielder Lothar Matthaeus said. ``But
our team showed its morale by coming back.''
	   Matthaeus, 37, made World Cup history by coming on in the second
half and contesting his 22nd World Cup match. In his fifth World
Cup, Matthaeus has more matches than any other players in World Cup
history.
	   ``We can be proud of our team,'' Matthaeus said.
	   The draw gave both teams four points in Group F, with Germany
ahead on goal difference.
	   But Yugoslavia could and should have clinched a place in the
second round, and will be left wondering what went wrong late in
the game.
	   Oliver Bierhoff, always a man for important goals, came through
with a powerful header in the 80th minute off a corner by Olaf Thon
to clinch the draw.
	   Bierhoff scored the ``golden goal'' that gave Germany the
European title in 1996 and now has 18 goals in 28 games for
Germany.
	   ``Every team in the world would be happy with this result,''
Bierhoff said. ``We were outplayed for most of the match but we
managed to turn the result.''
	   Yugoslavia looked on course for three points when Dragan
Stojkovic made the score 2-0 in the 54th. Dejan Stankovic had
opened the scoring for Yugoslavia in the 13th.
	   But Germany benefited from a fortunate deflection goal in the
74th minute and Yugoslavia's sudden collapse. So much under control
until then, the Yugoslavs began showing off their remarkable talent
and forgot about threatening the German goal. The stubborn Germans,
who are looking for their fourth World Cup title, took advantage of
the unexpected gift they were being given.
	   Michael Tarnat, a second-half substitute, fired a powerful
left-footed free kick from 25 meters that struck sweeper Sinisa
Mihajlovic's outstretched right boot to give goalkeeper Ivica Kralj
no chance. The goal was credited to Tarnat, although Yugoslav coach
Slobodan Santrac thought it was an own goal.
	   ``It really shook us up and we gave them the chance to
equalize,'' Santrac said. ``We didn't know how to preserve the
victory.''
	   German coach Berti Vogts said his team had risen from the dead.
	   ``We made possible what seemed impossible,'' Vogts said. ``We
turned defeat into a near victory.''
	   ``They wanted to toy with us instead of trying to score a third
goal and they got punished for that,'' Vogts said.
	   Yugoslavia took charge 13 minutes into the game.
	   Real Madrid striker Predrag Mijatovic, 30 meters from goal,
drove in a left wing cross, and Stankovic got the faintest of
touches as the ball bounced over German goalkeeper Andreas Koepke.
	   Though Mijatovic looked to have scored directly, Stankovic, the
19-year-old midfielder who recently agreed a move from Red Star
Belgrade to Lazio of Rome, was credited with the goal.
	   Yugoslavia doubled its lead three minutes into the second half
courtesy of a blunder from Andreas Koepke, the German goalkeeper.
	   Slavisa Jokanovic made a storming run through the heart of the
German defense, before knocking the ball to Darko Kovacevic.
	   The Real Sociedad forward fired low into the goal mouth and
Koepke fumbled the ball to present Yugoslav captain Dragan
Stojkovic with a simple tap-in from two meters in his 65th
international.
	   Germany finished the match with 10 men after Juergen Klinsmann
was knocked out by a Mihajlovic free kick that struck the German
captain in the chest. He was slow to regain consciousness.
	   ``We squandered a historic chance,'' said Perica Ognjenovic, a
Yugoslav substitute. Yugoslavia has not beaten Germany since 1973.
 &UR; Lineups:
	   Germany _ Andreas Koepke; Christian Woerns, Juergen Kohler, Olaf
Thon; Joerg Heinrich, Andy Moeller (Ulf Kirsten, 51st), Jens
Jeremis, Dietmar Hamann (Lothar Matthaeus, 46th), Christian Ziege
(Michael Tarnat, 62nd); Juergen Klinsmann, Oliver Bierhoff.
	   Yugoslavia _ Ivica Kralj; Sinisa Mihajlovic, Slobodan
Komljenovic, Zeljko Petrovic, Goran Djorovic; Slavisa Jokanovic,
Dragan Stojkovic, Dejan Stankovic (Dejan Govedarica, 65th),
Vladimir Jugovic; Darko Kovacevic (Perica Ognjenovic, 51st),
Predrag Mijatovic.
	   Referee _ Kim Milton Nielsen, Denmark.

Three injured as demonstrators clash with police in Yemen 
</HEADLINE>
By AHMED AL-HAJ
<TEXT>
	   SAN`A, Yemen (AP) _ Police in Yemen's capital on Sunday fired
bullets at rock throwing demonstrators protesting against a 40
percent IMF-spurred hike in fuel prices, injuring at least two
students, security officials said.
	   Protesters also clashed with police in the southern city of
Draa, where a 15-year-old boy was injured, the officials said,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Hundreds of troops were deployed around San`a University after
the clashes, on the third straight day of protests following the
hikes in gasoline, kerosene and cooking gas prices on Friday.
	   It was not clear how serious the injuries were. Most shops
remained closed in San`a Sunday.
	   The hikes in fuel prices were in line with International
Monetary Fund requirements to remove subsidies on petroleum
products and other commodities by the end of 1998.
	   The government has already cut other subsidies and stepped up
privatization of state-controlled companies as part of the reforms.
	   To help Yemen recover from the effects of the 1994 civil war,
the World Bank has approved a dlrs 80 million credit to support its
economic reform program.

Berezovsky: Armenia must take a stand on Nagorno-Karabakh 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ Armenia must take a decisive position on
the future of the Nagorno-Karabakh, an ethnic Armenian enclave
within Azerbaijan, the head of the Commonwealth of Independent
States said Sunday.
	   Boris Berezovsky, the Russian business tycoon who is executive
director of the coalition of post-Soviet states, spoke at a news
briefing after meeting with Azerbaijani President Gaidar Aliyev.
	   Berezovsky has been touring the former Soviet Union, speaking to
leaders and trying to patch up their differences so he can bolster
the CIS, which has never lived up to its promise.
	   Nagorno-Karabakh declared independence in early 1988 and drove
Azerbaijani troops out with Armenian help. The situation has never
been resolved, and internationally brokered talks to determine the
region's future have stalled.
	   Berezovsky, who recently visited Armenia, said he concluded that
officials there believe the region is neither independent nor a
part of Armenia.
	   Armenians, who have never officially recognized
Nagorno-Karabakh's independence, have insisted that Azerbaijan
negotiate with the enclave. Azerbaijan does not recognize the
separatists and wants to negotiate with Armenia.
	   Aliyev said it was necessary to resolve such conflicts if the
CIS was to become a functional commonwealth. He praised what he
described as Russia's consistent policy toward Nagorno-Karabakh and
the breakaway Georgian province of Abkhazia.
	   Russia, along with the United States and France, has proposed
that Armenia relinquish much of the disputed land it controls in
territory that Azerbaijan claims, while retaining a new corridor to
Nagorno-Karabakh.
	   Russia has deployed peacekeepers in Abkhazia to keep apart
Abkhazians and Georgians, but says it backs Georgia's territorial
integrity and has helped enforce Georgia's economic blockade
against Abkhazia.

	   ROME (AP) _ Cardinal Anastasio Alberto Ballestrero, a former
archbishop of Turin who allowed research on the mysterious Shroud
of Turin, died Sunday in a rest home in Liguria. He was 84.
	   The rest home, in Bocca di Magra, near the Ligurian city of La
Spezia, did not cite a cause of death, but noted that the cardinal
had been bedridden for some time.
	   Ballestrero, a native of Genova and a respected theologian, was
named to the Turin post in 1977. One of the highlights of his
tenure was the public showing of the Shroud of Turin in 1978, the
first such viewing in four decades.
	   Among the 3 million people who came then to see the mysterious
linen many believe wrapped the body of Jesus was the
then-archbishop of Krakow, Karol Wojtyla, who later that year was
elected Pope John Paul II.
	   Ballestero, who was made cardinal by John Paul in 1979, pushed
for scientific testing of the cloth. Results announced in 1988
dated the linen to medieval times.
	   The pope last month prayed before the shroud in its latest
public viewing in Turin and called for further tests on the cloth.
	   Ballestrero retired from the Turin post in 1989.
	   Ordained in 1936 in the Carmelite order, Ballestrero later
served as archbishop of the southern city of Bari. From 1979 to
1985, he was president of the Italian bishops' conference, a
powerful post in this country, where the Catholic church has much
influence on politics.
	   He was considered a diplomat, and when in 1977 he was appointed
to Turin, the major industrial city was affected by social and
political tensions. His relations with the then-Communist-run
municipality were excellent, and he often received striking
workers.
	   Funeral plans were not available.
	   Since Ballestrero was older than 80, he was no longer eligible
to elect the next pontiff.

Russia's atomic energy minister signs agreement with India 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Russia signed an accord with India on
Sunday paving the way for two 1,000 megawatts light water nuclear
reactors in southern India, Press Trust of India news agency said.
	   The accord, signed in New Delhi by Russian Atomic Energy
Minister Yevgeny Adamov and R. Chidambaram, the chairman of the
Indian Atomic Energy Commission, comes despite the recent economic
sanctions imposed on India following its nuclear tests.
	   PTI said the proposed nuclear reactors would be built according
to International Atomic Energy Commission safeguards.
	   A detailed project report for the nuclear power reactors would
be prepared in the next two years and actual construction work
would take up to six years, PTI quoted Chidambaram as saying. The
dlrs 2.6 billion plants will be located at Kudankulan in southern
Tamil Nadu state.
	   On Sunday, Adamov met with Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee in the northern hill resort of Manali where Vajpayee is
holidaying. The Russian minister later returned to New Delhi and
signed the agreement.
	   Russia did not support the economic sanctions imposed by the
United States and other Western countries and looked forward to
building nuclear power plants in India and other Asian countries,
PTI quoted Adamov as saying.
	   The Russian minister arrived in Bombay on Saturday, where he
visited India's major atomic research center.
	   Russia sees India as a prime source of money to develop its
underfunded nuclear technology programs. It also will cooperate on
developing more advanced reactors in India, the Interfax news
agency said last week.
	   A Russian Atomic Energy ministry spokesman said in Moscow that
sale of the reactors would ``allow us not only to survive, but to
keep up with other countries developing similar technologies,''
Interfax reported.

Italian man with gun pulls plug to kill sick wife

RETRANSMITTING for all needing
<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ A man distraught about his comatose wife
pulled a pistol on a doctor Sunday, demanded to be taken to the
woman's bedside and then pulled the respirator plug, surrendering
when he was assured she was dead.
	   After the man was taken into custody, police discovered the gun
was unloaded, the Italian news agency ANSA said.
	   News reports identified the husband as a 49-year-old teacher of
engineering in a school in Brianza, near Milan. They said the wife,
46, also a teacher, went into a coma following brain surgery Friday
at Monza's San Gerardo hospital. She had been suffering from a
tumor.
	   According to a hospital statement, the husband came to the
hospital shortly after dawn, asked about her condition and then
requested to see her. The man then pulled out the gun and forced
the doctor to accompany him, and once inside the woman's room,
demanded to be left alone with her, the hospital said.
	   The man, threatening to kill himself with the gun, then held
police at bay for an hour, until a friend of his who is a doctor
was summoned and assured him the woman had died, news reports said.
	   The couple, married for 25 years, had no children. They were
identified in the news reports only by initials.

Eds: UPDATES to UPGRADE attribution, embassy not target, add
<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Bombs exploded near the fortified U.S.
Embassy compound in a suburb north of Beirut Sunday, but there were
no casualties and the embassy was not the apparent target, security
officials said.
	   The explosions occurred in the early afternoon about one
kilometer (.6 miles) from the U.S. Embassy compound in the
Christian suburb of Aukar, the officials said. The motive for the
blast was not clear.
	   ``I was notified of this this morning, and investigations are
going on,'' U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright told NBC
television. ``We think everything is under control, but we will be
looking into it more.''
	   State-run Beirut radio said three rocket-propelled grenades
attached to a detonator exploded at 1:20 p.m. (1020GMT) in the
Christian suburb of Aukar, causing minor damage to a contractor's
business.
	   The security officials, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity, said the RPGs were detonated by a timer in a bush.
	   Police and Lebanese army troops sealed off the site and barred
journalists from approaching.
	   The blast came three days after an explosion killed two people
in a neighborhood east of the capital Beirut. The motive behind
Thursday's bombing in Dora was also not known.
	   Prime Minister Rafik Hariri was in the United States last week.
	   Although bombings were common during the 1975-90 civil war when
militias ruled the streets, they have become rare in Beirut since
the end of the conflict and the government's reassertion of its
authority.
	   The U.S. State Department last year lifted a decade-old ban on
U.S. travel to Lebanon.
	   The U.S. Embassy at Aukar was severely damaged in September 1984
when a Muslim suicide bomber blew up a vehicle in front of the main
building, killing 14 people.
	   The embassy had relocated to Aukar in 1984 after a suicide
bombing destroyed the original embassy in Beirut, killing 63
people.
	   It is protected by a detachment of Marine guards and a dozen
local guards who patrol the vicinity, where Lebanese troops are
also deployed.

World Cup: Two South African players suspended for rest of tournament ADDS quotes 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES throughout with two players suspended from World Cup;
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ South African players Brendan Augustine and
Naughty Mokoena were suspended for the rest of the World Cup after
staying out until dawn Sunday, South African soccer officials said.
	   The suspension means that Augustine, who started both of South
Africa's matches so far, and Mokoena, a reserve unlikely to see any
action, will miss the rest of their country's first World Cup,
South African Football Association president Molefi Oliphant said.
	   ``They've been suspended,'' Oliphant told a news conference.
``They won't be part of the team for the duration of the World
Cup.''
	   According to Oliphant and SAFA chief executive Danny Jordaan,
the two players went out Saturday night in violation of a team
curfew. When confronted Sunday, they responded they made a mistake,
Oliphant said.
	   But he noted a security official reported to SAFA he tried to
stop the players because they were leaving at a late hour.
	   ``We said it's not a mistake, it's defiance,'' Oliphant said.
	   Augustine and Mokoena both missed South Africa's practice Sunday
and neither was available for comment about the suspensions.
	   Coach Philippe Troussier said after the practice that he was
recommending the two players be suspended.
	   ``They have a responsibility to the team and the country and
they have to respect that,'' said Troussier, adding it was the
second time the pair violated a team curfew. ``As a coach it must
be my job to see that we do well in this World Cup and I cannot
accept that they break the rules.''
	   Jordaan said SAFA officials then held a hearing with the players
and decided to suspend them, based on reports by Troussier and
security officials. The reports said Augustine and Mokoena returned
to the hotel at 5:10 a.m.
	   Both Jordaan and Oliphant said they were unaware of previous
rumors that players were out partying the week before, after South
Africa's 3-0 loss to France in its World Cup opener. The South
Africans then tied Denmark 1-1 last week to earn their first World
Cup point and keep alive slim hopes of advancing to the second
round.
	   To make it, South Africa must beat winless Saudi Arabia and
France must beat Denmark in the final Group C matches on Wednesday,
and South Africa must overcome Denmark's four-goal advantage in
scoring differential.
	   Augustine, 26, a defensive midfielder who plays for Lask Linz,
played the full 90 minutes against France and was replaced at
halftime of the Denmark match. He played Saturday with nonstarters
in a training match against local players.
	   Troussier, known as a disciplinarian, has complained that some
players don't want to accept his rules. He said he doesn't mind
some rebellion, preferring what he called a ``live team'' to one
that never questions the coach, but he also insists on training
rules that include a midnight curfew.
	   ``There are five players who do what is required of them and do
prepare themselves for the game, but the others need to understand
that everybody is not perfect and I am not perfect,'' Troussier
told the South African Press Association. ``I need a strong effort
from the players and for them to accept my approach. I'm not here
to be a brother or to love the players. My job is to coach the team
and get the players to focus on the game.''

Iran's interior minister impeached but Khatami carries on fight 
</HEADLINE>

By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-line lawmakers impeached Iran's
moderate interior minister Sunday, but President Mohammad Khatami
swiftly countered the blow by naming him to a newly created post of
deputy president.
	   Barely an hour after the impeachment vote, Khatami sent the
hard-liners a clear message that he would not abandon his battle to
ease some of the harsher social restrictions of Iran's 19-year-old
Islamic fundamentalist government.
	   He named the impeached Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri to the
new job of deputy president for development and social affairs.
	   ``Due to your capabilities and ... the importance of
comprehensive and lasting development, especially political and
social affairs ... I appoint you as the deputy president for
development and social affairs.'' Khatami said in his two-line
statement.
	   Khatami also appointed the deputy interior minister for social
affairs, Mostafa Tajzadeh, as the acting interior minister, a
significant move given that he is a staunch loyalist of both
Khatami and Nouri.
	   One of the main reasons cited in the impeachment motion by the
hard-liners was Tajzadeh's appointment by Nouri as his deputy
minister.
	   Analysts said Khatami took the best course available to him:
constitutional as well as politically astute.
	   ``Khatami is serious in his efforts to protect political
freedoms,'' said Mohammad Hashemi, a law professor at the Shahid
Beheshti University in Tehran.
	   ``The deputies aimed to weaken Khatami but they will not
succeed. The winning card is in Khatami's hand. Khatami has the
support of the people and he has the nation's confidence,'' he told
The Associated Press.
	   Khatami's landslide victory in May 1997 shook the foundations of
Iran's clerical rule, which had long curbed civil liberties since
taking power in the 1979 Islamic revolution led by the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   But Khatami's time in office has been rife with struggle against
hard-line opponents who are backed by Khomeini's successor, the
powerful Ali Khamenei. The conservative members have been waging a
regular campaign to discredit officials loyal to Khatami.
	   Earlier Sunday, hoping to deal a body blow to Khatami's faction,
137 members in the 270-member Majlis, or Parliament, voted to
impeach Nouri. Another 128 supported Nouri and three abstained.
	   Nouri was not present when the results were announced after the
secret ballot.
	   The impeachment required Nouri to resign, but the unfolding
developments an hour later showed that Khatami may be willing to go
to any length to challenge the hard-liners.
	   ``The new appointments show that Khatami insists on his plans
for political developments ... and he insists on his principles,''
Hashemi, the law professor, said.
	   Thirty-one hard-line deputies started the impeachment motion
last month, accusing Nouri among other things of jeopardizing the
Islamic nation's stability and allowing a rally last month to
protest the influence of the hard-line clergy in Iran.
	   The motion accused Nouri, a clergyman, of ``creating tension in
the society, making provocative interviews and speeches in
different provinces and appointing inexperienced people to
managerial posts at the ministry.''
	   Speaking in Parliament before the vote, Nouri defended all his
appointments, including that of his deputy, Tajzadeh.
	   ``I do not claim that I have never made a mistake. However, you
should realize there is a plot afoot to separate the young, bright
university generation from the revolution and the clergy,'' he told
a packed parliament hall.
	   Nouri was also criticized for being quoted on Israeli radio. But
Nouri countered that he was not responsible for where his comments
appeared.
	   ``I've given dozens of press conferences and interviews and some
parliament members go looking for a couple of words here and there
... to use against me. That's not fair,'' he said.
	   Several hard-line deputies claimed drug-smuggling, kidnappings
and violence had increased since Nouri assumed power. They also
accused Nouri of hiring people who were not entirely committed to
the ideals of the Islamic revolution and for sacking conservative
officials.
	   ``Through uncalculated and unwise moves, Nouri, instead of
promoting democracy, created tension, anarchy and violence in the
society,'' said Parliament member Mohammad Reza Bahonar, one of the
deputies who initiated the impeachment proceedings.
	   The Parliament session was broadcast live on national radio.

Three off-duty policemen gunned down 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Three off-duty policemen were gunned
down in a congested eastern neighborhood of Karachi on Sunday,
police officials said, in the latest attacks linked to ethnic
violence.
	   The policemen were killed by three men on a motorcycle armed
with automatic rifles, said Qadir Ahmed, a police spokesman.
	   No one took responsibility for the killings and no arrests have
been made.
	   Ahmed blamed the shooting on the conflict between rival factions
of a militant group that has recently terrorized eastern and
central neighborhoods of Karachi.
	   In the last week 58 people _ including five policemen _ have
been killed and scores of people have been injured, often caught in
the crossfire.
	   The combatants are rival factions of the Mohajir Qami Movement,
representing Indian Muslims who settled in southern Sindh province
in 1947.
	   The movement has split into at least three different factions
and they routinely clash.
	   Despite meetings of the province's top law enforcement officials
the violence has continued unabated.
	   Hundreds of policemen and paramilitary Rangers in armored
vehicles are patrolling the streets. In some areas of the city
people are afraid to leave their homes.

EDS: UPDATES with new clashes after match, 50 arrests, two people
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Two people were injured and about 50 German
soccer fans detained in clashes with riot police before and after
Germany's World Cup match Sunday against Yugoslavia, police said.
	   Before the match, more than 20 German skinheads were detained in
this small north French town and outside the stadium.
	   Police used sticks to battle the Germans, who reportedly
included known groups of neo-Nazis who had arrived by train.
	   Riot police brought in reinforcements and sealed off the
downtown area.
	   After the match, a policeman was hospitalized with head
injuries, and a Brazilian cameraman was also injured in a melee,
police said.
	   Around 30 Germans were arrested after the match, police said.
	   Bar and restaurant owners, fearing further violence, closed
early evening.
	   Many German fans who were victims of a ticket swindle had come
to Lens despite not being able to get into the match. The match
ended 2-2.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ If soccer really does brings people together, then
FIFA is really getting into the spirit _ giving permission for a
couple to get married in the Marseille stadium before Tuesday's
Brazil-Norway game.
	   Olvind Ekeland, a 28-year-old Norwegian, and his 29-year-old
Brazilian fiancee Rosangela de Souza will get married on the pitch,
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said Sunday.
	   ``It's something rather special and unusual,'' said Cooper.
	   Ekeland and de Souza originally wanted to get married during
halftime. FIFA wouldn't give that idea a second thought, but
instead decided to let the nuptials proceed an hour before kickoff.
	   ``Football is about binding people in the spirit of
fraternity,'' said Cooper. ``Why on earth would we say no to
this.''
	   The couple will be married by a priest and accompanied by their
witnesses on the pitch. Their families will be there as well.
	   ``It's legal,'' Cooper said. ``They have tickets.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   PARIS (AP) _ A notorious English soccer hooligan _ believed to
be bound for Monday's England vs. Romania match in Toulouse _ has
been sent home.
	   A spokesman for the National Criminal Intelligence Service said
Martin Townsend, 25, of Manchester was deported Saturday from
Paris.
	   Townsend is classed as a ``Category C'' hooligan. He received a
four-year sentence in 1991 for grievous bodily harm and intent to
riot and a two-year concurrent term for rioting at a Manchester
City vs. Manchester United match.
	   In 1989, he received a seven-year exclusion order banning him
from soccer grounds.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Sports Minister Tony Banks has backed a
suggestion by Prime Minister Tony Blair that hooligans convicted in
France should be fired from their jobs at home.
	   ``There's no question of being gentle with these people because
they're not gentle with us,'' Banks said.
	   ``And, quite frankly, the country expects to see a very muscular
response to the sort of activities that we are seeing because it is
doing enormous damage to us as a country and as a game.
	   ``We obviously have quite a lot of lessons to learn here. We
mustn't allow these people, as it were, to disgrace the country.''
	   Critics have pointed out that it may be illegal to dismiss an
employee on the basis of a hooligan-related conviction.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Thousands of soccer fans took to the
streets and attacked cars and buses in two Bangladesh cities after
a power outage disrupted live television coverage of the
Japan-Croatia World Cup match.
	   Riot police used bamboo sticks to disperse the protesters in
Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital, and the sea town of Cox's Bazar
during the match Saturday night.
	   The power crisis in this South Asian nation has seen angry
soccer fans blocking roads and railroad traffic and forcing shops
and offices to close since the start of the World Cup this month.
	   Bangladeshi authorities have deployed riot police at power
stations across the country to avert violence.
	   On Saturday night, the national grid near the Bangladesh capital
shut down and plunged the entire country into darkness for at least
two hours.

Small party emerges from Czech elections as kingmaker 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: AMs. UPDATES throughout with fresh quotes, background.

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A small center-right party that
won only 9 percent in Czech elections emerged Sunday as the
deciding factor in whether the government stays to the right or
moves left.
	   The Christian Democratic Union, which will be only the fourth
largest of five parties in the new parliament, earned the apparent
kingmaker's role due to bitter divisions between most of the
parties.
	   The elections Friday and Saturday were called mid-term in hopes
of ending a stalemate between right and left that has stymied Czech
politics since 1996. But while the center-left Social Democrats won
the most votes, they fell far short of the majority necessary to
build a government.
	   Difficult coalition negotiations are to begin Monday, with
President Vaclav Havel expected to play a key role in persuading
parties plagued by bitter animosities to join forces and form a
government.
	   Political leaders talked about possible alliances on radio and
television programs and behind closed doors on the eve of
negotiations.
	   The only consensus to emerge was that whatever the new
government looks like, it must include the Christian Democrats.
	   But discussions broadcast live on television and radio indicated
that whatever the new government will look like, it must include
the Christian Democrats.
	   Possible alliances were discussed by political leaders on radio
and television programs and behind closed doors on the eve of
negotiations.
	   But discussions broadcast live on television and radio indicated
that whatever the new government will look like, it must include
the Christian Democrats.
	   The Social Democrats of Milos Zeman won with 32.3 percent of the
vote, closely followed by the Civic Democratic Party of former
Premier Vaclav Klaus with 27.7 percent.
	   The narrow margin makes Zeman's task of forming a stable
government a tough one.
	   A ``grand coalition'' of the Social Democrats and the Civic
Democratic party has been ruled out by both Klaus and Zeman.
	   The Social Democrat leader has also said he refuses to join with
the Freedom Union, leaving the Christian Democrats as his only
possible coalition partner.
	   But the Christian Democrats say they would not take part in such
a two-party coalition, as it would require silent support from the
Communists, a party no one wants as an ally.
	   Christian Democrat leader Josef Lux says he would prefer forming
a coalition with the Social Democrats and the Freedom Union. But
the Union's leader Jan Ruml says he will never be in the same
government with Zeman.
	   This may force the Social Democrats to form a minority
government that is not expected to last, or go into oppositon again
_ something Zeman is unwilling to do. Should the Social Democrat
leader fail to form a stable government, Klaus may be asked to do
so.
	   Although Klaus agrees Zeman first has the right to try and form
a government, he said he could see a coalition led by his
center-right party, with the Freedom Union and the Christian
Democrats. This would be a similar combination to his government
that collapsed last winter.
	   ``The Freedom Union says they don't want a coalition with
Zeman's Social Democrats. That _ I must consider positive news,''
Klaus told private F1 radio Sunday.
	   But Lux said such a Civic Democratic-led coalition seems
unlikely.
	   ``Voters wanted a change,'' he said. ``Any return to what we
already had is impossible.''
	   The election results would give such a coalition majority of 102
seats, as opposed to the 94 seats a Social Democrat - Christian
Democrat coalition would control.
	   The Freedom Union seems to favor the center-right coalition, but
sees personal animosities between Klaus and Lux as the main
obstacle.
	   Petr Mateju, the party's deputy chairman suggested to resolve
this dispute, Klaus and Lux should both stay away from the cabinet
and send ``people who are able to communicate'' in their stead.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Pope John Paul II fired parting shots
Sunday at his quarreling Austrian bishops, but steered clear of
directly addressing a sex scandal and dampened any hopes he would
change his positions on church policy.
	   At the end of his three-day pastoral visit to Austria, the plane
carrying the pope and his delegation left around 6:50 p.m. (1650
GMT).
	   The country's top churchman, Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn,
acknowledged that the conflicts buffeting the Austrian church
``have caused some people to lose confidence in the pope and the
bishops.''
	   ``All this calls for a change of ways, forgiveness,
reconciliation and renewal,'' Schoenborn said in welcoming the pope
at his final Mass in Austria.
	   A smaller-than-expected crowd of about 50,000 people turned out
in the Heldenplatz, or Heroes' Square, the vast plaza designed by
the Hapsburg emperors where hundreds of thousands poured in to
welcome Adolf Hitler in 1938.
	   John Paul beatified three people, including a nun, Sister
Restituta Kafka, who was arrested by the Gestapo for putting up
crosses in a hospital in a challenge to the Nazis. She was beheaded
in 1943. Beatification is the last step before possible sainthood.
	   Referring to the infamous events in 1938, the pontiff said:
``Sixty years ago, from the balcony of this square, a man (Hitler)
proclaimed himself the savior. Those newly beatified have a
different message. They tell us: Not in a human lies salvation,''
but in Jesus Christ.
	   The visit, John Paul's third to Austria, was aimed at calming
the waters in this traditional Catholic bastion that has been
rocked by accusations that a cardinal sexually abused young boys,
divisions among bishops and demands for reform signed by a
half-million Austrians.
	   John Paul issued his verdict in a private meeting of Austrian
bishops following Sunday's Mass. The Vatican released the text.
	   ``A bishop by himself does not realize the project of Christ,''
the pope said in a clear reference to Bishop Kurt Krenn, a
conservative who has angered many by his staunch support for
Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer. The cardinal was forced by the Vatican
to relinquish his duties following accusations of pedophilia.
	   The pope also scolded the bishops for going public with their
conflicts, saying that ``like every house that has special rooms
that are not open to all guests,'' the church too needs ``rooms for
talks that require privacy.''
	   In his only possible reference during the trip to the Groer
case, the pope said he knew his bishops had been ``put through
trials of various types'' and that they were ``particularly
present'' in his prayers.
	   In a statement prior to departure from Vienna's Schwechat
airport, the pontiff declared: ``Europe needs a spiritual face.
With all political planning and economic concepts currently
dominating the discussions, it is apt to consider that Europe owes
a lot to Christendom, but Christendom also owes Europe manifold
gratitude.''
	   The pope made no mention in his speeches in Austria of such
demands by the group We are the Church that the Vatican drop its
celibacy reqirement for priests and allow women into the
priesthood. But he has often indicated he had no intention of
changing policy.
	   The Vatican estimates that 78 percent of the 8 million Austrians
are Catholics, but only 20 percent are regular churchgoers and
40,000 drop out of the church each year.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-line lawmakers impeached Iran's
moderate interior minister Sunday, but President Mohammad Khatami
swiftly countered the blow by naming him to a newly created post of
deputy president.
	   Barely an hour after the impeachment vote, Khatami sent the
hard-liners a clear message that he would not abandon his battle to
ease some of the harsher social restrictions of Iran's 19-year-old
Islamic fundamentalist government.
	   He named the impeached Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri to the
new job of deputy president for development and social affairs.
	   ``Due to your capabilities and ... the importance of
comprehensive and lasting development, especially political and
social affairs ... I appoint you as the deputy president for
development and social affairs.'' Khatami said in his two-line
statement.
	   Khatami also appointed the deputy interior minister for social
affairs, Mostafa Tajzadeh, as the acting interior minister, a
significant move given that he is a staunch loyalist of both
Khatami and Nouri.
	   One of the main reasons cited in the impeachment motion by the
hard-liners was Tajzadeh's appointment by Nouri as his deputy
minister.
	   Analysts said Khatami took the best course available to him:
politically astute, but within his constitutional rights as well.
	   ``Khatami is serious in his efforts to protect political
freedoms,'' said Mohammad Hashemi, a law professor at the Shahid
Beheshti University in Tehran.
	   Khatami's landslide victory in May 1997 shook the foundations of
Iran's clerical rule, which had curbed civil liberties since the
1979 Islamic revolution led by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
	   But Khatami's time in office has been rife with struggle against
hard-line opponents who are backed by Khomeini's successor, the
powerful Ali Khamenei. The conservative members have been waging a
campaign to discredit officials loyal to Khatami.
	   Earlier Sunday, hoping to deal a body blow to Khatami's faction,
137 members in the 270-member Majlis, or Parliament, voted to
impeach Nouri. Another 128 supported Nouri and three abstained.
	   Nouri was not present when the results were announced after the
secret ballot.
	   The impeachment required Nouri to resign, but the unfolding
developments an hour later showed that Khatami may be willing to go
to any length to challenge the hard-liners.
	   The impeachment accused Nouri, a clergyman, of jeopardizing the
Islamic nation's stability and allowing a rally last month to
protest the influence of the hard-line clergy in Iran and
``creating tension in the society, making provocative interviews
and speeches in different provinces and appointing inexperienced
people to managerial posts at the ministry.''
	   Speaking in Parliament before the vote, Nouri defended all his
appointments.
	   ``I do not claim that I have never made a mistake. However, you
should realize there is a plot afoot to separate the young, bright
university generation from the revolution and the clergy,'' he told
a packed parliament hall.
	   Nouri was also criticized for being quoted on Israeli radio. But
Nouri countered that he was not responsible for where his comments
appeared.
	   Several hard-line deputies claimed drug-smuggling, kidnappings
and violence had increased since Nouri assumed power. They also
accused Nouri of hiring people who were not entirely committed to
the ideals of the Islamic revolution and for sacking conservative
officials.
	   ``Through uncalculated and unwise moves, Nouri, instead of
promoting democracy, created tension, anarchy and violence in the
society,'' said Mohammad Reza Bahonar, one of the deputies who
initiated the impeachment proceedings.
	   The Parliament session was broadcast live on national radio.

Small party emerges from Czech elections as kingmaker 
</HEADLINE>

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A small center-right party that
won only 9 percent in Czech elections emerged Sunday as the
deciding factor in whether the government stays to the right or
moves left.
	   The Christian Democratic Union, only the fourth largest of five
parties in the new parliament, earned the apparent kingmaker's role
due to bitter divisions between most of the parties.
	   The elections Friday and Saturday were called mid-term in hopes
of ending a stalemate between right and left that has stymied Czech
politics since 1996. But while the center-left Social Democrats won
the most votes, they fell far short of the majority necessary to
build a government.
	   Difficult coalition negotiations are to begin Monday, with
President Vaclav Havel expected to play a key role in persuading
parties plagued by bitter animosities to join forces and form a
government.
	   Political leaders talked about possible alliances on radio and
television programs and behind closed doors on the eve of
negotiations.
	   The only consensus to emerge was that whatever the new
government looks like, it must include the Christian Democrats.
	   The Social Democrats of Milos Zeman won with 32.3 percent of the
vote, closely followed by the Civic Democratic Party of former
Premier Vaclav Klaus with 27.7 percent.
	   A ``grand coalition'' of the Social Democrats and the Civic
Democratic party has been ruled out by both Klaus and Zeman.
	   The Social Democrat leader has also said he refuses to join with
the Freedom Union, leaving the Christian Democrats as his only
possible coalition partner.
	   But the Christian Democrats say they would not take part in such
a two-party coalition, as it would require silent support from the
Communists, a party no one wants as an ally.
	   Christian Democrat leader Josef Lux says he would prefer forming
a coalition with the Social Democrats and the Freedom Union. But
the Union's leader Jan Ruml says he will never be in the same
government with Zeman.
	   This may force the Social Democrats to form a minority
government that is not expected to last, or go into oppositon again
_ something Zeman is unwilling to do. Should the Social Democrat
leader fail to form a stable government, Klaus may be asked to do
so.
	   Klaus said he could see a coalition led by his center-right
party, with the Freedom Union and the Christian Democrats. This
would be a similar combination to his government that collapsed
last winter.
	   ``The Freedom Union says they don't want a coalition with
Zeman's Social Democrats. That I must consider positive news,''
Klaus told private F1 radio Sunday.
	   But Lux said such a Civic Democratic-led coalition seems
unlikely.
	   ``Voters wanted a change,'' he said. ``Any return to what we
already had is impossible.''
	   The election results would give such a coalition majority of 102
seats, as opposed to the 94 seats a Social Democrat - Christian
Democrat coalition would control.
	   The Freedom Union seems to favor the center-right coalition, but
sees personal animosities between Klaus and Lux as the main
obstacle.
	   Petr Mateju, the party's deputy chairman, Klaus and Lux should
both stay away from the cabinet and send ``people who are able to
communicate'' in their stead.

Eds: UPDATES with Aziz arrival in Madrid; EDITS to conform
<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Iraq's top diplomat arrived in Madrid on
Sunday to campaign for the lifting of U.N. sanctions on his
country, Iraqi Embassy officials said.
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz will tell Spanish officials
that Iraq has fulfilled the conditions set by the United Nations
for lifting the sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait, said the officials, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Aziz, who last visited Spain in 1996, will meet Prime Minister

World Cup: Argentina crushes Jamaica 5-0 
</HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta hit a second half, 11-minute
hat-trick after Ariel Ortega had scored the first two in a 5-0
crushing of Jamaica Sunday as two-time World Cup titlist Argentina
charged into the second round and eliminated both the Jamaicans and
Japanese.
	   The victory lifted Argentina to the top of the Group H standings
above Croatia on goal difference leaving the Reggae Boyz, making
their World Cup debuts, last with no points and a 1-8 goals tally.
Japan, another debutant, also has no points from two games and,
like Jamaica, goes out even with a game to play because both
Argentina and Croatia have six.
	   Ortega ran the ball past overworked goalkeeper Warren Barrett in
the 32nd minute at the Parc des Princes after good approach work by
Juan Veron and Diego Simeone had opened up the Jamaican defense.
	   The Jamaicans ended the first half with 10 men after Darryl
Powell was expelled after his second yellow card and Ortega made
them pay with a second in the 55th minute after exchanging passes
with Claudio Lopez.
	   Batistuta then hit two more goals in the 73rd, 79th and 83rd
minutes to go top of the World Cup scorers list with four.
	   Batistuta could have put Argentina two goals ahead inside the
first 64 seconds as his team dominated from the very start.
	   The game was only 20 seconds old when the Jamaican defense gave
him room to shoot for goal and was lucky that the Fiorentina star
slightly mis-hit the effort and 'keeper Barrett was able to save.
	   But Argentina won a free kick almost immediately on the right,
Batistuta rose to meet Veron's well-flighted kick and flashed a
header wide of the post.
	   After 10 minutes of total domination by Argentina, Jamaica went
close to taking the lead.
	   Fitzroy Simpson got clear of Argentina's defense down the left
with only 'keeper Carlos Roa ahead of him but a defender got back
to block his shot on goal.
	   But Barrett remained the busier goalkeeper, nervously holding a
lob-shot from Ortega and then blocking a close range header from
the same player.
	   In the 28th minute, Ortega went on a weaving run past four
Jamaican defenders but fired his shot over the bar from 16 meters
(yards).
	   Four minutes later the ever-dangerous Ortega put his team ahead
after an wonderfully-constructed move from just inside Argentina's
half.
	   Veron swapped passes with Simeone and then released Ortega, who
had made a perfectly-timed run down behind the Jamaican defense.
Barrett raced off his line but the Valencia forward chipped the
ball past him into en empty net.
	   To make things worse for Jamaica, midfielder Powell was sent off
in the second minute of first half injury time for clattering into
Ortega near the side line, his second yellow card of the game.
	   Ortega's second came 10 minutes into the second half when he
swapped passes with Claudio Lopez just outside the Jamaican area,
darted through a gap in the defense and prodded the ball past
Barrett.
	   Theodore Whitmore surprised the South Americans with a low,
25-meter shot that shaved the post but Argentina, who repeatedly
looked like adding to its lead, made it 3-0 in the 73rd minute.
	   Ortega was this time the provider, sliding a pass wide to
Batistuta with the outside of his right foot and the Fiorentina
striker powered home a shot from just inside the area.
	   Six minutes later Batistuta netted his third goal of the
championship, taking a pass from Matias Almeyda and running through
a huge gap in the Jamaican defense to fire home via the fingertips
of 'keeper Barrett.
	   Batistuta fired his third from the penalty spot in the 83rd
minute after Christopher Dawes hauled down Ortega as the forward
charged into the area.
	   Lineups:
	   Argentina_Carlos Roa; Roberto Ayala, Jose Chamot, Roberto
Sensini (Nelson Vivas, 25th), Javier Zanetti; Matias Almeyda, Diego

Family of slain Palestinian split over compensation offer 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A rare Israeli offer for compensation
made Sunday to the widow and children of a Palestinian man clubbed
to death last week by a Jewish youth was greeted with mixed
reaction by the family Sunday.
	   Abdel Abu Turki was walking home from his fields June 16 with a
cousin when a 16-year-old Jewish youth apparently leaned out of a
van carrying six other friends and wacked Abu Turki on the back of
the head with a wooden plank. The blow killed Abu Turki almost
instantly. The youth and another 16-year-old in the car with him,
are in Israeli custody.
	   ``I have come to express our sorrow with this ugly crime,''
Interior Minister Eli Ishai told the Abu Turki family, making the
first condolence call by an Israeli official.
	   ``Israeli law does not require compensation but as a minister I
will make every effort to bring aid and financial support to the
family,'' Ishai said.
	   Abu Turki's father Mohammed welcomed the prospects of help for
his 10 fatherless grandchildren but not everyone felt the same.
	   Abu Turki's 11-year-old daughter Noor led a protest outside her
own home during the visit. Refusing to greet the minister, she
shouting ``With our blood and souls we will redeem our martyr,''
and ``We want the settlers out.''
	   Her older brother Khalil told the minister he would not accept
any money.
	   ``We don't want any aid, we don't accept pay-offs,'' Khalil Abu
Turki told Ishai.
	   The two minors in custody for Abu Turki's death were living at a
halfway house for troubled youth at the nearby Jewish settlement of
Beit Hagay.
	   The area, where Jewish settlers live in enclaves next to
Palestinian villages, is one of the most volatile spots in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ The beer bottle slipped off the table
and crashed to the floor Sunday as alcohol flowed in a bar packed
with English fans, some of them veterans of the violence that
trashed downtown Marseille last week.
	   Many with tattoos and close-cropped hair, they insisted they're
not looking for a fight, just another good World Cup match in this
southwestern town Monday between England and Romania.
	   As long as they're not provoked.
	   ``If somebody pokes ya, you poke back,'' said Bob Wells, a
muscle-bound Folkestone construction foreman with tattoos on his
arms and chest. Wells said he did just that in Marseille last week.
	   Local youths from working glass North African immigrant families
pelted him with bottles before the England-Tunisia match last
Monday in violence that left 50 injured and 100 arrested.
	   ``The police were too late,'' Wells complained, echoing reports
in some French media.
	   Despite tightened security, many locals in Toulouse were nervous
that Monday's match _ or the partying around it _ could bring
another riot like the one in Marseille.
	   About 10,000 English fans were expected in Toulouse Monday,
although only 5,300 had tickets, officials said. Many fans could be
seen around town Sunday seeking tickets on the black market.
	   British police identified four known troublemakers who were
detained, the local prosecutor's office said, adding that about 100
so-called category `b' and `c' hooligans had also been identified.
	   British police said they expected more would be detained in
coming days. But they predicted there would be less trouble than in
Marseille.
	   Some 1,800 police have been deployed throughout Toulouse for the
match, 500 of whom were drafted in as reinforcements after the
Marseille violence.

Bertinotti: Italy's Prodi will survive a confidence vote 
</HEADLINE>
EDS: SUBS 12th graf, The conservative etc, with Berlusconi quote
<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italian centrists will probably wait until the last
minute before deciding how to vote on NATO enlargement, reports
said Sunday, leaving it up in the air whether Premier Romano
Prodi's coalition will secure a majority.
	   There are fears that if the government loses its majority on
such a fundamental foreign policy plank, it could face a vote of
confidence.
	   Private TV network Canale 5 said the centrists, headed by
ex-President Francesco Cossiga, would likely decide after hearing
Prodi's speech Tuesday to the Chamber of Deputies shortly before
the vote.
	   The centrists had said they would vote for the enlargement, but
on Satuday raised the possibility of a no-vote for reasons which
had nothing to do with the Western strategic alliance.
	   Cossiga's followers were irritated by an official of the main
leftist party in Prodi's coalition who had criticized Cossiga last
week for defending ex-premier Giulio Andreotti at the latter's
Sicilian trial on charges of helping the Mafia.
	   Prodi, who has a majority in the Senate, usually doesn't need
the center's vote to garner a majority in the lower chamber. His
center-left coalition is backed by outside-coalition help from
Communist Refoundation, a hardline party led by Fausto Bertinotti.
	   But the Communists, for ideaological reasons, refuse to back the
government on NATO.
	   Bertinotti, in an interview Sunday in the Communist daily il
manifesto, reiterated his pledge that he would support Prodi in any
confidence vote growing out of a possible defeat on NATO.
	   ``If Prodi asks for the confidence vote, we will vote for it in
any case, today, tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow,'' Bertinotti
said.
	   However, he noted that the coalition is due in about a week to
review overall policy -- on issues ranging from joblessness to how
to deal with the center-right opposition -- and that continued
Communist support for the goverment would depend on how those talks
went.
	   On Saturday, right-wing leader Gianfranco Fini invited the
indecisive centrists to join the conservative opposition in voting
for NATO enlargement, then demanding Prodi step down.
	   Former Premier Silvio Berlusconi, the media mogul who leads the
conservative opposition, on Sunday renewed the demand.
	   After confirming the conservatives would vote ``yes'' on NATO,
Berlusconi added: ``But if in the voting Tuesday, Communist
Refoundation won't vote (yes), the government will have the moral
and political duty to resign.''
	   Bertinotti said he doubted NATO backers would actually vote down
expansion because of political caprices.
	   ``The contrary opinion of just one country is enough to block
the entire process. I'd like to look straight in the eye this
right-wing, which would be so bold to resist the Americans and the
Germans'' on NATO expansion, Bertinotti added.

Small party emerges from Czech elections as kingmaker repeated from earlier version 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: DELETES grafs 7-9 pvs, redundant material inadvertently
By NADIA RYBAROVA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ A small center-right party that
won only 9 percent in Czech elections emerged Sunday as the
deciding factor in whether the government stays to the right or
moves left.
	   The Christian Democratic Union, which will be only the fourth
largest of five parties in the new parliament, earned the apparent
kingmaker's role due to bitter divisions between most of the
parties.
	   The elections Friday and Saturday were called mid-term in hopes
of ending a stalemate between right and left that has stymied Czech
politics since 1996. But while the center-left Social Democrats won
the most votes, they fell far short of the majority necessary to
build a government.
	   Difficult coalition negotiations are to begin Monday, with
President Vaclav Havel expected to play a key role in persuading
parties plagued by bitter animosities to join forces and form a
government.
	   Political leaders talked about possible alliances on radio and
television programs and behind closed doors on the eve of
negotiations.
	   The only consensus to emerge was that whatever the new
government looks like, it must include the Christian Democrats.
	   The Social Democrats of Milos Zeman won with 32.3 percent of the
vote, closely followed by the Civic Democratic Party of former
Premier Vaclav Klaus with 27.7 percent.
	   The narrow margin makes Zeman's task of forming a stable
government a tough one.
	   A ``grand coalition'' of the Social Democrats and the Civic
Democratic party has been ruled out by both Klaus and Zeman.
	   The Social Democrat leader has also said he refuses to join with
the Freedom Union, leaving the Christian Democrats as his only
possible coalition partner.
	   But the Christian Democrats say they would not take part in such
a two-party coalition, as it would require silent support from the
Communists, a party no one wants as an ally.
	   Christian Democrat leader Josef Lux says he would prefer forming
a coalition with the Social Democrats and the Freedom Union. But
the Union's leader Jan Ruml says he will never be in the same
government with Zeman.
	   This may force the Social Democrats to form a minority
government that is not expected to last, or go into oppositon again
_ something Zeman is unwilling to do. Should the Social Democrat
leader fail to form a stable government, Klaus may be asked to do
so.
	   Although Klaus agrees Zeman first has the right to try and form
a government, he said he could see a coalition led by his
center-right party, with the Freedom Union and the Christian
Democrats. This would be a similar combination to his government
that collapsed last winter.
	   ``The Freedom Union says they don't want a coalition with
Zeman's Social Democrats. That _ I must consider positive news,''
Klaus told private F1 radio Sunday.
	   But Lux said such a Civic Democratic-led coalition seems
unlikely.
	   ``Voters wanted a change,'' he said. ``Any return to what we
already had is impossible.''
	   The election results would give such a coalition majority of 102
seats, as opposed to the 94 seats a Social Democrat - Christian
Democrat coalition would control.
	   The Freedom Union seems to favor the center-right coalition, but
sees personal animosities between Klaus and Lux as the main
obstacle.
	   Petr Mateju, the party's deputy chairman suggested to resolve
this dispute, Klaus and Lux should both stay away from the cabinet
and send ``people who are able to communicate'' in their stead.

Colin Powell's cousin to make bid for Vikings 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) _ Another suitor for the Minnesota Vikings
football team has surfaced.
	   J. Bruce Llewellyn, a cousin of former Joint Chiefs of Staff
chairman Colin Powell and chairman of the board of Philadelphia
Coca-Cola Bottling Co., said he will make a bid to buy the team by
a July 1 deadline.
	   If Llewellyn acquires the Vikings, he would become the first
black to own controlling interest in an National Football League
team, as well as the only current black majority owner in a major
professional sport.
	   Llewellyn is to meet with NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue on
Wednesday and plans to fly to Minneapolis on Thursday to meet with
current Vikings owners and civic officials, former Vikings CEO and
co-owner Mike Lynn said.
	   Llewellyn would provide primary backing for a group that
includes Lynn.
	   Llewellyn announced his intentions through a news release issued
Saturday night by a Minnesota public relations firm.
	   He said he has some ``concerns'' about the Metrodome, the
Vikings' home stadium, but would keep the team in Minnesota. He
said a number of the team's current owners would remain in his
ownership group.
	   ``We have no interest in moving the team,'' the statement said.
``It belongs in Minnesota.''
	   Vikings owners put the team back up for sale for at least dlrs
200 million following the collapse of author Tom Clancy's bid last
month.

Defense ministry suspends staff after pornography was downloaded from Internet 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A Ministry of Defense employee and four staff from
an associated company have been suspended after workers at a
defense research laboratory downloaded thousands of pornographic
images from the Internet, ministry spokesmen said Sunday.
	   The Sunday Times said military investigators found staff at the
Defense Evaluation and Research Agency, or Dera, at Malvern in
southwest England had downloaded 170,000 pornographic images,
including pictures of children and animals, over a period of three
weeks.
	   The government scientists, who are responsible for developing
battlefield technology for Britain's armed services, used 200 false
identities to collect the material, the Sunday Times reported. A
key computer, supposed to be used to exchange research data with
colleagues worldwide, spent more than 70 percent of its on-line
time downloading and distributing the pornographic images, it said.
	   Rupert Cazalet, Dera's spokesman, said the agency is
investigating whether further disciplinary action is needed.
	   ''A number of pornographic images were discovered and that is
why one Dera staff member and four others were suspended. To access
or download material which is not work related is a disciplinary
offense,'' he said.
	   ``The monitoring of Internet communications is being tightened
as a result but we are aware that the Internet is a very valuable
resource,'' he added. ``However, we understand that sometimes
temptation gets the better of people.''
	   The Sunday Times said more than 3,500 Dera employees across
Britain had access to the system containing the material.
	   Jim Bates, a forensic computer expert who carried out an
independent inquiry, told The Sunday Times: ``The sheer amount of
material is staggering. I've never seen anything with such huge
quantities relayed to such large numbers of people.''

Fighting for Kosovo roads rages despite calls for peace 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES and RECASTS with more fighting reports
By ISMET HAJDARI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Heavy fighting was reported south
and west of Kosovo's capital Sunday despite the latest
international efforts to calm the conflict in the secessionist
Serbian province.
	   There were fierce battles for control of the two main roads
crossing Kosovo, based on reports from sources affiliated with both
warring sides _ Serb forces and ethnic Albanian militants.
	   In another sign the situation is deteriorating, Serb and
Albanian villagers were exchanging fire northwest of the capital
Pristina, the Albanians' Kosovo Information Center reported.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year between government forces and guerrillas who enjoy
increasing support among ethnic Albanians, a 90 percent majority in
the province of 2.2 million people.
	   World powers have accused Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
of excessive brutality against pro-independence ethnic Albanians.
Despite threatened NATO intervention, Milosevic has refused to
comply with demands to pull out his forces from the province.
	   Russia, a traditional Serb ally, has promised to try to persuade
Belgrade to ease up on its attacks but says the West must get the
KLA to halt fighting, too.
	   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky flew to the
Yugoslav and Serbian capital Belgrade on Sunday and met with
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic.
	   Another top Russian diplomat, Alexander Avdeyev, went for talks
to Yugoslavia's neighbor Albania, considered a vital source of
support to the ethnic Albanian separatists.
	   The Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army, which claims to control
about 40 percent of Kosovo territory, appears to be trying to
secure a corridor along the main east-west road across the
province.
	   Serb villagers reportedly joined the police in fighting Albanian
militants Sunday outside the town of Klina, near the east-west
artery.
	   Four Albanians were wounded, the Kosovo Information Center said.
A KLA commander was quoted as saying the militants had repelled an
attempt by Serbian forces to take a strategic spot.
	   The Serbs accused the Albanians of killing one 18-year-old Serb
villager Sunday and of kidnapping at least five people over the
weekend.
	   The pro-Serb Media Center said armed Albanians opened fire early
Sunday against the Serb village of Kijevo along the east-west road.
	   Further west, the Serbs were alleged to be opening grenade fire
on Albanian villages in the contested Decane area, 75 kilometers
(nearly 50 kilometers) west of Pristina.
	   The Albanians' reports of fighting in the sealed-off areas, like
the Serbs', could not be verified.
	   In the south, the ethnic Albanians claimed Serb police and army
forces had opened fire on three villages _ Petestica, Beline and
Caralevo _ sending civilians fleeing to nearby woods.
	   ``It's a veritable state of war,'' ethnic Albanian official Ali
Sadriu said of the situation along the north-south road near
Stimlje, linking the main towns of Pristina and Prizren.
	   The Serbs, trying to reassert control in Kosovo and crush the
independence forces, are estimated to have 45,000 to 50,000 police
and Yugoslav army soldiers in the province.
	   Some 13 buses with police troops reportedly arrived Sunday in
Pec, Kosovo's second-largest town, to reinforce or replace existing
government forces.

Key facts about Colombia With Colombia-Election 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   Key facts about Colombia, which holds presidential elections
Sunday:
	    &UR; ___
	   LAND: Bordered by Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador and Panama,
Colombia is the size of France, Spain and Portugal combined.
Diverse jungle and Andean mountain terrain.
	   PEOPLE: Nearly 40 million. Predominantly Roman Catholic; about
10 percent Protestant.
	   CIVIL WAR: In the late 1940s and early 1950s, 300,000 people
died in a civil war known as La Violencia. Thousands of Colombians
die every year in violence perpetrated by drug traffickers, leftist
rebels, right-wing paramilitary squads and wayward army troops.
	   POLITICS: A power-sharing agreement between the two main
parties, the Liberals and Conservatives, ended in 1974, but those
parties continue to hold the presidency. Given long history of
political violence, the government is mobilizing 200,000 soldiers
and policemen for Sunday's presidential vote.
	   ECONOMY: Main legal export products are oil and coffee; much of
the world's cocaine also originates in Colombia.

Guinea-Bissau loyalists demand ceasefire before talks Red Cross delivers food aid to community near Bissau. Edits to conform. No pickup. 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES to ADD comments from Guinea-Bissau opposition leader,
By IAN STEWART
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MPAK, Senegal (AP) _ Guinea-Bissau's government on Sunday ruled
out peace talks with renegade forces unless they declare an
immediate ceasefire, as the warring factions waged gunbattles in
the nearly deserted capital.
	   The rebels must also explain their motives for staging a
takeover bid, said Male Sane, Guinea-Bissau's Minister for the
Presidency of the Council of Ministers, quoted by the Portuguese
news agency Lusa.
	   There was no immediate reaction to the demands from the rebels,
who launched a coup attempt from a military garrison in Bissau on
June 7 under the command of former army chief of staff Ansumane
Mane.
	   Candjura Indjai, leader of Guinea-Bissau's main opposition party
Union for Change, meanwhile, offered to mediate talks with
Portugal's ambassador Henriques da Silva and the Catholic bishop of
Bissau, Septimio Ferrazzetta, Lusa reported.
	   Indjai said that government officials were only willing to
negotiate with the rebels if they surrendered their military
positions. The mediators had not yet consulted the rebels, Lusa
said.
	   The mutiny has sparked two weeks of fierce fighting in this
former Portuguese colony on Africa's western tip and has drawn in
troops from neighboring Senegal and Republic of Guinea to support
the government.
	   The rebels have called for the ouster of President Joao Bernardo
Vieira, whom the renegades accused of gross corruption. Mane, a
Gambian-born hero of Guinea-Bissau's war of independence against
Portugal, was fired from the army early this year for allegedly
running guns to Senegalese separatists.
	   Senegalese military officials said Sunday fighting continued
around Bissau's international airport, where the breakaway army
faction dug in after retreating from the military garrison last
week.
	   Reports that the rebels controlled all roads into the seaside
city could not be confirmed.
	   The number of casualties from the fighting remains unclear,
although more than a hundred rotting corpses lay in the streets of
the capital.
	   Officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross said
they recently removed 60 civilian bodies from sections of the
capital held by government forces over the past two weeks,
Portuguese radio RDP-Africa reported.
	   Most of Bissau's 300,000 people have fled and many were
reportedly without food in tiny villages throughout the country. A
relative few had managed to cross the border into Senegal.
	   Senegalese troops were blocking unnamed relief groups trying to
cross into Guinea-Bissau, RDP-Africa said without elaborating. The
report could not be independently confirmed.
	   Attempted talks headed by a Gambian envoy disintegrated last
week as rebels demanded the discussions be led by their hand-picked
mediator, a Senegalese opposition figure.
	   The rebel forces said in a clandestine radio broadcast that
their positions in the town of Ingore on Guinea-Bissau's northern
border with Senegal had been shelled last week by Senegalese
artillery.
	   Specially-trained Portuguese soldiers arrived Saturday in Bissau
to protect the country's embassy, Lusa reported.
	   Portugal's ambassador said he had met with the government, Red
Cross and Catholic aid workers to plan a relief effort for the tens
of thousands of refugees left without food.
	   Red Cross workers began delivering food aid to some 5,000
refugees at Pravis on the southwestern outskirts of Bissau, the aid
group's spokesman, Didier Grond, said in Geneva. It was the first
known case of successful food aid deliveries to the area since the
fighting began.
	   Although most foreigners left by sea, the ambassadors of France,
Brazil, Cuba and Senegal were still in Bissau, the Portuguese
ambassador said.
	   Food and water shortages have been reported in Bissau and
elsewhere. All telephone communication with the West African
country had been cut by Saturday.

Batistuta scores hat trick; Korea fires coach, violence in Lens match; South Africa players sent home; WILL be UPDATED with U.S.-Iran AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Argentina-Jamaica, more clashes after Germany
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta's hat trick, the first of the
1998 World Cup, helped carry both Argentina and Croatia into the
second round Sunday, while Germany and Yugoslavia put on a
thrilling show that ended in a 2-2 draw.
	   In developments away from the field, South Korea became the
second team in as many days to fire its coach, neo-Nazis clashed
with police before and after the Germany-Yugoslavia game, and
dissident Iranians protested ahead of Iran's politically charged
match against the United States.
	   All three of Batistuta's goals came in the second half, and
Ariel Ortega netted twice in a 5-0 rout of Jamaica that gave
Argentina and Croatia the two second-round berths from Group H. The
result meant newcomers Jamaica and Japan will be heading home after
the first round.
	   Argentina and Croatia, both with 6 points after two games, will
play for first place in the group on Friday.
	   In a showdown between two of Europe's top teams, Germany rallied
from 2-0 down in the second half to salvage a draw at Lens.
	   Oliver Bierhoff's header in the 80th minute followed Michael
Tarnat's deflected free-kick goal in the 74th to keep Germany in
first place in Group F on goal differential. Dejan Stankovic and
Dragan Stojkovic netted for the Yugoslavs.
	   ``We made possible what seemed impossible,'' German coach Berti
Vogts said. ``We turned defeat into a near victory. ... They wanted
to toy with us instead of trying to score a third goal, and they
got punished for that.''
	   Tarnat's goal, a left-footed free kick from 25 meters, was
directed into the net by the outstretched right boot of Yugoslav
defender Sinisa Mihajlovic. Mihajlovic was originally cited for an
own goal, but the official scorers later gave the credit to Tarnat.
	   ``I am sad and happy,'' Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac said.
``I am happy with the outcome, but I am sad that we let the victory
slip away.''
	   Before and after the game, two people were injured and about 50
German fans _ including more than 20 skinheads _ were detained in
clashes with riot police. Bar and restaurant owners, fearing
further violence, closed early.
	   Meanwhile, the city of Toulouse was nervously anticipating
Monday's England-Romania game. More than 10,000 English fans were
expected to descend on the city, only half of them with tickets.
	   Although there were no early reports of trouble, police, wary
from the three days of violence involving English fans in
Marseille, on Sunday detained four known hooligans from England.
	   The Argentina-Jamaica match at Paris featured two teams with
exuberant supporters, but nothing could match the unusual
atmosphere surrounding the U.S.-Iran match in Lyon.
	   Iranians partied on the streets before the game, while
dissidents charged that thousands more who wanted to come were
turned away at the border by French authorities giving in to
pressure from Tehran.
	   The French Interior Ministry confirmed that a number of
dissident Iranians had been denied entry as security threats Sunday
morning while trying to enter by road from Belgium.
	   That didn't sit well with local Iranian resistance leaders, who
also accused the French of allowing Tehran government secret police
to scour the crowd for exiles they consider to be enemies.
	   ``Is this the claim that `football is not political?' ''
Mohammad Mohadessin, head of the foreign relations committee of the
Mujahedeen Khalq, told reporters in Lyon. ``It seems, that so long
as football serves the interest of the murderous mullahs in Iran,
it can be political.''
	   On the field, Iran was seeking Asia's first victory in eight
games at this World Cup. The continent that is hosting the 2002
tournament is having a tough time, with its four representatives
going a collective 0-7 with two teams eliminated and two coaches
fired.
	   Saudi Arabia, France 98's first team to be knocked out of
second-round contention, fired Carlos Alberto Parreira on Saturday.
On Sunday, one day after a 5-0 loss to the Netherlands, the Koreans
dismissed Cha Bum-kun.
	   ``Somebody had to take responsibility,'' Chun Hanjin, the team
vice-manager said. ``It ends right here, right now for him.''
	   South Korea, co-host of the 2002 World Cup with Japan, has never
won a World Cup game in five appearance in the tournament. It lost
its opener 3-1 to Mexico before the humiliating defeat to the
Netherlands.
	   South Africa, which also isn't playing well, took action Sunday
not against its coach, but rather two of its players.
	   Brendan Augustine and Naughty Mokoena were suspended for the
rest of the World Cup after violating a team curfew by staying out
until dawn Sunday.
	   ``They've been suspended,'' South African Football Association
president Molefi Oliphant said. ``They won't be part of the team
for the duration of the World Cup.''
	   All of this happened on Fair Play Day, set aside by FIFA to
underline sportsmanship in the globe's most popular game.
	   To mark the occasion, joint group photographs _ instead of one
per team _ were taken before Sunday's three matches.
	   ``The impact of this visual image will be quite substantial,
especially for the U.S.A.-Iran game,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper
said.

Jordan criticizes Israel's decision to extend Jerusalem With Israel-Palestinian 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan on Sunday described as
``provocative'' the Israeli Cabinet's approval of a plan that would
extend Jerusalem municipal authority over nearby Jewish settlements
in the West Bank.
	   ``We ask the Israeli government to stop these anti-peace
measures, that hinder the peace process,'' Jordan's Foreign
Minister Jawad Anani said.
	   He added that the Jordanian government considers the Israeli
move a ``provocative decision.''
	   ``These measures create an explicit offensive for the occupied
Palestinian lands and infringe the accords and agreements that
Israel has signed,'' Anani said.

Sweden's Mats Lanner wins Madeira Island Open 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MACHICO, Madeira (AP) _ Swede Mats Lanner shrugged off his poor
form of the past two years to win the Madeira Island Open by a
single stroke Sunday, the third European Tour victory of his
career.
	   Lanner, who also won here in 1994, made up a two-shot overnight
deficit to edge Stephen Scahill of New Zealand.
	   Lanner, 37, fired a final round of 73 on the par-72 Santo da
Serra course for a four-round aggregate of 277.
	   Scahill, who shattered the Santo da Serra course record by two
shots with an 11-under-par 61 in his second round, carded 76 in the
mist-delayed final round to clinch second place.
	   England's Andrew Beal finished third after carding 73.
	   The Swede scooped the first prize of dlrs 70,000 and also gained
a two-year exemption on the European Tour.
	   Most of the leading European players were competing in the US
Open this week.

Garzelli wins sixth stage, takes lead in Tour de Suisse 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LENZERHEIDE, Switzerland (AP) _ Stefano Garzelli won the
156.1-kilometer (97.0-mile) sixth stage of the Tour de Suisse on
Sunday, taking the golden tricot for overall lead away from fellow
Italian Davide Rebellin.
	   Garzelli sprinted ahead of two other Italians, Leonardo Piepoli
and Daniele De Paoli, to win in 4 hours 27 minutes 9 seconds.
	   It was the second success in a row for the 25-year-old Garzelli,
whose victory in Saturday's fifth stage was his first professional
win.
	   He leads Beat Zberg of Switzerland, who finished fourth Sunday,
by 1 minute 19 seconds in the standings. Piepoli is third overall
with the same time as Zberg.
	   The demanding stage, which began and ended at Lenzerheide,
covered a picturesque course through the Engadine region, including
the Albula and Julier passes. Virtually never flat, the leg varied
in altitude by 3,116 meters (10,223 feet).
	   Bjarne Riis of Denmark, winner of the 1996 Tour de France,
finished seventh. Last year's Tour de France winner, Jan Ullrich of
Germany, was 15th.

Parliament refers press law draft to committee for debate 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Parliament on Sunday referred a draft press
law to a legal committee, indicating that lawmakers are not
satisfied with the bill that has been widely criticized for
proposing widespread restrictions.
	   Parliamentary sources said it will take several weeks for the
draft bill to be enacted, possibly with amendments.
	   ``There will be thorough discussions with local and foreign
journalists to get their ideas on the various issues that affect
their lives,'' said a deputy, speaking on customary condition of
anonymity.
	   In a four-hour debate on Sunday, 48 lawmakers in the 80 member
house voted to send the bill to Parliament's legal body, known as
the National Guidance Committee.
	   It was earlier speculated that the predominantly pro-government
deputies in the Parliament will pass the bill instantly.
	   The bulk of 57 deputies, including pro-government politicians,
who took the floor in Sunday's debate argued that the draft bill
will curb press freedoms and infringe on public freedoms under a
democratization process launched in 1989.
	   ``The draft law violates the citizen's right to obtain
information and restricts the freedom of speech in Jordan,'' said
lawmaker Nazih Amareen, a former communist.
	   The governments intends to use the new bill to replace a 1993
law, which it it says has led to a freewheeling media that violated
the ethics and norms of professional journalism.
	   The government says the new law targets Jordan's 22 weekly
tabloids, many of which are affiliated with Muslim fundamentalist
and leftist groups opposed to King Hussein's pro-western style and
the 1994 Jordan-Israel peace treaty.
	   Information Minister Abdullah Nsour told Western media
journalists on Sunday that the government was more worried about
the tabloids' ``scandalous reports and personality assassination''
of local and foreign figures.
	   The tabloids have been critical of many Arab leaders whom they
blame for a rift in the Arab world _ a highly sensitive issue for
Jordan which over the years has lived of donations from neighboring
rich Gulf countries.
	   The draft law gives the government the upper hand by allowing it
to censor foreign newspapers and the right to close down local
publications in case of violations.
	   It stipulates hefty fines in case of violations and onerous
capital requirements for local publications _ which could
ultimately force the closure of many newspapers.
	   On the foreign media, the draft stipulates that only Jordanians
can be chief editors of local bureaus. They will be held
responsible for any violations leading to hefty fines and
suspension of the correspondent's credentials or his office's
registration.
	   It also bans local and foreign journalists from publishing
information on ongoing investigations and trials and coverage
considered disparaging to the royal family, the armed forces, heads
of states or topics harming the states's security and financial
stability.
	   It also obliges foreign and local journalists to divulge their
sources in court.

Eds: UPDATES throughout with eyewitnesses saying leaders shot each
<TEXT>
	   GROZNY, Russia (AP) _ Two prominent Chechen leaders were killed
Sunday in a violent confrontation with each other in the capital of
the breakaway Russian republic, authorities said.
	   The men were identified as Lecha Khultygov, chief of the Chechen
National Security Service, and Vakha Dzhafarov, chief of staff of a
guerrilla army led by rebel leader Salman Raduyev.
	   Authorities in the Chechen Interior Ministry said only that the
two men died in a gunfight during a rally of Raduyev's supporters
near the television center in Grozny, the Chechen capital.
	   However, some eyewitnesses said they saw Khultygov pull a gun
during the confrontation and shoot Dzhafarov, who managed to fire
back and kill Khultygov before he died himself.
	   The two were apparently arguing over the demonstration by
Raduyev supporters when the shooting occurred.
	   Earlier in the day, Raduyev _ whom the government considers
dangerously unstable _ had spoken at a rally in the central square
in Grozny, telling supporters that Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov was involved in the killing of former President Dzhokhar
Dudayev.
	   After that, he and his supporters marched to the television
center, where they were confronted by Khultygov and his security
forces.
	   Shamil Basayev, a guerrilla commander turned deputy premier of
Chechnya, called for calm among Chechen citizens, many of whom
still revere Dudayev and some of whom support Raduyev.
	   ``We need patience,'' he said. ``A consensus should be reached
between the opposing groups.''
	   Since its 1994-96 war of secession from Russia, Chechnya has
been plagued by lawlessness, violence and kidnappings. Its
government has not been able to restore order or rebuild the
economy.
	   Chechnya still considers itself independent of Russia, although
Russia still views it as a renegade Russian republic.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Pope John Paul II fired parting shots
Sunday at his quarreling Austrian bishops, but steered clear of
directly addressing a sex scandal and dampened any hopes he would
change his positions on church policy.
	   At the end of his three-day pastoral visit to Austria, the plane
carrying the pope and his delegation left around 6:50 p.m. (1650
GMT) and returned to Rome less than 90 minutes later.

Netanyahu appoints ministers, staff to study referendum 
</HEADLINE>
By DAFNA LINZER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Indicating he was moving ahead with
plans for a national referendum on a U.S. proposal to withdraw
Israeli troops from the West Bank, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu appointed a committee Sunday to study such a vote.
	   Justice Minister Tsachi Hanegbi will sit on the committee
together with Communications Minister Limor Livnat, and
representative of the prime minister's office, the interior
ministry and the justice department, Hanegbi's office said.
	   Netanyahu has not officially announced he would hold a
referendum but has floated the idea, saying he felt public input
over a plan to cede West Bank land to the Palestinians, was vital.
	   The United States has asked Israel to make a quick decision on
the withdrawal proposal it submitted in January. The Palestinians,
who have accepted the proposal, see a referendum as a stall tactic.
	   But for Netanyahu, public support for the plan would effectively
silence far-right wing members of his government who have
threatened to topple him, if he goes ahead with the withdrawal.
	   ``The committee will research the experiences other countries
have had with referendums, a time-frame for such a vote, and the
budgetary requirements involved,'' said justice ministry
spokeswoman Etty Eshed.
	   A mock referendum conducted last week by the Israeli newspaper
Maariv and involving 50,000 of its readers, found that two-thirds
supported a withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, as
proposed by the United States.
	   The paper also published a Gallup poll conducted among 500
Jewish Israelis which indicated that 67 percents favored holding a
referendum on a withdrawal, and that 28 percent were opposed.

Slain designer's companion says he wants to design fashion 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The companion of slain designer Gianni
Versace says he wants to design his own fashion label but won't try
to imitate Versace's style.
	   Antonio D'Amico, who was staying with Versace in the Miami villa
when the designer was shot to death in July, was quoted as saying
in Sunday's Corriere della Sera, a Milan daily, that he and a
friend had started a fashion house whose label would carry
D'Amico's name.
	   ``The teaching by Gianni, an authentic artistic genius, was an
extraordinary school for me but I won't present myself as a
copier,'' D'Amico was quoted as saying. ``He was unique, and I have
my tastes and my style.''
	   D'Amico was hoping to get the collection started in time for
men's fashion shows in early 1999, according to the report.
	   According to Versace's will, D'Amico is allowed to stay in the
designer's luxurious residences, including the Miami mansion. But
D'Amico, while acknowledging his companion's generosity, said:
``I'll never set foot again (in the residences) because it would
only be fruitless suffering.''

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ City officials assessed the losses Sunday from the
most violent summer storm in recent memory: six dead, tens of
thousands of trees lost, and damage to the Bolshoi Theater and the
walls of the Kremlin.
	   ``The damage done to the city is huge,'' a spokesman for Mayor
Yuri Luzhkov told the Interfax news agency.
	   The freak storm struck the Russian capital just before midnight
Saturday, with nearly continuous thunder and lightning, intense
downpours and shrieking winds. It lasted about 30 minutes, during
which trees snapped, billboards and street kiosks collapsed and the
air was alive with flying debris.
	   ``It was worse than a hurricane,'' said Mikhail Gordunov, the
night manager of a kiosk on Kutuzovsky Prospect, a wide boulevard
leading toward the Kremlin. ``I was trying to bring an umbrella in,
and was afraid of being swept away.''
	   Winds were recorded at 90 kilometers per hour (60 mph), but
whirlwinds in some places gusted much higher, according to Raisa
Yeliseyeva, duty officer at the Moscow weather center.
	   She said the storm was triggered by a collision of two air
masses over the capital.
	   ``Temperatures in Moscow and east of the capital were very high,
32-35 degrees (90-95 F), while air masses with temperatures of
20-22 (68-72 F) were approaching the city from the west,'' she
said.
	   They collided with a bang.
	   Luzhkov, who promised earlier in the year to cancel the city's
contract with the national weather service after it failed to
predict a heavy spring snowstorm, renewed his criticism Sunday.
	   The weather service ``failed to predict the storm once again,''
he said, according to Interfax. He reiterated his plans to cancel
the city's contract and hire new forecasters.
	   The mayor put the death toll at six, and rattled off other
statistics: 45,000 trees down; power lines down in 700 places and
electric trolley and tram lines in 500 places; 300 roofs torn off
homes.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said 122 people had been hospitalized
for treatment of injuries suffered in the storm. Other reports said
most had been hurt by falling trees or flying debris.
	   The storm seriously damaged the roof of the Bolshoi Theater and
smashed windows at the Moskva Hotel, adjacent to Red Square,
ITAR-Tass said.
	   About 200 trees were uprooted in the majestic Kremlin gardens,
and several turrets atop the Kremlin wall _ sections of which date
to the 15th century _ were knocked down by falling trees.
	   Cafes and outdoor restaurants along Tverskaya Street, the city's
main shopping street, were smashed beyond repair, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Sporadic power outages were reported throughout the night, and
cable television service was also affected.
	   Three thousand Interior troops and regular soldiers joined city
workers in cleaning up the debris Sunday. Luzhkov promised that the
most serious problems would be repaired by Monday morning, and
insisted that the damage would not affect the World Youth Games,
which begin in Moscow on July 11.

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Pope John Paul II fired parting shots
Sunday at his quarreling Austrian bishops, but steered clear of
directly addressing a sex scandal and dampened any hopes he would
change his positions on church policy.
	   At the end of his three-day pastoral visit to Austria, the plane
carrying the pope and his delegation left around 6:50 p.m. (1650
GMT) and returned to Rome less than 90 minutes later.
	   The country's top churchman, Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn,
acknowledged that the conflicts buffeting the Austrian church
``have caused some people to lose confidence in the pope and the
bishops.
	   ``All this calls for a change of ways, forgiveness,
reconciliation and renewal,'' Schoenborn said in welcoming the pope
at his final Mass in Austria.
	   A smaller-than-expected crowd of about 50,000 people turned out
in the Heldenplatz, or Heroes' Square, the vast plaza designed by
the Hapsburg emperors where hundreds of thousands poured in to
welcome Adolf Hitler in 1938.
	   John Paul beatified three people, including a nun, Sister
Restituta Kafka, who was arrested by the Gestapo for putting up
crosses in a hospital in a challenge to the Nazis. She was beheaded
in 1943. Beatification is the last step before possible sainthood.
	   ``Sixty years ago, from the balcony of this square, a man
(Hitler) proclaimed himself the savior,'' the pontiff said. ``Those
newly beatified have a different message. They tell us: Not in a
human lies salvation,'' but in Jesus Christ.
	   The visit, John Paul's third to Austria, was aimed at calming
the waters in this traditional Catholic bastion that has been
rocked by accusations that a cardinal sexually abused young boys,
divisions among bishops and demands for reform signed by a
half-million Austrians.
	   John Paul issued his verdict in a private meeting of Austrian
bishops following Sunday's Mass. The Vatican released the text.
	   ``A bishop by himself does not realize the project of Christ,''
the pope said in a clear reference to Bishop Kurt Krenn, a
conservative who has angered many by his staunch support for
Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer. The cardinal was forced by the Vatican
to relinquish his duties following accusations of pedophilia.
	   The pope also scolded the bishops for going public with their
conflicts, saying that ``like every house that has special rooms
that are not open to all guests,'' the church too needs ``rooms for
talks that require privacy.''
	   In his only possible reference during the trip to the Groer
case, the pope said he knew his bishops had been ``put through
trials of various types'' and that they were ``particularly
present'' in his prayers.
	   In a statement prior to departure from Vienna's Schwechat
airport, the pontiff declared: ``Europe needs a spiritual face.
With all political planning and economic concepts currently
dominating the discussions, it is apt to consider that Europe owes
a lot to Christendom, but Christendom also owes Europe manifold
gratitude.''
	   The pope made no mention in his speeches in Austria of such
demands by the group We are the Church that the Vatican drop its
celibacy reqirement for priests and allow women into the
priesthood. But he has often indicated he had no intention of
changing policy.
	   The Vatican estimates that 78 percent of the 8 million Austrians
are Catholics, but only 20 percent are regular churchgoers and
40,000 drop out of the church each year.

Netanyahu appoints ministers, staff to study referendum

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
appointed a committee Sunday to consider whether to call a national
referendum on a U.S. proposal to withdraw Israeli troops from the
West Bank.
	   Netanyahu has not officially announced he would hold a
referendum but has floated the idea, saying he felt public input
over a plan to cede West Bank land to the Palestinians was vital.
	   The United States has asked Israel to make a quick decision on
the withdrawal proposal it submitted in January. The Palestinians,
who have accepted the proposal, see a referendum as a stall tactic.
	   For Netanyahu, public support for the plan would effectively
silence far-right wing members of his government who have
threatened to topple him if he goes ahead with the withdrawal.
	   Justice Minister Tsachi Hanegbi will be on the committee
together with Communications Minister Limor Livnat, and
representative of the prime minister's office, the interior
ministry and the justice department, Hanegbi's office said.
	   ``The committee will research the experiences other countries
have had with referendums, a time-frame for such a vote, and the
budgetary requirements involved,'' said justice ministry
spokeswoman Etty Eshed.
	   A mock referendum conducted last week by the Israeli newspaper
Maariv and involving 50,000 of its readers, found that two-thirds
supported a withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank, as
proposed by the United States.

Garzelli wins sixth stage, takes lead in Tour de Suisse 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LENZERHEIDE, Switzerland (AP) _ Stefano Garzelli won the
156.1-kilometer (97.0-mile) sixth stage of the Tour de Suisse on
Sunday, taking the golden tricot for overall lead away from fellow
Italian Davide Rebellin.
	   Garzelli sprinted ahead of two other Italians, Leonardo Piepoli
and Daniele De Paoli, to win in 4 hours 27 minutes 9 seconds.
	   It was the second success in a row for the 25-year-old Garzelli,
whose victory in Saturday's fifth stage was his first professional
win.
	   He leads Beat Zberg of Switzerland, who finished fourth Sunday,
by 1 minute 19 seconds in the standings. Piepoli is third overall
with the same time as Zberg.
	   The demanding stage, which began and ended at Lenzerheide,
covered a picturesque course through the Engadine region, including
the Albula and Julier passes. Virtually never flat, the leg varied
in altitude by 3,116 meters (10,223 feet).
	   Bjarne Riis of Denmark, winner of the 1996 Tour de France,
finished seventh. Last year's Tour de France winner, Jan Ullrich of
Germany, was 15th.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Their international image and economy
battered by four years of corruption-plagued government, Colombians
chose in a presidential runoff Sunday between a key player from the
outgoing administration and a challenger promising change.
	   Public anger with President Ernesto Samper's government had led
many analysts to predict defeat for his hand-picked successor, but
Horacio Serpa of the governing Liberal Party showed surprising
strength in pre-election polls.
	   A populist firebrand and career politician, Serpa was running
nearly even with the Conservative Party challenger, Andres
Pastrana, a telegenic former mayor of Bogota whom Samper narrowly
defeated in the 1994 presidential race.
	   The two candidates each received about 35 percent of vote in the
first round May 31, in which independent candidate Noemi Sanin
placed a close third.
	   Sanin, who was backed by anti-corruption forces, refused to
endorse either candidate in Sunday's vote and accused Samper of
using a recent public works spending spree to try to boost Serpa's
appeal.
	   Compared to other recent elections, relatively few rebels
attacks were reported.
	   Guerrillas attacked two helicopters Sunday near the southern
city of Neiva, killing two police officers and wounding two, the
army said. Since Friday, guerrillas have kidnapped at least 11
election officials and burned 37 vehicles nationwide.
	   The Liberals have held the presidency for the past 12 years,
control a majority in Congress and have a well-entrenched patronage
system that gets out the vote in the provinces.
	   Samper, who came under attack for alleged links to drug
traffickers, bought the support of regional political bosses by
doling out hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds.
Meanwhile, unemployment soared to 14.5 percent and the deficit more
than doubled.
	   ``We're in very bad shape economically and if Serpa wins it's
only going to get worse,'' said Jairo Chaustre, 31, a helicopter
pilot who voted for Pastrana. ``Serpa is a continuation of Samper's
politics, which have busted the country's economy.''
	   Maria Elena Restrepo, a 41-year-old publicist voting in Bogota,
disagreed.
	   ``Just because someone has a relative who is a thief doesn't
necessarily mean that they are themselves a thief,'' she said.
	   Like Samper, the 55-year-old Serpa was cleared of any wrongdoing
in the scandal over dlrs 6 million in contributions from the Cali
drug cartel to Samper's 1994 campaign _ the president by a loyal
congress and Serpa by the chief prosecutor. Serpa was a top
campaign aide and later became Samper's main defender as interior
minister.
	   Some political analysts have criticized Pastrana for not
attacking Serpa's alleged drug links more vigorously.
	   The new president will inherit a 34-year-old guerrilla war that
has reached new depths of violence in recent months, with
stepped-up massacres of civilians by right-wing paramilitary forces
and assassinations of human rights workers.
	   Both candidates billed themselves as the best chance for peace
but the country's oldest and largest rebel group, the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, tacitly endorsed Pastrana last week.
	   Serpa has pledged to lower the work week from 48 to 40 hours,
earning the scorn of big business. Pastrana, the 44-year-old son of
the late President Misael Pastrana, promised a computer for every
schoolchild and a cut in the sales tax from 16 percent to 12
percent.

World Cup: Ortega, Batitusta lead Argentina to 5-0 rout 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional. UPDATES with quotes.
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Ariel Ortega did Diego Maradona's old jersey
justice. In terms of goalscoring, Gabriel Batistuta went one better
than Ortega.
	   Ortega scored the first two goals and Batistuta topped him with
a late, 11-minute hat-trick as Argentina trounced Jamaica 5-0
Sunday to roll into the World Cup round of 16. It also eliminated
the Reggae Boyz and Japan, both making their debuts.
	   The victory lifted two-time champion Argentina atop the Group H
standings with six points, above Croatia on goal difference, and
left Jamaica last with no points and a 1-8 goals tally. Japan also
has no points from two games and also goes out with a game to play.
	   ``We wanted to win to make sure we would qualify. And we knew
that we had to score several goals so as not to be at a
disadvantage against Croatia,'' said Argentina coach Daniel
Passarella, whose team faces Croatia Friday to close first-round
play. ``But sincerely I didn't think we would score so many.''
	   Taking advantage of a tentative and disorganized Jamaica, which
fell apart after an expulsion in first-half injury time, Argentina
dominated throughout at the muggy Parc des Princes.
	   Ortega was the catalyst.
	   The stocky playmaker, wearing the number 10 that Maradona donned
during his illustrious career, scored in the 32nd and 55th minutes
on similar, clinically-executed attacks.
	   Ortega then set up two of Batistuta's goals as the Fiorentina
striker connected in the 73rd, 79th and 83rd to move on top of the
tournament scoring table with four goals.
	   ``Ortega played a great game,'' Passarella said. ``He was beaten
up but fortunately not injured. He played a smart game, not only on
the individual level but also as a team player.''
	   Ortega put his team ahead after a maneuver that started just
inside Argentina's half.
	   Juan Veron swapped passes with Diego Simeone and then released
Ortega, who had made a perfectly-timed run down behind the defense.
The Valencia forward chipped the ball over charging 'keeper Warren
Barrett and into an empty net.
	   To make things worse for Jamaica, midfielder Darryl Powell was
sent off in first-half injury time for clattering into Ortega near
the sideline, his second yellow card of the game for a foul on the
24-year-old.
	   ``We played evenly until we had that expulsion,'' Jamaica coach
Rene Simoes said. ``When you play with 10 men against a team the
caliber of Argentina, you are likely to allow a lot of goals. We
don't have the proper experience.''
	   Ortega made it 2-0 10 minutes after halftime when he swapped
passes with Claudio Lopez just outside the Jamaican area, darted
through a gap in the defense and prodded the ball past Barrett.
	   Theodore Whitmore surprised the South Americans with a low,
25-meter (yard) shot that shaved the post but Argentina struck
right back to make it 3-0 in the 73rd.
	   Ortega was the provider this time, sliding a pass wide to
Batistuta with the outside of his right foot and the veteran
powered home a shot from just inside the area.
	   Six minutes later Batistuta took a pass from Matias Almeyda and
ran through a huge hole in the defense to fire home off Barrett's
fingertips.
	   Batistuta's third on the day came from the penalty spot, after
Christopher Dawes hauled down Ortega as the forward charged into
the area.
	   Argentina was impressive from the start, and Batistuta could
have scored twice inside the first 64 seconds.
	   First, the Jamaican defense gave him room to shoot and was lucky
that the striker slightly mis-hit the effort and Barrett slapped
the ball away. Argentina won a free kick almost immediately on the
right, Batistuta rose to meet Veron's well-flighted cross and
flashed a header wide.
	   After 10 minutes of total control by Argentina, Jamaica went
close to taking the lead.
	   Fitzroy Simpson got clear of Argentina's defense down the left
with only 'keeper Carlos Roa ahead of him but a defender got back
to block his shot.
	   Lineups:

After 10-year break, druids return for ceremony at Stonehenge 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For the first time in a decade, druids and other
pagan groups gathered within the encircling rocks of Stonehenge at
dawn on Sunday to celebrate the summer solstice.
	   Some 100 people, including members of six druid groups, held
ceremonies at the 5,000-year-old monument in southwest England.
	   In one, druids in white robes formed a circle in the center of
the stone circle, striking a Tibetan gong to mark the dawn of the
year's longest day.
	   Druids and other pagan groups were banned from holding
ceremonies at Stonehenge in the late 1980s after clashes with
police.
	   On Sunday, police controlled access to the site and patrolled a
wide area around it, but said there had been few problems. Six
people were arrested for minor breaches of public order, said a
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   On an overcast morning, the sun was nowhere to be seen, but
Stonehenge director Clews Everard said the event had been a
success. ``Stonehenge means different things to different people.
What we want to try to do is allow people to enjoy Stonehenge for
what it is to them,'' she said.
	   English Heritage, which owns the site, said the decision to
allow 100 people into the Stone Circle was the first step toward
admitting larger crowds.

Swiss government expels alleged Russian spy 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government has expelled a
Russian diplomat it accuses of spying, Federal Police Chief Urs von
Daeniken said Sunday.
	   Von Daeniken confirmed a report in the Zurich-based weekly
SonntagsZeitung that said the diplomat, accredited to the Russian
mission to U.N. offices in Geneva, left Swtizerland two weeks ago.
	   The diplomat was identified only by the initials M.A. He
received material on NATO and Slovakia from a Slovak diplomat, said
von Daeniken, who declined to give further details.

Despite tense relations, Mexico-U.S. talks open, frank 
</HEADLINE>
By JULIE WATSON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MORELIA, Mexico (AP) _ Frank talk about immigration, sovereignty
and trade failed to resolve major differences between U.S. and
Mexican legislators during their annual binational meeting .
	   Mexican legislators who opened the 37th U.S.-Mexico
Parliamentary Session with a searing reprimand Friday over a recent
U.S. money laundering sting on Mexican soil said they were at least
satisfied their message was heard. The meeting closed late
Saturday.
	   Although the U.S. delegation stood firm behind the controversial
undercover anti-drug operation known as Casablanca, Sen. Pat
Roberts, a Kansas Republican, said they learned an important
lesson.
	   ``I would say on behalf of the United States that we have
learned of course that your sovereignty must be paramount in
regards to any cooperative efforts that we have,'' the co-chairman
of the U.S. delegation told Mexican legislators.
	   Mexican officials said they were not properly notified about the
Drug Enforcement Administration's investigation that netted
mid-level employees from several Mexican banks, and that parts of
the operation conducted here violated Mexico's sovereignty.
	   The two sides also remained at odds over U.S. immigration
policies.
	   ``There exists a hypocrisy on the U.S. side to not admit migrant
workers who aid the U.S. economy, yet they are willing to relax
economic policies for the flow of trade,'' said Mexican Rep. Carlos
Heredia Zubieta of the lefist Democratic Revolutionary Party.
	   ``There's also a certain amount of racism that Canadians are not
required to present a visa to enter the United States and Mexicans
are, even though we are both NAFTA partners,'' he said.
	   Rep. Jim Kolbe, head of the U.S. delegation, said the U.S.
government admits more legal immigrants than any other nation _ and
has a right to control its borders.
	   ``We do believe every person who comes into our country has the
right to be respected and to certain constitutional rights,'' the
Arizona Republican said. ``But we will continue to enforce our
immigration laws.''
	   The lawmakers who met in this picturesque colonial town 135
miles (220 kilometers) west of Mexico City also discussed
environmental concerns, border infrastructure, and trade.
	   More than a dozen U.S. and Mexican lawmakers _ three Democrats
and 13 Mexican lawmakers _ signed a letter asking for an evaluation
of the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement between
Canada, Mexico and the United States.
	   Rep. William Delahunt, a Massachusetts Democrat, said he is
concerned about the loss of U.S. jobs to Mexico because of NAFTA.
Mexican wages are way below those of the U.S., inducing many plants
to relocate here.
	   Mexican legislators said they are concerned about increased U.S.
grain imports shutting out Mexico's small farmers. The group will
take the letter to Washington next month.
	   PAN members proposed lawmakers replace the annual talks with
permanent work committees that would meet several times a year to
address binational concerns.

Policeman in coma after clashes with German fans following Germany match; WILL be UPDATED with U.S.-Iran AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with policeman in coma from violence
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ One of the most thrilling days soccer-wise so far
at World Cup couldn't compete with another round of violence,
serious injuries and demonstrations away from the field.
	   A French policeman was in a coma Sunday night after being struck
on the head with an iron bar in clashes after Germany's World Cup
match against Yugoslavia.
	   Television footage showed the policeman lying on the pavement in
a pool of blood. French police said the person who attacked the
officer had been identified and arrested. His nationality was not
given.
	   About 50 German soccer fans were detained after clashes with
riot police before and after the match, which was played in the
nothern city of Lens. More than 20 of those detained before the
match were neo-Nazi skinheads.
	   Elsewhere, officials were hoping to thwart another round of
English fan violence ahead of Monday's England-Romania match in
Toulouse, and dissident Iranians protested ahead of Iran's
politically charged match against the United States in Lyon.
	   The developments overshadowed the first hat trick of the
tournament, scored by Gabriel Batistuta in Argentina's 5-0 rout of
Jamaica. All three of his goals came in the second half, with Ariel
Ortega netting twice in a result that put both Argentina and
Croatia into the second-round and eliminated newcomers Jamaica and
Japan.
	   Argentina scored enough times to move ahead of Croatia on goal
differential. Both have 6 points after two games and will play for
first place in Group F on Friday.
	   ``We knew that we had to score several goals so as not to be at
a disadvantage,'' Argentina coach Daniel Passarella said. ``But
sincerely I didn't think we would score so many.''
	   In a showdown between two of Europe's top teams, Germany rallied
from 2-0 down in the second half to salvage a 2-2 draw with
Yugoslavia.
	   Oliver Bierhoff's header in the 80th minute followed Michael
Tarnat's deflected free-kick goal in the 74th to keep Germany in
first place in Group F on goal differential. Dejan Stankovic and
Dragan Stojkovic netted for the Yugoslavs.
	   ``We made possible what seemed impossible,'' German coach Berti
Vogts said. ``We turned defeat into a near victory. ... They wanted
to toy with us instead of trying to score a third goal, and they
got punished for that.''
	   Tarnat's goal, a left-footed free kick from 25 meters, was
directed into the net by the outstretched right boot of Yugoslav
defender Sinisa Mihajlovic. Mihajlovic was originally cited for an
own goal, but the official scorers later gave the credit to Tarnat.
	   ``I am sad and happy,'' Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac said.
``I am happy with the outcome, but I am sad that we let the victory
slip away.''
	   Sunday's late game was the U.S.-Iran encounter. Iranians partied
on the streets before the game, while dissidents charged that
thousands more who wanted to come were turned away at the border by
French authorities giving in to pressure from Tehran.
	   The French Interior Ministry confirmed that a number of
dissident Iranians had been denied entry as security threats Sunday
morning while trying to enter by road from Belgium.
	   That didn't sit well with local Iranian resistance leaders, who
also accused the French of allowing Tehran government secret police
to scour the crowd for exiles they consider to be enemies.
	   ``Is this the claim that `football is not political?' ''
Mohammad Mohadessin, head of the foreign relations committee of the
Mujahedeen Khalq, told reporters in Lyon. ``It seems, that so long
as football serves the interest of the murderous mullahs in Iran,
it can be political.''
	   In Toulouse, more than 10,000 English fans were expected to
descend on the city, only half of them with tickets, ahead of
Monday's game against Romania. Although there were no early reports
of trouble, police, wary from the three days of violence
surrounding the England-Tunisia game in Marseille, on Sunday
detained four known hooligans from England.
	   Also Sunday, South Korea fired its coach, Cha Bum-kun, following
Saturday night's 5-0 loss to the Netherlands eliminated the Koreans
from second-round contention.
	   ``Somebody had to take responsibility,'' Chun Hanjin, the team
vice-manager said. ``It ends right here, right now for him.''
	   Cha's dismissal came one day after Saudi Arabia fired Carlos
Alberto Parreira. South Korea, co-host of the 2002 World Cup with
Japan, has never won a World Cup game in five appearances in the
tournament.
	   All this happened on Fair Play Day, set aside by FIFA to
underline sportsmanship in the globe's most popular game.
	   To mark the occasion, joint group photographs _ instead of one
per team _ were taken before Sunday's three matches.
	   ``The impact of this visual image will be quite substantial,
especially for the U.S.A.-Iran game,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper
said.

Facts on Jerusalem and the city's new expansion plan With Israel-Palestinian 
</HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
	   Some key facts and figures on Jerusalem, its borders and
expansion plans:
	   SIZE: Jerusalem's area is 125 square kilometers (48 square
miles) including annexed east Jerusalem, which Israel captured from
Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   In 1995, there were 591,400 residents _ 417,000 Jews and 174,400
Arabs.
	    &UR; ___
	   BORDERS: Following the 1967 war, the city's municipal borders
were expanded to include newly captured land. The city is
surrounded by a ring of Israeli suburban communities plus rapidly
growing West Bank settlements that are expected to become part of
Israel under a final peace agreement.
	    &UR; ___
	   EXPANSION PLAN: The plan approved Sunday by Israel's Cabinet
would create an ``umbrella authority'' headed by Jerusalem's mayor
that would bring the suburbs and several nearby West Bank
settlements under certain municipal authorities, notably planning
and building.
	   The plan is expected to include Maale Adumim, the largest Jewish
settlement plus several Israeli suburban communities to the west of
the city such as Mevaseret.
	    &UR; ___
	   WHAT'S NEXT: A committee supervised by the director-general of
the prime minister's office is to look into implementing the plan.
Israeli Infrastructure Minister Ariel Sharon is to decide which
settlements will be included. The Cabinet must approve any decision
by the committee or Sharon.
	    &UR; ___
	   ARGUMENTS: Israel says the plan is not political, but is
intended to streamline and improve services, to attract more
investment and industry to the city and increase the Jewish
population.
	   The Palestinians say the plan is a de facto annexation of West
Bank land and alters the status of Jerusalem, issues that are
supposed to be negotiated as part of a final peace settlement.

After 10-year break, druids return for ceremony at Stonehenge

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ For the first time in a decade, druids and other
pagan groups gathered within the encircling rocks of Stonehenge at
dawn on Sunday to celebrate the summer solstice.
	   Some 100 people, including members of six druid groups, held
ceremonies at the 5,000-year-old monument in southwest England.
	   In one, druids in white robes formed a circle in the center of
the stone circle, striking a Tibetan gong to mark the dawn of the
year's longest day.
	   Druids and other pagan groups were banned from holding

Arafat delays formation of new government 
</HEADLINE>
By IMAD MUSA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat informed PLO
officials Sunday that he will not meet a June 25 deadline to
reshuffle his Cabinet and will need more time to form a new
government, an aide said on Sunday.
	   Arafat had originally promised to present the list of new
ministers to the PLO Executive Committee last Friday, but asked for
more time to complete his consultations. ``The president ... will
need a few extra days beyond June 25 to present his government,''
said Tayeb Abdel Rahim, secretary-general of the Palestinian
Authority.
	   Other Palestinian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity
said it might take Arafat until the end of the month to form the
new Cabinet.
	   Last month the Palestinian legislature threatened a
no-confidence vote in the government, and in response Arafat
promised a prompt reshuffle of his Cabinet.
	   Speaker of the legislative council, Ahmed Qureia, said he had
not been asked to delay this week's scheduled no-confidence vote.
``It depends on the Council if the vote will still be held on
Thursday or not,'' he said.
	   Of the 24 Cabinet slots, seven need to be filled. Two ministers
passed away this year, four resigned, and the appointment of one
current minister was never approved by the legislature.
	   Arafat appeared to be using the time to consult and reconcile
with leader of Palestinian opposition groups such as Hamas and the
Islamic Jihad which oppose peace with Israel.
	   Taysir Khaled, a spokesman for the small Democratic Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, said its leader, Nayef Hawatmeh, may
meet with Arafat in Cairo ``within days.'' The two have not met
since Arafat signed peace accords with Israel in 1993.

Arafat delays formation of new government 
</HEADLINE>
By IMAD MUSA
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told PLO
officials Sunday that he will not meet a June 25 deadline to
reshuffle his Cabinet and will need more time to form a new
government, an aide said on Sunday.
	   Arafat appeared to be using the time to consult and reconcile
with leader of Palestinian opposition groups such as Hamas and the
Islamic Jihad which oppose peace with Israel.
	   He had originally promised to present the list of new ministers
to the PLO Executive Committee last Friday, but asked for more time
to complete his consultations.
	   ``The president ... will need a few extra days beyond June 25 to
present his government,'' said Tayeb Abdel Rahim, secretary-general
of the Palestinian Authority.
	   Other Palestinian officials who spoke on condition of anonymity
said it might take Arafat until the end of the month to form the
new Cabinet.
	   Last month the Palestinian legislature threatened a
no-confidence vote in the government, and in response Arafat
promised a prompt reshuffle of his Cabinet.
	   Speaker of the legislative council, Ahmed Qureia, said he had
not been asked to delay this week's scheduled no-confidence vote.
``It depends on the Council if the vote will still be held on
Thursday or not,'' he said.
	   Of the 24 Cabinet slots, seven need to be filled. Two ministers
died this year, four resigned, and the appointment of one current
minister was never approved by the legislature.
	   Taysir Khaled, a spokesman for the small Democratic Front for
the Liberation of Palestine, said its leader, Nayef Hawatmeh, may
meet with Arafat in Cairo ``within days.'' The two have not met
since Arafat signed peace accords with Israel in 1993.

Policeman in coma after clashes with German fans AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with police quotes; WILL be UPDATED with U.S.-Iran
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ One of the most thrilling days soccer-wise so far
at World Cup couldn't compete with another round of violence,
serious injury and demonstrations away from the field.
	   A French policeman was in a coma Sunday night after being struck
on the head with an iron bar in clashes after Germany's World Cup
match against Yugoslavia.
	   Television footage showed the policeman lying on the pavement in
a pool of blood. French police said the person who attacked the
officer had been identified and arrested. His nationality was not
given.
	   About 50 German soccer fans were detained after clashes with
riot police before and after the match, which was played in the
nothern city of Lens. More than 20 of those detained before the
match were skinheads, thought to have neo-Nazi connections.
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux said the hooligans were ``for the
most part sober _ not like the ones in Marseille,'' referring to
English soccer fans who rampaged in the southern French city last
Monday after a match against Tunisia.
	   He also said they were ``perfectly organized with means of
communication.''
	   ``They didn't come to support their team,'' Cadoux said. ``They
came to smash things up, to attack security forces.''
	   Elsewhere, officials were hoping to thwart another round of
English fan violence ahead of Monday's England-Romania match in
Toulouse, and dissident Iranians protested ahead of Iran's
politically charged match against the United States in Lyon.
	   The developments overshadowed the first hat trick of the
tournament, scored by Gabriel Batistuta in Argentina's 5-0 rout of
Jamaica. All three of his goals came in the second half, with Ariel
Ortega netting twice in a result that put both Argentina and
Croatia into the second-round and eliminated newcomers Jamaica and
Japan.
	   Argentina scored enough times to move ahead of Croatia on goal
differential. Both have 6 points after two games and will play for
first place in Group F on Friday.
	   ``We knew that we had to score several goals so as not to be at
a disadvantage,'' Argentina coach Daniel Passarella said. ``But
sincerely I didn't think we would score so many.''
	   In a showdown between two of Europe's top teams, Germany rallied
from 2-0 down in the second half to salvage a 2-2 draw with
Yugoslavia.
	   Oliver Bierhoff's header in the 80th minute followed Michael
Tarnat's deflected free-kick goal in the 74th to keep Germany in
first place in Group F on goal differential. Dejan Stankovic and
Dragan Stojkovic netted for the Yugoslavs.
	   ``We made possible what seemed impossible,'' German coach Berti
Vogts said. ``We turned defeat into a near victory. ... They wanted
to toy with us instead of trying to score a third goal, and they
got punished for that.''
	   Tarnat's goal, a left-footed free kick from 25 meters, was
directed into the net by the outstretched right boot of Yugoslav
defender Sinisa Mihajlovic. Mihajlovic was originally cited for an
own goal, but the official scorers later gave the credit to Tarnat.
	   ``I am sad and happy,'' Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac said.
``I am happy with the outcome, but I am sad that we let the victory
slip away.''
	   Sunday's late game was the U.S.-Iran encounter. Iranians partied
on the streets before the game, while dissidents charged that
thousands more who wanted to come were turned away at the border by
French authorities giving in to pressure from Tehran.
	   The French Interior Ministry confirmed that a number of
dissident Iranians had been denied entry as security threats Sunday
morning while trying to enter by road from Belgium.
	   That didn't sit well with local Iranian resistance leaders, who
also accused the French of allowing Tehran government secret police
to scour the crowd for exiles they consider to be enemies.
	   ``Is this the claim that `football is not political?' ''
Mohammad Mohadessin, head of the foreign relations committee of the
Mujahedeen Khalq, told reporters in Lyon. ``It seems, that so long
as football serves the interest of the murderous mullahs in Iran,
it can be political.''
	   In Toulouse, more than 10,000 English fans were expected to
descend on the city, only half of them with tickets, ahead of
Monday's game against Romania. Although there were no early reports
of trouble, wary police on Sunday detained four known hooligans
from England.
	   Also Sunday, South Korea fired its coach, Cha Bum-kun, following
Saturday night's 5-0 loss to the Netherlands eliminated the Koreans
from second-round contention.
	   ``Somebody had to take responsibility,'' Chun Hanjin, the team
vice-manager said. ``It ends right here, right now for him.''
	   Cha's dismissal came one day after Saudi Arabia fired Carlos
Alberto Parreira. South Korea, co-host of the 2002 World Cup with
Japan, has never won a World Cup game in five appearances in the
tournament.
	   All this happened on Fair Play Day, set aside by FIFA to
underline sportsmanship in the globe's most popular game.
	   To mark the occasion, joint group photographs _ instead of one
per team _ were taken before Sunday's three matches.
	   ``The impact of this visual image will be quite substantial,
especially for the U.S.A.-Iran game,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper
said.

EDS: UPDATES with quotes from regional prefect; version moving on
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ A French policeman was in a coma Sunday
night after being struck on the head with an iron bar in clashes
after Germany's World Cup match against Yugoslavia.
	   Television footage showed the policeman lying on the pavement in
a pool of blood.
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux told a news conference that the
person who attacked the officer had been identified and arrested.
His nationality was not given.
	   About 50 German soccer fans were detained Sunday after clashes
with riot police before and after the match in Lens, northern
France.
	   A Brazilian television cameraman was also injured in clashes,
police said.
	   Cadoux said the hooligans were ``for the most part sober _ not

rampaged in the southern French city last Monday after a match
against Tunisia.
	   He also said they were ``perfectly organized with means of

	   ``They didn't come to support their team,'' Cadoux said. ``They
came to smash things up, to attack security forces.''
	   Before the match, more than 20 German skinheads were detained
downtown and outside the stadium.
	   Police used sticks to battle the Germans, who reportedly
included known groups of neo-Nazis who had arrived by train.
	   Riot police brought in reinforcements and sealed off the
downtown area.
	   Around 30 Germans were arrested after the match, police said.
	   Bar and restaurant owners, fearing further violence, closed
early evening.
	   Many German fans who were victims of a ticket swindle had come
to Lens despite not being able to get into the match, which ended
2-2.

Opposition party says it will join demonstrations 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The opposition People's National
Congress said Sunday it will throw its support behind
anti-government street demonstrations that have seethed in
Georgetown for four days.
	   Leader Desmond Hoyte said his party did not organize the first
demonstrations, which have been marked by violent clashes with
police, but that it sympathizes with protesters who claim President
Janet Jagan's People's Progressive Party rigged the elections in
December.
	   ``The PNC therefore will adopt these protests with a view to
sharpening their focus and clarifying their objectives in the
interest of good order and effectiveness,'' Hoyte said.
	   He said the party would hold a public meeting in the Square of
the Revolution, a favorite assembly point for demonstrators, in the
next few days.
	   Race riots broke out following the elections as Guyanese of
African descent, who primarily support Hoyte's party, protested the
win by Jagan's party, which is backed by people of East Indian
descent.
	   Most conflicts in this former British colony in South America
are linked to friction between the two ethnic groups.
	   The Caribbean Community trade organization brokered a shaky
peace in January by promising to audit the election results. On
June 2, auditors said the elections were fair, touching off the new
protests.
	   During clashes Thursday and Friday, demonstrators hurled stones
at police and smashed store windows in downtown Georgetown. Police
used tear gas and fired automatic rifles into the air to clear the
crowds.
	   Jagan on Sunday urged protesters to stop the demonstrations.
	   ``The street activity will not unseat me,'' Jagan said during
her weekly television address. ``If any of these people who are
demonstrating on the streets are related to you, whether your
neighbor, your uncle, son, your brother or whatever, tell them to
stop this nonsense.''

Iran's interior minister impeached but Khatami carries on fight group; TRIMS 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Cabinet meeting; reaction from Iranian opposition
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-line lawmakers impeached Iran's
moderate interior minister Sunday, but President Mohammad Khatami
swiftly countered by naming him to the newly created post of deputy
president.
	   Barely an hour after the impeachment vote, Khatami sent
hard-liners a clear message he would not abandon his battle to ease
some of the harsher social restrictions of Iran's 19-year-old
Islamic fundamentalist government.
	   He named the impeached Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri to the
new job of deputy president for development and social affairs.
	   ``Due to your capabilities and ... the importance of
comprehensive and lasting development, especially political and
social affairs ... I appoint you as the deputy president for
development and social affairs.'' Khatami said in a two-line
statement.
	   Khatami also appointed the deputy interior minister for social
affairs, Mostafa Tajzadeh, as acting interior minister. Tajzadeh
staunchly supports both Khatami and Nouri.
	   Sunday's developments _ coming in the wake of a corruption trial
of Tehran's pro-Khatami mayor and the recent closure of several
liberal publications _ signaled a heightening power struggle within
the ruling clergy since Khatami took office in August.
	   An hour after the 137-128 vote with three abstentions in the
270-member Majlis, or Parliament, Khatami named Nouri to the new
post, demonstrating the lengths to which he will go to challenge
the hard-liners.
	   Addressing his Cabinet, Khatami said he respected the
Parliament's decision but declared that the new interior minister
will carry on Nouri's work.
	   ``We are all obedient of law (but) we believe this issue along
with other big issues ahead of the government are solvable,''
Khatami said.
	   Analysts said that showed Khatami's determination about reforms.
	   ``Khatami is serious in his efforts to protect political
freedoms,'' said Mohammad Hashemi, a law professor at the Shahid
Beheshti University in Tehran.
	   ``The deputies aimed to weaken Khatami but they will not
succeed. The winning card is in Khatami's hand. Khatami has the
support of the people and he has the nation's confidence,'' Hashemi
told The Associated Press.
	   Khatami's landslide victory in May 1997 shook the foundations of
Iran's clerical rule, which had curbed civil liberties since taking
power in the 1979 Islamic revolution led by the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   Hard-liners backed by Khomeini's successor, Ali Khamenei, have
waged a campaign to discredit Khatami and his supporters since he
became president.
	   Nouri is only the second Cabinet minister to be impeached since
the revolution.
	   The impeachment proved ``that the clerical regime cannot
tolerate the slightest deviation from the ... absolute rule of the
clerics,'' an Iranian opposition group in exile, the National
Council of Resistance of Iran, said in a statement faxed to the AP
in Cairo.
	   It said the hard-liners are already preparing to impeach other
Cabinet ministers.
	   Thirty-one hard-line deputies started impeachment proceedings
last month, accusing Nouri of, among other things, jeopardizing the
Islamic nation's stability and allowing a rally last month
protesting the hard-line clergy's influence in Iran.
	   The motion accused Nouri, a clergyman, of ``creating tension in
the society, making provocative interviews and speeches in
different provinces and appointing inexperienced people to
managerial posts at the ministry.''
	   Speaking in Parliament before the vote, Nouri defended his
appointments, including Tajzadeh's.
	   ``I do not claim that I have never made a mistake. However, you
should realize there is a plot afoot to separate the young, bright
university generation from the revolution and the clergy,'' he told
a packed parliament hall.
	   Several hard-line deputies claimed drug-smuggling, kidnappings
and violence had increased since Nouri assumed power. They also
accused Nouri of hiring people who were not entirely committed to
the ideals of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution and for firing people
who were not liberals.

Two policemen injured in fresh street violence in Spain's Basque region 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   PORTUGALETE, Spain (AP) _ Two policemen were slightly injured
when 150 hooded youths went on a vandalism spree before dawn Sunday
in a northern Basque town, authorities said.
	   Gangs of hooded youths, believed to be backed by the armed
Basque separatist group ETA, regularly clash with police and stage
weekend vandalism sprees in towns and cities in the Basque region.
	   The youths, who separated into several groups, tossed fire
bombs, set fires in garbage containers and broke street light
transformers, leaving the old city dark, police said.
	   No detentions were reported in the small town of Portugalete,
300 kilometers, (189 miles) northeast of Madrid.
	   The two policemen were hurt by fire bombs when they were trying
to prevent a bus from being burned by a group of youths. They were
treated at a nearby hospital, the Interior Ministry said.

will carry on Nouri's work.
	   ``We are all obedient of law (but) we believe this issue along
with other big issues ahead of the government are solvable,''
Khatami said.
	   Analysts said that showed Khatami's determination about reforms.
	   ``Khatami is serious in his efforts to protect political
freedoms,'' said Mohammad Hashemi, a law professor at the Shahid
Beheshti University in Tehran.
	   Khatami's landslide victory in May 1997 shook the foundations of
Iran's clerical rule, which had curbed civil liberties since the
1979 Islamic revolution led by the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini.
	   Hard-liners backed by Khomeini's successor, Ali Khamenei, have
waged a campaign to discredit Khatami and his supporters since he
became president.
	   Nouri is only the second Cabinet minister to be impeached since
the revolution.
	   The impeachment proved ``that the clerical regime cannot
tolerate the slightest deviation from the ... absolute rule of the
clerics,'' an Iranian opposition group in exile, the National
Council of Resistance of Iran, said in a statement faxed to the AP
in Cairo.
	   It said the hard-liners are already preparing to impeach other
Cabinet ministers.
	   The motion accused Nouri, a clergyman, of jeopardizing the
Islamic nation's stability and allowing a rally last month to
protest the influence of the hard-line clergy in Iran and
``creating tension in the society, making provocative interviews
and speeches in different provinces and appointing inexperienced
people to managerial posts at the ministry.''
	   Speaking in Parliament before the vote, Nouri defended his
appointments, including Tajzadeh's.
	   ``I do not claim that I have never made a mistake. However, you
should realize there is a plot afoot to separate the young, bright
university generation from the revolution and the clergy,'' he told
a packed parliament hall.
	   Several hard-line deputies claimed drug-smuggling, kidnappings
and violence had increased since Nouri assumed power. They also
accused Nouri of hiring people who were not entirely committed to
the ideals of Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution and for firing people
who were not liberals.

World Cup: South Koreans train under new coach 
</HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT QUENTIN, France (AP) _ It was a silent and subdued South
Korean national team that trained under the guidance of its new
coach on Sunday, following the sacking of Cha Bum-kun.
	   Cha, dismissed on Sunday following the team's dismal 5-0 defeat
to the Netherlands the night before, was packing his bags for his
return to South Korea.
	   Promoted from assistant to head coach, Kim Pyong-seok led the
bruised South Korean soccer team through a series of post-match
exercises at their training base just outside of Paris, attempting
to restore the players' faith in themselves after their elimination
at the hands of the Dutch.
	   Although the team arrived in France simply hoping to post the
nation's first World Cup win in five appearances, it later got
caught up in the hype and excitement of the showcase tournament and
raised its sights to a place in the second round.
	   But after a 3-0 loss to Mexico and its crushing defeat to the
Netherlands on Saturday, the Asian team's ambitions have been
deflated.
	   ``The team at training today are all hoping for a win to end the
tournament on a high note after its failures and after the
departure of Mr. Cha,'' said Kim, who played on the South Korean
national squad at the 1986 World Cup in Mexico with Cha. ``The
players want to win for him.''
	   The players didn't seem to feel that their performance in the
match against Netherlands, which sealed Cha's fate, was
disappointing.
	   Goalkeeper Kim Byong-ji for one, felt that the South Korean
team's effort against the soccer powerhouse was fairly respectable.
	   ``It was a good match,'' said Kim. ``The whole team worked very
hard, but the Dutch were just so strong ... I think I can do better
against Belgium.''

RETRANSMITS to fix slug

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Hard-line lawmakers impeached Iran's
moderate interior minister Sunday, but President Mohammad Khatami
swiftly countered by naming him to the newly created post of deputy
president.
	   Barely an hour after the impeachment vote, Khatami sent
hard-liners a clear message he would not abandon his battle to ease
some of the harsher social restrictions of Iran's 19-year-old
Islamic fundamentalist government.
	   He named the impeached Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri to the
new job of deputy president for development and social affairs.
	   ``Due to your capabilities and ... the importance of
comprehensive and lasting development, especially political and
social affairs ... I appoint you as the deputy president for
development and social affairs.'' Khatami said in a two-line
statement.
	   Khatami also appointed the deputy interior minister for social
affairs, Mostafa Tajzadeh, as acting interior minister. Tajzadeh
staunchly supports both Khatami and Nouri.
	   Sunday's developments _ coming in the wake of a corruption trial
of Tehran's pro-Khatami mayor and the recent closure of several
liberal publications _ signaled a heightening power struggle within
the ruling clergy since Khatami took office in August.
	   An hour after the 137-128 vote with three abstentions in the
270-member Majlis, or Parliament, Khatami named Nouri to the new
post, demonstrating the lengths to which he will go to challenge
the hard-liners.
	   Addressing his Cabinet, Khatami said he respected the
Parliament's decision but declared that the new interior minister
will carry on Nouri's work.
	   ``We are all obedient of law (but) we believe this issue along
with other big issues ahead of the government are solvable,''
Khatami said.
	   Analysts said that showed Khatami's determination about reforms.
	   ``Khatami is serious in his efforts to protect political
freedoms,'' said Mohammad Hashemi, a law professor at the Shahid
Beheshti University in Tehran.
	   ``The deputies aimed to weaken Khatami but they will not
succeed. The winning card is in Khatami's hand. Khatami has the
support of the people and he has the nation's confidence,'' Hashemi
told The Associated Press.
	   Khatami's landslide victory in May 1997 shook the foundations of
Iran's clerical rule, which had curbed civil liberties since taking
power in the 1979 Islamic revolution led by the late Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini.
	   Hard-liners backed by Khomeini's successor, Ali Khamenei, have
waged a campaign to discredit Khatami and his supporters since he
became president.
	   Nouri is only the second Cabinet minister to be impeached since
the revolution.
	   The impeachment proved ``that the clerical regime cannot
tolerate the slightest deviation from the ... absolute rule of the
clerics,'' an Iranian opposition group in exile, the National
Council of Resistance of Iran, said in a statement faxed to the AP
in Cairo.
	   It said the hard-liners are already preparing to impeach other
Cabinet ministers.
	   Thirty-one hard-line deputies started impeachment proceedings
last month, accusing Nouri of, among other things, jeopardizing the
Islamic nation's stability and allowing a rally last month
protesting the hard-line clergy's influence in Iran.
	   The motion accused Nouri, a clergyman, of ``creating tension in
the society, making provocative interviews and speeches in
different provinces and appointing inexperienced people to
managerial posts at the ministry.''
	   Speaking in Parliament before the vote, Nouri defended his
appointments, including Tajzadeh's.
	   ``I do not claim that I have never made a mistake. However, you
should realize there is a plot afoot to separate the young, bright
university generation from the revolution and the clergy,'' he told
a packed parliament hall.
	   Several hard-line deputies claimed drug-smuggling, kidnappings
and violence had increased since Nouri assumed power. They also
accused Nouri of hiring people who were not entirely committed to

Stewart guards his lead on an unforgiving course AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: will be UPDATED when leaders finish nine holes
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ The unfriendly clouds piled up by a
sinister Pacific breeze served as a reminder to Payne Stewart how
quickly things can change at the U.S. Open.
	   The four-stroke lead he carried into Sunday's final round at The
Olympic Club was as fragile as the changing weather on the
California coast, especially considering his four closest rivals
have all won major championships.
	   Especially considering that the three other times the U.S. Open
was held at Olympic the players who had the lead coming into the
final round _ Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson _ all
finished second.
	   And especially considering that the man Stewart was paired with
in the final round _ Tom Lehman _ is playing in the final group on
the final day at the U.S. Open for the fourth consecutive year.
	   Lehman, the 1996 British Open winner, and Bob Tway, who won the
U.S. PGA Championship in 1986, started the final round four strokes
behind Stewart's 3-under-par 207.
	   Lee Janzen, who held off Stewart to win the 1993 U.S. Open at
Baltusrol, and Nick Price, winner of the PGA Championship in 1992
and '94 and the British Open in '94, were five strokes back at 212.
	   Steve Stricker and Jeff Maggert were at 213.
	   ``I'm not going out there and trying to play against Tom Lehman
tomorrow,'' Stewart said after a 71 on Saturday to build the
largest 54-hole lead at the U.S. Open since Tony Jacklin was four
ahead after three rounds in his winning effort in 1970.
	   ``I'm going to go out there and try and play against the golf
course,'' Stewart said.
	   That has been no easy task this week. The firm, fast and
frightening Lake Course at Olympic has yielded only two 66s and
three 67s through three rounds, and Stewart was the only player
under par heading to Sunday.
	   And in the three previous U.S. Opens played at Olympic only four
players _ Palmer and winner Billy Casper in 1966 and Watson and
winner Scott Simpson in 1987 _ finished 72 holes below par.
	   In all likelihood, if Stewart shoots a 70 on Sunday no one will
catch him.
	   ``Well, that might be true, that might be true,'' Stewart said.
``That won't be my approach. I'm going to try to do the things I've
been doing and that's take advantage of my good shots and deal with
my bad ones and not make too many mistakes.
	   Stewart has been brilliant at containing his mistakes this week.
Through 54 holes he had yet to make a double bogey.
	   On the other hand, Janzen played the 468-yard (427.8-meter)
par-4 17th hole 5 over par trough three rounds and Lehman has made
two double bogeys.
	   After all of the talk last year about the new breed in golf when
three of the four major championships were won by Tiger Woods Ernie
Els and Justin Leonard _ all under 30 - this is turning into a good
year for the old guys.
	   Mark O'Meara, 41, won the Masters while Stewart and Price are
both 41 and Lehman and Tway are 39. Woods, Els and Leonard,
meanwhile, are well out of contention.
	   Price also has another historical connection to Sunday's doings
at Olympic. The last 14 major championships were won by 14
different people _ going back to when Price won British Open and
the PGA in 1994.
	   And if Price wins he will become only the 10th player in history
to win three of the four legs of the career Grand Slam.
	   If the history of U.S. Opens at Olympic holds to form someone
will come from off the pace to win again this year. And if that is
the case there would be no more deserving winner than Lehman.
	   The last three years he has gone into the final round either
leading or tied for the lead at the Open only to finish third,
second and third.
	   He has been overwhelming in the third rounds, shooting 67, 65,
68 and 68 the last for years. But he has been an underachiever in
the final round, shooting 74, 71 and 73 going into Sunday.
	   ``I don't think it owes me one,'' Lehman said. ``I think I owe
myself one, though.''
	   And if there is an unsettling thought for Stewart, it is that
Hogan, Palmer and Watson all left Olympic feeling it owed them one.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Over American protests, Israel's Cabinet
unanimously approved a plan Sunday that would extend Jerusalem
municipal authority over nearby Jewish settlements in the West
Bank.
	   Palestinians charged that Israel was violating the
Israel-Palestinian peace accords by unilaterally expanding
Jerusalem's borders and annexing West Bank land.
	   Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Ziad, whose views reflect
official Palestinian policy on Jerusalem, called the plan ``de
facto annexation'' of the settlements to Israel.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority will do what it can to confront this
challenge,'' he said. ``The people must stand up to defend
Jerusalem.''
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat called the plan a
``declaration of war against the Arab presence in Jerusalem. The
world must look to this step as a very dangerous one because it
means the end of the negotiations before they even begin,'' Erekat
said.

Premier says Russia needs `quick, tough and ... unpopular measures' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's new prime minister promised Sunday to
impose ``quick, tough and often unpopular measures'' to turn around
the country's ailing economy.
	   Sergei Kiriyenko said he would meet with President Boris Yeltsin
on Monday to finalize the government's anti-crisis program, which
is aimed at turning around the problems that led to a crash in
Russian financial markets last month.
	   Appearing on the weekly program ``Zerkolo'' (``Mirror''),
Kiriyenko said it was clear what the government needed to do, but
that knowledge wouldn't make it any easier.
	   The International Monetary Fund, whose representatives are to
meet with Russian leaders in the coming week, is said to have told
Russia it needs to slash its budget, dramatically improve tax
collection and make its financial workings more visible.
	   Speaking of the anti-crisis measures, Kiriyenko said, ``It will
be a program of quick, tough and often unpopular measures.''
	   ``It will take colossal political courage to pass it,'' he
added. ``And it will take colossal consolidation of all ways and
means of the authorities ... to implement it.''

World Cup: Ortega, Batitusta lead Argentina to 5-0 rout 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with more quotes.
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Ariel Ortega did Diego Maradona's old jersey
justice. In terms of goalscoring, Gabriel Batistuta did Ortega one
better.
	   Ortega scored the first two goals and Batistuta topped him with
a late, 11-minute hat-trick as Argentina trounced Jamaica 5-0
Sunday to roll into the World Cup round of 16. It also eliminated
the Reggae Boyz and Japan, both making their debuts.
	   The victory lifted two-time champion Argentina atop Group H with
six points, above Croatia on goal difference, and left Jamaica last
with no points and a 1-8 goals tally. Japan also has no points from
two games.
	   ``We wanted to win to make sure we would qualify. And we knew
that we had to score several goals so as not to be at a
disadvantage against Croatia,'' said Argentina coach Daniel
Passarella, whose team faces Croatia Friday to close first-round
play.
	   ``But sincerely I didn't think we would score so many.''
	   Batistuta did, and now he'd like to be this World Cup's top
scorer.
	   ``Well, I hope so,'' he said. ``That's why I'm here, but it's
not easy.
	   ``We came to take the Cup, but there are other teams that will
fight us hard for it. Even so, we'll give it our best shot.''
	   ``Jamaica went down a little after the first goal. From then on
everything was easy,'' the Fiorentina star said.
	   Taking advantage of a tentative and disorganized Jamaica, which
fell apart after an expulsion in first-half injury time, Argentina
dominated throughout at the muggy Parc des Princes.
	   Ortega was the catalyst.
	   The stocky playmaker, wearing the number 10 that Maradona donned
during his illustrious career, scored in the 32nd and 55th minutes
on similar, clinically-executed attacks.
	   Ortega then set up two of Batistuta's goals as the Fiorentina
striker connected in the 73rd, 79th and 83rd to move on top of the
tournament scoring table with four goals.
	   ``Ortega played a great game,'' Passarella said. ``He was beaten
up but fortunately not injured. He played a smart game, not only on
the individual level but also as a team player.''
	   Juan Veron swapped passes with Diego Simeone and then released
Ortega, who had made a perfectly-timed run down behind the defense.
The Valencia forward chipped the ball over charging 'keeper Warren
Barrett and into an empty net.
	   To make things worse for Jamaica, midfielder Darryl Powell was
sent off in first-half injury time for clattering into Ortega near
the sideline, his second yellow card of the game for a foul on the
24-year-old.
	   ``We played evenly until we had that expulsion,'' Jamaica coach
Rene Simoes said. ``When you play with 10 men against a team the
caliber of Argentina, you are likely to allow a lot of goals. We
don't have the proper experience.''
	   Ortega made it 2-0 10 minutes after halftime when he swapped
passes with Claudio Lopez just outside the Jamaican area, darted
through a gap in the defense and prodded the ball past Barrett.
	   Ortega was the provider for the third, sliding a pass wide to
Batistuta with the outside of his right foot and the veteran
powered home a shot from just inside the area.
	   Six minutes later Batistuta took a pass from Matias Almeyda and
ran through a huge hole in the defense to fire home off Barrett's
fingertips.
	   Batistuta's third on the day came from the penalty spot, after
Christopher Dawes hauled down Ortega as the forward charged into
the area.
	   ``Batistuta deserves to have scored all those goals because he
worked very hard,'' said Passarella, who dropped the man known as
``Batigol'' from the lineup during qualifying. ``I hope he'll keep
scoring and bring Argentina to the final.''
	   Roa was hardly threatened otherwise and Argentina registered its
seventh straight shutout, including warmup games.
	   ``Since we play with a three man line on defense, sometimes it
looks like we leave too much space for dangerous balls,'' Roberto
Ayala said. ``But if you watched today, Roa had no work to do.''
	   Lineups:
	   Argentina_Carlos Roa; Roberto Ayala, Jose Chamot, Roberto
Sensini (Nelson Vivas, 25th), Javier Zanetti; Matias Almeyda, Diego
Simeone (Hector Pineda, 79th), Ariel Ortega, Juan Veron; Claudio

Cabinet approves plan to extend Jerusalem authority to settlements

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Over American protests, Israel's Cabinet
unanimously approved a plan Sunday that would extend Jerusalem
municipal authority over nearby Jewish settlements in the West
Bank.
	   Palestinians charged that Israel was violating the
Israel-Palestinian peace accords by unilaterally expanding
Jerusalem's borders and annexing West Bank land.
	   Palestinian legislator Ziad Abu Ziad, whose views reflect
official Palestinian policy on Jerusalem, called the plan ``de
facto annexation'' of the settlements to Israel.
	   ``The Palestinian Authority will do what it can to confront this
challenge,'' he said. ``The people must stand up to defend
Jerusalem.''
	   Senior Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat called the plan a
``declaration of war against the Arab presence in Jerusalem. The
world must look to this step as a very dangerous one because it
means the end of the negotiations before they even begin,'' Erekat
said.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu rejected those charges,
accusing the Palestinians of creating an ``artificial storm'' for
political gain.
	   ``This is an important decision aimed at strengthening
Jerusalem,'' he said in a news conference. ``We are not changing
the status of any one of these communities or of Jerusalem. ...
There is no violation of the Oslo accords.''
	   Netanyahu claimed that the Palestinians were the ones violating
the peace accords by trying to establish authority in Jerusalem.
	   The United States called the plan ``provocative,'' coming at a
delicate point when U.S. officials are trying to shepherd the two
sides to reluctant agreement on an Israeli withdrawal from the West
Bank. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright urged Netanyahu in
a telephone call to have the Cabinet reconsider.
	   The plan does not annex the West Bank settlements in question,
which surround Jerusalem to the north, south and east _ they will
continue to pay local property taxes and vote in their own
jurisdictions, Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said.
	   But it sets up an ``umbrella authority'' _ putting the
settlements under Jerusalem municipal authority for certain
services, notably building and planning. Settlements normally have
to get approval from the defense ministry for any construction.
	   ``It's the first time that regional powers concerning a region
of the West Bank will be vested in a civilian Israeli organ,''
lawyer and peace activist Danny Seidemann said.
	   The United States has called for a ``time-out'' on any expansion
of Jewish settlements in an effort to help re-start the stalled
peace talks.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat gave U.S. Consul-General John
Herbst a letter Sunday for U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright telling her that the Palestinians ``will not accept any
adjustments to the U.S. initiative and demand its implementation as
is,'' according to Arafat aide Nabil Abourdeneh. The letter was in
response to one Arafat received from Albright a day earlier
confirming the American commitment to the peace process, in light
of the new Jerusalem expansion plan.

	   HEBRON, West Bank (AP) _ A rare Israeli offer for compensation
made Sunday to the widow and children of a Palestinian man clubbed
to death last week by a Jewish youth was greeted with mixed
reaction by the family Sunday.
	   Abdel Abu Turki was walking home from his fields June 16 with a
cousin when a 16-year-old Jewish youth apparently leaned out of a
van carrying six other friends and wacked Abu Turki on the back of
the head with a wooden plank. The blow killed Abu Turki almost
instantly. The youth and another 16-year-old in the car with him,
are in Israeli custody.
	   ``I have come to express our sorrow with this ugly crime,''
Labor Minister Eli Ishai told the Abu Turki family, making the
first condolence call by an Israeli official.

French policeman in coma after being hit by German hooligan color from Lens, adds byline.

EDS: UPDATES with nationality of aggressor, details of policeman,
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ A French policeman was in a coma Sunday
night after being struck on the head with an iron bar in clashes
after Germany's World Cup match against Yugoslavia.
	   Television footage showed the policeman lying on the pavement in
a pool of blood. The officer, identified as 44-year-old Daniel
Nivel, is married with two children, police said, and from the
nearby town of Arres.
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux told a news conference that the
man who attacked the officer had been arrested. The officer was
flown by helicopter to a hospital in the city of Lille.
	   He said 86 soccer fans _ mostly Germans _ were detained Sunday
after clashes with riot police before and after the match in Lens,
northern France.
	   Six of the people detained _ again, mostly Germans _ were
immediately deported, Cadoux said.
	   A Brazilian television cameraman was also injured in clashes,
police said, although he was not in serious condition.
	   Cadoux said the German hooligans were ``for the most part sober
_ not like the ones in Marseille,'' referring to English soccer
fans who rampaged in the southern French city last Monday after a
match against Tunisia.
	   He also said they were ``perfectly organized with means of
communication.''
	   ``They didn't come to support their team,'' Cadoux said. ``They
came to smash things up, to attack security forces.''
	   Before the match, more than 20 German skinheads were detained.
Police used sticks to battle the Germans, who included known groups
of neo-Nazis who had arrived by train.
	   Riot police brought in reinforcements and sealed off the
downtown area.
	   As many as 450 skinheads were seen on the streets of Lens before
and after the match giving Nazi salutes.
	   As night fell, police patrolled the town in cars, but the
atmosphere was calm, and most fans had left. Most bar and
restaurant owners, fearing further violence, had closed shortly
after the match.
	   Only small groups of Germans wearing their national colors were
in the streets.
	   Many German fans who were victims of a ticket swindle had come
to Lens despite not being able to get into the match, which ended
2-2.

Report: Remains of Israeli soldier to be returned at end of this week 
</HEADLINE>
By VITA BEKKER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The body of an Israeli soldier killed in
Lebanon will be returned to Israel at the end of this week, as a
part of swap with Iranian-backed guerrillas, Israel's Channel 2 TV
said Sunday.
	   Late Sunday or early Monday, Israel will begin digging up the
bodies of sixty Lebanese guerrillas killed in fighting and buried
by Israel, as part of the exchange, according to Channel 2.
	   Israel has been negotiating with Lebanon for the return of
soldier Itamar Ilya's body since Sept. 5, when he was killed left
behind after a botched Israeli commando raid into Lebanese
territory.
	   After Ilya's body is back in Israel and identified, Israel will
release the bodies of 60 Iranian-backed Hezbollah soldiers, the
report said.
	   According to Israeli sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Israel will then release fifty Hezbollah soldiers, ten
from Israeli prisons and forty from Elchion prison in South
Lebanon, the sources told The Associated Press.
	   The swap will not begin before Wednesday, when Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri is scheduled to return to Lebanon from visits
abroad, the sources said.
	   Israel patrols a security zone in south Lebanon it set up in
1985 to prevent cross-border guerrilla attacks on its northern
communities. Since then, Israel has been engaged in a costly
on-going war with Hezbollah which vows to oust Israel from Lebanese
territory.

World Cup: Estili header gives Iran 1-0 lead 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Hamid Estili headed in a cross from Javad
Zarincheh in the 40th minute, giving Iran a 1-0 halftaime lead over
the United States Sunday night in a pivotal World Cup group match
for both sides.
	   The goal came against the run of play as the Americans hit the
post twice in the first half and controlled most of the possession.
	   Zarincheh broke down the right side and lofted a cross to an
unmarked Estili, who lofted a header across the goal into the upper
left corner.
	   Until the goal, the United States had the better chances.
	   Brian McBride sent a header from 15 meters off the top of the
crossbar after only three minutes and Claudio Reyna hit the right
post with a left-footed shot from 25 meters in the 33rd.
	   Besides being the most politically charged match of the 64-game
tournament, both teams needed a victory to keep their second-round
hopes alive.
	   Iran seemed content to counter and their extended offensive
possessions rarely produced anything dangerous.
	   Despite being enemies since the Iran's Islamic revolution in
1979, where radical students held 52 American embassy employees
hostage for 444 days, none of the animosity was present between the
two teams before the match.
	   Each of the Iranian starters, as they did in their first game
against Yugoslavia, presented their American counterparts with
flowers and, in an uprecedented move, the two teams joined for a
group photo instead of the customary two separate squad shots.
	   During pre-game warmups, as the players stretched the crowd
partied to the Macarena, including one female Iranian fan gyrating
in the very un-Islamic attire of tight shorts and a bare-midrif
T-shirt.
	   Iranian flags fluttered in the evening breeze next to the
stars-and-stripes and fans swayed side-by-side to both American and
Arabic music.
	   FIFA's announced ban on political displays was ignored by a
group of Iranian dissidents, who filled one section in the upper
tier of one end zone with banners and dominated the crowd in a less
organized fashion by wearing T-shirts supporting Massoud Rajavi,
the head of the Iraqi-based Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen
Khalq.
	   Minor scuffles broke out as security confiscated some of the
banners, but more were unveiled after they left.

Tehran becomes ghost town as residents rush indoors for match 
</HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Thousands of police guarded the capital's
deserted streets while millions of residents stayed indoors to
watch Iran take on the United States in the World Cup soccer's most
politically charged match.
	   Cars sped across neighborhoods, carrying anxious fans back home
before the start of the match in Lyons, France, from where it was
broadcast live on television. But state-run Iranian TV did not show
the handshakes and exchange of gifts by the players.
	   As the hour for the kick-off approached _ 11.30 p.m. in Iran _
this city of 10 million people turned a ghost town. The only people
visible were police and the ``Basiji'' volunteer force manning
checkpoints set up across the city.
	   At Tajrish square in downtown Tehran, about 20 policemen busied
themselves setting up a television set in a police kiosk.
	   The Shahr-Pazi amusement park, which stays open until 2 a.m.
every night closed early. Few shops and restaurants were open and
those that were had televisions on.
	   ``I am in a hurry to go home. I am very excited so don't talk to
me right now,'' said Hameed Kani, 33, as he jumped into a taxi,
shouting out his name and age as the vehicle sped away.
	   The match is loaded with political significance: a generation of
Iranians has grown up while being taught that there is no greater
enemy than the United States, pilloried as the ``Great Satan'' by
the ruling Islamic clergy.
	   But the recent overtures of friendship by moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, who has put an end to the rhetoric of his
predecessors, has only served to heighten the surreal feeling among
Iranians unsure about an adversary that they don't known should be
hated or loved.
	   Such is the excitement generated from the match that hospitals
are bracing to treat the weak-hearted fans.
	   Even the politically stunning developments earlier Sunday when
Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri was impeached by Parliament failed
to subdue the soccer fervor.
	   Nouri, a Khatami loyalist, was targeted by the hard-line faction
in the ruling clergy, which opposes Khatami's efforts to mend
fences with the West and allow social reforms.
	   The hearing in a landmark corruption trial of pro-Khatami Tehran
mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi was postponed from Sunday to Thursday
to prevent a clash with the match.
	   Unexpected support for the Iranian team came from neighboring
Iraq. The two countries fought a war between 1980 to 1988 and
relations are still uneasy.
	   The match was being broadcast live in Iraq and dozens of Iraqis
interviewed said they will support Iran because they can't seem
themselves rooting for the United States. Iraqis revile the United
States, largely accused by the Iraqis of working to keep in place
U.N. economic sanctions.
	   Besides, Iran and Iraq are both Muslim countries and both are
from the same continent, said Husham Ajaj, the first secretary of
the Iraqi Football Olympic Committee, in Baghdad.
	   Asked what his reaction would be if Iran loses, he said: ``We
hope that Iraqi would be with them (next time) to fight in football
together against the United States.''

World Cup: Glum Spanish go back to drawing board 
</HEADLINE>
By CIARAN GILES
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ The Spanish squad ended a 24-hour break
from a so-far disastrous World Cup to return to the drawing board
in search of a survival strategy.
	   But there was no disguising the mood of helplessness.
	   Following an unusually short and simple, 45-minute session
Sunday at the Bourgognes sports complex at this chateau town north
of Paris, the 22 players marched grim-faced past waiting press, a
few apologizing that they were under orders not to speak.
	   It was understandable; there's not a lot to say.
	   Spain, with one point from two games, is threatened with an
embarrassing first-round elimination. Even if it defeats Bulgaria
in its final game Wednesday, it will have to hope Paraguay doesn't
defeat Nigeria to earn the second berth from Group D. Nigeria has
already clinched first place in the group.
	   Bulgaria is in the same sinking boat as Spain, with one point
and eager to grasp any tournament life-saver it can find.
	   Spanish news reports Sunday said FIFA would be on the lookout
that no financial incentives come Nigeria's way to encourage a
victory that would favor either Spain or Bulgaria.
	   During training Sunday, there was little of the joking and
play-acting of previous sessions. Neither was there any special
tactic practice, which suggested that Spain may have tried
everything it has and can only await its fate.
	   Friday's 0-0 draw against hitherto group minnow Paraguay
exasperated the players who had hoped the game would help them
erase memory of the 3-2 shock defeat to Nigeria.
	   Spain came into the World Cup on a roll of just four defeats in
58 games under Clemente. It was an obvious group favorite and
tipped to make the quarterfinals at least.
	   ``The Spanish think they're the best and have underestimated
their opponents,'' said a player who knows them well, Bulgaria's
former FC Barcelona star Hristo Stoichkov.
	   ``Superiority has to be shown on the field and now they're under
pressure because they have to win,'' Stoichkov said this weekend.
	   Spain trains behind closed doors Monday before flying Tuesday to
the northern city of Lens for the game against Bulgaria.

U.N. envoy in Baghdad to discuss oil-for-food implementation 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Sevan's arrival
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The U.N. coordinator for the oil-for-food
program said Sunday that he wants to find ways to speed up
implementation of the new arrangement that would let Iraq sell more
oil.
	   ``We came to Iraq to discuss ... how to implement the enhanced
distribution plan and how to speed the process of approval,'' Benon
Sevan told reporters as he arrived in Baghdad.
	   ``They say give peace a chance, so why don't we give the
distribution plan a chance,'' he added.
	   Sevan, a career U.N. officer from Cyprus, said he would meet
Iraq's ministers of trade, health, education ``and all those who
are concerned.''
	   The U.N. Security Council unanimously agreed Friday to allow
Baghdad to spend dlrs 300 million of its oil-for-food revenue to
buy spare parts for its oil industry in order to meet increased
export targets.
	   Iraq initially opposed this idea for fear it would make the
oil-for-food program a permanent agreement. But officials now seem
ready to discuss the enhanced program.
	   Iraq has been under U.N. sanctions on oil exports and other
international commerce since it invaded Kuwait in 1990. The
oil-for-food program allows Iraq to export limited amounts of oil
under a U.N.-monitored program in order to earn more money to
import food and other humanitarian items.
	   The oil-for-food plan permitted Iraq to sell dlrs 2 billion
worth of oil every six months when it first was implemented in
December 1996, but this amount was raised to dlrs 5.2 billion this
year.
	   Hours before Sevan's arrival, a Baghdad newspaper accused U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan of doing nothing to fulfill his
promise to get the sanctions lifted.
	   Al-Thawra, newspaper of the ruling Baath Party, said Annan had
promised to work for the removal of the embargo in a deal he signed
with Iraqi leaders Feb. 23.
	   ``Mr. Annan is legally and morally responsible for the sanctions
file ... and under the February deal he is under obligation to
bring this matter to the attention of the Security Council,'' the
paper said in a front-page editorial.
	   The February deal gave U.N. arms inspectors _ charged with
overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _
unconditional access to all sites in Iraq, including presidential
compounds.
	   The United States and Britain had threatened air and missile
strikes if Iraq did not allow the monitors into President Saddam
Hussein's palaces.
	   Al-Thawra's editorial reflected Iraq's frustration over the
continuation of the U.N. sanctions. It was the first time that Iraq
had accused Annan of shirking his promises.

EDS: UPDATES with nationality of aggressor, details of policeman,
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ A French policeman was in a coma Sunday
night after being struck on the head with an iron bar by a German
soccer hooligan after Germany's World Cup match against Yugoslavia.
	   Television footage showed the policeman lying on the pavement in
a pool of blood. The officer, identified as 44-year-old Daniel
Nivel, is married with two children, police said, and from the
nearby town of Arres.
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux said the man who attacked the
officer was a German, and had been arrested. No further details
were immediately available. The officer was flown by helicopter to
a hospital in the city of Lille.
	   He said 86 soccer fans _ mostly Germans _ were detained Sunday
after clashes with riot police before and after the match in Lens,
northern France.
	   Six of the people detained _ again, mostly Germans _ were
immediately deported, Cadoux said.
	   A Brazilian television cameraman was also injured in clashes,
police said, although he was not in serious condition.
	   Cadoux said the German hooligans were ``for the most part sober
_ not like the ones in Marseille,'' referring to English soccer
fans who rampaged in the southern French city last Monday after a
match against Tunisia.
	   He also said they were ``perfectly organized with means of
communication.''
	   ``They didn't come to support their team,'' Cadoux said. ``They
came to smash things up, to attack security forces.''
	   Before the match, more than 20 German skinheads were detained.
Police used sticks to battle the Germans, who included known groups
of neo-Nazis who had arrived by train.
	   Riot police brought in reinforcements and sealed off the
downtown area.
	   As many as 450 skinheads were seen on the streets of Lens before
and after the match giving Nazi salutes.
	   As night fell, police patrolled the town in cars, but the
atmosphere was calm, and most fans had left. Most bar and
restaurant owners, fearing further violence, had closed shortly
after the match.
	   Only small groups of Germans wearing their national colors were
in the streets.
	   Many German fans who were victims of a ticket swindle had come
to Lens despite not being able to get into the match, which ended
2-2.

Policeman in coma after clashes with German fans police attacker; WILL be UPDATED with U.S.-Iran AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with latest arrest numbers, nationality of alleged
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ One of the most thrilling days soccer-wise so far
at World Cup couldn't compete with another round of violence,
serious injury and demonstrations away from the field.
	   A French policeman was in a coma Sunday night after being struck
on the head with an iron bar in clashes after Germany's World Cup
match against Yugoslavia.
	   Television footage showed the policeman lying on the pavement in
a pool of blood. French police said the person who attacked the
officer was a German, and had been arrested.
	   Police said 86 soccer fans _ mostly Germans _ were detained
after clashes with riot police before and after the match in Lens.
Six were immediately deported. More than 20 of those detained
before the match were skinheads, thought to have neo-Nazi
connections.
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux said the hooligans were ``for the
most part sober _ not like the ones in Marseille,'' referring to
English soccer fans who rampaged in the southern French city last
Monday after a match against Tunisia.
	   He also said they were ``perfectly organized with means of
communication.''
	   ``They didn't come to support their team,'' Cadoux said. ``They
came to smash things up, to attack security forces.''
	   Elsewhere, officials were hoping to thwart another round of
English fan violence ahead of Monday's England-Romania match in
Toulouse, and dissident Iranians protested ahead of Iran's
politically charged match against the United States in Lyon.
	   The developments overshadowed the first hat trick of the
tournament, scored by Gabriel Batistuta in Argentina's 5-0 rout of
Jamaica. All three of his goals came in the second half, with Ariel
Ortega netting twice in a result that put both Argentina and
Croatia into the second-round and eliminated newcomers Jamaica and
Japan.
	   Argentina scored enough times to move ahead of Croatia on goal
differential. Both have 6 points after two games and will play for
first place in Group F on Friday.
	   ``We knew that we had to score several goals so as not to be at
a disadvantage,'' Argentina coach Daniel Passarella said. ``But
sincerely I didn't think we would score so many.''
	   In a showdown between two of Europe's top teams, Germany rallied
from 2-0 down in the second half to salvage a 2-2 draw with
Yugoslavia.
	   Oliver Bierhoff's header in the 80th minute followed Michael
Tarnat's deflected free-kick goal in the 74th to keep Germany in
first place in Group F on goal differential. Dejan Stankovic and
Dragan Stojkovic netted for the Yugoslavs.
	   ``We made possible what seemed impossible,'' German coach Berti
Vogts said. ``We turned defeat into a near victory. ... They wanted
to toy with us instead of trying to score a third goal, and they
got punished for that.''
	   Tarnat's goal, a left-footed free kick from 25 meters, was
directed into the net by the outstretched right boot of Yugoslav
defender Sinisa Mihajlovic. Mihajlovic was originally cited for an
own goal, but the official scorers later gave the credit to Tarnat.
	   ``I am sad and happy,'' Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac said.
``I am happy with the outcome, but I am sad that we let the victory
slip away.''
	   Sunday's late game was the U.S.-Iran encounter. Iranians partied
on the streets before the game, while dissidents charged that
thousands more who wanted to come were turned away at the border by
French authorities giving in to pressure from Tehran.
	   The French Interior Ministry confirmed that a number of
dissident Iranians had been denied entry as security threats Sunday
morning while trying to enter by road from Belgium.
	   That didn't sit well with local Iranian resistance leaders, who
also accused the French of allowing Tehran government secret police
to scour the crowd for exiles they consider to be enemies.
	   ``Is this the claim that `football is not political?' ''
Mohammad Mohadessin, head of the foreign relations committee of the
Mujahedeen Khalq, told reporters in Lyon. ``It seems, that so long
as football serves the interest of the murderous mullahs in Iran,
it can be political.''
	   In Toulouse, more than 10,000 English fans were expected to
descend on the city, only half of them with tickets, ahead of
Monday's game against Romania. Although there were no early reports
of trouble, wary police on Sunday detained four known hooligans
from England.
	   Also Sunday, South Korea fired its coach, Cha Bum-kun, following
Saturday night's 5-0 loss to the Netherlands eliminated the Koreans
from second-round contention.
	   ``Somebody had to take responsibility,'' Chun Hanjin, the team
vice-manager said. ``It ends right here, right now for him.''
	   Cha's dismissal came one day after Saudi Arabia fired Carlos
Alberto Parreira. South Korea, co-host of the 2002 World Cup with
Japan, has never won a World Cup game in five appearances in the
tournament.
	   All this happened on Fair Play Day, set aside by FIFA to
underline sportsmanship in the globe's most popular game.
	   To mark the occasion, joint group photographs _ instead of one
per team _ were taken before Sunday's three matches.
	   ``The impact of this visual image will be quite substantial,
especially for the U.S.A.-Iran game,'' FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper
said.

Kidnapped Swiss engineer freed after 7 1/2 months byline.

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ A Swiss engineer freed this weekend 7
1/2 months after being kidnapped near Chechnya, returned home
Sunday.
	   ``It's been a long time,'' said Peter Zollinger, 36, on his
arrival at Zurich's International Airport. ``When I finally talked
with my family by telephone yesterday, it was like Christmas seven
times over.''
	   Zollinger, who appeared tired but well, said, ``I feel super
good.''
	   Zollinger's family had little advance notice of the release. The
clan chief of the kidnappers had Zollinger taken Saturday to the
airport of Nazran in the Ingushetia region that borders Chechnya,
said the family lawyer.
	   There he was handed over to a contact person for the family.
	   Zollinger, employed by the Seibert-Stinnes AG construction
company, was kidnapped by an armed commando from a building site at
the airport last November.
	   He flew Sunday morning to Moscow and from there to Switzerland.
	   The kidnappers reportedly were demanding a ransom of dlrs 1
million. Neither the lawyer nor Swiss officials would comment on
how the release occurred.
	   Swiss Foreign Ministry spokesman Livio Zanolari would only say
that the Swiss government never pays ransoms.
	   The lawyer, who asked not to be identified, declined to comment
on grounds that it could affect the status of other hostages in the
region.
	   Zanolari said two Britons, two Swedes, two Hungarians and a
Frenchman are still being held by kidnappers as well as a number of
people from the region.
	   The lawyer said the family had used channels to contact the
kidnappers directly after becoming discouraged by efforts of the
government and the company, but they kept the Foreign Ministry
informed.
	   Swiss officials also appealed to the Russian government for aid.

World Cup: Iranian opposition, security scuffle at World Cup match 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Scuffles broke out in the stands at the
World Cup game between Iran and the United States Sunday, as
opponents of the Tehran government were removed by police.
	   Thousands of supporters of the Mujahedeen Khalq, the largest
Iranian opposition group, filled the 44,000-seat Gelrand stadium in
Lyon.
	   Most wore T-shirts with pictures of Mujahedeen leader Masoud
Rajavi, or his wife Maryam, the exile group's president.
	   Police had to go into the stands several times to prevent
supporters from unfurling large yellow banners emblazoned with
``Rajavi,'' or portraits of the two leaders. Some supporters were
escorted out of the stadium.
	   Minor scuffles broke out in the stands, forcing some fans who
had come with children, to leave. Outside the stadium before the
game, there were minor arguments with Mujahedeen supporters and
backers of Iran's Islamic government.
	   Just before the game started, Mujahedeen supporters floated a
balloon with a portrait of Maryam, which glided past the huddled
Iranian team.
	   Earlier Sunday the Mujahedeen, which is based in Iraq and
outlawed in Iran, accused French authorities of banning Iranian
refugees from entering France.
	   Soccers world governing body, FIFA, had said it would ban
political banners from World Cup games.

U.N. envoy in Baghdad to discuss oil-for-food implementation 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Sevan's arrival
By LEON BARKHO
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The U.N. official overseeing Iraq's
oil-for-food plan said Sunday he wants to speed up implementation
of a new agreement that would let Iraq sell more oil to buy
humanitarian supplies.
	   ``We came to Iraq to discuss ... how to implement the enhanced
distribution plan and how to speed the process of approval,'' Benon
Sevan said as he arrived in Baghdad.
	   ``They say give peace a chance, so why don't we give the
distribution plan a chance,'' he added.
	   Sevan, a career U.N. officer from Cyprus, said he would meet
Iraq's ministers of trade, health, education ``and all those who
are concerned.''
	   Iraq has been barred from exporting oil under U.N. sanctions
imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990. The oil-for-food
program allows Iraq to export limited amounts of oil under a
U.N.-monitored program to raise money to import food and other
humanitarian items.
	   The U.N. Security Council unanimously agreed Friday to allow
Baghdad to spend dlrs 300 million of its permitted revenues to buy
spare parts for its oil industry to meet increased export targets.
	   Iraq initially opposed this idea, fearing it would make the
program a permanent agreement. But officials now seem ready to
discuss the enhanced program.
	   The oil-for-food plan permitted Iraq to sell dlrs 2 billion
worth of oil every six months when it first was implemented in
December 1996. That amount was raised to dlrs 5.2 billion this
year.
	   Hours before Sevan's arrival, a Baghdad newspaper accused U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan of doing nothing to fulfill his
promise to get the sanctions lifted.
	   Al-Thawra, newspaper of the ruling Baath Party, said in a front
page editorial that Annan had promised to work for the removal of
the embargo in a deal he signed with Iraqi leaders Feb. 23.
	   The February deal gave U.N. arms inspectors _ charged with
overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction _
unconditional access to all sites in Iraq, including presidential
compounds.
	   The United States and Britain had threatened air and missile
strikes if Iraq did not allow the monitors into President Saddam
Hussein's palaces.
	   Al-Thawra's editorial reflected Iraq's frustration over the
continuation of the U.N. sanctions. It was the first time that Iraq
had accused Annan of shirking his promises.

Ex-general says he'll run against Netanyahu in next elections 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) - An ex-general who served as chief-of-staff
during Israel's invasion of Lebanon said Sunday he plans to split
off from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Likud party and
challenge the premier in the 2000 elections.
	   Agriculture and Environment Minister Rafael Eitan heads the
hard-line Tsomet Party, which ran on Netanyahu's Likud Party slate
in the last elections under a plan to combine forces and topple the
left-wing Labor party.
	   But the 69-year-old ex-general known for his rough-edged manner
and straight talk said Sunday he'd had enough of being a minister
and wanted to shoot for the country's top slot.
	   ``Tsomet will run on an independent slate and I will present my
candidacy for prime minister,'' he said during an interview with
Israel TV.
	   Elections are slated for the year 2000 but many political
analysts believe Netanyahu's shaky coalition government may not
last that long and that elections could be called earlier than
expected.
	   ``I no longer see a reason to be a faction inside a party,''
Eitan said. ``I have much to offer.''
	   Eitan is the third person to announce intentions to run against
Netanyahu. In the 1996 elections, Netanyahu became Israel's first
directly elected prime minister. The new voting system totally
altered the political balance in Israel and strengthened smaller
parties.

	   ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) _ Two brothers tearfully embraced Sunday _
the younger deported to his native Eritrea from his Ethiopian home,
the older who feared the sibling he raised would become another
victim of the countries' border conflict.
	   ``I was afraid they would kill him on the way,'' said
67-year-old Berhe Gebremicael, blotting his eyes.
	   His brother, Tekle, 50, was one of 720 people of Eritrean
descent deported by Ethiopia in a dispute between one-time allies.
Like others among the 550,000 Eritreans living in Ethiopia, many
had their host country's citizenship.
	   Ethiopia forced another 300 Eritreans across the border Saturday
at Om Hajer, in the country's southwest, and loaded 1,500 Eritreans
aboard northbound buses for deportation, presidential adviser
Yemane Gebreab said Saturday.
	   Diplomatic efforts have failed to resolve the 6-week dispute
that has spread to three fronts, and jeopardizes the stability of
the Horn of Africa. Fighting, which has claimed hundreds of lives,
has ebbed since June 11.
	   In Addis Ababa, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi said his
country was committed to trying to solve the conflict peacefully,
while preparing for war.
	   ``We are working on the basis that if war breaks out, we will
win in a way that will make Eritreans stop their adventures,''
Meles said in comments published Sunday in Al-Ahram, Egypt's
leading newspaper.
	   In a show of national defiance against a threat to their
territory, more than 100,000 Eritreans welcomed the deportees
Saturday by waving eucalyptus branches and tossing popcorn.
	   They were taken to Asmara University's dormitories, largely
empty because students are on summer holidays or at the front.
Student volunteers were helping to keep order, and women provided
vats of spicy stew to be mopped up with a traditional, tangy bread.
	   Outside an iron gate, relatives ran fingers down long lists of
names, searching for loved ones.

Baseball's Al Campanis dead at 81

<TEXT>
	   FULLERTON, California (AP) _ Al Campanis, the former Los Angeles
Dodgers general manager who guided the team to four World Series
and was fired for suggesting blacks were unqualified for top jobs,
died Sunday of coronary artery disease. He was 81.
	   ``He was just a great baseball man who loved the game, who
obviously dedicated his life to the game. ....,'' Dodgers manager
Bill Russell said. ``And he really was a good teacher, a great
general manager.''
	   Campanis played in the minor leagues alongside Jackie Robinson,
the first black to break into the majors, after World War II.
Campanis was dismissed in 1987 shortly after he appeared on ABC's
``Nightline'' television show and said blacks ``lacked the
necessities'' to be managers and front-office executives.
	   The remarks sparked a nationwide debate about race and sports
and prompted then-commissioner Peter Ueberroth to make minority
hiring a priority.
	   Within two years, Bill White, a black, was appointed National
League president.
	   Campanis was the Dodgers' general manager from 1968-87. Before
that, he was the team's scouting director. Under his leadership,
the Dodgers won the World Series in 1981, beating the New York
Yankees in six games. The Dodgers lost the World Series in 1974,
1977 and 1978.
	   Former Dodgers manager Tom Lasorda, a longtime friend, referred
to Campanis as his mentor and said he ``doesn't have a prejudiced
bone in his body.''
	   But accusations that he was a racist dogged him for years. The
issue came up again last year when Campanis nearly died of
pneumonia.
	   ``It didn't come out the way it should have or the way I would
have liked,'' Campanis said of the remarks from his hospital bed.

Report: Remains of Israeli soldier to be returned at end of this week 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The body of an Israeli soldier killed in
Lebanon will be returned to Israel at the end of this week as a
part of swap with Iranian-backed guerrillas, Israel's Channel 2 TV
said Sunday.
	   Israel has been negotiating with Lebanon for the return of
soldier Itamar Ilya's body since Sept. 5, when he was killed in a
botched Israeli commando raid into Lebanese territory.
	   After Ilya's body is back in Israel and identified, Israel will
release the bodies of 60 Iranian-backed Hezbollah soldiers killed
in fighting and buried by Israel, the report said.
	   According to Israeli sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Israel will then release fifty Hezbollah soldiers, ten
from Israeli prisons and forty from Elchion prison in South
Lebanon, the sources told The Associated Press.
	   The swap will not begin before Wednesday, when Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri is scheduled to return to Lebanon from visits
abroad, the sources said. But Israeli TV said Israel would begin
digging up the remains of the guerrillas late Sunday or Monday.
	   Israel patrols a security zone in south Lebanon it set up in
1985 to prevent cross-border guerrilla attacks on its northern
communities. Since then, Israel has fought a costly war with
Hezbollah, which vows to oust Israel from Lebanese territory.

	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ The beer bottle slipped off the table
and crashed to the floor Sunday as alcohol flowed in a bar packed
with English fans, some of them veterans of the violence that
trashed downtown Marseille last week.
	   Many with tattoos and close-cropped hair, they insisted they're
not looking for a fight, just another good World Cup match in this
southwestern town Monday between England and Romania.
	   As long as they're not provoked.
	   ``If somebody pokes ya, you poke back,'' said Bob Wells, a
muscle-bound Folkestone construction foreman with tattoos on his
arms and chest. Wells said he did just that in Marseille last week.
	   Local youths from working glass North African immigrant families
pelted him with bottles before the England-Tunisia match last
Monday in violence that left 50 injured and 100 arrested.
	   ``The police were too late,'' Wells complained, echoing reports
in some French media.
	   Despite tightened security, many locals in Toulouse were nervous
that Monday's match _ or the partying around it _ could bring
another riot like the one in Marseille.
	   About 10,000 English fans were expected in Toulouse Monday,
although only 5,300 had tickets, officials said. Many fans could be
seen around town Sunday seeking tickets on the black market.
	   British police identified four known troublemakers who were
detained after being found at a downtown cafe, the local
prosecutor's office said, adding that about 100 so-called category
`b' and `c' hooligans had also been identified.
	   The four men were to be deported on Monday at the request of the
Toulouse prefecture, local police officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said.

World Cup: Iran wins political game 2-1

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Hamid Estili's 40th-minute header gave Iran
the lead and Mehdi Mahdavikia's breakaway in the 86th secured it,
giving the Persian nation a 2-1 victory over its avowed political
enemy, the United States, Sunday night, and keeping its World Cup
hopes alive.
	   The loss made the United States the third team to be eliminated
from the 32-team competition.
	   Estili headed in a cross from Javad Zarincheh, scoring against
the run of play as the Americans hit the post twice in the first
half and controlled most of the possession.
	   Zarincheh broke down the right side and lofted a cross to an
unmarked Estili, who lofted a header across the goal into the upper
left corner.
	   The goal stirred the Iranians, enabling them to control the last
five minutes of the half and the first 15 of the second half. But
slowly the Americans regained most of the possession.
	   The United States swarmed around the Iranian goal for long
stretches and only goalkeeper Ahmad Abedzadeh's block of Frankie
Hejduk's point-blank shot in the 79th kept Iran in the lead.
	   As the desperate Americans pushed forward late, Mahdavikia was
able to break down the left side behind the U.S. defense and beat
keeper Kasey Keller from 15 meters.
	   The United States finally scored in the 88th when Brian McBride
put a diving header just over the line. The Americans frantically
pushed forward in injury time, but couldn't not get the equalizer.
	   The final double whistle sent the Iranian bench sprinting onto
the field and Abedzadeh wrapped himself in the country's flag as he
walked across the field.
	   Until Estili's goal, the United States had the better chances.
	   Brian McBride sent a header from 15 meters off the top of the
crossbar after only three minutes and Claudio Reyna hit the right
post with a left-footed shot from 25 meters in the 33rd.
	   Iran seemed content to counter and their extended offensive
possessions rarely produced anything dangerous.
	   The game was the most politically charge of the 64-game
tournament.
	   Despite being enemies since the Iran's Islamic revolution in
1979, where radical students held 52 American embassy employees
hostage for 444 days, none of the animosity was present between the
two teams before the match.
	   Each of the Iranian starters, as they did in their first game
against Yugoslavia, presented their American counterparts with
flowers.
	   During pre-game warmups, as the players stretched the crowd
partied to the Macarena, including one female Iranian fan gyrating
in the very un-Islamic attire of tight shorts and a bare-midrif
T-shirt.
	   Iranian flags fluttered in the evening breeze next to the
stars-and-stripes and fans swayed side-by-side to both American and
Arabic music.
	   FIFA's announced ban on political displays was ignored by a
group of Iranian dissidents, who filled one section in the upper
tier of one end zone with banners and dominated the crowd in a less
organized fashion by wearing T-shirts supporting Massoud Rajavi,
the head of the Iraqi-based Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen
Khalq.
	   Minor scuffles broke out as security confiscated some of the
banners, but more were unveiled after they left.

Woods looking to be `major' contender again round AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Woods 3-over for the day at turn; will be UPDATED after his
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ So much for all that talk about a Grand
Slam. These days, Tiger Woods would be happy just to get into
contention at a major championship.
	   Once again, he found little reason to smile Sunday at the U.S.
Open.
	   He started with a birdie on par-5 first hole for the fourth
straight day, but Woods unraveled with three straight bogeys and
was headed for another undistinguished round at a major
championship.
	   After he walked off the 18th green at Augusta with a
breathtaking, record-breaking win at the Masters last year, even
Woods suggested it was possible to win all four majors in the same
year.
	   ``Whether it's realistic or not I couldn't really tell you,''
Woods said on the eve of the 1997 U.S. Open at Congressional. ``But
I think it can be done. Phil Mickelson last year won four times.
Well, if you win the right tournaments four times, then you have
the Slam.''
	   What Woods has since his 18-under-par 270 at the Masters is a
rather ordinary record in the majors.
	   Going into Sunday's final round at The Olympic Club, Woods had
played 19 rounds in majors at 16-over par. The only time he has
broken 70 was a 3-under 67 in the second round of the U.S. Open at
Congressional, and a 7-under 64 in the third round of the British
Open.
	   Since that third round at Royal Troon, Woods has had 12 straight
rounds in the 70s at the majors.
	   In fact, the only major where he was under par through 72 holes
was at the Masters. He had four rounds in the 70s, but his 3-under
285 was 15 strokes higher than the previous year.
	   Woods so thoroughly dominated Augusta in 1997 that Jack Nicklaus
said, ``We've got a guy out there who has decided he wants to
dominate the game.''
	   ``Whether he can do it,'' Nicklaus added, ``we'll have to wait
and see.''
	   Because no other course is more suited to Woods' game than
Augusta, with its runway-sized fairways and total absence of rough,
it was thought that Woods would struggle at courses that put a
premium on driving accuracy.
	   There's no greater test than a U.S. Open, where 30-yard
(27.4-meter) wide fairways are framed by rough that would make
errant tee shots difficult to find without marshals marking them
with tiny flags.
	   But going into the final round at Olympic, Woods was ranked 14th
in fairways hit. His worst round was Saturday, when he hit only
seven of 14 fairways _ and that was his best round of the
tournament, a 1-over 71.
	   What has bedeviled Woods the most has been his putter. The
10-foot (3.1-meter) birdie putts kept him from winning twice on the
U.S. PGA Tour earlier this year, and that same length _ usually for
par at the U.S. Open _ has stopped rounds cold.
	   Twice this week, Woods has made double bogey with a four-putt.
	   ``It's just one of those weeks when I haven't been able to put
all the pieces together,'' Woods said.
	   Not that he hasn't tried.
	   After last season, when Woods won four times and became the
first player to surpass dlrs 2 million in a season, he has geared
himself toward the majors.
	   At The Players Championship this year, Woods said getting his
game to peak for the Masters two weeks away was more important than
winning the richest tournament of the year.
	   ``I always go to every event to win, but you also have to look
at what are your ultimate goals,'' Woods said. ``My ultimate goals
are to win majors.''
	   No one ever said it would be easy.

EDS: UPDATES with new number of arrests, 15 placed under formal
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ A French policeman was in a coma Sunday
night after being struck on the head with an iron bar by a German
soccer hooligan after Germany's World Cup match against Yugoslavia.
	   Television footage showed the policeman lying on the pavement in
a pool of blood. The officer, identified as 44-year-old Daniel
Nivel, is married with two children, police said, and from the
nearby town of Arres.
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux said the man who attacked the
officer was a German, and had been arrested. No further details
were immediately available. The officer was flown by helicopter to
a hospital in the city of Lille.
	   Police said 96 soccer fans _ mostly Germans _ were detained
Sunday after clashes with riot police before and after the match in
Lens, northern France.
	   Six of the people detained _ again, mostly Germans _ were
immediately deported, Cadoux said. Another 15 were placed under
formal investigation _ one step short of being charged.

Montgomerie can't escape heckling fans AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ The verbal abuse of Scotland's Colin
Montgomerie by fans got worse Sunday during the fourth round of the
U.S. Open, leading Montgomerie into an exchange with a fan midway
through the round.
	   Montgomerie, the target of hecklers last year at the Open at
Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland, thought he'd
escape such ribbing this week at The Olympic Club and made a point
of saying he thought fans on the West Coast were not as abusive as
their East Coast counterparts.
	   But Montgomerie, a member of the European Ryder Cup team that
beat the United States last year, has been taking a beating from
fans all week.
	   After Montgomerie hit his tee shot on the sixth hole Sunday, one
fan yelled, ``Get in the bunker.'' The fan was identified and led
away by security guards.
	   As Montgomerie walked from the eighth green to the ninth tee,
another fan yelled, ``Go home, Monty.''
	   ``Who said that?'' Montgomerie demanded.
	   ``I did,'' a fan replied.
	   ``Why?'' Montgomerie asked.
	   ``Because of the Ryder Cup,'' the fan responded.
	   ``There's nothing wrong with the Ryder Cup except that you
lost,'' Montgomerie snapped.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; NICKI'S ADVICE: &LR;  Steve Stricker was missing his usual caddie
for the U.S. Open, but that didn't stop him from getting some
advice from her that helped Stricker move onto the leaderboard for
the fourth round.
	   Stricker, who began Sunday's round tied for sixth, has had his
wife, Nicki, carry his bag in four previous Opens. But she's
expecting to give birth to the couple's first child in late August,
so caddying was out of the question.
	   That didn't stop Nicki from giving her husband a few tips, and
one of them paid off in the third round.
	   ``My wife gave me a little lesson on the green. She told me to
slow it down a little bit, so I tried to have that major thought
while I was on the greens,'' Stricker said. ``I started to putt a
little bit better.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	    &UR; SAND ON THE FAIRWAYS: &LR;  Some of the green fairways at The
Olympic Club were pockmarked with patches of tan by Sunday's fourth
round, the result of divots being filled in with sand.
	   When golfers took divots out of the grass, crews filled many of
them in with sand overnight. Some golfers said unpredictable
conditions resulted.
	   ``The 18th fairway is a mine field. You have sand in the divots
and if your ball lands in one, you don't know if you have a chip or
a bunker shot. I don't think it's right,'' Jack Nicklaus said.
	   ``It's unfair,'' Tiger Woods added. ``It's one thing not to be
in the middle of the fairway. It's another thing to end up in a
bunker in the middle of the fairway. There is a lot of sand in a
lot of the divots and the ball tends to sit down in it.''
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; DIVOTS: &LR;  As the leaders teed off for the final round, 15 reporters
were glued to a TV set inside the press tent, watching the
U.S.-Iran World Cup soccer match. ... Lee Janzen had trouble
driving this weekend _ off the course. He made a wrong turn in San
Francisco, and ended up going across the Bay Bridge toward the
neighboring city of Oakland. Then he got caught in traffic on the
way back across the bridge, and lost a hubcap, too.

Report: Remains of Israeli soldier to be returned at end of this week 
</HEADLINE>
EDs: UPDATES with Netanyahu comment in grafs 2, 8
By VITA BEKKER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The body of an Israeli soldier killed in
Lebanon will be returned to Israel at the end of this week, as a
part of swap with Iranian-backed guerrillas, Israel's Channel 2 TV
said Sunday.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he hoped the
soldier's remains would be returned ``soon.''
	   Late Sunday or early Monday, Israel will begin digging up the
bodies of sixty Lebanese guerrillas killed in fighting and buried
by Israel, as part of the exchange, according to Channel 2.
	   Israel has been negotiating with Lebanon for the return of
soldier Itamar Ilya's body since Sept. 5, when he was killed left
behind after a botched Israeli commando raid into Lebanese
territory.
	   After Ilya's body is back in Israel and identified, Israel will
release the bodies of 60 Iranian-backed Hezbollah soldiers, the
report said.
	   According to Israeli sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Israel will then release fifty Hezbollah soldiers, ten
from Israeli prisons and forty from Elchion prison in South
Lebanon, the sources told The Associated Press.
	   The swap will not begin before Wednesday, when Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri is scheduled to return to Lebanon from visits
abroad, the sources said.
	   Netanyahu told reporters during a tour of Israel's north Sunday
that Israel was making efforts to return Ilya's body. ``I hope it
will happen soon,'' he said.
	   Israel patrols a security zone in south Lebanon it set up in
1985 to prevent cross-border guerrilla attacks on its northern
communities. Since then, Israel has been engaged in a costly
on-going war with Hezbollah which vows to oust Israel from Lebanese
territory.

World Cup: Iran wins political game 2-1

<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Hamid Estili's 40th-minute header gave Iran
the lead and Mehdi Mahdavikia's breakaway in the 86th secured it,
giving the Persian nation a 2-1 victory over its avowed political
enemy, the United States, Sunday night, and keeping its World Cup
hopes alive.
	   The loss made the United States the fifth team to be eliminated
from the 32-team competition.
	   Estili headed in a cross from Javad Zarincheh, scoring against
the run of play as the Americans hit the bar and the post in the
first half and controlled most of the possession.
	   Zarincheh broke down the right side and lofted a cross to an
unmarked Estili, who lofted a header across the goal into the upper
left corner.
	   The goal stirred the Iranians, enabling them to control the last
five minutes of the half and the first 15 of the second half. But
slowly the Americans regained most of the possession.
	   The United States swarmed around the Iranian goal for long
stretches and only goalkeeper Ahmad Abedzadeh's block of Frankie
Hejduk's point-blank shot in the 79th kept Iran in the lead.
	   As the desperate Americans pushed forward late, Mahdavikia was
able to break down the left side behind the U.S. defense and beat
keeper Kasey Keller from 15 meters.
	   The United States finally scored in the 88th when Brian McBride
put a diving header just over the line. The Americans frantically
pushed forward in injury time, but couldn't not get the equalizer.
	   ``We went on the attack from the start,'' American coach Steve
Sampson said. ``We crashed three shots on the posts.
	   ``But I'm proud of our boys. They played like Americans, always
on the attack, never giving up.
	   ``We have to use this match as a learning experience so we can
play at this level,'' Sampson said.
	   ``It is a difficult defeat, but I'm very proud of the way we
played. We created so many chances but we couldn't finish them.
Give credit to Iran. They had one chance in the first half and they
put it away.''
	   The final double whistle sent the Iranian bench sprinting onto
the field and Abedzadeh wrapped himself in the country's flag as he
walked across the field.
	   Until Estili's goal, the United States had the better chances.
	   McBride sent a header from 15 meters off the top of the crossbar
after only three minutes and Claudio Reyna hit the right post with
a left-footed shot from 25 meters in the 33rd.
	   Iran seemed content to counter and their extended offensive
possessions rarely produced anything dangerous.
	   The game was the most politically charge of the 64-game
tournament.
	   Despite being enemies since the Iran's Islamic revolution in
1979, where radical students held 52 American embassy employees
hostage for 444 days, none of the animosity was present between the
two teams before the match.
	   Each of the Iranian starters, as they did in their first game
against Yugoslavia, presented their American counterparts with
flowers.
	   During pre-game warmups, as the players stretched, the crowd
partied to the Macarena, with one female Iranian fan gyrating in
the very un-Islamic attire of tight shorts and a bare-midriff
T-shirt.
	   Iranian flags fluttered in the evening breeze next to the
stars-and-stripes and fans swayed side-by-side to both American and
Arabic music.
	   FIFA's announced ban on political displays was ignored by a
group of Iranian dissidents, who filled one section in the upper
tier of one end zone with banners and dominated the crowd in a less
organized fashion by wearing T-shirts supporting Massoud Rajavi,
the head of the Iraqi-based Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen
Khalq.
	   Minor scuffles broke out as security confiscated some of the
banners, but more were unveiled after they left.

Policeman in coma after clashes with German fans AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS to UPDATE with U.S.-Iran
By JOSEPH WHITE
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Fair Play Day didn't have that feel-good feeling.
	   For every thrilling goal, for every show of sportsmanship in
Iran's 1-0 politically charged victory over ``Great Satan'' United
States, there seemed to be a contentious or nasty off-the-field
development to counter it.
	   The worst came from Lens, where a French policeman was in a coma
Sunday night after being struck on the head with an iron bar in
clashes after Germany's World Cup match against Yugoslavia.
	   Television footage showed the policeman lying on the pavement in
a pool of blood. French police said the person who attacked the
officer was a German, and had been arrested.
	   Police said 96 soccer fans _ mostly Germans _ were detained
after skirmishes with riot police before and after the match. Six
were immediately deported and another 15 were placed under formal
investigation. More than 20 of those detained before the match were
skinheads, thought to have neo-Nazi connections.
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux said the hooligans were
``perfectly organized'' and ``for the most part sober _ not like
the ones in Marseille,'' referring to English soccer fans who
rampaged in the southern French city last Monday after a match
against Tunisia.
	   ``They didn't come to support their team,'' Cadoux said. ``They
came to smash things up, to attack security forces.''
	   Back in Tehran, Hamid Estili and Mehdi Mahdavikia became instant
national heros for the goals that gave Iran its first-ever World
Cup victory.
	   Brian McBride's late goal did little to console the United
States, which became the fifth team to be eliminated from any hope
of making the second round.
	   ``I'm proud of our boys,'' coach Steve Sampson said. ``They
played like Americans, always on the attack, never giving up. We
have to use this match as a learning experience so we can play at
this level.''
	   The game was played on Fair Play Day, set aside by FIFA to
underline sportsmanship in the globe's most popular game. To mark
the occasion, joint group photographs _ instead of one per team _
with players intermingled were taken before all three matches
Sunday.
	   The U.S. and Iranian players posed for the photo, shook hands
and exchanged flowers, although that piece of international
diplomacy wasn't shown on Iranian TV.
	   Before the game, Iranians partied on the streets, while
dissidents charged that thousands more who wanted to come were
turned away at the border by French authorities giving in to
pressure from Tehran.
	   ``Is this the claim that `football is not political?' '' said
Mohammad Mohadessin, senior official of the resistance group
Mujahedeen Khalq. ``It seems, that so long as football serves the
interest of the murderous mullahs in Iran, it can be political.''
	   Outside the stadium before kickoff, there were minor arguments
with Mujahedeen supporters and backers of Iran's Islamic
government. During the game, minor scuffles broke out in the
stands.
	   In other games, Gabriel Batistuta scored the tournament's first
hat trick in Argentina's 5-0 rout of Jamaica. All three of his
goals came in the second half, with Ariel Ortega netting twice in a
result that put both Argentina and Croatia into the second-round
and eliminated newcomers Jamaica and Japan.
	   Argentina scored enough times to move ahead of Croatia on goal
differential. Both have 6 points after two games and will play for
first place in Group F on Friday.
	   ``We knew that we had to score several goals so as not to be at
a disadvantage,'' Argentina coach Daniel Passarella said. ``But
sincerely I didn't think we would score so many.''
	   In a showdown between two of Europe's top teams, Germany rallied
from 2-0 down in the second half to salvage a 2-2 draw with
Yugoslavia.
	   Oliver Bierhoff's header in the 80th minute followed Michael
Tarnat's deflected free-kick goal in the 74th to keep Germany in
first place in Group F on goal differential. Dejan Stankovic and
Dragan Stojkovic netted for the Yugoslavs.
	   ``We made possible what seemed impossible,'' German coach Berti
Vogts said. ``We turned defeat into a near victory. ... They wanted
to toy with us instead of trying to score a third goal, and they
got punished for that.''
	   Elsewhere, officials were hoping to thwart another round of
English fan violence ahead of Monday's England-Romania match in
Toulouse. More than 10,000 English fans were expected to descend on
the city, only half of them with tickets. Although there were no
early reports of trouble, wary police on Sunday detained four known
hooligans from England.
	   Also Sunday, South Korea fired its coach, Cha Bum-kun, following
Saturday night's 5-0 loss to the Netherlands eliminated the Koreans
from second-round contention.
	   Cha's dismissal came one day after Saudi Arabia fired Carlos
Alberto Parreira. South Korea, co-host of the 2002 World Cup with
Japan, has never won a World Cup game in five appearances in the
tournament.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ An Italian priest known for his
work with the poor was gunned down in the crime-ridden slum where
he lived, police said Sunday.
	   Father Leo Commissari, 56, was found dead with gunshot wounds to
the chest and neck just a few meters from his home in Oleoducto, a
poor neighborhood of Sao Bernardo do Campo, an industrial city near
Sao Paulo. He was shot in his car as he returned home from a church
social event. A briefcase with documents was reportedly stolen.
	   ``We have no suspect and no motive,'' said Nelson Neves, the
district police chief.
	   Commissari, a native of Imola, had spent 28 years in Brazil,
including 15 years in the Sao Bernardo do Campo area.
	   Commissari was a staunch defender of the city's street kids,
said local human rights activist Ariel de Castro Alves.
	   ``He was well known in the area for his work with the poor and
especially needy children,'' Castro told the Associated Press.
	   ___
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Rio officials hope to install
parking meters throughout the city, a newspaper said Sunday, in a
bid to solve a situation so chaotic that motorists often leave
their vehicles on the sidewalks.
	   The transit authority will test the first 100 meters in July in
the upscale beach neighborhoods of Ipanema and Leblon, the
newspaper Jornal do Brasil said.
	   Success is far from certain. When Rio tried using meters in the
downtown area, the public broke the machines, said Marcello de
Rezende, a transit official.
	   To prevent similar problems, the meters will use electronic
debit cards sold at newsstands instead of coins. After inserting
the card, the motorist chooses the amount of time and the meter
deducts .50 to 1.50 reals (dlrs .43 to 1.30) an hour.
	   They ``won't be robbed or vandalized (like coin meters),''
Rezende told Jornal do Brasil. ``If the test goes well, we will
install them throughout the city.''

	   LYON, France (AP) _ Iranians and Americans in full party mode
tied together the tips of their national flags and danced through
the streets of Lyon on Sunday, then headed for a World Cup soccer
showdown _ each wishing the other good luck.
	   Iran won, 2-1, and partied on alone. But most fans seemed
happier at advancing closer toward the second World Cup round than
at humiliating the Great Satan.
	   Before the game, amazed Americans beamed to hear their supposed
foes chanting, ``USA,'' and not adding, ``Down With,'' before it.
	   ``We've never really stopped being friends, whatever the
governments did,'' said Afsaneh, a London architect who withheld
her last name for fear of reprisals to her family. She held aloft a
huge heart, with Iran and the U.S. sharing equal space.
	   Amir Hosseinzadeh, a young Sweden-based exile who studies
medicine in Hungary and dreams of returning to a more liberal Iran,
laughed easily about what national leaders labeled a game of
political significance.
	   ``I hope the game improves relations between our countries,'' he
said, ``for business and chicks.''
	   Just in case, police outside the stadium opened every bag and
bundle. Mothers lifted babies from strollers for a careful search.
As the game ended, riot police filed out to block off the field.
	   The only trouble was among Iranians. In one flareup, a young
exile pushed aside Syed Saeed Loghmani, a bearded 53-year-old,
muttering, ``Get out of my way, you're with the mullahs.'' Loghmani
spat back that he had lived 32 years in France.
	   Politics bubbled repeatedly to the surface. Many Iranians said
they came to Lyon not for football but to draw attention to
repression in the Islamic republic.
	   Banners unfurled at the game read, ``Iran Rajavi,'' hailing
Massoud Rajavi, head of the Mujahadeen Khalq, the leading Iranian
exiled opposition group. Security police pulled them down and
hauled at least one opposition supporter out of the stands.
	   During Iran's national anthem, new anti-government banners
appeared, and a section of the stands erupted in scuffling.
Blue-clad police poured over the railing and restored order.
	   The Mujahadeen have accused France of keeping Iranians out while
allowing in secret agents from Tehran to scan the crowd for people
they wanted to punish.
	   French officials confirmed they turned back hundreds of Iranians
at the border. Bearded men, identified by exiles as Iranian
revolutionary guards, filmed faces among the revelry.
	   But almost all the noise was about soccer. At each goal,
Iranians went wild, banging drums, blaring horns and chanting
``I-ran, I-ran.''
	   On a sunny afternoon before the game, it was party time. French
police watched indulgently as cheering Iranians spilled out of
convertibles on the Place Bellecour, the main square.
	   A few Iranian women wore black headdresses to cover their hair.
But others with slashes of red and green _ the colors of the
Iranian flag _ on their bare shoulders wore skimpy clothes that
pushed the lower limits of modesty, even for France.
	   Perhaps 30,000 Iranians living in the West came to the game, far
outnumbering those traveling from Iran. But almost all insisted
that living abroad had not diluted their patriotism.
	   Too many foreigners confuse Iran's conservative Islamic leaders
with a 7,000-year-old civilization of much wider dimensions,
Afsaneh said. ``I'm not covered from head to toe.''
	   Americans were far fewer, but just as exuberant.
	   Andy Romhanyi, 33, a warehouse manager from Phoenix, painted his
face as Old Glory and wore a U.S. flag as a scarf. His friend,
Nicky Carter, wore a sequined vest and elaborate hat in the same
colors.
	   ``We don't give a stuff about politics,'' said Romhanyi. ``It
would be a huge, huge shame if we lost, but not because it is
Iran.''
	   He heaved a large arm around two Iranian fans and posed for
photographs.
	   Like many Americans, Rob Ramsey, 27, said he was surprised to
see an Iranian crowd that was so far from the standard stereotypes.
	   ``One guy came up to me and said in clumsy English that he was
working for world peace,'' Ramsay said. ``Everything starts

Connors beats McEnroe in senior tourney 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   NEWPORT BEACH, California (AP) _ Jimmy Connors beat John McEnroe
6-4, 6-4 on Sunday to win The Challenge senior tennis tournament.
	   It was the third time Connors has beaten McEnroe in the event's
title match and it gave Connors a 4-2 edge over his longtime rival
as seniors. During their years on the ATP Tour, McEnroe had a 21-13
record against Connors.
	   Connors kept McEnroe, a serve-and-volleyer, pinned to the
baseline for most of the match, which was marked by several tirades
against the officials from McEnroe.
	   ``Jimmy's an incredible competitor,'' said McEnroe, who earned
dlrs 100,000. ``I did not play badly, but because of his high
level, I got a little tentative. The officials? There were some bad
decisions made at crucial times.''
	   Connors, who earned dlrs 150,000, has won 31 titles on the
5-year-old senior tour that he co-founded. McEnroe is a four-time
finalist in The Challenge, but has yet to win.

Report: Remains of Israeli soldier to be returned at end of this week 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS comment from Netanyahu.
By VITA BEKKER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The body of an Israeli soldier killed in
Lebanon will be returned to Israel at the end of this week as a
part of swap with Iranian-backed guerrillas, Israel's Channel 2 TV
said Sunday.
	   During a tour of northern Israel on Sunday, Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said efforts were underway for the return of
Itamar Ilya's remains. ``I hope it will happen soon,'' he said.
	   Israel has been negotiating with Lebanon for the return of
Ilya's remains since Sept. 5, when he was killed in a botched
Israeli commando raid into Lebanese territory.
	   After Ilya's body is back in Israel and identified, Israel will
release the bodies of 60 Iranian-backed Hezbollah soldiers killed
in fighting and buried by Israel, the TV report said.
	   According to Israeli sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, Israel will then release fifty Hezbollah soldiers, ten
from Israeli prisons and forty from Elchion prison in South
Lebanon, the sources told The Associated Press.
	   The swap will not begin before Wednesday, when Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri is scheduled to return to Lebanon from visits
abroad, the sources said. But Israeli TV said Israel would begin
digging up the remains of the guerrillas late Sunday or Monday.
	   Israel patrols a security zone in south Lebanon it set up in
1985 to prevent cross-border guerrilla attacks on its northern
communities. Since then, Israel has fought a costly war with
Hezbollah, which vows to oust Israel from Lebanese territory.

World Cup: Iran wins political game 2-1 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS top
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Iran ousted the United States from the World
Cup Sunday with a goal in each half and survived desperate rushes
that produced one late U.S. goal for a 2-1 victory.
	   In a match watched as much for political reasons as soccer
skills, Iran got the better of its avowed political enemy. Hamid
Estili's 40th-minute header gave Iran the lead and Mehdi
Mahdavikia's breakaway in the 86th made it 2-0.
	   The United States finally scored in the 88th when Brian McBride
put a diving header just over the line. The Americans frantically
pushed forward in injury time, but couldn't not get the equalizer.
	   ``It is a difficult defeat, but I'm very proud of the way we
played. We created so many chances but we couldn't finish them.
Give credit to Iran. They had one chance in the first half and they
put it away,'' U.S. coach Steve Sampson said.
	   The loss made the United States the fifth team to be eliminated
from the 32-team competition. The victory, Iran's first ever in
World Cup competition, left it with a slim chance of qualifying for
the second round.
	   Estili headed in a cross from Javad Zarincheh, scoring against
the run of play as the Americans hit the bar and the post in the
first half and controlled most of the possession.
	   Zarincheh broke down the right side and lofted a cross to an
unmarked Estili, who lofted a header across the goal into the upper
left corner.
	   The goal stirred the Iranians, enabling them to control the last
five minutes of the half and the first 15 of the second half. But
slowly the Americans regained most of the possession.
	   The United States swarmed around the Iranian goal for long
stretches and only goalkeeper Ahmad Abedzadeh's block of Frankie
Hejduk's point-blank shot in the 79th kept Iran in the lead.
	   As the desperate Americans pushed forward late, Mahdavikia was
able to break down the left side behind the U.S. defense and beat
keeper Kasey Keller from 15 meters.
	   ``We went on the attack from the start,'' Sampson said. ``We
crashed three shots on the posts.
	   ``But I'm proud of our boys. They played like Americans, always
on the attack, never giving up.
	   ``We have to use this match as a learning experience so we can
play at this level,'' Sampson said.
	   ``It is a difficult defeat, but I'm very proud of the way we
played. We created so many chances but we couldn't finish them.
Give credit to Iran. They had one chance in the first half and they
put it away.''

Iran erupts into joyous frenzy after beating U.S. at soccer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with celebrations after victory
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Millions of Iranians poured into the streets
chanting ``Iran Iran,'' cars sped aimlessly honking non-stop and
people wept and smiled in joy after Iran beat the United States in
a World Cup soccer match Sunday.
	   The tensions surrounding the most politically charged game of
the tournament erupted into a frenzy of celebrations here after
Iran's 2-1 victory in the first round match at Lyon, France. The
party promised to last for hours.
	   A ghostly silence that had enveloped Tehran during the match
exploded into a collective human roar that rippled across this city
of 10 million when the final whistle signaled an end to the tussle
at 1.30 a.m. here.
	   In a message to the Iranian team, Iran's hard-line spiritual
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said: ``Tonight again, the strong
and arrogant opponent felt the bitter taste of defeat at your
hands. Be happy that you have made the Iranian nation happy.'' The
message was read out on state television.
	   The moderate President Mohammad Khatami simply congratulated the
Iranian players.
	   Like him, millions of others saw the victory as a time to
celebrate than to gloat over the United States.
	   There were no chants of ``Death to America,'' once so common
after the 1979 Islamic revolution that overthrew the pro-U.S. shah
and installed a clerical regime, which started a 19-year-long
enmity between the two countries.
	   In a northern Tehran neighborhood, a private school invited fans
to watch the match on a giant screen in an auditorium, charging
6,000 riyals (dlrs 2) per entry. As the match ended, the 500 young
people in the auditorium rushed out with computer printouts
proclaiming ``Iran beat U.S.A.'' After pasting the sheets on the
rear windshields of their cars, the youths sped away.
	   Men, women and children mingled in the crowds on the streets.
Trucks packed with fans waving Iran's green-white-and-red flags
roared down the streets, promptly getting stuck in a sea of humans.
	   Women distributed sweets and candies while men shouted
themselves hoarse with slogans of ``Iran, Iran.''
	   ``Nobody is sitting at home. It is impossible for anybody to be
inside their home'' shouted Human Razavi, a teenager wearing a
T-shirt with a picture of Ali Daei, Iran's star player.
	   ``Mubarak, mubarak,'' others shouted using the Farsi word for
congratulations. Yet others chanted ``Estili we love you.'' The
object of their adoration: Hamidi Estili, who scored the first goal
in the 40th minute.
	   Thousands of police deployed across the city did not interfere
with the celebrations, smilingly accepting flowers offered by fans.
	   Celebrations also erupted in Lebanon where Iran enjoys a large
following among its majority Shiite Muslims. Many people there
fired guns in the air. Honking cars also ruled the roads in Cairo,
Egypt.
	   Sunday's match was loaded with political significance: a
generation of Iranians has grown up being taught that there is no
greater enemy than the United States, pilloried as the ``Great
Satan'' by the ruling clergy.
	   But the recent overtures of friendship by Khatami, who has put
an end to the rhetoric of his predecessors, has only served to
heighten the surreal feeling among Iranians, unsure about an
adversary that they don't known whether to hate or love.
	   Even the politically stunning developments earlier Sunday when
Interior Minister Abdollah Nouri was impeached by Parliament failed
to subdue the soccer fervor.
	   Nouri, a Khatami loyalist, was targeted by the hard-line faction
in the ruling clergy, which opposes Khatami's efforts to mend
fences with the West and allow social reforms.
	   The hearing in a landmark corruption trial of pro-Khatami Tehran
mayor Gholamhossein Karbaschi was postponed from Sunday to Thursday
to prevent a clash with the match.
	   Unexpected support for the Iranian team came from neighboring
Iraq. The two countries fought a war between 1980 to 1988 and
relations are still uneasy.
	   The match was broadcast live in Iraq and dozens of Iraqis
interviewed said they will support Iran because they can't seem
themselves rooting for the United States. Iraqis revile the United
States, largely accused by the Iraqis of working to keep in place
U.N. economic sanctions.
	   Besides, Iran and Iraq are both Muslim countries and both are
from the same continent, said Husham Ajaj, the first secretary of
the Iraqi Football Olympic Committee, in Baghdad.

World Cup: Two South African players suspended for rest of tournament EDITS throughout 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: CORRECTS in 13th graf that Augustine replaced in both matches;
By TOM COHEN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   VICHY, France (AP) _ South African players Brendan Augustine and
Naughty Mokoena were suspended for the rest of the World Cup after
staying out until dawn Sunday, South African soccer officials said.
	   ``They've been suspended,'' South African Football Association
president Molefi Oliphant told a news conference. ``They won't be
part of the team for the duration of the World Cup.''
	   Augustine had started both of South Africa's matches, while
Mokoena was a reserve unlikely to see any action.
	   According to Oliphant and SAFA chief executive Danny Jordaan,
the two players went out Saturday night in violation of a team
curfew. When confronted Sunday, they admitted they had made a
mistake, Oliphant said.
	   But, Oliphant said, a security official told SAFA he tried to
stop the players because they were leaving at a late hour.
	   ``We said it's not a mistake, it's defiance,'' Oliphant said.
	   Augustine and Mokoena both missed South Africa's practice Sunday
and neither was available for comment.
	   Coach Philippe Troussier said after the practice that it was the
second time the pair violated a team curfew, and that he was
recommending the two players be suspended.
	   ``They have a responsibility to the team and the country and
they have to respect that,'' Troussier said. ``As a coach it must
be my job to see that we do well in this World Cup and I cannot
accept that they break the rules.''
	   Jordaan said SAFA officials then held a hearing with the players
and decided to suspend them, based on reports by Troussier and
security officials that Augustine and Mokoena returned to the hotel
at 5:10 a.m.
	   Augustine, 26, a defensive midfielder who plays for Lask Linz,
was replaced in both matches South Africa has played _ in the 57th
minute against France and at halftime against Denmark. He played
Saturday with nonstarters in a training match against local
players.

Remains of alleged police victims disappear from morgue 
</HEADLINE>
By JACK EPSTEIN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Human rights groups have accused
authorities of thwarting an investigation into police death squads
after the disappearance of the bodies of 12 of their alleged
victims.
	   The bodies were among 32 discovered in clandestine graves during
a federal probe of a criminal group known as the ``uniformed
gang,'' because most of its members were active policemen.
	   Local human rights workers and James Cavallaro, Brazil director
of the New York-based Human Rights Watch, discovered the bodies
were missing Thursday during a surprise visit to the morgue in
Maceio, capital of the state of Alagoas, 1,400 miles (2,300 kms)
north of Rio de Janeiro.
	   Morgue official Manoel Cassiano dos Santos conceded that the
bodies of eight victims had already been reburied. He said he was
unsure of the whereabouts of four others.
	   ``The failure to present a dozen skeletons shows a lack of
interest to complete a thorough investigation to help the
prosecution,'' Cavallaro told The Associated Press.
	   Following the visit, the state governor fired morgue director
Marcos Peixoto. Local authorities are investigating the
disappearance of the bodies.
	   Since the federal probe of the gang began in January, more than
60 policemen have been arrested and three have been sentenced to
six years in prison for illegal possession of machine guns.
	   Investigations have revealed that the police officers
participated in murder-for-hire schemes, arms trafficking, car
theft and bank robberies.
	   Each year, hundreds of Brazilians are killed by police death
squads that are ``often composed of off-duty police officers, who
continue to act with impunity in at least nine states,'' Amnesty
International said in a report last week.
	   Several prosecutors, judges and human rights workers have been
threatened with death. Last week, a bomb was hurled at a judge
while he jogged along the beach. He was unhurt and three policemen
were arrested for attempted murder.
	   Polls show Brazilians living in crime-ridden violent cities
support death squad killings of suspected criminals.
	   ``The uniformed gang has gone way beyond even those perverse
limits,'' Cavallaro said.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Their international image and economy
battered by four years of corruption-plagued government, Colombians
picked a new president Sunday, choosing in a runoff between a key
player from the outgoing administration and a challenger promising
change.
	   Andres Pastrana, a former Bogota mayor making his second
straight run for the presidency, led Horacio Serpa of the governing
Liberal Party 51.9 percent to 45 percent with 22 percent of the
vote counted, official results showed.
	   Public anger with President Ernesto Samper's tenure apparently
hurt Serpa, a populist firebrand and veteran politician who was
interior minister during most of the outgoing administration.
	   Pastrana, of the Conservative Party, was narrowly defeated by
Samper in 1994.
	   The two candidates each received about 35 percent of vote in the
first round May 31, in which independent candidate Noemi Sanin
placed a close third.
	   Sanin, who was backed by anti-corruption forces, refused to
endorse either candidate in Sunday's vote and accused Samper of
using a recent public works spending spree to try to boost Serpa's
appeal.
	   Caravans of horn-honking supporters for both candidates cruised
Bogota's streets on Sunday. People spilled out of windows and
sunroofs, shouting and waving election banners. On a main artery, a
Serpa vehicle crashed into a car carrying Pastrana backers.

Iran erupts into joyous frenzy after beating U.S. at soccer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with celebrations after victory
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Millions of Iranians poured into the streets
chanting ``Iran Iran,'' cars sped aimlessly honking non-stop and
people wept in joy after Iran beat the United States in a World Cup
soccer match Sunday.
	   The tensions surrounding the most politically charged game of
the tournament erupted into a frenzy of celebrations here after
Iran's 2-1 victory in the first round match at Lyon, France. The
party promised to last for hours.
	   A ghostly silence that had enveloped Tehran during the match
exploded into a collective human roar that rippled across this city
of 10 million when the final whistle signaled an end to the tussle
at 1.30 a.m. (2030 GMT) here.
	   In a message to the Iranian team, Iran's hard-line spiritual
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said: ``Tonight again, the strong
and arrogant opponent felt the bitter taste of defeat at your
hands. Be happy that you have made the Iranian nation happy.'' The
message was read out on state television.
	   The moderate President Mohammad Khatami simply congratulated the
Iranian players.
	   Like him, millions of others saw the victory more as a time to
celebrate than to gloat over the United States.
	   There were no chants of ``Death to America,'' once so common
after the 1979 Islamic revolution that overthrew the pro-U.S. shah
and installed a clerical regime, which presided over a 19-year-long
enmity between the two countries.
	   In a northern Tehran neighborhood, a private school invited fans
to watch the match on a giant screen in an auditorium, charging
6,000 riyals (dlrs 2) per entry. As the match ended, the 500 young
people in the auditorium rushed out with computer printouts
proclaiming ``Iran beat U.S.A.'' After pasting the sheets on the
rear windshields of their cars, the youths sped away.
	   Men, women and children mingled in the crowds on the streets.
Trucks packed with fans waving Iran's green-white-and-red flags
roared down the streets, promptly getting stuck in a sea of humans.
	   Women distributed sweets and candies while men shouted
themselves hoarse with slogans of ``Iran, Iran.''
	   ``Nobody is sitting at home. It is impossible for anybody to be
inside their home'' shouted Human Razavi, a teen-ager wearing a
T-shirt with a picture of Ali Daei, Iran's star player.
	   ``Mubarak, mubarak,'' others shouted using the Farsi word for
congratulations.
	   Thousands of police deployed across the city did not interfere
with the festivities, smiling as they accepted flowers offered by
fans.
	   Celebrations also erupted in Lebanon where Iran enjoys a large
following among its majority Shiite Muslims. Many people there
fired guns in the air. Honking cars also ruled the roads in Cairo,
Egypt.
	   Sunday's match was loaded with political significance: a
generation of Iranians has grown up being taught that there is no
greater enemy than the United States, pilloried as the ``Great
Satan'' by the ruling clergy.
	   But the recent overtures of friendship by Khatami, who has put
an end to the harsh rhetoric of his predecessors, has only
heightened the surreal feeling among Iranians about an adversary
they don't known whether to hate or love.
	   Unexpected support for the Iranian team came from neighboring
Iraq. Iran and Iraq fought a war from 1980 to 1988, and relations
are still uneasy.

Security clampdown as English soccer fans fete early after bars closed

EDS: UPDATES with standoff between English fans and riot police
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ The beer bottle slipped off the table
and crashed to the floor Sunday as alcohol flowed in a bar packed
with English fans, some of them veterans of the violence that
trashed downtown Marseille last week.
	   Many with tattoos and close-cropped hair, they insisted they're
not looking for a fight, just another good World Cup match in this
southwestern town Monday between England and Romania.
	   As long as they're not provoked.
	   ``If somebody pokes ya, you poke back,'' said Bob Wells, a
muscle-bound Folkestone construction foreman with tattoos on his
arms and chest. Wells said he did just that in Marseille last week.
	   Local youths from working glass North African immigrant families
pelted him with bottles before the England-Tunisia match last
Monday in violence that left 50 injured and 100 arrested.
	   ``The police were too late,'' Wells complained, echoing reports
in some French media.
	   Despite tightened security, many locals in Toulouse were nervous
that Monday's match _ or the partying around it _ could bring
another riot like the one in Marseille.
	   About 10,000 English fans were expected in Toulouse Monday,
although only 5,300 had tickets, officials said. Many fans could be
seen around town Sunday seeking tickets on the black market.
	   British police identified four known troublemakers who were
detained after being found at a downtown cafe, the local
prosecutor's office said, adding that about 100 so-called category
`b' and `c' hooligans had also been identified.
	   The four men were to be deported on Monday at the request of the
Toulouse prefecture, local police officials, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said.
	   Late Sunday, after bars closed, there was a brief standoff
between riot police and about 200 English fans, some of whom pelted
the police with beer cans. No arrests were reported.

World Cup: Iran wins political game 2-1 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Optional; adds more quotes.
By BRIAN TRUSDELL
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Iran's been wanting to humiliate the United
States for two decades. A World Cup victory said it all, especially
as it knocked the Americans out.
	   Capitalizing on two of their handful of chances, the Iranians
scored a goal in each half and overcame their fiercest political
enemy for the last 19 years, beating the United States 2-1 to keep
its World Cup hopes alive.
	   Scoring a pair of goals against the run of play, Iran then rode
the support of the majority of the crowd at Stade Gerland to
victory in the most politically charged match of the 64-game
tournament.
	   ``We both had a few chances,'' Iranian coach Jalel Talebi, who
lives in the United States, said to his American counterpart Steve
Sampson. ``But we scored and you did not.
	   ``It was a big victory for the Iranian nation,'' he added. ``Not
because it was the United States, but because it was the first in
the World Cup''
	   The final double whistle sent the Iranian bench sprinting onto
the field and goalkeeper-captain Ahmad Abedzadeh wrapped himself in
the country's flag as he walked across the field.
	   ``We came to play football and that's what we thought of,
nothing else,'' Iranian forward Ali Daei said.
	   The game was almost entirely for pride. In reality, Iran's
chances of reaching the second round remain slim. With an opening
1-0 loss to Yugoslavia, Iran needed a victory over three-time
champion Germany to advance.
	   Its second loss made the United States the fifth team to be
eliminated from the 32-nation tournament.
	   Embarrassed by their opening 2-0 loss the Germans, the Americans
pushed from the opening kickoff.
	   Brian McBride sent a header from 15 meters off the top of the
crossbar after only three minutes and Claudio Reyna hit the right
post with a left-footed shot from 25 meters in the 33rd.
	   ``We went on the attack from the start,'' American coach Steve
Sampson said. ``We crashed three shots on the posts.
	   ``But I'm proud of our boys. They played like Americans, always
on the attack, never giving up.
	   ``We have to use this match as a learning experience so we can
play at this level,'' Sampson said.
	   ``It is a difficult defeat, but I'm very proud of the way we
played. We created so many chances but we couldn't finish them.
Give credit to Iran. They had one chance in the first half and they
put it away.''
	   Iran seemed content to counter and their extended offensive
possessions rarely produced anything dangerous.
	   But the momentum shifted in the 40th minute when an unmarked
Hamid Estili lofted a header from 15 meters over the outstretch
hand of goalkeeper Kasey Keller into the upper left corner.
	   The goal stirred the Iranians, enabling them to control the last
five minutes of the half and the first 15 of the second half. But
slowly the Americans regained most of the possession.
	   The United States swarmed around the Iranian goal for long
stretches and only goalkeeper Ahmad Abedzadeh's block of Frankie
Hejduk's point-blank shot in the 79th kept Iran in the lead.
	   As the desperate Americans pushed forward late, Mehdi Mahdavikia
was able to break down the left side behind the U.S. defense and
beat Keller from 15 meters.
	   ``It was that first goal that forced us to come forward and
attack,'' Reyna said. ``Then they got the second goal, and that
just rocks you.''
	   The United States finally scored in the 88th when McBride put a
diving header just over the line. The Americans frantically pushed
forward in injury time, but couldn't not get the equalizer.
	   Despite being enemies since the Iran's Islamic revolution in
1979, where radical students held 52 American embassy employees
hostage for 444 days, none of the animosity was present between the
two teams before the match.
	   Each of the Iranian starters, as they did in their first game
against Yugoslavia, presented their American counterparts with
flowers.
	   During pre-game warmups, as the players stretched, the crowd
partied to the Macarena, with one female Iranian fan gyrating in
the very un-Islamic attire of tight shorts and a bare-midriff
T-shirt.
	   Iranian flags fluttered in the evening breeze next to the
stars-and-stripes and fans swayed side-by-side to both American and
Persian music.
	   FIFA's announced ban on political displays was ignored by a
group of Iranian dissidents, who filled one section in the upper
tier of one end zone with banners and dominated the crowd in a less
organized fashion by wearing T-shirts supporting Massoud Rajavi,
the head of the Iraqi-based Iranian opposition group Mujahedeen
Khalq.
	   Minor scuffles broke out as security confiscated some of the
banners, but more were unveiled after they left.

Jones completes sweep of 100, 200 and long jump AP Track Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Weariness couldn't prevent Marion Jones from
becoming the first athlete in 50 years to win the women's 100 and
200 meters and long jump at the USA Track and Field Championships.
	   The 22-year-old Jones, who has become the world's most
celebrated female athlete in the sport in just one year, completed
the rare sweep Sunday by winning the 200 in 22.24 seconds while
running into a headwind.
	   The time was the second-fastest of the year and only Jones has
run faster.
	   ``I was exhausted,'' Jones said, after her tiring weekend that
included three races in the 100 and two in the 200 in hot and humid
conditions. Temperatures were consistently in the mid-to-high 90s
(mid 30s Celsius) _ including 98 degrees (36.7 Celsius) Sunday _
the heat index was over 100 and the temperature on the field Sunday
was 114 degrees (45.6 Celsius).
	   ``I'm happy and relieved to come out in this heat and win all
three events. I didn't feel any pressure,'' she said.
	   ``But it's the most difficult thing I've done. The 100 and long
jump took a lot out of me.''
	   Jones began her assault on the rare triple Saturday by winning
the 100 and long jump.
	   Her time in the 100 was 10.72, again only she has run run faster
this year.
	   Her winning effort in the long jump was a wind-aided 23 feet, 8
inches (7.21 meters) and only she has jumped farther in 1998.
	   In the 200, she bolted quickly out of the blocks, took the lead
early and kept increasing the margin until 15 meters remained, when
she eased up.
	   The mercurial Jones burst onto the world scene only a year ago
at these championships at Indianapolis by winning the 100 in 10.97
and the long jump at 22-9 (6.93 meters), beating the great Jackie
Joyner-Kersee.
	   That was a forerunner to her performance at the World
Championships at Athens, Greece, where she was the only woman to
win two gold medals _ in the 100 and 400 relay. She was then voted
the outstanding women's track and field athlete of 1997.
	   Stella Walsh was the only athlete to sweep the women's 100, 200
and long jump at the national championships, accomplishing it four
times, the first in 1930, the last in 1948.
	   Carl Lewis won all three men's events in the USA Championships
at Indianapolis in 1983.
	   The imperturbable Jones made her first strong track and field
impression as a 16-year-old high school junior, when she qualified
for the 1992 Olympic relay team as an alternate by placing fifth in
the 100 and fourth in the 200 at the trials in New Orleans.
	   She passed taking a spot on the team, feeling she was too young
and inexperienced.
	   Then, she went to the University of North Carolina and led it to
the collegiate basketball title as a freshman. She was a starting
point guard on three collegiate championship teams. After watching
the 1996 Olympics on television while recuperating from a broken
foot, Jones decided to return to track and field.
	   The decision is paying off athletically and financially.
	   As she keeps winning, her appearance fee keeps going up, and she
is getting far more money for competing in track and field than if
she had played professional basketball.
	   Jones' remarkable feat overshadowed four world-leading
performances at the championships Sunday.
	   The most startling was Bryan Bronson's 47.03 clocking in the 400
hurdles. Bronson's time was the third fastest ever and the fastest
on American soil, behind only Kevin Young's world record 46.78 at
the 1992 Olympics and Edwin Moses' 47.02 at Koblenz, Germany, in
1983.
	   ``If the world record doesn't come this year, I've still had a
great year,'' said Bronson, 25, the 1997 world championship bronze
medalist. ``I'm getting better technically and my speed is the best
it's ever been.
	   Reggie Torian, the 1997 collegiate 110 hurdles champion, ran the
fastest race of his career in winning in a world-leading 13.03. He
edged Mark Crear, the runner-up in 13.06, the second fastest time
this year.
	   Kim Batten won her fifth straight title and sixth overall in the
women's 400 hurdles, clocking a world-leading 53.61.
	   Collegiate champion Jerome Young of St. Augustine's won the
men's 400 in 44.09, the fastest of his career and the fastest of
1998.
	   The Clark family dominated the women's 800, as Jearl Miles-Clark
won in 1:58.78, the fastest by an American this year, her
sister-in-law Joetta Clark was second at 1:59.01 and Joetta's
younger sister, Hazel, finished fourth at 2:00.23.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A former Bogota mayor who promised to
end rampant political corruption led Sunday in a runoff election
against a key player in the scandal-tainted administration of
President Ernesto Samper.
	   Andres Pastrana, making his second straight run for Colombia's
highest office, had 51.2 percent against 45.2 percent for Horacio
Serpa of the governing Liberal Party with 53 percent of the vote
counted, official results showed.
	   ``I believe that Colombia has really voted for a change,''
Pastrana, of the opposition Conservative Party, said in a
television interview when the first results showed him ahead.
	   Public anger with Samper's tenure apparently helped Pastrana,
who was narrowly defeated by the incumbent in 1994.
	   Serpa, a populist firebrand and veteran politician, was interior
minister for most of Samper's administration, defending the
incumbent in a corruption scandal that battered Colombia's
international image and economy.
	   The Liberals have held the presidency for the past 12 years,
control a majority in Congress and have a well entrenched patronage
system that gets out the vote in the provinces.
	   The two candidates each received about 35 percent of vote in the
first round May 31, in which independent candidate Noemi Sanin
placed a close third.
	   Sanin, who was backed by anti-corruption forces, refused to
endorse either candidate in Sunday's vote and accused Samper of
using a recent public works spending spree to try to boost Serpa's
appeal.
	   Caravans of horn-honking supporters for both candidates cruised
Bogota's streets on Sunday. People spilled out of windows and
sunroofs, shouting and waving election banners. On a main artery, a
Serpa vehicle crashed into a car carrying Pastrana backers.
	   Compared to other recent elections, relatively few rebels
attacks were reported.
	   Guerrillas attacked two helicopters Sunday near the southern
city of Neiva, killing two police officers and wounding two, the
army said. Since Friday, guerrillas have kidnapped at least 11
election officials and burned 37 vehicles nationwide.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ As Payne Stewart stood on the second green
and stared at the scoreboard he could see there were no red numbers
for Sunday's final round. No one was making birdies. No one was
making a move.
	   The outcome of the 98th Open seemed to be squarely in Stewart's
hands. It was all a matter of how many strokes he would give back
to the field on the firm, fast and frightening Lake Course at The
Olympic Club.
	   And he was giving strokes back. Stewart started the day at
3-under-par and four strokes ahead of Tom Lehman and Bob Tway.
	   Even with no one pressuring him, Stewart found the thick round
several times on the front nine and scrambled well to make only two
bogeys and fall to 1-under-par with nine holes to play, three
strokes ahead of Lee Janzen and four better than Tom Lehman and
Nick Price.
	   ``I'm not surprised about Payne because Payne loves this and he
feeds off all of this,'' Paul Azinger said, referring to his friend
after Azinger shot a 65 on Sunday, the lowest round of the
tournament.
	   But Azinger, who won the 1993 U.S. PGA Championship, knows all
about the pressure of protecting the lead in the final round.
	   ``He's the only guy that's panicking right now,'' Azinger said.
``The others are in their charge mode.''
	   Casey Martin rode up the 18th fairway in his cart to warm cheers
from the gallery and closed with a 72 to be at 291. Jack Nicklaus,
playing the Open for the 42nd time, was at 295, one stroke better
than defending champion Ernie Els.
	   John Daly shot a 78, including a quadruple bogey when he
four-putted after missing a one-footer (0.3 meter shot) he tried to
backhand, and was at 297.
	   Amateur Matt Kuchar, who turned 20 on Sunday, started the day
eight strokes back but shot a 38 on the front nine, the same score
as Tiger Woods, who was 10 back when he started play.
	   Certainly, Stewart knew how fragile the four-stroke lead he
carried into Sunday's final round was, especially considering that
his four closest rivals have all won major championships.
	   Especially considering that the three other times the U.S. Open
was held at Olympic the players who had the lead coming into the
final round _ Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson _ all
finished second.
	   And especially considering that the man Stewart was paired with
in the final round _ Lehman _ was playing in the final group on the
final day at the U.S. Open for the fourth consecutive year.
	   ``I'm not going out there and trying to play against Tom Lehman
tomorrow,'' Stewart said after a 71 on Saturday to build the
largest 54-hole lead at the U.S. Open since Tony Jacklin was four
ahead after three rounds in his winning effort in 1970.
	   ``I'm going to go out there and try and play against the golf
course,'' Stewart said.
	   That has been no easy task this week. Olympic has yielded only
two 66s and three 67s through three rounds and Stewart was the only
player under par heading to Sunday.
	   And in the three previous U.S. Opens played at Olympic only four
players _ Palmer and winner Billy Casper in 1966 and Watson and
winner Scott Simpson in 1987 _ finished 72 holes below par.
	   It was clear that if Stewart shot an even-par 70 on Sunday no
one would catch him.
	   ``Well, that might be true, that might be true,'' Stewart said.
``That won't be my approach. I'm going to try to do the things I've
been doing and that's take advantage of my good shots and deal with
my bad ones and not make too many mistakes.
	   Stewart was brilliant at containing his mistakes all. Through 54
holes he had yet to make a double bogey.
	   On the other hand, Janzen played the 468-yard (428-meter) par-4
17th hole 5 over par through three rounds and Lehman has made two
double bogeys.
	   After all of the talk last year about the new breed in golf when
three of the four major championships were won by Woods, Els and
Justin Leonard _ all under 30 - this is turning into a good year
for the old guys.
	   Mark O'Meara, 41, won the Masters while Stewart and Price are
both 41 and Lehman and Tway are 39. Woods, Els and Leonard,
meanwhile, are well out of contention.
	   Price also has another historical connection to Sunday's doings
at Olympic. The last 14 major championships were won by 14
different people _ going back to when Price won British Open and
the PGA in 1994.
	   And if Price wins he will become only the 10th player in history
to win three of the four legs of the career Grand Slam.

Dominican business leaders to visit Cuba 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Dominican business
leaders are meeting with Cuban counterparts in the first
government-sponsored trade conference since the two countries
normalized relations in April.
	   About 30 Dominican executives were expected at the meeting
Monday in Santiago, Cuba, the Dominican Export Promotion Center
said. Cuba and the Dominican Republic are sharing the costs of the
meeting.
	   The two countries, separated by only about 150 miles (250
kilometers) were on chilly terms for decades after the Dominican
Republic severed diplomatic ties in 1961. Relations began improving
after centrist Dominican president Leonel Fernandez took office in
1996.
	   The countries opened diplomatic offices on each other's soil
earlier this year and are now trying to broaden their commercial
ties.
	   In August, Cuban President Fidel Castro is expected to make his
first visit to the Dominican Republic since the 1959 revolution
that brought him to power.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (AP) _ Pedro Martinez gave up only a
fifth-inning triple in eight innings Sunday, leading the Boston Red
Sox to a 3-1 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
	   Martinez (9-2) struck out six and walked two. The right-hander,
who pitched a two-hitter against Seattle in April, regrouped after
Miguel Cairo's triple to retire the last 11 batters he faced.
	   Tom Gordon allowed Dave Martinez's single in the ninth to
complete the two-hitter and get his 23rd save in 24 chances.
	   Nomar Garciaparra hit his 10th homer off Jason Johnson (2-4) as
the Red Sox won for the ninth time in 11 games.
 &UR; Blue Jays 7, Orioles 3
	   In Baltimore, Ed Sprague hit two homers and Pat Hentgen pitched
seven gritty innings to earn his first win since May 25 as the
Toronto Blue Jays beat the Baltimore Orioles.
	   Sprague went 3-for-3 with a walk and drove in a season-high four
runs, giving him 400 RBIs for his career. Shawn Green and Carlos
Delgado also homered to help the Blue Jays gain a split of the
four-game series.
	   Hentgen (8-4) threw 128 pitches, allowing eight hits and walking
four. The right-hander, who struck out seven and did not have a
1-2-3 inning, was 0-1 in his previous four starts.
	   Randy Myers got one out for his 19th save, including three
against the Orioles, the team he left in the offseason.
	   Harold Baines homered for the Orioles, who stranded eight
runners through the first seven innings. Rookie Sidney Ponson (1-5)
was the loser.
 &UR; Twins 6, White Sox 1
	   In Chicago, Mike Morgan took a shutout into the ninth and Brent
Gates hit his first career grand slam to lead the Minnesota Twins
over the Chicago White Sox.
	   Morgan (4-2) was three outs away from his first shutout in
nearly five years when Mike Caruso homered on the right-hander's
first pitch. He allowed four hits, walked two and struck out one.
His last shutout came with the Cubs in 1993 against Colorado.
	   Hector Carrasco got his first save since June 1995.
	   Gates connected with two outs in the fourth inning for only his
second homer this year and 21st of his career. Jason Bere (3-7)
allowed six runs and four hits in four innings.
 &UR; Royals 6, Tigers 5
	   In Detroit, Jeff Conine hit a three-run double and Hipolito
Pichardo won his first game since May 5 as the Kansas City Royals
beat the Detroit Tigers.
	   Larry Sutton homered and had three RBIs for the Royals, who have
won seven of 10. Kansas City took three of four in Detroit to win
three straight series for the first time since September 1996.
	   Pichardo (3-6) gave up for runs and five hits in six innings. He
retired the last 11 he faced after Tony Clark and Luis Gonzalez hit
back-to-back homers in the third.
	   The Tigers closed to within a run on Gonzalez's RBI single in
the eighth, but Jeff Montgomery pitched the ninth for his 14th
save.
	   Rookie Denny Harriger (0-2) allowed six runs _ three earned _
and seven hits in 4 2-3 innings.

	   The May 31 first round of elections was a virtual tie between
Pastrana and Samper, with indepedent candidate Noemi Sanin placing
a close third.
	   Sanin, who was backed by anti-corruption forces, refused to
endorse either candidate in Sunday's vote but accused Samper of
using a recent public works spending spree to try to boost Serpa's
appeal.
	   Caravans of horn-honking supporters for both candidates cruised
Bogota's streets on Sunday. People spilled out of windows and
sunroofs, shouting and waving election banners. On a main artery, a
Serpa vehicle crashed into a car carrying Pastrana backers.
	   Compared to other recent elections, relatively few rebels
attacks were reported.
	   Guerrillas attacked two helicopters Sunday near the southern
city of Neiva, killing two police officers and wounding two, the
army said. Since Friday, guerrillas have kidnapped at least 11
election officials and burned 37 vehicles nationwide.
	   Samper, who came under attack for alleged links to drug
traffickers, bought the support of regional political bosses by
doling out hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds.
Meanwhile, unemployment soared to 14.5 percent and the deficit more
than doubled.
	   ``We're in very bad shape economically and if Serpa wins it's
only going to get worse,'' said Jairo Chaustre, 31, a helicopter
pilot who voted for Pastrana. ``Serpa is a continuation of Samper's
politics, which have busted the country's economy.''
	   Maria Elena Restrepo, a 41-year-old publicist voting in Bogota,
disagreed.
	   ``Just because someone has a relative who is a thief doesn't
necessarily mean that they are themselves a thief,'' she said.
	   Like Samper, the 55-year-old Serpa was cleared of any wrongdoing
in the scandal over dlrs 6 million in contributions from the Cali
drug cartel to Samper's 1994 campaign _ the president by a loyal
congress and Serpa by the chief prosecutor. Serpa was a top
campaign aide and later became Samper's main defender as interior
minister.
	   Some political analysts have criticized Pastrana for not
attacking Serpa's alleged drug links more vigorously.
	   Pastrana inherits a 34-year-old guerrilla war that has reached
new depths of violence in recent months, with stepped-up massacres
of civilians by right-wing paramilitary forces and assassinations
of human rights workers.
	   Both candidates billed themselves as the best chance for peace
but the country's oldest and largest rebel group, the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, tacitly endorsed Pastrana last week.
	   Serpa has pledged to lower the work week from 48 to 40 hours,
earning the scorn of big business. Pastrana, the 44-year-old son of
the late President Misael Pastrana, promised a computer for every
schoolchild and a cut in the sales tax from 16 percent to 12
percent.

	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Despite yet another home run by streaking Sammy
Sosa, the Chicago Cubs fell to the Philadelphia Phillies 7-2 Sunday
when Bobby Abreu drove in four runs and Tyler Green struck out 10.
	   Sosa's solo home run in the fourth inning was his 17th this
month, extending his own major league record for homers in June and
tying Willie Mays' NL mark for home runs in any month.
	   With eight games still left in June, Sosa has a good chance to
break the major league record for homers in a single month of 18,
set by Detroit's Rudy York in August 1937.
	   Sosa has hit 30 home runs this season. He has connected 10 times
in his last nine games, and 21 times in the last 22 games. After he
sent Green's 2-2 pitch into the bleachers, the Wrigley Field crowd
gave him a standing ovation and some fans behind the dugout bowed
as he returned.
	   Green (5-4) allowed five hits and two runs in six innings. Steve
Trachsel (6-4) gave up four runs and five hits in 4 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Mets 3, Marlins 2 &QC; 
	   In New York, John Franco escaped a bases-loaded, no-out jam in
the eighth inning as New York ended a four-game losing streak.
	   Al Leiter (9-3), traded from Florida to the Mets in the
offseason, won his sixth straight decision. He allowed two runs and
six hits in seven innings, striking out seven and walking a
season-high five.
	   After the Marlins loaded the bases in the eighth against two
relievers, Franco got John Wehner to hit a comebacker for a
forceout at the plate. Franco then struck out Mike Redmond and
pinch-hitter Mark Kotsay, and the lefty reliever ran off the mound
with both arms raised.
	   Franco got Edgar Renteria to hit into a double play, and got his
16th save.
	   Edgardo Alfonzo's single in the seventh brought in the go-ahead
run for New York.
 &UR; Expos 4, Braves 1
	   In Montreal, Dustin Hermanson pitched five-hit ball for eight
innings and the Expos gave Montreal manager Felipe Alou his 500th
career victory.
	   The Expos won two of three from Atlanta, winning their first
series against the Braves since July 1994.
	   Alou passed Gene Mauch for second place on the victory list of
Expos managers. Buck Rodgers leads with 520.
	   Hermanson (5-6) shut down the NL's top offense, allowing only a
seventh-inning home run to Michael Tucker.
	   Ugueth Urbina pitched the ninth for his 18th save.
	   Denny Neagle (8-5) allowed four runs _ three earned _ and six
hits in six innings.
 &UR; Pirates 8, Brewers 7 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Jose Guillen hit a grand slam as Pittsburgh nearly
blew a seven-run lead.
	   The Brewers, trailing 8-1 in the seventh inning, came back
behind Jeff Cirillo. He hit a two-run single in the eighth, and
another two-run single with two outs in the ninth.
	   Milwaukee's three-run rally in the ninth ended, though, when
Dave Nilsson fouled out with the bases loaded to Ricardo Rincon,
who held on for his ninth save.
	   Esteban Loaiza (5-3) pitched seven solid innings in his longest
outing of the season. He gave up two runs and five hits, walked
none and struck out seven as the Pirates took three of four from
the Brewers.
	   Guillen was mired in an 8-for-46 slump (.173) before hitting his
sixth homer and first career grand slam for a 6-0 lead in the third
off Jeff Juden (6-6).
 &UR; Cardinals 5, Diamondbacks 4 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Clint Sodowsky's bases-loaded wild pitch in the
eighth inning helped the Cardinals extend their winning streak to
four games.
	   St. Louis, which trailed 4-1 in the sixth, is 7-2 against the
expansion Diamondbacks. The Cardinals have won six of seven overall
to climb a game above .500 for the first time since June 3.
	   Brady Raggio (1-1) pitched 2 1-3 scoreless innings and Jeff
Brantley worked the ninth for his 11th save.
	   After loading the bases, Sodowsky's first pitch to Delino
DeShields got past catcher Damian Miller for his fourth wild pitch
in 35 1-3 innings.
	   Mark McGwire, who leads the majors with 33 home runs, went
homerless for the third straight game. He walked in the first,
struck out in the third, was hit by a pitch in the fifth and
singled in the seventh.
 &UR; Astros 3, Reds 1
	   In Houston, Pete Schourek pitched six solid innings and Jeff
Bagwell drove in a run as Houston handed Cincinnati its eighth
straight loss.
	   The Astros swept the Reds in a three-game series for the first
time since 1992. Cincinnati has been swept six times this season.
	   The Reds, who lost nine in a row in 1996, have also lost eight
in a row on the road.
	   Schourek (4-5) allowed one run and five hits. Trever Miller
pitched 2 1-3 scoreless innings before being replaced Mike Magnante
in the ninth. Magnante pitched out of a two-on, one-out jam for his
first save.
	   Pete Harnisch (6-3) has lost two straight starts for the first
time this season.
 &UR; Rockies 11, Dodgers 6 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Dante Bichette homered and drove in five runs for
Colorado.
	   The Rockies used five- and six-run innings to split the
four-game series and overcome another big game by Eric Karros. He
homered twice and drove in four runs _ to go 7-for-17 with four
homers and 13 RBIs in the series.
	   Despite his problems with Karros, Bobby Jones (2-2) pitched the
fourth complete game for Colorado this season. He gave up 10 hits,
four in a two-run ninth.
	   Bichette's two-run single capped a five-run second inning off
Chan Ho Park (5-5). His three-run homer off Greg McMichael
accounted for the final runs in a six-run sixth.

	   RECASTS grafs 1-5 to lead with meeting. No pickup.
	   GEORGETOWN, Guyana (AP) _ The opposition People's National
Congress said Sunday it will meet early this week to organize a new
round of demonstrations against President Janet Jagan's government.
	   Racially charged demonstrations have taken place in downtown
Georgetown since Thursday. The People's National Congress decided
Friday to throw its support behind the protesters.
	   Leader Desmond Hoyte said Sunday the party would hold a public
meeting in the Square of the Revolution, a favorite assembly point
for demonstrators.
	   He said the party sympathizes with protesters who claim Jagan's
People's Progressive Party rigged the elections in December.
	   Race riots broke out following the elections as Guyanese of
African descent, who primarily support Hoyte's party, protested the
win by Jagan's party, which is backed by people of East Indian
descent.
	   Most conflicts in this former British colony in South America
are linked to friction between the two ethnic groups.
	   The Caribbean Community trade organization brokered a shaky
peace in January by promising to audit the election results. On
June 2, auditors said the elections were fair, touching off the new
protests.
	   During clashes Thursday and Friday, demonstrators hurled stones
at police and smashed store windows in downtown Georgetown. Police
used tear gas and fired automatic rifles into the air to clear the
crowds.
	   Jagan on Sunday urged protesters to stop the demonstrations.
	   ``The street activity will not unseat me,'' she said during her
weekly television address. ``If any of these people who are
demonstrating on the streets are related to you, whether your
neighbor, your uncle, son, your brother or whatever, tell them to
stop this nonsense.''

Woods looking to be `major' contender again AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with Woods in at 73; quotes
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ So much for all that talk about a Grand
Slam. These days, Tiger Woods would be happy just to get into
contention at a major championship.
	   Once again, he found little reason to smile Sunday at the U.S.
Open.
	   ``I'm disappointed,'' Woods said after taking three straight
bogeys early on, then three-putting the 18th from about 8 feet
(2.44 meters) for a 73 that left him at 10-over 290 for the
tournament.
	   ``I came here to win, and I just didn't do it.''
	   Lately, Woods hasn't even come close, a far cry from the
expectations of a year ago.
	   After he walked off the 18th green at Augusta with a
breathtaking, record-breaking win at the Masters last year, even
Woods suggested it was possible to win all four majors in the same
year.
	   ``Whether it's realistic or not I couldn't really tell you,''
Woods said on the eve of the 1997 U.S. Open at Congressional. ``But
I think it can be done. Phil Mickelson last year won four times.
Well, if you win the right tournaments four times, then you have
the Slam.''
	   What Woods has since his 18-under-par 270 at the Masters is a
rather ordinary record in the majors.
	   Since his Masters win, Woods has played his last 20 rounds in
majors at 19-over par. The only time he has broken 70 was a 3-under
67 in the second round of the U.S. Open at Congressional, and a
7-under 64 in the third round of the British Open.
	   Since that third round at Royal Troon, Woods now has gone 13
straight rounds in the 70s at major championships.
	   The only major where he was under par through 72 holes was at
the Masters. He had four rounds in the 70s, but his 3-under 285 was
15 strokes higher than the previous year.
	   Woods so thoroughly dominated Augusta in 1997 that Jack Nicklaus
said, ``We've got a guy out there who has decided he wants to
dominate the game.
	   ``Whether he can do it,'' Nicklaus added, ``we'll have to wait
and see.''
	   Five majors later, the waiting game continues.
	   Because no other course is more suited to Woods' game than
Augusta, with its runway-sized fairways and total absence of rough,
it was thought that Woods would struggle at courses that put a
premium on driving accuracy.
	   There's no greater test than a U.S. Open, where 30-yard
(27.42-meter) wide fairways are framed by rough that would make
errant tee shots difficult to find without marshals marking them
with tiny flags.
	   But going into the final round at Olympic, Woods was ranked 14th
in fairways hit. His worst round was Saturday, when he hit only
seven of 14 fairways _ and that was his best round of the
tournament, a 1-over 71.
	   ``What I'm impressed with is how well I drove it,'' Woods said.
``I hit four balls today that landed in the fairways and wound up
in the deep stuff.''
	   What has bedeviled Woods lately has been his putter.
	   The 10-foot (3.05-meter) birdie putts kept him from winning
twice on the U.S. PGA Tour earlier this year, and that same length
_ usually for par at the U.S. Open _ has stopped rounds cold.
	   Twice this week, Woods has made double bogey with a four-putt.
	   ``It's just one of those weeks when I haven't been able to put
all the pieces together,'' Woods said.
	   Not that he hasn't tried.
	   After last season, when Woods won four times and became the
first player to surpass dlrs 2 million in a season, he has geared
himself toward the majors.
	   At The Players Championship this year, Woods said getting his
game to peak for the Masters two weeks away was more important than
winning the richest tournament of the year.
	   ``I always go to every event to win, but you also have to look
at what are your ultimate goals,'' Woods said. ``My ultimate goals
are to win majors.''
	   No one ever said it would be easy.

Fruhwirth earns first LPGA victory AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
	   AGAWAM, Massachusetts (AP) _ Amy Fruhwirth earned her first U.S.
LPGA tour victory on Sunday, parring the last 12 holes for an even
72 in the final round of the Friendly's Classic to beat Kim Saiki
and Charlotta Sorenstam by two strokes.
	   Fruhwirth finished the 72 holes at 8-under 280 at the 6,381-yard
(5833-meter) Crestview Country Club and won dlrs 90,000. Her lone
bogey of the weekend came on No. 6, a par-3, in the final round and
she parred out from there.
	   Saiki, playing with Fruhwirth in the final group, bogeyed the
par-4 15th and birdied No. 16, another par-4, failing to gain
ground on the leader. She finished with a 71 and tied at 282 with
Sorenstam, who shot a 70 Sunday.
	   Pamela Kometani, who had four bogeys on the front nine, birdied
two of the last three holes to finish at 72 and was another stroke
back in fourth. Six others were four strokes back at 284.
	   After a clear opening day on Thursday, the tournament had two
rain delays on Friday and two more on Saturday. The last, which
halted play at 2 p.m. (1800 GMT), left Fruhwirth on No. 13; she
came back and birdied the last three holes to shoot to the top of
the leaderboard and begin the last round with a three-stroke lead.
	   Her final round was more steady, with the birdie on No. 3, a
par-3, erased three holes later with the lone bogey. No one came
within two strokes of Fruhwirth all day.
	   Although the 29-year-old Fruhwirth, who is nicknamed ``Giggles''
because of the way she releases her nervous energy, had never won
an LPGA tour event, she did win the 1997 JCPenny Classic, paired
with Clarence Rose. She had finished third twice.
	   Saiki got to six under when she put a 7-iron three feet (a
meter) from the hole on the par-4 4th. But she left a 3-iron short
of the green on 15, chipped to eight feet (2.44 meters) and missed
the putt that could have kept her close.
	   She put an 8-iron four feet (1.22 meters) away on 16 and made
the putt to get back into the tie for second place.

URGENT
Eds: COMBINES urgent series. UPDATES with 94.9 percent of the vote.
By FRANK BAJAK
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A former Bogota mayor who promised to
end rampant political corruption won Sunday's presidential runoff,
embraced by voters who spurned a key player in the scandal-tainted
administration of President Ernesto Samper.
	   Andres Pastrana, in his second straight bid for Colombia's
highest office, had 50.7 percent against 46 percent for Horacio
Serpa of the governing Liberal Party with 94.9 percent of the vote
counted, official results showed.
	   ``I believe that Colombia has really voted for a change,''
Pastrana, 44, of the opposition Conservative Party, said in a
television interview.
	   Pastrana promised to work for peace with leftist rebels and
pledged to help ``the poorest people, the most marginalized. That
is our commitment, to improve the quality of life of 18 million
Colombians who today live in poverty.''
	   Hundreds congregated outside Pastrana's campaign headquarters,
some dancing to vallenato and cumbia music, others shouting
``Andres. Andres''
	   Campaign adviser Jimmy Camargo said Pastrana never dreamed he
would win by more than a half million votes.
	   ``It's surprising. It's incredible,'' he said. ``People have
rejected business-as-usual. The horrible night is over.''
	   Public anger with Samper's tenure apparently helped Pastrana,
who was narrowly defeated by the incumbent in 1994.
	   Serpa, a populist firebrand and veteran politician, was interior
minister for most of Samper's administration and defended his boss
in a corruption scandal that battered Colombia's international
image and economy.
	   The Liberals had held the presidency for the 12 years, control a
majority in Congress and have a well-entrenched patronage system.
	   The May 31 first round of elections was a virtual tie between
Pastrana and Samper, with independent candidate Noemi Sanin, who
was backed by anti-corruption forces, placing a close third.
Analysts believed Pastrana won the lion's share of Sanin votes.
	   Compared to other recent elections, relatively few rebels
attacks were reported.
	   Guerrillas attacked two helicopters Sunday near the southern
city of Neiva, killing two police officers and wounding two, the
army said. Since Friday, guerrillas have kidnapped at least 11
election officials and burned 37 vehicles nationwide.
	   Samper, who came under attack for alleged links to drug
traffickers, bought the support of regional political bosses by
doling out hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds.
Meanwhile, unemployment soared to 14.5 percent and the deficit more
than doubled.
	   ``We're in very bad shape economically and if Serpa wins it's
only going to get worse,'' said Jairo Chaustre, 31, a helicopter
pilot who voted for Pastrana. ``Serpa is a continuation of Samper's
politics, which have busted the country's economy.''
	   Maria Elena Restrepo, a 41-year-old publicist voting in Bogota,
disagreed.
	   ``Just because someone has a relative who is a thief doesn't
necessarily mean that they are themselves a thief,'' she said.
	   Like Samper, the 55-year-old Serpa was cleared of any wrongdoing
in the scandal over dlrs 6 million in contributions from the Cali
drug cartel to Samper's 1994 campaign _ the president by a loyal
congress and Serpa by the chief prosecutor. Serpa was a top
campaign aide and later became Samper's main defender as interior
minister.
	   Pastrana inherits a 34-year-old guerrilla war that has reached
new depths of violence in recent months, with stepped-up massacres
of civilians by right-wing paramilitary forces and assassinations
of human rights workers.
	   Both candidates billed themselves as the best chance for peace
but the country's oldest and largest rebel group, the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, tacitly endorsed Pastrana last week.
	   Serpa had pledged to lower the work week from 48 to 40 hours,
earning the scorn of big business. Pastrana, the 44-year-old son of
the late President Misael Pastrana, has promised a computer for
every schoolchild and a cut in the sales tax from 16 percent to 12
percent.

World Cup: Iran team plays down US victory 
</HEADLINE>
By ANWAR FARUQI
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ For Iran's coach, the euphoria surrounding
Sunday's 2-1 victory over the United States had nothing to do with
politics.
	   ``It was a big victory for the Iranian nation, not because it
was the United States, but because it was the first in the World
Cup,'' coach Jalal Talebi said.
	   Iran was winless in its only previous World Cup appearance in
1978 and it lost its France 98 opener 1-0 to Yugoslavia.
	   Talebi, who has a home in California where his Iranian wife and
three sons live, said the media had blown the game out of
proportion, making his players very nervous.
	   ``We thought that if we lose this game we will have lost
everything,'' he said. ``Although this was not the case. It was
really just another game.''
	   But for millions of Iranians, who danced in the streets of
Tehran after the win, it was more than just soccer. Even U.S.
President Bill Clinton underscored the game's political importance
with a pre-game televised message that spoke of the match being
``another step toward ending the estrangement between our
nations.''
	   Iranians packed the 44,000-seat Stade Gerland in the heart of
France. Most were supporters of the Iraq-based Mujahedeen Khalq
organization, political opponents of the Islamic government in
Iran.
	   Scuffles broke out in the stands as French police pulled down
banners, unfurled by Mujahedeen members, showing portraits of their
leaders or denouncing Iran's President Mohammad Khatami.
	   ``Down with Khatami,'' read one banner.
	   Asked if the presence of the dissidents had bothered him, Talebi
said he was too focused on the match.
	   ``Of course, such activity can affect the morale of the
players,'' Talebi said. ``But I was so focused on the game that I
didn't think of anything else. I tried to get the players to do the
same.''
	   Striker Ali Daei said politics wasn't on his mind.
	   ``We came to play football and that's what we thought of,
nothing else,'' Daei said.
	   Iran's German-based striker Khodadad Azizi agreed.
	   ``From the beginning we came to win, and thought about nothing
else,'' Azizi said.
	   Talebi was gracious in victory, offering comforting words to
U.S. coach Steve Sampson in front of reporters.
	   ``This is football,'' Talebi said. ``You deserve to be winning
too. But in the end, one team must win and one must lose.''

Iran erupts into joyous frenzy after beating U.S. at soccer majority, in Lebanon.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Millions of Iranians poured into the streets
chanting ``Iran Iran,'' cars sped aimlessly honking non-stop and
people wept in joy after Iran beat the United States in a World Cup
soccer match Sunday.
	   The tensions surrounding the most politically charged game of
the tournament erupted into a frenzy of celebrations here after
Iran's 2-1 victory in the first round match at Lyon, France. The
party promised to last for hours.
	   A ghostly silence that had enveloped Tehran during the match
exploded into a collective human roar that rippled across this city
of 10 million when the final whistle signaled an end to the tussle
at 1.30 a.m. (2030 GMT) here.
	   In a message to the Iranian team, Iran's hard-line spiritual
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said: ``Tonight again, the strong
and arrogant opponent felt the bitter taste of defeat at your
hands. Be happy that you have made the Iranian nation happy.'' The
message was read out on state television.
	   The moderate President Mohammad Khatami simply congratulated the
Iranian players.
	   Like him, millions of others saw the victory more as a time to
celebrate than to gloat over the United States.
	   There were no chants of ``Death to America,'' once so common
after the 1979 Islamic revolution that overthrew the pro-U.S. shah
and installed a clerical regime, which presided over a 19-year-long
enmity between the two countries.
	   In a northern Tehran neighborhood, a private school invited fans
to watch the match on a giant screen in an auditorium, charging
6,000 riyals (dlrs 2) per entry. As the match ended, the 500 young
people in the auditorium rushed out with computer printouts
proclaiming ``Iran beat U.S.A.'' After pasting the sheets on the
rear windshields of their cars, the youths sped away.
	   Men, women and children mingled in the crowds on the streets.
Trucks packed with fans waving Iran's green-white-and-red flags
roared down the streets, promptly getting stuck in a sea of humans.
	   Women distributed sweets and candies while men shouted
themselves hoarse with slogans of ``Iran, Iran.''
	   ``Nobody is sitting at home. It is impossible for anybody to be
inside their home'' shouted Human Razavi, a teen-ager wearing a
T-shirt with a picture of Ali Daei, Iran's star player.
	   ``Mubarak, mubarak,'' others shouted using the Farsi word for
congratulations.
	   Thousands of police deployed across the city did not interfere
with the festivities, smiling as they accepted flowers offered by
fans.
	   Celebrations also erupted in Lebanon where Iran enjoys a large
following among the Shiite Muslims, Lebanon's largest religious
community. Many people there fired guns in the air. Honking cars
also ruled the roads in Cairo, Egypt.

	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Lee Janzen won the 1993 U.S. Open by
holding off Payne Stewart down the stretch. On Sunday, he turned
back Stewart once again in the Open, this time by overcoming a
seven-stroke deficit.
	   Showing startling confidence on a day when no one was making
birdies at The Olympic Club, Janzen played the final 15 holes four
under par for a 68 to finish at even-par 280, one stroke ahead of
Stewart.

	   Stewart came to the 18th hole needing a birdie to force an
18-hole playoff. But his approach was above the hole and he had a
very difficult, very fast downhill, curling putt.
	   When the ball broke just low of the hole Janzen, who was
watching on TV, let out a big sigh and buried his head in a towel.
	   Stewart tapped in and walked dejectedly off the green.
	   Janzen had closed out his round 20 minutes earlier when he
tapped in a 2-foot (70 cms) par putt while his father Larry
clapped, appreciating the moment on U.S. Father's Day.
	   ``That might not have looked like a long putt but it couldn't
have been longer,'' Janzen said about his final stroke.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   Janzen, playing two groups in front of Stewart, made bogeys on
two of the first three holes and fell seven strokes behind _ the
same margin Billy Casper erased in the final nine holes against
Arnold Palmer in the 1966 U.S. Open at Olympic.
	   But for the fourth consecutive time, the third-round leader in
the U.S. Open at The Olympic Club was not able to protect the lead.
Like Stewart, Ben Hogan in 1955, Arnold Palmer in 1966 and Tom
Watson in 1987 all finished second.
	   Because none of those three ever won another major championship,
Olympic is known as the Graveyard of Champions. Stewart, 41, won
the PGA Championship in 1989 and the U.S. Open in 1991 and must now
wonder if he will join them.
	   When Stewart stood on the second green he could see that there
was no red on the leaderboard. No one among the contenders was
making birdies, no one was making a move.
	   Then, after getting a break when his ball hung in a tree briefly
on No. 5 before falling to the ground, Janzen kick-started his
comeback when he chipped in from 15 feet (4.5 meters) to save par
on the hole. He never made another bogey.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A former Bogota mayor who promised to
end rampant political corruption won Sunday's presidential runoff,
embraced by voters who spurned a key player in the scandal-tainted
administration of President Ernesto Samper.
	   Andres Pastrana, in his second straight bid for Colombia's
highest office, won 50.5 percent against 46.4 percent for Horacio
Serpa of the governing Liberal Party with 97 percent of the ballots
counted, official results showed.
	   ``The choice was between business-as-usual or change and the
country clearly picked change,'' Pastrana, 44, of the opposition
Conservative Party, said in a television interview in which he
promised to make peace with leftist rebels his top priority.
	   Pastrana's victory broke the Liberals' 12-year hold on the
presidency, but the party still controls a majority in Congress and
boasts a well-entrenched patronage system.
	   Public anger with Samper's tenure helped Pastrana, a wealthy
former president's son who was narrowly defeated by the incumbent
in 1994. Many Colombians view Pastrana as an intellectual
lightweight.
	   ``Pastrana is bad and Serpa is corrupt. That's why I voted for
the bad one,'' said Luis Eduardo Gutierrez, a 59-year-old tailor
interviewed in Bogota's central square.
	   Serpa, a populist firebrand and veteran politician, was interior
minister for most of Samper's administration and defended his boss
in a corruption scandal that battered Colombia's international
image and economy.
	   In a concession speech, Serpa vowed to ``continue fighting for
the people and for peace in Colombia.''
	   Pastrana inherits a 34-year-old guerrilla war that has reached
new depths of violence in recent months, with stepped-up massacres
of civilians by right-wing paramilitary forces and assassinations
of human rights workers.
	   Hundreds congregated outside Pastrana's campaign headquarters,
blocking traffic. Some danced to vallenato and cumbia music, others
shouted ``Andres. Andres''
	   Campaign adviser Jimmy Camargo said Pastrana never dreamed he
would win by more than a half million votes.
	   ``It's surprising. It's incredible,'' he said. ``The horrible
night is over.''
	   Voter turnout was 54.7 percent, down from 43.3 percent in the
1994 runoff.
	   Pastrana pledged to help ``the poorest people, the most
marginalized. That is our commitment, to improve the quality of
life of 18 million Colombians who today live in poverty.''
	   The May 31 first round of elections was a virtual tie between
Pastrana and Serpa, with independent candidate Noemi Sanin, who was
backed by anti-corruption forces, placing a close third. Pastrana
apparently won the lion's share of Sanin votes.
	   Compared to other recent elections, relatively little rebel
violence was reported.
	   Guerrillas attacked two helicopters and ambushed a police truck
on Sunday in two separate incidents, killing two police officers
and wounding six, officials said. Since Friday, guerrillas have
kidnapped at least 11 election officials and burned 37 vehicles
nationwide.
	   Samper, who came under attack for alleged links to drug
traffickers, bought the support of regional political bosses by
doling out hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds.
Meanwhile, unemployment soared to 14.5 percent and the deficit more
than doubled.
	   ``Serpa is a continuation of Samper's politics, which have
busted the country's economy,'' said Jairo Chaustre, 31, a
helicopter pilot who voted for Pastrana.
	   Maria Elena Restrepo, a 41-year-old publicist voting in Bogota,
disagreed.
	   ``Just because someone has a relative who is a thief doesn't
necessarily mean that they are themselves a thief,'' she said.
	   Like Samper, the 55-year-old Serpa was cleared of any wrongdoing
in the scandal over dlrs 6 million in contributions from the Cali
drug cartel to Samper's 1994 campaign _ the president by a loyal
congress and Serpa by the chief prosecutor.
	   Serpa was a top aide in Samper's 1994 campaign.
	   Both candidates billed themselves as the best chance for peace,
but the country's oldest and largest rebel group, the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, tacitly endorsed Pastrana last week.
	   Serpa had pledged to lower the work week from 48 to 40 hours,
earning the scorn of big business. Pastrana, son of the late
President Misael Pastrana, has promised a computer for every
schoolchild and a cut in the sales tax from 16 percent to 12
percent.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Gunfire and fireworks mixed with shouts
of ``death to America'' in a Beirut suburb Sunday as Shiite Muslim
sympathizers of Iran celebrated the Persian nation's victory over
the United States in a World Cup match.
	   South Beirut, where Iran enjoys wide following among fellow
Shiites, erupted into celebrations as soon as the game was over
with Iran's 2-1 win over the United States in Lyon, France.
	   ``We cannot express our feeling. It is a magnificent victory
against the Great Satan,'' said Hassan Jammal, 25, borrowing from
the Iranian revolutionary vocabulary of describing the United
States.
	   Thousands of people took to the streets or stood on apartment
balconies. They cheered, showered rice or danced the folk dabke
dance in the traditional Lebanese way of celebrating.
	   Many drove around on motorcycles and cars, waving Iranian flags
and honking. They occasionally pulled pistols or AK-47 assault
rifles and emptied them in the air.
	   Fireworks also lit the night sky over south Beirut.
	   Some people shouted ``Death to America,'' the standard Iranian
anti-U.S. slogan that is also used by Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed
Lebanese guerrilla group.
	   Lebanese Shiites form the largest single sect in this nation of
about 3 million people.
	   ``It's a crushing defeat for the Americans more than it is a
victory for Iran,'' said Abu Ali, 35, as he drove off in his car,
packed with revelers.
	   In the southern port city of Tyre in Shiite-populated southern
Lebanon, Ali Hamadeh set aside the flag of the German team he
supports to wave Iran's colors in front a big screen on the sandy
beach just a few kilometers (miles) from Israeli army lines.
	   ``It felt just as good as a rocket being fired on Israel,'' the
21-year-old said about the Iranian victory.

SAN FRANCISCO: another bogey. 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   Stewart led after each of the first three rounds but finally
gave up the top spot when he made consecutive bogeys on Nos. 12 and
13, the first when he had the bad luck to drive into a divot and
the second when he couldn't get up and down from the thick
greenside rough.
	   Janzen put the squeeze on coming down the stretch, hitting iron
shots to 8 feet (2.5 meters) on No. 11 and 4 feet (1.3 meters) on
No. 13 to take the lead.
	   ``That's the one where I started thinking I was in the hunt,''
Janzen said about the birdie on No. 11.
	   And, as at Baltusrol when he won the Open, Janzen refused to
make mistakes down the stretch.
	   The key may have come on No. 17, where Janzen was five over par
in the first three rounds. After Stewart pulled back into a tie on
No. 14, Janzen play two perfect shots to the green on the 468-yard
(428 meter) hole and made a good two-putt par from 35 feet (10.5
meters), motioning playfully for the first putt to turn toward the
hole.
	   ``I wanted that hole today,'' Janzen said. ``I didn't want to
say that was the hole that undid me.''
	   Stewart lost the lead for good when he went from the rough to
the rough to the bunker and made a bogey on No. 16.

Eds: Contains items on Prince William, Gianni Versace's companion,
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Admitting tacitly that his first birthday without
his mother would be difficult, Prince William, Princess Diana's
handsome elder son, turned 16 on Sunday, spending the day with
friends and talking on the phone to his family.
	   Alongside hundreds of pictures and gushing columns of newsprint
about the boy born to be king, tabloid newspapers marked the
birthday weekend with new promises to respect his privacy _ made
after Diana was killed Aug. 31 in a Paris car crash, with
photographers in pursuit.
	   William, who with head-turning looks and a shy smile bears a
striking resemblance to Diana, stared out from the pages.
	   There was the chubby baby taken along on an official tour of
Australia; the laughing toddler rushing toward Diana's outstretched
arms; the gap-toothed boy starting school; the hesitant-looking
child whose parents' marriage fell apart before a watching world;
and the tall, solemn boy following his mother's coffin to
Westminster Abbey.
	   In addition to celebrating his birthday with friends, whose
names were not provided, William marked the occasion by giving an
interview to the British news agency, Press Association.
	   ___
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The companion of slain designer Gianni
Versace says he wants to design his own fashion label but won't try
to imitate Versace's style.
	   Antonio D'Amico, who was staying with Versace in the Miami villa
when the designer was shot to death in July, was quoted as saying
in Sunday's Corriere della Sera, a Milan daily, that he and a
friend had started a fashion house whose label would carry
D'Amico's name.
	   ``The teaching by Gianni, an authentic artistic genius, was an
extraordinary school for me but I won't present myself as a
copier,'' D'Amico was quoted as saying. ``He was unique, and I have
my tastes and my style.''
	   D'Amico was hoping to start the collection in time for men's
fashion shows in early 1999, according to the report.
	   According to Versace's will, D'Amico is allowed to stay in the
designer's luxurious residences, including the Miami mansion. But
D'Amico, while acknowledging his companion's generosity, said:
``I'll never set foot again (in the residences) because it would
only be fruitless suffering.''

	   BREST, France (AP) _ About 500 boats took to the sea Sunday
during ceremonies to pay tribute to Eric Tabarly, France's
best-known yachtsman who died last week.
	   While the boats, ranging from three-masters to small dinghies,
sailed in a light breeze, some 1,000 people, including President
Jacques Chirac, attended a religious service at the Lanveoc-Poulmic
naval base.
	   Shortly after, another ceremony was held at sea, and a wreath
was thrown into the water.
	   Tabarly, who crisscrossed oceans to win numerous solo titles,
was declared dead June 14 after falling overboard near Wales. He
was 66.
	   He was knocked into the sea two days earlier while changing the
main sail as his century-old sailboat _ the Pen Duick _ headed
toward Scotland in rough seas. Air and sea searches failed to
locate him.
	   ___
	   LONDON (AP) _ For the first time in a decade, druids and other
pagan groups gathered within the encircling rocks of Stonehenge at
dawn Sunday to celebrate the summer solstice.
	   About 100 people, including members of six druid groups, held
ceremonies at the 5,000-year-old monument in southwest England.
	   In one ceremony, druids in white robes formed a circle in the
center of the stone circle, striking a Tibetan gong to mark the
dawn of the year's longest day.
	   Revelers were banned from holding solstice ceremonies at
Stonehenge in the late 1980s after clashes with police.
	   On Sunday, police controlled access to the site and patrolled a
wide area around it. Six people were arrested for minor breaches of
public order, said a spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   English Heritage, which owns the site, said the decision to
allow 100 people into the monument was the first step toward
admitting larger crowds.
	   ___
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Hours after election results were
made official Sunday, one Czech politician made good on his
pre-election promise to swallow a live bug.
	   Heading into the weekend's elections, Eduard Kremlicka vowed he
would eat a June bug if his populist Pensioners for Secure Living
failed to make it into the parliament.
	   When it became clear his party had fallen short of their goal by
a clear 2 percent, he began searching for a big, brown June bug.
But none could be found, so instead he ingested a slightly smaller
click beetle _ still wiggling.
	   When asked by private F1 radio if he'd really eaten the bug,
Kremlicka deadpanned: ``Of course, it's full of protein.''
	   ``It's easy,'' he said. ``First you bite the head off, then you
squeeze the body _ or you can just munch on it because the legs are
still moving.''
	   Kremlicka said he had fulfilled his pre-election promise and
hoped that those parties elected would also make good on theirs.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A former Bogota mayor who promised to
end rampant political corruption won Sunday's presidential runoff,
embraced by voters who spurned a key player in the scandal-tainted
administration of President Ernesto Samper. Andres Pastrana, in his
second straight bit for Colombia's highest office, had 50.9 percent
against 46 percent for Horacio Serpa of the governing Liberal Party
with 89 percent of the vote counted, official results showed.
Public anger with Samper's tenure apparently helped Pastrana, who
was narrowly defeated by the incumbent in 1994 Serpa, a populist
firebrand and veteran politician, was interior minister for most of
Samper's administration, defending the incumbent in a corruption
scandal that battered Colombia's international image and economy.

	   LYON, France (AP) _ Iran, whose political rivalry with the
United States has spanned nearly two decades, beat the Americans
2-1 in a World Cup soccer match Sunday that set off wild
celebrations in France and Iran. It was the first soccer match
between the former allies whose governments are tentatively
reaching out to each other after years of bad blood. The tension
surrounding the most politically charged game of the tournament
erupted into a frenzy of celebrations after Iran eliminated the
United States from the World Cup. Celebrations promised to last for
hours. In Tehran, Iran, millions of Iranians poured into the
streets chanting ``Iran,'' cars speeding aimlessly honked non-stop
and people wept and smiled in joy. (SPORTS-SOCCER-US-IRAN)
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Heavy fighting was reported south
and west of Kosovo's capital Sunday despite the latest
international efforts to calm the conflict in the secessionist
Serbian province. There were fierce battles for control of the two
main roads crossing Kosovo, based on reports from sources
affiliated with both warring sides _ Serb forces and ethnic
Albanian militants. In another sign the situation is deteriorating,
Serb and Albanian villagers were exchanging fire northwest of the
capital Pristina, the Albanians' Kosovo Information Center
reported. More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated
earlier this year between government forces and guerrillas who
enjoy increasing support among ethnic Albanians, a 90 percent
majority in the province of 2.2 million people. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Days before his departure for China, President
Bill Clinton and his administration made plain their view that
shunning the world's most populous nation, either by refusing to
talk to its leaders or imposing trade restrictions, would be a
disaster for the United States. ``In isolating China, we would only
encourage China to turn inward and to act in opposition to our
interests and values,'' Clinton wrote in an essay published Sunday
by Newsweek. Clinton leaves Wednesday for the first visit to
Beijing by a U.S. president since the 1989 crackdown against
pro-democracy students. The trip has been widely criticized by
Republicans and human rights advocates as giving tacit recognition
to the Chinese government's policies. (US-CHINA)
	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Protests and technical glitches marred a
peaceful first round of presidential elections Sunday in the West
African country of Togo, where former dictator President Gnassigbe
Eyadema was bidding to extend his 31-year rule. Few people doubted
whether Eyadema would advance past the first round against five
challengers. If a candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote,
he automatically becomes president. If not, the two top
vote-getters face off in the second round. Initial results were
expected Monday. (TOGO)

<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ Brian Barnes earned his first Senior PGA
Tour victory Sunday with a 4-under-par 68 that left him strokes
ahead of three players at the dlrs 1.1 million AT and T Canada
Senior Open.
	   Barnes, 53, started the final round three shots behind
third-round leader Walter Hall at the 6,942-yard (6,345-meter)
Glencoe Golf and Country Club. His Sunday round, which included an
eagle with a 75-foot (23-meter) putt at the par-5 14th, gave him an
11-under 277 total and the dlrs 165,000 first prize.
	   Barnes, who won the British Senior Open in 1995 and 1996,
followed the eagle with a birdie on No. 15 that gave him a
three-shot lead.
	   Dana Quigley also closed with a 68 and finished tied for second
at 279 with Bruce Summerhays and Tom Jenkins, who both had 70s on
Sunday.
	   Hall never recovered from bogeys on Nos. 3, 7 and 8, finished
with a 74 and was alone at 280.

Janzen wins U.S. Open AP Golf Writer

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Lee Janzen won the 1993 U.S. Open by
holding off Payne Stewart down the stretch. On Sunday, he turned
back Stewart once again in the Open, this time by overcoming a
seven-stroke deficit.
	   Showing startling confidence on a day when no one was making
birdies at The Olympic Club, Janzen played the final 15 holes four
under par for a 68 to finish at even-par 280, one stroke ahead of
Stewart.
	   Stewart came to the 18th hole needing a birdie to force an
18-hole playoff. But his approach was above the hole and he had a
very difficult, very fast downhill, curling putt.
	   When the ball broke just low of the hole Janzen, who was
watching on TV, let out a big sigh and buried his head in a towel.
	   Stewart tapped in and walked dejectedly off the green.
	   Janzen had closed out his round 20 minutes earlier when he
tapped in a 2-foot (70 cms) par putt while his father Larry
clapped, appreciating the shot on U.S. Father's Day.
	   ``That might not have looked like a long putt but it couldn't
have been longer,'' Janzen said about his final stroke.
	   Janzen, playing two groups in front of Stewart, made bogeys on
two of the first three holes and fell seven strokes behind _ the
same margin Billy Casper erased in the final nine holes against
Arnold Palmer in the 1966 U.S. Open at Olympic.
	   But for the fourth consecutive time, the third-round leader in
the U.S. Open at The Olympic Club was not able to protect the lead.
Like Stewart, Ben Hogan in 1955, Arnold Palmer in 1966 and Tom
Watson in 1987 all finished second.
	   Because none of those three ever won another major championship,
Olympic is known as the Graveyard of Champions. Stewart, 41, won
the PGA Championship in 1989 and the U.S. Open in 1991 and must now
wonder if he will join them.
	   When Stewart stood on the second green he could see that there
was no red on the leaderboard. No one among the contenders was
making birdies, no one was making a move.
	   Then, after getting a break when his ball hung in a tree briefly
on No. 5 before falling to the ground, Janzen kick-started his
comeback when he chipped in from 15 feet (4.5 meters) to save par
on the hole. He never made another bogey.
	   Stewart led after each of the first three rounds but finally
gave up the top spot when he made consecutive bogeys on Nos. 12 and
13, the first when he had the bad luck to drive into a divot and
the second when he couldn't get up and down from the thick
greenside rough.
	   Janzen put the squeeze on coming down the stretch, hitting iron
shots to 8 feet (2.5 meters) on No. 11 and 4 feet (1.3 meters) on
No. 13 to take the lead.
	   ``That's the one where I started thinking I was in the hunt,''
Janzen said about the birdie on No. 11.
	   And, as at Baltusrol when he won the Open, Janzen refused to
make mistakes down the stretch.
	   The key may have come on No. 17, where Janzen was five over par
in the first three rounds. After Stewart pulled back into a tie
with a curling 15-foot (4.5 meters) on No. 14, Janzen play two
perfect shots to the green on the 468-yard (428-meter) hole and
made a good two-putt par from 35 feet (10.5 meters), motioning
playfully for the first putt to turn toward the hole.
	   ``I wanted that hole today,'' Janzen said. ``I didn't want to
say that was the hole that undid me.''
	   Stewart lost the lead for good when he went from the rough to
the rough to the bunker and made a bogey on No. 16.
	   Meanwhile, no one else among those within striking distance was
able to mount a charge on the firm, fast and frightening Lake
Course at Olympic.
	   Jeff Maggert, Bob Tway and Nick Price _ all veterans of major
championship pressure _ had a chance but failed to make a move.
	   Perhaps the most heartbreaking of the also-rans was Tom Lehman,
who started the day four strokes behind Stewart and was playing in
the final group on the final day at the U.S. Open for the fourth
consecutive year.
	   But he merely added a fifth-place finish to the third, second
and third he has had the three previous years.
	   Similarly, none of the young guns expected to contend in this
Open was a factor. David Duval closed with a 69 and was at 287,
along with Lee Westwood, the young Englishman.
	   Justin Leonard, Ernie Els, Tiger Woods and Jim Furyk were never
a factor.
	   Other thrills came from other places.
	   Casey Martin rode up the 18th fairway in his cart to warm cheers
from the gallery and closed with a 72 to be at 291. Jack Nicklaus,
playing the Open for the 42nd time, was at 295, one stroke better
than Els, the defending champion.
	   Amateur Matt Kuchar, who turned 20 on Sunday, shot a 74 and was
at 289, one stroke better than Woods, who closed with a 73 that
included a three-putt from 7 feet (2.3 meters) on the final hole.
	   John Daly shot a 78, including a quadruple bogey when he
four-putted after missing a one-footer he tried to backhand, and
was at 297.

Policeman in coma as police battle fans as shine taken off World Cup action AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By ROBERT MILLWARD
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A policeman lay in a coma, the victim of an iron
bar wielded by a German soccer fan. Iranian dissidents clashed with
police during a politically charged match between Iran and the
United States.
	   Skinhead fans were detained before a match between Germany and
Yugoslavia and there were signs of more violence from English
supporters.
	   Somehow, even on the most thrilling day yet at the World Cup,
the stars weren't allowed to shine.
	   Gabriel Batistuta scored an 11-minute hat-trick for Argentina
and Ariel Ortega, wearing the No. 10 shirt made famous by Diego
Maradona, added two more in a 5-0 crushing of Jamaica. It was a
result that put the two-time titlist into the last 16 but ended the
World Cup debuts both of Jamaica and Japan.
	   Germany, the team that refuses to lose, hit back with two goals
to force a dramatic 2-2 tie with Yugoslavia after being outplayed
for most of the game. Both are favored to reach the next round.
	   Then came Iran 2, United States 1.
	   In a game that had a huge political background between two
nations that haven't spoken to each other for almost two decades,
Iran couldn't have chosen a better opponent for its first ever
World Cup victory.
	   That result kept the Iranians in the competition but left the
Americans to follow Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Jamaica and Japan to
the airport after the first round of games.
	   Goalscorers Hamid Estili and Mehdi Mahdavikia are names that now
will famous in their own country as the players who knocked their
avowed political enemy out of the World Cup.
	   The Iranians were leading 2-0 by the time the Americans, who hit
the bar once and the post twice, hit back through Brian McBride two
minutes from the end. When the final whistle blew, the entire
Iranian bench ran onto the field to hug those on the field.
	   The victory marked the biggest triumph yet for a nation who
dropped out of big-time international soccer after the revolution
of 1979 and began the long road back in 1991.
	   Yugoslavia, banned from the last World Cup and two European
Championships because of the wars in Croatia and Bosnia, also had
something to prove here.
	   Facing three-time titlist and European champion Germany, the
Yugoslavs went 2-0 ahead through goals by Dejan Stankovic and
Dragan Stojkovic.
	   The Germans, with 37-year-old Lothar Matthaeus making his 125th
appearance and a World Cup record 27th, looked short of ideas. But
they hit back with goals by Oliver Bierhoff and Michael Tarnat to
earn a tie.
	   ``We made possible what seemed impossible,'' German coach Berti
Vogts said. ``We turned defeat into a near victory. ... They wanted
to toy with us instead of trying to score a third goal, and they
got punished for that.''
	   Yugoslav coach Slobodan Santrac saw it another way. ``I am happy
with the outcome,'' he said, ``but I am sad that we let the victory
slip away.''
	   Argentina never looked like letting anything slip away against
the debutant Jamaicans, especially after Ortega fired the South
Americans ahead and Jamaica's Darryl Powell was ejected before half
time for two yellow cards.
	   From then on it was a procession of goals _ Ortega adding the
third 10 minutes into the second half and setting up the third for
Batistuta in the 73rd. It was 4-0 when Batistuta struck again in
the 79th and, when Ortega was hauled down by Christopher Dawes, the
Fiorentina striker completed his hat-trick.
	   ``Batistuta deserves to have scored all those goals because he
worked very hard,'' said Argentina coach Daniel Passarella, who has
not been a great fan of the star and dropped him from qualifying
games. ``I hope he'll keep scoring and bring Argentina to the
final.''
	   The action continued Monday with England vs. Romania at Toulouse
and Colombia vs. Tunisia at Montpellier and that meant more work
for the security forces.
	   The police detained more than 80 fans at Marseille last weekend,
many of them English, after rioting with locals and there were
signs of more trouble in Toulouse Sunday night.
	   But the biggest problems were at Lens.
	   Television footage showed 44-year-old policeman Daniel Nivel
lying on the pavement in a pool of blood after he had been struck
over the head with an iron bar by a German fan and he was taken to
hospital in a coma.
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux said 86 soccer fans _ many of
them German skinheads _ were detained after clashes with riot
police before and after the match against Yugoslavia.
	   Police also were in action during the U.S.-Iran game at Lyon.
	   They had to go into the stands several times to prevent Iranian
dissidents protesting against the Tehran government. Some
supporters were escorted out of the stadium.
	   Minor scuffles broke out in the stands, forcing some fans who
had come with children, to leave. Outside the stadium before the
game, there were minor arguments with supporters of the opposition
Mujahedeen Khalq and backers of Iran's Islamic government.

World Cup: Who needs Maradona? Ortega, Batistuta doing fine 
</HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ No Diego Maradona? No problem.
	   After coming into a World Cup without its former superstar for
the first time in two decades, Argentina seems to have found not
just one but two suitable heirs.
	   Ariel Ortega, wearing Maradona's old number 10 jersey, pushed
the two-time titlists ahead with two goals and Gabriel Batistuta
added an 11-minute hat-trick late in the game as Argentina thumped
Jamaica 5-0 Sunday to reach the round of 16.
	   For years, Maradona was the center of attention for Argentina,
scoring miraculous goals, leading the country to the 1986 title and
making just as spectacular news off the field. He was kicked out of
the World Cup four years ago after a positive drug test during the
tournament.
	   The team collapsed after that sudden exit, and many observers
have wondered who would provide the magic at France '98 for coach
Daniel Passarella.
	   The answer might have come Sunday.
	   ``Ortega played a great game,'' Passarella said after the stocky
forward made the Parc des Princes his personal playground. ``He was
beaten up but fortunately not injured. He played a smart game, not
only on the individual level but also as a team player. He used the
spaces that were there.''
	   The 24-year-old scored in the 32nd and 55th minutes by finishing
similar, well-executed attacks.
	   Then he turned provider, assisting on Batistuta's first goal,
and earned the penalty that the Fiorentina star slotted in to round
off the rout. Batistuta, who tallied in the 73rd, 79th and 83rd
minutes, moved atop the tournament scoring table with four goals.
	   Passarella had dropped the man known as ``Batigol'' from the
starting 11 during World Cup qualifying. Now he's counting on the
veteran to lead the team.
	   ``Batistuta deserves to have scored all those goals because he
worked very hard,'' the coach said. ``I hope he'll keep scoring and
bring Argentina to the final.''
	   Batistuta is a classic finisher and raised his career tally to
46 goals in 62 national team appearances. Ortega provides the
all-field vision and slick moves that help create chances, but
showed Sunday that he, too, has a nose for the net.
	   If that pair keeps clicking, the South Americans must be
considered a threat to continue their impressive record at the
World Cup, where they have played in three of the past championship
matches.
	   Behind the attack stands a defensive unit that has now
registered seven consecutive shutouts, counting France '98 warmup
games.

Japanese learn gospel at Harlem workshop 
</HEADLINE>
AP Photos NYR101-106
By LISI de BOURBON
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Genevieve Brown was skeptical when she heard a
group of Japanese visitors were to perform gospel music at Harlem's
Memorial Baptist Church.
	   ``I said to myself, `Japanese people singing gospel _ now that's
a good one,''' said Brown, who asked a parishioner to take her to
the church Saturday. ``I want to see these people singing gospel,
you hear me?''
	   After listening to two thunderous numbers, it was clear to Brown
that the Japanese had a baptism by fire _ and brimstone.
	   ``I've never seen anything like it,'' she said. ``I'm just sorry
I didn't bring my camera. I'll never forget it.''
	   Nor will Akiko Namba, a 28-year-old from Osaka who is studying
English here. Enthralled parishioners swarmed her with hugs and
handshakes after she led the 22-member choir to ``Come on in This
House'' at a pre-Father's Day concert.
	   Namba had just learned the hymn during her first lesson ever
with Terrance Kennedy, instructor of a gospel workshop at the
church.
	   The workshop was the brainchild of Tommy Tomita, owner of Harlem
Connection Inc., a company that takes Japanese tourists sightseeing
in the New York City neighborhood.
	   Tomita, a former Tokyo jazz club impresario, often received
requests from clients about learning more about black music, said
his business partner, Takeshi Oguda.
	   ``The black culture is very important in Japan,'' said Oguda.
``Instead of Tommy just talking to them about it, they can
understand it on an emotional level if they participate in
something like this.''
	   Tomita approached James Ford, head of Memorial Baptist's tourist
ministry, about starting a workshop. The pastor, the Rev. Preston
R. Washington Sr. liked the idea.
	   ``He gave his blessing,'' Ford said. ``We're in the soul-saving
business. If we can bring anyone to Christ through song, we have
accomplished something.''
	   The three-hour gospel sessions, which began in May, cost dlrs 30
each.
	   Though they spoke little English, the fledgling altos, sopranos
and tenors picked up their parts quickly, Kennedy said.
	   ``Music has its own spirit and that serves as the translator,''
he said.
	   Oguda is called upon occasionally to translate whenever the
singers hit a snag.
	   From a bench in front of a gleaming Steinway piano inside the
church's sanctuary, Kennedy bellowed instructions.
	   ``Louder, louder, louder,'' he prodded the group of mostly
women.
	   Within minutes, Kennedy had them singing, ``He Has Done
Marvelous Things.''
	   Chiaki Morishima, a soprano, couldn't stop smiling as she belted
out the words and the audience of 200 joyously responded.
	   ``The first time I sing gospel, I'm happy,'' said Morishima, 32,
a clay toy designer from Chiba, Japan, who currently lives in
downtown Manhattan.

World Cup: Yet again, Yugoslavia fails to beat Germany 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Nearly every World Cup team would be happy
to tie Germany, the three-time world champions.
	   But not the Yugoslavs, who wasted what they called ``a historic
chance'' to pay back the Germans for a history of defeats.
	   ``They came back from the dead,'' Yugoslav captain Dragan
Stojkovic said after Germany came back from a two-goal deficit to
steal a 2-2 draw Sunday. ``We wasted a historic chance to pay them
back for all those losses in the past.''
	   Yugoslavia and Germany have played five times in the World Cup.
Germany won four of those matches, while Yugoslavia's only win came
in 1962 in Chile. The last time Yugoslavia beat the Germans was in
a 1973 friendly.
	   ``The Germans ... simply never die on the pitch. They never give
up. We let them walk away,'' said Yugoslav star forward Predrag
Mijatovic, who wasted a perfect chance to make it 3-0 late in the
second half.
	   In a match between the two Group F favorites, the inspired
Yugoslavs looked on course for three points just after halftime
when Stojkovic made the score 2-0.
	   The 19-year-old rising star, Dejan Stankovic, had opened the
scoring for Yugoslavia in the 13th minute.
	   Very much under control until then, the Yugoslavs began showing
off their remarkable technical talent and forgot about threatening
the German goal.
	   The stubborn Germans took advantage of the unexpected gift from
the so-called ``European Brazilians.''
	   First, Germany benefited from a fortunate deflection goal in the
74th minute.
	   Michael Tarnat, a second-half substitute, fired a powerful
left-footed free kick from 25 meters (yards) that struck sweeper
Sinisa Mihajlovic's outstretched right boot and changed direction,
giving goalkeeper Ivica Kralj no chance. The goal was credited to
Tarnat.
	   With 10 minutes left, Oliver Bierhoff, always good under
pressure, tied the score.
	   ``We made possible what seemed impossible,'' German coach Berti
Vogts said. ``We turned defeat into a near victory. They wanted to
toy with us instead of trying to score a third goal and they got
punished for that.''
	   With Germany and Yugoslavia having won their opening games, both
teams knew that victory would mean a near-certain place in the next
round.
	   The Yugoslavs, who play the United States on Thursday, appeared
gloomy and dejected after the game.
	   ``It will be tough to play the Americans after this,''
midfielder Slavisa Jokanovic said. ``But we have to forget the
Germany game and prepare for the Americans. Life goes on.''

World Cup: Once revered, Cha now dished 
</HEADLINE>
By ERICA BULMAN
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   SAINT-QUENTIN, France (AP) _ The price of failure at the World
Cup is high. For South Korean coach Cha Bum-kun, it cost him his
job.
	   The most famous and successful striker in the history of South
Korean football, the once revered ``Brown Bomber'' is now
considered just a bomb.
	   With his team's string of failures at this World Cup _ the
failure to even muster a single goal in losses to Mexico or
Netherlands _ it was only a matter of time before Cha was fired.
	   His players' humiliating 5-0 defeat at the hands of the Dutch in
Marseille on Saturday sealed Cha's fate. Koreans soccer officials
called a special committee meeting in Paris the following day and
decided to fire the former international.
	   ``Someone had to take the blame,'' said Cha, who spent 10 years
in Germany with Bayer Leverkusen and Eintracht Frankfort between
1979 and 1989, winning the UEFA Cup with both teams. ``I tried my
best but the result was poor.''
	   Cha, who said he was upset but not bitter about the dismissal,
added if the Korean Football Association ever offered him a second
chance, he would ``get better results.''
	   He also said he would study the video of his team's matches to
work out what went wrong.
	   To many it was obvious.
	   The South Korean media heavily criticized Cha for mismanagement
of the team and an unwise selection for his starting lineup against
Mexico.
	   Cha also adopted a seemingly naive strategy against the
Netherlands, electing for man-to-man marking of the great Dutch
strikes. It wasn't enough to stop the likes of Dennis Bergkamp.
	   Cha became coach in January 1997, replacing 1995 Asian Coach of
the Year Park Jong-hwan after Park was dismissed following the
country's elimination in the quarterfinals of the Asian Cup against
Iran the year before.
	   If Cha's World Cup campaign was a disaster, his build-up to the
event was anything but.
	   Marching his team through qualifying with a 9-2-1 record, Cha's
only blemish was a sensitive 2-0 defeat at the hands of traditional
rival Japan.
	   In matches leading up to the World Cup after qualifying, Cha
guided the team to a respectable 14 wins, seven draws and six
defeats.
	   But all of that has already been forgotten.
	   South Korean TV stations reported that a record number of
viewers stayed up to watch the Netherlands match live. Crushed by
their team's dismal 5-0 defeat, many called for Cha's removal.
	   South Koreans were particularly upset because arch-rival Japan
looked somewhat respectable in a 1-0 loss to Croatia earlier in the
day.
	   Cha will be replaced by his assistant coach Kim Pyong-seok, one
of Cha's teammates on the South Korean national squad at the 1986
World Cup in Mexico.
	   It will be up to Kim to lead the emotionally battered team as it
hopes for its first-ever victory in five World Cup appearances. The
team is particularly hungry to justify its role as co-host of the
2002 Cup finals with Japan.

World Cup: Dutch relax after World Cup's biggest win 
</HEADLINE>
By MIKE CORDER
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   MONACO (AP) _ After a 5-0 victory at the World Cup, an easy day
at work is certainly in order.
	   That was the reward Sunday for the Dutch players who took part
in the rout of South Korea. While the rest of the squad went
through a full practice session, the stars of Saturday's victory
had little more than a lighthearted kick around in the late
afternoon sun.
	   Four players, including three goal scorers, sat out even the
light training with what team officials described as ``minor
knocks'' suffered during the biggest margin-of-victory win of the
World Cup so far.
	   Among them was Dennis Bergkamp, who was feeling the effects of
playing 78 minutes in his first start since injuring a hamstring in
April. Also resting were Phillip Cocu, Jaap Stam and Pierre van
Hooijdonk.
	   Looking relaxed, Guus Hiddink denied he had taken a risk by
putting Cocu, normally a defensive midfielder, up front next to
Bergkamp. Both Cocu and Bergkamp scored memorable goals Saturday in
Marseille.
	   ``I did not for a moment think it was a gamble,'' Hiddink said.
``Phillip can play a defensive midfield role, but that is not all
... He always has the strength to penetrate and he is strong in the
air''
	   As Korean coach Cha Bum-kun was packing his bags after being
fired in the aftermath of the 5-0 thrashing, Hiddink was looking
forward to Thursday's match with Mexico and then a possible
round-of-16 matchup with Germany.
	   ``The Mexico match will be a very different game,'' he said,
noting that Mexico came back from a 2-0 deficit to draw 2-2 with
Belgium in a match in which both teams finished with 10 men.
	   And asked about a possible confrontation with Germany, Hiddink
oozed confidence.
	   ``It is a possibility and I do not fear that possibility,'' he
said.

World Cup: France faces week without Zizou 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Recaps previous.
By RAF CASERT
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   CLAIREFONTAINE. France (AP) _ The host nation enters a new World
Cup week facing a troublesome question: Can it survive the next
seven days without star playmaker Zinedine Zidane?
	   France has qualified for the second round even ahead of its last
first-round game Wednesday, but coach Aime Jacquet wants at least a
draw from the game against Denmark so his team can win Group C
outright and avoid a round-of-16 clash with Nigeria next Sunday.
	   Zidane has been called the genius France cannot do without if it
wants to lift the World Cup July 12. But all that has been put into
question because of his two-game suspension for deliberately
planting his studs in the side of an opponent.
	   ``Nobody can replace him. There is nobody like him,'' said
Jacquet. ``But he can be assured, the team will play for him.''
	   If France keeps winning, Zidane returns to the lineup for the
July 3-4 quarterfinals.
	   With the Juventus midfielder sidelined, Jacquet could well be
looking at Robert Pires of Racing Metz to fill in the gap.
	   Who?
	   At 24, Pires has led provincial Metz into next season's European
Champions League as French runner-up. But despite 15 selections for
Les Bleus, he has yet to make a big impression on the international
stage.
	   ``I sometimes think the players have no confidence in me,''
Pires said. ``For long I've been taken for just someone from a
small club.''
	   And Jacquet is unlikely to transfer the full weight of Zidane's
responsibility on Pires' shoulders.
	   Inter Milan's Youri Djorkaeff, another battle-hardened star from
Italy's Serie A, could be pulled into the center to provide
authority and help get balls to the two 20-year-old forwards,
Thierry Henry and David Trezeguet.
	   Henry already scored three goals in the first two games, but the
lack of Zidane's playmaking ability could stifle him.
	   Jacquet could make drastic changes for the Denmark game, resting
captain Didier Deschamps and even defenders Laurent Blanc and
Bixente Lizarazu, all of whom had already had a yellow card.
	   If France survives the Denmark game, it will bypass Nigeria and
play either Spain, Bulgaria or Paraguay in the second round in
Lens.
	   Whatever happens, Zidane is convinced his World Cup role is far
from over.
	   ``I'll rejoin my colleagues in the quarterfinal,'' he said.

German hooligans riot in northern France; policeman in coma 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: Recaps previous.
By NESHA STARCEVIC
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   LENS, France (AP) _ German soccer hooligans fought street
battles with French police around Germany's World Cup match against
Yugoslavia, leaving one police officer in a coma.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old French police officer, was attacked
just minutes after Sunday's World Cup match between Germany and
Yugoslavia.
	   Television footage showed Nivel lying face-down on a pavement in
a pool of blood. He was flown by helicopter to a hospital in the
city of Lille.
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux said the man who attacked the
officer was a German and had been arrested. In all, 96 people were
detained by police, most of them German.
	   Six of the people detained during the clashes with police before
and after the match were immediately deported, Cadoux said. Most
were German.
	   Another 15 were placed under formal investigation _ one step
short of being charged.
	   A Brazilian television cameraman was also injured in clashes,
police said, although he was not in serious condition.
	   Cadoux said the German hooligans were ``for the most part sober
_ not like the ones in Marseille,'' referring to English soccer
fans who rampaged in the southern French city last Monday after a
match against Tunisia.
	   He also said they were ``perfectly organized with means of
communication.''
	   ``They didn't come to support their team,'' Cadoux said. ``They
came to smash things up, to attack security forces.''
	   French Sports Minister Marie-George Buffet said Sunday she was
``angered'' by the violence, which she said had ``ruined the
party.''
	   ``How can it be that people can use sport for such ends?,'' she
said in an interview with television channel TF1. ``These people
will be pursued in the courts.''
	   Before the match, more than 20 German skinheads were detained.
Police used sticks to battle the Germans, who included known groups
of neo-Nazis who had arrived by train.
	   Riot police brought in reinforcements and sealed off the
downtown area.
	   As many as 450 skinheads were seen on the streets of Lens before
and after the match giving Nazi salutes, German news reports said.
	   Late Sunday, police patrolled the town in cars, but the
atmosphere was calm, and most fans had left. Most bar and
restaurant owners, fearing further violence, had closed shortly
after the match.
	   Only small groups of Germans wearing their national colors were
in the streets.
	   Many German fans who were victims of a ticket swindle had come
to Lens despite not being able to get into the match, which ended
2-2.

OPEC hopes to rescue oil market by cutting production AP Graphic OPEC AP Business Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE
<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ After failing to rescue the depressed oil
market by slashing production this spring, OPEC now hopes a new
round of cuts might do the trick.
	   But analysts and traders are skeptical, saying that even if the
oil producers find the willpower to follow though on all their new
promises about restraining output, it might not be enough to push
prices higher any time soon.
	   OPEC's average crude price plunged to dlrs 10.11 per barrel
early last week, less than half the group's official target of dlrs
21. Prices have not been so low since 1986, a year that brought
disaster to the global oil industry, from the palaces of the
wealthy Gulf sheiks to the small producers who had to shut down
their little wells in the U.S. oil patch.
	   The current cheap oil prices have been a bargain for consumers,
including gas-hungry vacationers preparing for summer getaways, but
they are devastating to OPEC and other producers.
	   The biggest OPEC exporters, including Saudi Arabia, Venezuela
and Iran, have joined smaller OPEC countries with pledges to cut
some 620,000 barrels of production daily, out of current output of
about 28.2 million barrels. Non-OPEC producers Mexico, Russia and
Oman are trying to help out with promises to remove another 203,000
barrels a day from the glutted market.
	   But even if all those cuts are made and sustained, and experts
have big doubts about this, traders say more than 1 million barrels
a day need to be removed.
	   ``When you look at the numbers, it doesn't add up,'' said Peter
Bogin, an analyst at Cambridge Energy Research Associates in Paris.
``There's too much supply going out for the next 18 to 24 months.''
	   Three producers, Nigeria, Algeria and Libya, had not announced
any new cuts ahead of the OPEC meeting that formally opens
Wednesday.
	   Experts believe these producers soon will chime in with cuts. It
also seems likely that some of the small players will clamor for
bigger cuts from Saudi Arabia. The world's top oil producer and
exporters has pledged the biggest cuts, 225,000 barrels per day,
but with more than 8 million barrels a day of production it has far
more oil than anybody else.
	   Saudi oil minister Ali Naimi has insisted, however, that his
nation won't return to a role of OPEC's ``swing producer,''
unilaterally adjusting its own massive output to keep markets in
balance.
	   Indonesia, hit by the double whammy of its own economic collapse
and low oil prices, has said it has no plans to cut back.
	   Volatility and oil prices have often gone hand in hand, but the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries created its own
crisis this time with the ill-judged decision to raise output last
winter. OPEC was blindsided by the magnitude of the Asian economic
crisis, which began choking off demand for crude oil just as the
market became oversaturated.
	   By the time OPEC started scaling back output, in an emergency
meeting in March, the damage was done. Repairing it won't be easy,
because any production cuts are unlikely to push prices quickly
higher. Thus, taking tough decisions now on output will cause more
short-term pain.
	   OPEC members agreed in an emergency meeting in March to slash
1.245 million barrels of oil production daily. Outside experts say
they came up short, cutting a little less than a million barrels.
	   The Center for Global Energy Studies in London has dubbed this
year ``OPEC's annus horribilis,'' and its chief economist, Leo
Drollas, says the once-powerful oil cartel might as well write off
1998.
	   As always, OPEC will be haunted by the specter of Iraq's
eventual full-scale return to the market. Iraq can only sell
limited amounts of oil under United Nations sanctions imposed after
its 1990 invasion of fellow OPEC member Kuwait, but there have been
indications that a settlement between Iraq and U.N. weapons
inspectors could be drawing closer.
	   OPEC members are Algeria, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Kuwait,
Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and
Venezuela.

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Gabriel Batistuta's hat trick paid off for a
charity in Argentina.
	   In recognition of the first three-goal performance of France 98,
McDonald's will donate dlrs 25,000 to the SOS Children's Villages
organization.
	   The fast food chain says it will make a charitable donation
every time there's a hat trick, with the amount increasing with
every round.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton said in a
televised message that the World Cup offered people around the
globe a chance ``to be judged not by the place they grew up, the
color of their skin, or the way they choose to worship, but by
their spirit, skill and strength.''
	   Clinton, in an address televised in English on the
Spanish-language network Univision before Sunday's U.S.-Iran game,
noted recent moves toward reconciliation by himself and Iran's
president.
	   ``As we cheer today's game between American and Iranian
athletes, I hope it can be another step toward ending the
estrangement between our nations,'' Clinton said. ``Over the last
year, President Khatami and I have both worked to encourage more
people-to-people exchanges, and to help our citizens develop a
better understanding of each other's rich civilizations.''
	   Iran won the game 2-1.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MONACO (AP) _ Dutch striker Dennis Bergkamp sat out training
Sunday, the day after playing 78 minutes and scoring a goal in the
5-0 Dutch demolition of South Korea.
	   Team officials described Bergkamp's injury as a ``minor knock''
and Bergkamp himself appeared relaxed and happy as he sat in the
sun watching his teammates train.
	   Bergkamp's return to the starting lineup Saturday was the jolt
the Dutch needed to get their World Cup campaign back on track
after last weekend's disappointing 0-0 draw with Belgium.
	   The Arsenal striker had been sidelined since April following a
hamstring injury. Although he came on as a second-half substitute
against Belgium, he could make no impression on the game.
	   But on Saturday in Marseille, he scored a quality goal in the
71st minute and created space for other attackers. His goal,
shrugging off two Korean defenders and sliding the ball past
goalkeeper Kim Byung-ji, was his 34th for the Netherlands in his
59th international appearance.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LENS, France (AP) _ Yugoslav central defender Miroslav Djukic is
out of the World Cup after tearing his calf muscle.
	   Djukic, 32, who plays for Valencia in Spain, suffered the injury
while warming up during a practice session Saturday ahead of the
Group F match against Germany on Sunday.
	   It will take at least four weeks for the injury to heal,
according to Yugoslav team doctors.
	   Djukic did not start in Yugoslavia's 1-0 opening victory against
Iran, but he was scheduled to start against Germany.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   CHANTILLY, France (AP) _ Spanish World Cup midfielder Gullermo
Amor is on the verge of closing a deal with Italian Serie A side
Fiorentina, thus ending a trophy-filled, 19-year association with
mighty FC Barcelona.
	   Sources close to the 30-year-old player said Sunday that
Fiorentina officials had met with the midfielder's representatives
this weekend in Paris to draw up a two-season deal which reportedly
will land the player dlrs 4 million.
	   Barcelona's Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal caused a storm in Spanish
soccer circles last month when he told Amor and at least two other
players that they had no future with the club.
	   Amor, one of the most liked players in Spanish soccer, joined
Barcelona as a boy playing for the youth side. He went on to win
several league titles and a prized European Champions Cup under
former coach Johan Cruyff.
	   Fellow international Albert Ferrer, who was also put on the
let-go list by Van Gaal, signed for England's European Cup Winners
Cup champion Chelsea earlier this month.

	   ST. PETERSBURG, Florida (AP) _ Pedro Martinez gave up only a
fifth-inning triple in eight innings Sunday, leading the Boston Red
Sox to a 3-1 win over the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
	   Martinez (9-2) struck out six and walked two. The right-hander,
who pitched a two-hitter against Seattle in April, regrouped after
Miguel Cairo's triple to retire the last 11 batters he faced.
	   Tom Gordon allowed Dave Martinez's single in the ninth to
complete the two-hitter and get his 23rd save in 24 chances.
	   Nomar Garciaparra hit his 10th homer off Jason Johnson (2-4) as
the Red Sox won for the ninth time in 11 games.
 &UR; Blue Jays 7, Orioles 3
	   In Baltimore, Ed Sprague hit two homers and Pat Hentgen pitched
seven gritty innings to earn his first win since May 25 as the
Toronto Blue Jays beat the Baltimore Orioles.
	   Sprague went 3-for-3 with a walk and drove in a season-high four
runs, giving him 400 RBIs for his career. Shawn Green and Carlos
Delgado also homered to help the Blue Jays gain a split of the
four-game series.
	   Hentgen (8-4) threw 128 pitches, allowing eight hits and walking
four. The right-hander, who struck out seven and did not have a
1-2-3 inning, was 0-1 in his previous four starts.
	   Randy Myers got one out for his 19th save, including three
against the Orioles, the team he left in the offseason.
	   Harold Baines homered for the Orioles, who stranded eight
runners through the first seven innings. Rookie Sidney Ponson (1-5)
was the loser.
 &UR; Twins 6, White Sox 1
	   In Chicago, Mike Morgan took a shutout into the ninth and Brent
Gates hit his first career grand slam to lead the Minnesota Twins
over the Chicago White Sox.
	   Morgan (4-2) was three outs away from his first shutout in
nearly five years when Mike Caruso homered on the right-hander's
first pitch. He allowed four hits, walked two and struck out one.
His last shutout came with the Cubs in 1993 against Colorado.
	   Hector Carrasco got his first save since June 1995.
	   Gates connected with two outs in the fourth inning for only his
second homer this year and 21st of his career. Jason Bere (3-7)
allowed six runs and four hits in four innings.
 &UR; Royals 6, Tigers 5
	   In Detroit, Jeff Conine hit a three-run double and Hipolito
Pichardo won his first game since May 5 as the Kansas City Royals
beat the Detroit Tigers.
	   Larry Sutton homered and had three RBIs for the Royals, who have
won seven of 10. Kansas City took three of four in Detroit to win
three straight series for the first time since September 1996.
	   Pichardo (3-6) gave up for runs and five hits in six innings. He
retired the last 11 he faced after Tony Clark and Luis Gonzalez hit
back-to-back homers in the third.
	   The Tigers closed to within a run on Gonzalez's RBI single in
the eighth, but Jeff Montgomery pitched the ninth for his 14th
save.
	   Rookie Denny Harriger (0-2) allowed six runs _ three earned _
and seven hits in 4 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Mariners 10, Athletics 5
	   In Seattle, Rico Rossy came up from the minors and hit his first
homer in nearly five years to lead Seattle.
	   Edgar Martinez added a two-run homer as the Mariners scored four
times in the fifth inning off Mike Oquist (4-4) to take the lead
and help Bill Swift (7-4) become the winningest pitcher on
Seattle's staff.
	   Alex Rodriguez went 4-for-5 and scored twice for the Mariners,
who won for just the second time in eight games despite making
three errors.
	   Trailing 3-2, the Mariners tied it when Rossy led off the fifth
with his fourth career homer, and first since July 5, 1993, with
Kansas City. Ken Griffey Jr. put the Mariners ahead with a
sacrifice fly and Martinez hit his 12th homer to make it 6-3.

	   LENS, France (AP) _ German soccer hooligans fought street
battles with French police around Germany's World Cup match against
Yugoslavia, leaving one police officer in a coma.
	   Daniel Nivel, a 44-year-old French police officer, was attacked
just minutes after Sunday's World Cup match between Germany and
Yugoslavia.
	   Television footage showed Nivel lying face-down on a pavement in
a pool of blood. He was flown by helicopter to a hospital in the
city of Lille.
	   Regional Prefect Daniel Cadoux said the man who attacked the
officer was a German and had been arrested. In all, 96 people were
detained by police, most of them German.
	   Six of the people detained during the clashes with police before
and after the match were immediately deported, Cadoux said. Most
were German.
	   Another 15 were placed under formal investigation _ one step
short of being charged.
	   A Brazilian television cameraman was also injured in clashes,
police said, although he was not in serious condition.
	   Cadoux said the German hooligans were ``for the most part sober
_ not like the ones in Marseille,'' referring to English soccer
fans who rampaged in the southern French city last Monday after a
match against Tunisia.
	   He also said they were ``perfectly organized with means of
communication.''
	   ``They didn't come to support their team,'' Cadoux said. ``They
came to smash things up, to attack security forces.''
	   French Sports Minister Marie-George Buffet said Sunday she was
``angered'' by the violence, which she said had ``ruined the
party.''
	   ``How can it be that people can use sport for such ends?,'' she
said in an interview with television channel TF1. ``These people
will be pursued in the courts.''
	   Before the match, more than 20 German skinheads were detained.
Police used sticks to battle the Germans, who included known groups
of neo-Nazis who had arrived by train.
	   Riot police brought in reinforcements and sealed off the
downtown area.
	   As many as 450 skinheads were seen on the streets of Lens before
and after the match giving Nazi salutes, German news reports said.
	   Late Sunday, police patrolled the town in cars, but the
atmosphere was calm, and most fans had left. Most bar and
restaurant owners, fearing further violence, had closed shortly
after the match.
	   Only small groups of Germans wearing their national colors were
in the streets.
	   Many German fans who were victims of a ticket swindle had come
to Lens despite not being able to get into the match, which ended
2-2.

Fighting breaks out for control of Kosovo roads 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Heavy fighting for control of two
important roads has broken out in the secessionist Serbian province
even as Russian diplomats made a new attempt to calm the conflict.
	   Sources affiliated with both Serb forces and ethnic Albanian
militants said the two sides were battling for control of the main
east-west and north-south arteries.
	   The separatist Kosovo Liberation Army, which claims to control
about 40 percent of the province, appeared to be trying to secure a
corridor along the east-west road.
	   Fighting reportedly was raging near that road Sunday outside the
town of Klina, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) west of Kosovo's
capital, Pristina. The Albanians' Kosovo Information Center said
four Albanians were wounded. The Serbs said Albanians killed an
18-year-old Serb villager.
	   Meanwhile, ethnic Albanians claimed Serb police and army forces
had opened fire on three villages in the south, sending civilians
fleeing to nearby woods.
	   ``It's a veritable state of war,'' spokesman Ali Sadriu said of
the situation along the north-south road near Stimlje, linking
Pristina to the southern town of Prizren.
	   The reports could not be independently verified.
	   In another sign the situation was deteriorating, Serb and
Albanian villagers exchanged fire northwest of Pristina, the Kosovo
Information Center said.
	   More than 300 people have died since fighting escalated earlier
this year between government forces and guerrillas who enjoy
increasing support among ethnic Albanians, who account for 90
percent of the province's 2.2 million people.
	   World powers have accused Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
of excessive brutality against ethnic Albanians. Despite threatened
NATO intervention, Milosevic has refused to comply with demands to
withdraw his estimated 45,000 to 50,000 police and Yugoslav army
soldiers from the province.
	   Russia, a traditional Serb ally, has promised to try to persuade
Belgrade to ease up on its attacks but says the West must get the
Kosovo Liberation Army to halt fighting as well.
	   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai Afanasyevsky flew to
Belgrade, Yugoslavia's capital, on Sunday and met with Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic. Russian diplomat Alexander Avdeyev went
for talks to Yugoslavia's neighbor Albania, considered a vital
source of support to the ethnic Albanian separatists.

<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ Despite yet another home run by streaking Sammy
Sosa, the Chicago Cubs fell to the Philadelphia Phillies 7-2 Sunday
when Bobby Abreu drove in four runs and Tyler Green struck out 10.
	   Sosa's solo home run in the fourth inning was his 17th this
month, extending his own major league record for homers in June and
tying Willie Mays' National League mark for home runs in any month.
	   With eight games still left in June, Sosa has a good chance to
break the U.S. Major League Baseball record for homers in a single
month of 18, set by Detroit's Rudy York in August 1937.
	   Sosa has hit 30 home runs this season. He has connected 10 times
in his last nine games, and 21 times in the last 22 games. After he
sent Green's 2-2 pitch into the bleachers, the Wrigley Field crowd
gave him a standing ovation and some fans behind the dugout bowed
as he returned.
	   Green (5-4) allowed five hits and two runs in six innings. Steve
Trachsel (6-4) gave up four runs and five hits in 4 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Mets 3, Marlins 2 &QC; 
	   In New York, John Franco escaped a bases-loaded, no-out jam in
the eighth inning as New York ended a four-game losing streak.
	   Al Leiter (9-3), traded from Florida to the Mets in the
offseason, won his sixth straight decision. He allowed two runs and
six hits in seven innings, striking out seven and walking a
season-high five.
	   After the Marlins loaded the bases in the eighth against two
relievers, Franco got John Wehner to hit a comebacker for a
forceout at the plate. Franco then struck out Mike Redmond and
pinch-hitter Mark Kotsay, and the lefty reliever ran off the mound
with both arms raised.
	   Franco got Edgar Renteria to hit into a double play, and got his
16th save.
	   Edgardo Alfonzo's single in the seventh brought in the go-ahead
run for New York.
 &UR; Expos 4, Braves 1
	   In Montreal, Dustin Hermanson pitched five-hit ball for eight
innings and the Expos gave Montreal manager Felipe Alou his 500th
career victory.
	   The Expos won two of three from Atlanta, winning their first
series against the Braves since July 1994.
	   Alou passed Gene Mauch for second place on the victory list of
Expos managers. Buck Rodgers leads with 520.
	   Hermanson (5-6) shut down the NL's top offense, allowing only a
seventh-inning home run to Michael Tucker.
	   Ugueth Urbina pitched the ninth for his 18th save.
	   Denny Neagle (8-5) allowed four runs _ three earned _ and six
hits in six innings.
 &UR; Pirates 8, Brewers 7 &QC; 
	   In Milwaukee, Jose Guillen hit a grand slam as Pittsburgh nearly
blew a seven-run lead.
	   The Brewers, trailing 8-1 in the seventh inning, came back
behind Jeff Cirillo. He hit a two-run single in the eighth, and
another two-run single with two outs in the ninth.
	   Milwaukee's three-run rally in the ninth ended, though, when
Dave Nilsson fouled out with the bases loaded to Ricardo Rincon,
who held on for his ninth save.
	   Esteban Loaiza (5-3) pitched seven solid innings in his longest
outing of the season. He gave up two runs and five hits, walked
none and struck out seven as the Pirates took three of four from
the Brewers.
	   Guillen was mired in an 8-for-46 slump (.173) before hitting his
sixth homer and first career grand slam for a 6-0 lead in the third
off Jeff Juden (6-6).
 &UR; Cardinals 5, Diamondbacks 4 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Clint Sodowsky's bases-loaded wild pitch in the
eighth inning helped the Cardinals extend their winning streak to
four games.
	   St. Louis, which trailed 4-1 in the sixth, is 7-2 against the
expansion Diamondbacks. The Cardinals have won six of seven overall
to climb a game above .500 for the first time since June 3.
	   Brady Raggio (1-1) pitched 2 1-3 scoreless innings and Jeff
Brantley worked the ninth for his 11th save.
	   After loading the bases, Sodowsky's first pitch to Delino
DeShields got past catcher Damian Miller for his fourth wild pitch
in 35 1-3 innings.
	   Mark McGwire, who leads the majors with 33 home runs, went
homerless for the third straight game. He walked in the first,
struck out in the third, was hit by a pitch in the fifth and
singled in the seventh.
 &UR; Astros 3, Reds 1
	   In Houston, Pete Schourek pitched six solid innings and Jeff
Bagwell drove in a run as Houston handed Cincinnati its eighth
straight loss.
	   The Astros swept the Reds in a three-game series for the first
time since 1992. Cincinnati has been swept six times this season.
	   The Reds, who lost nine in a row in 1996, have also lost eight
in a row on the road.
	   Schourek (4-5) allowed one run and five hits. Trever Miller
pitched 2 1-3 scoreless innings before being replaced Mike Magnante
in the ninth. Magnante pitched out of a two-on, one-out jam for his
first save.
	   Pete Harnisch (6-3) has lost two straight starts for the first
time this season.
 &UR; Rockies 11, Dodgers 6 &QC; 
	   In Denver, Dante Bichette homered and drove in five runs for
Colorado.
	   The Rockies used five- and six-run innings to split the
four-game series and overcome another big game by Eric Karros. He
homered twice and drove in four runs _ to go 7-for-17 with four
homers and 13 RBIs in the series.
	   Despite his problems with Karros, Bobby Jones (2-2) pitched the
fourth complete game for Colorado this season. He gave up 10 hits,
four in a two-run ninth.
	   Bichette's two-run single capped a five-run second inning off
Chan Ho Park (5-5). His three-run homer off Greg McMichael
accounted for the final runs in a six-run sixth.
 &UR; Padres 5, Giants 1
	   In San Francisco, Kevin Brown kept up his mastery of the Giants
with 8 2-3 impressive innings and the San Diego Padres beat San
Francisco for their 12th win in 13 games.
	   Rebounding from Saturday's 5-2 loss that snapped their
club-record tying 11-game winning streak, the Padres got a pair of
run-scoring singles from Carlo Hernandez in sending the Giants to
their eighth loss in 11 games. Six of those of defeats have come
against San Diego.
	   Tony Gwynn broke out of an 0-for-14 drought _ matching the
longest of his career _ by going 3-for-4 with an RBI. Steve Finley
hit a run-scoring triple as the Padres stretched their lead in the
NL West to 5 1/2 games over San Francisco.
	   Brown (8-3) improved to 6-0 with a 0.58 ERA in seven
regular-season starts against the Giants. He gave up seven hits,
struck out nine and walked one.
	   Trevor Hoffman closed for his 22nd save in 22 chances.
	   Orel Hershiser (6-5) was removed after three innings, his
shortest outing of the season.

	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ After riot police faced off with drunken
English soccer fans overnight, this jittery city was hoping tight
security would prevent it from becoming the next victim of World
Cup violence.
	   About 1,800 police were deployed in this southwestern city for
Monday evening's match between England and Romania, the day after a
policeman was left in a coma when German toughs clashed with
officers in the northern city of Lens.
	   Only in its second week, the five-week World Cup already was
developing a reputation for violence and ticket scandals that
organizers were desperately trying to crush. But the problems
persisted.
	   Late Sunday, drunken English fans who blocked traffic on a main
thoroughfare prompted about 50 riot police to take position. After
a few beer cans were thrown at the force, the angry fans desisted
with the help of London police mediator.
	   ``The World Cup is not a beer festival, and it's not a festival
of violence,'' Toulouse Mayor Dominique Baudis told reporters at
the site of the standoff minutes after it ended.
	   But more trouble loomed Monday. About 10,000 English fans were
expected and only 5,300 had tickets, officials said. Many could be
seen around town Sunday seeking tickets on the black market, and
police feared frustration among the ones who can't buy.
	   British police identified four known troublemakers who were
detained after being found at a downtown cafe, the local
prosecutor's office said. They were to be deported back to England
Monday.
	   In addition, about 100 so-called category `b' and `c' English
hooligans had also been identified, with c having the most violent
records.
	   Four local youths were also arrested, officials said.
	   As a result, this southwestern college town _ the ``pink city''
known for its red brick buildings _ seemed more like an armed camp.
	   Under the watchful eye of riot police and van loads of
reinforcements standing nearby just in case, cafes in the squares
and on main boulevards were jammed with singing English fans. Some
had platinum blonde hair and the bright red cross of Saint George
died into their manes.
	   But large World Cup screens were taken down, bars closed early
and a nationwide music festival was postponed to prevent mob
violence.
	   It was the first match for England since playing Tunisia one
week earlier in Marseille, where clashes between fans and local
North African immigrant youths left 50 injured and 100 arrested.
	   ``Imagine what would have happened last week'' with a music
festival in Marseille, said Mayor Baudis. ``There may have been
deaths, at least many more injured and much more damage,'' he said.
	   How violent Monday would be in Toulouse depended on the reaction
of English fans unable to get tickets, and whether local youths
would clash with the English.
	   ``We will get those tickets,'' 34-year-old London insurance
broker George Davies said as he walked down a sidestreet Sunday and
tried to negotiate with a ticket scalper.
	   On the Boulevard de Strasbourg, English fans in shorts, with or
without T-shirts, sang and chanted loudly as they sat or stood on a
curb with pints of beer in their hands. Some sat slumped on the
curb or against hotel doorways.
	   ``No surrender, no surrender, no surrender to the IRA!,'' they
sang, among other songs.
	   A worried-looking Mohammed Abdel-Loubab, 15, walked by holding a
wooden box of avocados and melons he bought from the bustling

drinking, and they drink a lot. It could heat up.''

Overnight standoff ends peacefully; match security tight

	   TOULOUSE, France (AP) _ After riot police faced off with drunken
English soccer fans overnight, this jittery city was hoping tight
security would prevent it from becoming the next victim of World
Cup violence.
	   About 1,800 police were deployed in this southwestern city for
Monday evening's match between England and Romania, the day after a
policeman was left in a coma when German toughs clashed with
officers in the northern city of Lens.
	   Only in its second week, the five-week World Cup already was
developing a reputation for violence and ticket scandals that
organizers were desperately trying to crush. But the problems
persisted.
	   Late Sunday, drunken English fans who blocked traffic on a main
thoroughfare prompted about 50 riot police to take position. After
a few beer cans were thrown at the force, the angry fans desisted
with the help of London police mediator.
	   ``The World Cup is not a beer festival, and it's not a festival
of violence,'' Toulouse Mayor Dominique Baudis told reporters at
the site of the standoff minutes after it ended.
	   But more trouble loomed Monday. About 10,000 English fans were
expected and only 5,300 had tickets, officials said. Many could be
seen around town Sunday seeking tickets on the black market, and
police feared frustration among the ones who can't buy.
	   British police identified four known troublemakers who were
detained after being found at a downtown cafe, the local
prosecutor's office said. They were to be deported back to England
Monday.
	   In addition, about 100 so-called category `b' and `c' English
hooligans had also been identified, with c having the most violent
records.
	   Four local youths were also arrested, officials said.
	   As a result, this southwestern college town _ the ``pink city''
known for its red brick buildings _ seemed more like an armed camp.
	   Under the watchful eye of riot police and van loads of
reinforcements standing nearby just in case, cafes in the squares
and on main boulevards were jammed with singing English fans. Some
had platinum blonde hair and the bright red cross of Saint George
died into their manes.
	   But large World Cup screens were taken down, bars closed early
and a nationwide music festival was postponed to prevent mob
violence.
	   It was the first match for England since playing Tunisia one
week earlier in Marseille, where clashes between fans and local
North African immigrant youths left 50 injured and 100 arrested.
	   ``Imagine what would have happened last week'' with a music
festival in Marseille, said Mayor Baudis. ``There may have been
deaths, at least many more injured and much more damage,'' he said.
	   How violent Monday would be in Toulouse depended on the reaction
of English fans unable to get tickets, and whether local youths
would clash with the English.
	   ``We will get those tickets,'' 34-year-old London insurance
broker George Davies said as he walked down a sidestreet Sunday and
tried to negotiate with a ticket scalper.
	   On the Boulevard de Strasbourg, English fans in shorts, with or
without T-shirts, sang and chanted loudly as they sat or stood on a
curb with pints of beer in their hands. Some sat slumped on the
curb or against hotel doorways.
	   ``No surrender, no surrender, no surrender to the IRA!,'' they
sang, among other songs.
	   A worried-looking Mohammed Abdel-Loubab, 15, walked by holding a
wooden box of avocados and melons he bought from the bustling
outdoor market.
	   So far, he said, ``they're nice. But you see the English
drinking, and they drink a lot. It could heat up.''

	   LOME, Togo (AP) _ Throngs of voters marched through the streets
in this west African country, but no violence was reported in a
presidential election that President Gnassigbe Eyadema was hoping
would extend his 31-year rule.
	   Voters took to the streets of the capital of Lome Sunday after
ballots failed to appear in several opposition strongholds,
according to reports on several radio stations. But the
demonstrators remained peaceful and no clashes were reported.
	   Ballots eventually showed up more than four hours after the
polls opened. The cause of the mishap was not immediately known.
	   Many polling stations closed on schedule by 7:30 p.m. (1930
GMT), although some remained open late to allow a backlog of voters
to mark their ballots. Initial results were expected Monday.
	   Few people doubted whether Eyadema would advance past the first
round against five challengers. If a candidate wins more than 50
percent of the vote, he automatically becomes president. If not,
the two top vote-getters face off in the second round.
	   Gilchrist Olympio, son of the country's first president, was the
best-known challenger. But Olympio, who fears for his life and
lives in neighboring Ghana, was not expected to reach the second
round. It was not clear whether he was in Togo for the election.
	   Yaovi Agboyibo, a lawyer with support in the country's south,
and Leopold Gnininvi, a university professor with wide support
among Togo's intellectual class, were considered the two candidates
with the best chances of reaching the second round.
	   An angry demonstration erupted in the town of Atakpame and
Palime north of the capital to protest the arrests on Saturday of
four Agboyibo supporters. No violence was reported.
	   The four activists were detained for planning to disrupt voting,
police told state-controlled radio without giving details.
	   Foreign observers offered reserved praise for Togo's second
presidential election. They said it was a big improvement over the
country's first poll five years ago, won overwhelmingly by Eyadema
and boycotted by opposition groups. This time voters and opposition
candidates flocked to the polls.
	   Eyadema ruled this tiny French-speaking country wedged between
Ghana and Benin as a military dictator for 26 years until 1993,
when he won the country's first election.
	   For the past two months, the president has launched a massive
television and radio campaign to assure another term in power,
while relegating opposition candidates to occasional slices of
airtime.
	   Voting in his home village of Pya in northern Togo, Eyadema said
he hoped for a calm and fair election.
	   ``Let the best man win,'' he said.

Slumping Sampras back `home' at Wimbledon AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: play stars at 1100 GMT
By STEPHEN WILSON
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ He's in a slump. He lacks motivation.
He's burned out.
	   Pete Sampras has heard it all and admits that much of it is
true.
	   But there's one antidote that can bring Sampras back to life:
the green lawns of Wimbledon.
	   ``There's just something about Wimbledon _ the history, the
grass, an intensity that seems to bring out the best in me,'' he
said. ``When I get onto Center Court, I'm pumped, and I think the
other guys still fear me.''
	   Sampras gets a chance to halt his slide Monday when he begins
defense of his Wimbledon title against Slovakia's Dominic Hrbaty in
the opening match of the fortnight on Center Court. A solid showing
should give some indication whether Sampras is poised to win his
fifth championship in six years.
	   ``I feel come 2 o'clock Monday, it's kind of like coming back
home,'' he said. ``It hasn't been a great year by any means, but
this is kind of where I kicked it in last year. I feel like I can
obviously do it again.''
	   With only two other former champions (Andre Agassi and Richard
Krajicek) in the field and a shortage of strong grass-court players
in the game, Sampras remains the favorite.
	   But the American has lost his aura of invincibility since
trouncing Cedric Pioline in straight sets in last year's final. He
lost in the fourth round at the 1997 U.S. Open, the quarterfinals
of the Australian Open and the second round of the French Open.
	   Sampras briefly lost his No. 1 ranking to Marcelo Rios, regained
it and now holds it almost by default.
	   At the Wimbledon warmup tournament at Queen's Club, Sampras lost
in the third round to Australian doubles specialist Mark Woodforde.
	   ``Everyone is aware that, motivation-wise, he's not there,''
Woodforde said.
	   Sampras agrees that motivation has been a problem, complaining
that the season is too long and he never had time to rest and
recover at the end of last year.
	   ``It's not easy getting motivated each week I play,'' he said.
``But at this point, I know I'm getting motivated for what's coming
up. I have no doubt in my mind that I'm going to get out of it. I
can't think of a better place to do it than here.''
	   Nothing motivates Sampras more than Grand Slams, and with 10
Slam titles to his credit, he needs just two more to equal Roy
Emerson's record of 12.
	   Players who could stop him include Yevgeny Kafelnikov, Agassi,
Krajicek, Petr Korda, Patrick Rafter and the two Britons _ Greg
Rusedski and Tim Henman.
	   The exceptionally wide open nature of the men's tournament is
underlined by this fact: there have been 10 different players in
the last five Grand Slam finals.
	   Agassi, the 1992 champion who has zoomed back up the rankings
since dropping to 141st last November, was matched Monday against
Spain's Alex Calatrava.
	   In other featured men's matches, Kafelnikov faced big-serving
Mark Philippoussis, Henman was up against Jiri Novak, and Korda
played Javier Sanchez.
	   Much of the focus this year will fall on the women's tournament,
where a fascinating mix of the new and the old will vye for the
title.
	   Martina Hingis, the defending champion and top seed, doesn't
play until Tuesday. Fellow 17-year-olds Venus Williams and Anna
Kournikova, recovering from a thumb injury, are also off until
Tuesday.
	   The highest women's seed in action on the opening day was No. 2
Lindsay Davenport, matched against Florencia Labat of Argentina.
	   But the spotlight Monday fell to seven-time champion Steffi
Graf, who was scheduled on Center Court against Spain's Gala Leon
Garcia.
	   The fourth-seeded German is playing her 13th Wimbledon. But it's
her first in two years and her first Grand Slam since undergoing
major knee surgery a year ago.
	   Graf's comeback has been slowed by a series of other injuries
but she looked back on track last week at the Eastbourne
tournament, where she lost to Kournikova in a tight, three-setter.
	   Another leader of the old guard, Monica Seles, was scheduled to
play Monday against Maria Sanchez Lorenzo. Seles, whose career was
disrupted by a stabbing in 1993, made an inspiring run to the
French Open final earlier this month, just three weeks after the
death of her father Karolj.

World Cup vs. Wimbledon AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN WADE
<TEXT>
	   WIMBLEDON, England (AP) _ The early summer sports lull usually
leaves Wimbledon as the only show in town.
	   Not this year.
	   Even players could get distracted by soccer's month-long World
Cup in France.
	   London's Sunday Times was a good example. Its first 10 sports
pages _ save for one cricket story _ were carpeted with World Cup
coverage. Two lonely tennis pages followed.
	   Britain's Tim Henman _ the 12th seed _ could get upstaged, too.
Henman's opening-round match Monday on Court 1 against Jiri Novak
of the Czech Republic could clash with England's crucial World Cup
game against Romania in Toulouse.
	   The loser in that competition will be Henman.
	   England, which failed to qualify for the World Cup four years
ago, is grouped with six or seven teams behind defending champion
Brazil as a favorite to make the July 12 championship game.
	   England's notorious soccer hooligans made news last weekend,
setting off riots in Marseille. They've been quiet for a few days,
but more trouble would almost certainly diminish Wimbledon's
importance.
	   Then there's Scotland. Scotland plays Morocco Tuesday, and a
victory would put the Scots in the second round for the first time
in eight tries.
	   Fortunately for Wimbledon schedulers, its July 5 men's final is
a rest day at the World Cup _ slipped in between the quarterfinals
and semifinals. However, the women's July 4 final clashes with two
quarterfinals.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   RUSEDSKI, KOURNIKOVA READY: Injured Greg Rusedski and Anna
Kournikova say they'll play.
	   Rusedski, the No. 4 seed and fastest server in the game, was
rated 50-50 for Wimbledon after spraining his left ankle at the
Queen's Club tournament 10 days ago.
	   In a statement Sunday, Wimbledon said Rusedski ``successfully
completed a practice session this morning and has indicated that he
will be playing in the championships.''
	   Rusedski reached the quarterfinals here last year and, along
with Tim Henman, offers the best hope of a British man winning
Wimbledon for the first time since Fred Perry in 1936.
	   On the women's side, WTA Tour officials said Kournikova looks
set to play despite suffering a sprained right thumb during her
quarterfinal victory over Steffi Graf Thursday at Eastbourne.
	   Kournikova reached the semifinals last year and is seeded No.
12. She withdrew from Eastbourne as a precaution and saw a medical
specialist Sunday.
	   Both Rusedski and Kournikova are scheduled to play their
first-round matches Tuesday.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   EQUAL PAY: Bart McGuire, the recently appointed chief executive
officer of the Women's Tennis Association, will be at Wimbledon
pressing the chiefs of the four Grand Slams for equal pay for
women.
	   With young WTA stars like Martina Hingis, Venus and Serena
Williams, and Anna Kournikova, McGuire says the women's game has
become more attractive than the men's.
	   Only the U.S. Open among the four Grand Slams pays the men and
women equally.
	   ``I will be addressing the issue respectfully to the Grand Slam
chairmen,'' he told The Sunday Telegraph.
	   ``The TV ratings for the Australian Open show the women getting
more viewers than the men. At Wimbledon and the French Open last
year, the U.S. TV ratings were 20 percent better for the women.''
	   ``All we are asking is for people to recognize that the
situation is changing,'' he added. ``That these changes are not
transitory but have a degree of permanence and should be reflected
in the women's prize money relative to the men.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MAN TO WATCH: That would be 18-year-old Spain-based Russian
Marat Safin, who upset Andre Agassi and Gustavo Kuerten in the
French Open.
	   The 6-foot-4 (1.93-meter) Safin has a powerful serve suited to
grass. But he has a tough first-round match against Andrei Medvedev
and then, perhaps, Goran Ivanisevic, in the second.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MAC ATTACK: John McEnroe, writing in The Sunday Telegraph, again
rapped unmotivated players and a system that has them playing too
much tennis.
	   ``To be honest,'' he said. ``Looking down the field there are
not too many out there with greatness seared through them.''
	   ``The way the tour and the ranking system are set up, there is
too much money and the motivational forces are not as strong as
they used to be.''
	   ___ &QC; 
	   EXTREMES: Yvon Petra of France in 1946 was the last men's
singles winner to wear long trousers. American Jack Kramer was the
first to win in shorts in 1947.
	   Britain's Charlotte Sterry was the oldest Wimbledon singles
champion when she won at 37 in 1908. Martina Hingis was the
youngest champion of all time when she won doubles in 1996 at 15
years 282 days.
	   Boris Becker was the youngest men's singles champion, 17 years
227 days in 1985.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SPICE GIRLS: The British tabloid press, which focused so much
last season on the good looks of Russian teen-ager Kournikova,
probably won't change its tack.
	   The Daily Mail on Sunday adorned its adjoining center pages with
photos of Kournikova, Martina Hingis, Serena Williams and Mary
Pierce _ under this headline: ``The Spice Girls of Centre Court.''

	   LYON, France (AP) _ Frenzied Iranians spilled out of the stadium
into the streets after their 2-1 World Cup soccer victory against
the United States, turning it into a jubilant rally for dissident
leaders.
	   But Iranians in Tehran, Iran, took a more traditional approach
as millions poured into the streets to celebrate a game that had
obvious ramifications beyond the field because of two decades of
tense relations between Iran and the United States.
	   Thousands in Lyon removed their red and green football jerseys
to reveal white T-shirts bearing photos of Maryam Rajavi, wife of
Massoud Rajavi who heads the Mujahadeen Khalq resistance movement.
Dissidents want her to be the president of a new Iran.
	   Dancing to pounding drums and bellowing jubilation, they
chanted, ``Iran Rajavi, Rajavi Iran.'' An overwhelming majority at
the rally were Iranians living in Europe and elsewhere abroad.
	   ``This is the first time in 18 years we've had a chance to
express our view like this, said Alireza Jafarzadeh, a member of
the resistance. ``A lot of these people have lost family members to
repression; for them this is life and death.''
	   French police had confiscated many of the shirts before the
game, enforcing a World Cup rule against mixing politics and
soccer. But organizers claimed 25,000 got through security checks.
	   The politics abruptly pushed aside soccer after a day of
partying between Iranians and Americans, which began as groups from
both sides tied together the tips of their national flags and
danced the linked colors through the streets.
	   Amazed Americans beamed to hear their supposed foes chanting,
``USA,'' and not adding, ``Down With,'' before it.
	   ``We've never really stopped being friends, whatever the
governments did,'' said Afsaneh, a London architect who withheld
her last name for fear of reprisals to her family. She held aloft a
huge heart, with Iran and the U.S. sharing equal space.
	   The nations broke off diplomatic relations during the 1979-81
hostage crisis, and U.S. President Bill Clinton and other American
officials saw this game as an opportunity for a thaw.
	   ``As we cheer today's game between American and Iranian
athletes, I hope it can be another step toward ending the
estrangement between our nations,'' Clinton said in a statement
before the game.
	   Police outside the stadium opened every bag and bundle. Mothers
lifted babies from strollers for a careful search. As the game
ended, riot police filed out to block off the field.
	   The only trouble was among Iranians. In one flareup, a young
exile pushed aside Syed Saeed Loghmani, 53 and bearded, muttering,
``Get out of my way, you're with the mullahs.'' Loghmani spat back
that he had lived in France for 32 years.
	   Banners unfurled at the game read, ``Iran Rajavi.'' Security
police pulled them down and hauled at least one Mujahadeen out of
the stands. During Iran's national anthem, new banners appeared,
and police poured over the railings to seize them, often by fierce
tug-of-war.
	   French officials confirmed they turned back hundreds of Iranians
at the border.
	   But much of the noise was about soccer as Iran's 2-1 victory
eliminated the United States from World Cup contention. At each
goal, Iranians went wild all together, banging drums, blaring horns
and yelling in frenzy. In unison, they chanted, ``I-ran, I-ran.''
	   Thousands of Iranians living in Europe, North America, Asia and
Australia came to the game, far outnumbering those traveling from
Iran. But almost all insisted that a different place of residence
did not dilute their claim to a beloved identity.
	   Too many foreigners confuse Iran's conservative Islamic leaders
with a 7,000-year-old civilization with much wider dimensions, she
added. ``I'm not covered from head to toe.''
	   Hatif Abedi Jam, 15, left Iran for Germany when he was 2, and
also wants to go back. ``I can't go now, but maybe things will
change.'' He was painted and clothed in bright Iran colors, but a
small U.S. flag flew from his hat.
	   Americans were far fewer, but some were just as exuberant.
	   Andy Romhanyi, 33, a warehouse manager from Phoenix, painted his
face as Old Glory and wore a U.S. flag as a scarf over a flamboyant
red, white and blue outfit. His friend, Nicky Carter, wore a
sequined vest and elaborate hat in the same colors.
	   ``We don't give a stuff about politics,'' said Romhanyi, who
wanted a win so the U.S. team would advance to the next round. ``It
would be a huge, huge shame if we lost, but not because it is
Iran.''
	   He heaved a large arm around two Iranian fans and posed for
photographs.
	   Mostly, Americans stayed to themselves and talked soccer
strategy. Rob Ramsay, 27, an accountant from Atlanta, plays the
game and is dead serious about it.
	   ``Most of our players are about my age, and they don't know
about the politics,'' he said. ``They say, like, `Great Satan what?
But it's got to be in your head if your government is all over you
about it. There's no point in putting this on them.''
	   Like many Americans, he was surprised to see an Iranian crowd
that was so far from the standard stereotypes. As a result, the
game might end up being about more than soccer.
	   ``One guy came up to me and said in clumsy English that he was
working for world peace,'' Ramsay said. ``Who knows? I hope this
all has some effect. Everything starts somewhere, so it might as
well start here.''

Iran's leader gloats, nation parties after beating U.S. at soccer With World Cup-Iran Party Time 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran's spiritual leader gloated about
defeating an ``arrogant opponent'' and millions of Iranians kicked
off a night long party Monday after their World Cup soccer victory
over the United States.
	   Across the country, men women and children yelling ``Iran,''
rushed into the streets after the final whistle sealed Iran's 2-1
victory before midnight Sunday in Lyon, France. It was 1.30 a.m.
Monday in Iran.
	   For 90 minutes, fans had watched on live television Iran's
fortunes dip and rise during the tournament's most politicized
match, which pitted the Persian country against its most bitter
diplomatic enemy. The result kept Iran's World Cup hopes alive.
	   ``Nobody is sitting at home. It is impossible for anybody to be
inside their home'' Human Razavi, a teen-ager, shouted above the
din of honking cars and dancing fans draped in the national
green-red-and-white flags.
	   Others shouted ``We love you Ali Daie,'' referring to Iran's
star player. Others sang: ``Estili we love you.'' Hamidi Estili had
scored Iran's first goal in the 40th minute of the game.
	   Sweet shops reopened in the middle of the night and distributed
ice cream and candy free to revelers who packed Tehran's streets
and created unprecedented traffic jams.
	   In a message to the Iranian team, Iran's hard-line spiritual
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said: ``Tonight again, the strong
and arrogant opponent felt the bitter taste of defeat at your
hands. Be happy that you have made the Iranian nation happy.'' The
message was read on state television.
	   The moderate President Mohammad Khatami, however, simply
congratulated the Iranian players, saying the victory is a ``symbol
of national unity.''
	   Khatami's recent overtures of friendship have softened Iran's
enmity with the United States. But awareness that Washington has
done its best to isolate Iran internationally ensured that many
Iranians saw the game as the ultimate grudge match.
	   Still, there were no ``Death to America'' slogans, once so
common after the 1979 Islamic revolution that overthrew the
pro-U.S. shah and installed a clerical regime that has presided
over a 19-year-long hostility between the two countries.
	   Instead, people greeted each other with ``mubarak, mubarak,''
the Farsi word for congratulations.
	   Thousands of police deployed across the city did not interfere
with the celebrations but accepted flowers from fans with smiles.
	   Celebrations also erupted in Lebanon where Iran enjoys a large
following among its Shiite Muslims. Many people there fired guns in
the air.
	   The skyline of Ramallah, West Bank, lit up with fireworks.
Palestinians came out to cheer and honk horns. Israelis, who are
technically at a state of war with Iran, rooted for the United
States.
	   Honking cars also ruled the roads in Cairo, Egypt.
	   A caller to a late night radio show said Iran was backed by all
Muslim nations in the Middle East. ``As far as I am concerned, it
was my national team playing,'' said the Egyptian caller who gave
his name only as Tarek.
	   Unexpected support for the Iranian team came from one-time war
enemy and neighboring Iraq, where the match was broadcast live.
Dozens of Iraqis interviewed said they support Iran, not surprising
since Iraqis accuse the United States of working to prolong U.N.
economic sanctions on their country.

Pilots at All Nippon Airways call off planned strike 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Pilots at major Japanese airline All Nippon Airways
have called off a planned strike, a company spokeswoman said
Monday.
	   The 1,380-member union of pilots and flight engineers notified
ANA's management on Sunday that the union would not go on strike at
midnight Tuesday, said the ANA spokeswoman, on condition of
anonymity.
	   The Tokyo Shimbun newspaper quoted an unidentified union
official as saying that it ``took into account various
circumstances surrounding the union'' in canceling the planned
walkout.
	   Union officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   Had it gone forward as planned the strike would have forced
flight cancellations on some of ANA's international routes.
	   The pilots' union was demanding that the airline abandon a new
salary restructuring system introduced on April 1 that the pilots
claim reduces their pay.
	   ANA pilots went on a strike in early April, but suspended their
walkout before Japan's ``Golden Week'' holiday period between April
29 and May 5, a popular time for travel. The walkout was limited to
international routes.
	   Before the two weeks prior to the holiday period, a total of
27,000 passengers were grounded or forced to find alternative
flights, and the airline suffered 4.2 billion yen (dlrs 30.4
million) in losses.
	   Japanese airlines, faced with increasing international
competition, are being forced to cut costs amid domestic moves to
deregulate the industry.
	   ANA is Japan's second largest airline.

Report: public endangered by rail shipments of nuclear waste 
</HEADLINE>
By CHRISTOPHER BURNS
Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Despite government denials, a report issued Monday
by an anti-nuclear study group claims that France's state nuclear
industry has endangered the public with hundreds of trainloads of
nuclear waste that cross the country each year.
	   Authorities halted the shipments in May, pending further study,
after regulators determined that 35 percent of the convoys were
contaminated. Still, they insisted the radioactivity poses no real
health danger.
	   The debate is the latest to hit France's nuclear power business,
a multibillion-dollar industry that generates 75 percent of the
nation's power and earns money by processing waste from other
countries.
	   The convoys travel to and from La Hague, the world's largest
nuclear waste processing plant, on a windy coastal bluff near the
Normandy port of Cherbourg. It receives rail shipments from within
France as well as Germany, Switzerland and Belgium. The French
power company EDF alone has 200 such convoys annually.
	   The plant itself, which stores large amounts of spent or
reprocessed fuel, also has been under investigation for radiation
leaks into local seawater.
	   For years, authorities in France and other European countries
``have managed to hide the fact that international transport
regulations for spent fuel shipments have been constantly
violated,'' says the report by the World Information Source on
Energy (WISE), released Monday.
	   Radioactivity has been registered ``up to levels exceeding
several thousand times the limit,'' says the study, published in
the organization's monthly magazine Plutonium Investigation.
	   WISE is a Paris-based anti-nuclear group that has published
numerous studies on nuclear dangers.
	   The study's author, Mycle Schneider, included a table of
readings he said were gathered by the German nuclear safety agency
GRS and transmitted to Cogema, the French state nuclear fuel
processing company that owns La Hague.
	   The figures show that as late as February this year, inspectors
detected 10,000 becquerels of radioactivity on a trainload of spent
fuel from Germany. Readings before that ran as high as 13,000
becquerels.
	   A becquerel is a unit for measuring radioactive decay, equal to
the number of atoms that disintegrate per second. The safety limit
set by the International Atomic Energy Agency is four becquerels.
	   Schneider said in an interview that the French Directorate for
Safety of Nuclear Installations (DSIN), which in 1997 assumed the
role of cleaning up rail transport of nuclear waste, ``has been
covering up'' the seriousness of the contamination.
	   ``This is very substantial radioactivity. It's not minor, as has
been said so far.''
	   Before the shipments were suspended in May, Greenpeace tried to
block a number of them.
	   A spokeswoman for DSIN, which is part of the Industry Ministry,
countered that the contamination ``doesn't pose a health problem.
It's a technical problem.
	   ``You can find high readings on containers,'' said spokeswoman
Sandrine Le Breton. ``But you shouldn't take the square centimeter
reading as the norm.''
	   Le Breton said the 35 percent contamination figure has fallen to
15 percent this year.
	   DSIN has announced new measures that require better
decontamination of trains before they leave power plants, and
closer monitoring of the shipments.
	   ``We're not yet in a perfect situation, but there has been an
improvement,'' she said.
	   A study has been requested by the ministers of environment,
health and industry. Findings are expected by the end of the month.

Louise Woodward implies Eappens were responsible for baby's death 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In her first in-depth interview since returning
home from the United States after being convicted of killing a baby
in her care, Louise Woodward implied the parents were responsible
for the death.
	   ``If the parents didn't do it, who did?'' Ms. Woodward told the
British Broadcasting Corp. in an interview scheduled to be aired on
British television Monday night.
	   Prosecutors had claimed that Ms. Woodward, who returned to
Britain on Thursday with a manslaughter conviction, shook
8-month-old Matthew Eappen to death. She has always maintained her
innocence.
	   ``There was the whole feeling that somebody had to pay and that
somebody had to be me,'' she said in the interview, according to
excerpts released by the BBC.
	   Woodward allowed to leave the United States after a
Massachusetts high court upheld a lower court judge's decision last
November to reduce her second-degree murder conviction to
manslaughter and sentenced her to the 279 days she had already
spent in prison.
	   A BBC spokeswoman, speaking on customary anonymity, said the
interview will cover Ms. Woodward's ``desperate attempts to cope
with Matthew on the day he went to hospital, her arrest, reaction
to the trial and fight to clear her name.''
	   During the program, the 20-year-old former au pair will talk
about life with the Eappen family, her supporters back in Britain
and her reaction to last week's high court decision to allow her to
go home, the BBC said.
	   The Eappen family was not immediately available for comment late
Sunday.
	   Ms. Woodward's mother, Susan, has promised ``lots of answers''
to questions surrounding the baby's death in February 1997.
	   Although Ms. Woodward said during a press conference on Thursday
that she would receive no payment for the BBC interview and that
she would not sell her story, controversy has since broken out over
the tabloid Daily Mail's confirmation that it paid 40,000 pounds
(dlrs 66,000) to Ms. Woodward's parents in November, before he
conviction was reduced. The newspaper began publishing a series on
Saturday, which it said was based on contacts with the girl and her
parents over several months.
	   In Monday's installment, the newspaper reported on Ms.
Woodward's life inside prison.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ A former Bogota mayor who promised to
end rampant political corruption has been elected Colombia's
president, defeating a key player in the scandal-tainted
administration of President Ernesto Samper.
	   Andres Pastrana, in his second straight bid for Colombia's
highest office, had 50.4 percent against 46.5 percent for Horacio
Serpa of the governing Liberal Party with 98 percent of the vote
counted in Sunday's runoff election, official results showed.
	   ``The choice was between business-as-usual or change and the
country clearly picked change,'' said Pastrana, 44, of the
opposition Conservative Party.
	   In his victory speech at Bogota's convention center, Pastrana
promised to make peace with leftist rebels his top priority, and to
enact belt-tightening fiscal reforms.
	   As fireworks exploded outside the hall, he vowed to repair the
country's tattered international image ``so we can once again be
proud to pronounce Colombia's name in all corners of the world.''
	   Pastrana's victory broke the Liberals' 12-year hold on the
presidency, but the party still controls a majority in Congress and
boasts a well entrenched patronage system.
	   Public anger with Samper's tenure helped Pastrana, a wealthy
former president's son who was narrowly defeated by the incumbent
in 1994. Many Colombians view Pastrana as an intellectual
lightweight.
	   ``Pastrana is bad and Serpa is corrupt. That's why I voted for
the bad one,'' said Luis Eduardo Gutierrez, a 59-year-old tailor
interviewed in Bogota's central square.
	   Serpa, a populist firebrand and veteran politician, was interior
minister for most of Samper's administration, defending the
incumbent in a corruption scandal that battered Colombia's
international image and economy.
	   In a concession speech, Serpa vowed to ``continue fighting for
the people and for peace in Colombia.''
	   When Pastrana takes office on Aug. 7, he will inherit a
34-year-old guerrilla war that has reached new depths of violence
in recent months, with stepped-up massacres of civilians by
right-wing paramilitary forces and assassinations of human rights
workers.
	   Thousands congregated outside Pastrana's campaign headquarters.
Some danced and others shouted ``Andres. Andres.'' Horn-honking
Pastrana supporters, banners waving, jammed major roads and
intersections.
	   Voter turnout was 54.7 percent, up from 43.3 percent in the 1994
runoff.
	   Pastrana pledged to help the 18 million Colombians _ nearly half
of the population _ who live in poverty.
	   ``I'm going to be the president of the poor,'' he said. ``I
don't want any more hunger in Colombia.''
	   The May 31 first round of elections was a virtual tie between
Pastrana and Serpa, with independent candidate Noemi Sanin, who was
backed by anti-corruption forces, placing a close third. Pastrana
apparently won the lion's share of Sanin votes and appealed to her
to help him fight political corruption.
	   Compared to other recent elections, relatively little rebel
violence was reported.
	   Guerrillas attacked two helicopters and ambushed a police truck
on Sunday in two separate incidents, killing two police officers
and wounding six, officials said. Since Friday, guerrillas have
kidnapped at least 11 election officials and burned 37 vehicles
nationwide.
	   Samper, accused of links to drug traffickers, bought the support
of regional political bosses by doling out hundreds of millions of
dollars in public funds. Meanwhile, unemployment soared to 14.5
percent and the deficit more than doubled.
	   Like Samper, the 55-year-old Serpa was cleared of any wrongdoing
in the scandal over dlrs 6 million in contributions from the Cali
drug cartel to Samper's 1994 campaign _ the president by a loyal
congress and Serpa by the chief prosecutor.
	   Serpa was a top aide in Samper's 1994 campaign.
	   Both candidates billed themselves as the best chance for peace,
but the country's oldest and largest rebel group, the Revolutionary
Armed Forces of Colombia, tacitly endorsed Pastrana last week.
	   Serpa had pledged to lower the work week from 48 to 40 hours,
earning the scorn of big business. Pastrana, son of the late
President Misael Pastrana, has promised a computer for every
schoolchild and a cut in the sales tax from 16 percent to 12
percent.

Jackson won't return as Bulls coach AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By NANCY ARMOUR
<TEXT>
	   CHICAGO (AP) _ The Chicago Bulls' sixth championship was,
indeed, the last with coach Phil Jackson.
	   Jackson won't return to the Bulls, despite an offer from
chairman Jerry Reinsdorf to coach for another year, Jackson's
attorney, Todd Musberger, confirmed Sunday night. Jackson does not
have another job, Musberger said.
	   Jackson's departure was first reported in an interview with
Newsweek magazine, which goes on sale Monday.
	   ``It is accurate,'' Musberger told The Associated Press.
	   Neither Jackson, Reinsdorf nor Bulls general manager Jerry
Krause returned messages that were left for them Sunday by the AP.
	   Musberger said Jackson did not want to elaborate on why he chose
not to come back for another season. Jackson's relations with
Krause have been rancorous all season, and he said after signing a
one-year contract last summer that ``wild horses'' could not bring
him back for another year.
	   ``I said no, it's time for me to step away and enjoy some
different things,'' Jackson told Newsweek.
	   ``For me, it's the perfect conclusion to a wonderful team,'' he
said. ``There's nothing we can do to top this anymore. Now it's
time to step back from the game for a while.''
	   Though Musberger said Jackson has had ``discreet feelers'' from
other teams, he does not have another job.
	   Jackson told Newsweek he did not expect to coach anywhere next
season.
	   Jackson's departure is the first of what could be many for the
six-time NBA champions. Michael Jordan, who is especially close to
Jackson, is a free agent and has said he will not play for anyone
else, though he has recently softened his stance on that.
	   Jackson said he thinks Jordan, who scored the title-winning
basket a week ago as the Bulls beat the Utah Jazz in six games,
also wants to go out on top.
	   ``I can't imagine him doing it again. I don't know but I
anticipate that's how he feels,'' Jackson told Newsweek.
	   Musberger said Jackson's decision was not tied in any way to
Jordan.
	   ``All of the principles involved have individual reasons for
whatever choices they make,'' Musberger said. ``It's an individual
decision, and I know if Michael decides to return, he will have
Phil's blessing.''
	   Scottie Pippen and Dennis Rodman also are free agents, as are
six other of the 12 players on Chicago's playoff roster. Rodman has
said he would like to play for the Bulls again, but Pippen, hurt by
what he deems as a lack of respect and low salaries, has said
repeatedly that he won't return.
	   But Pippen, too, has wavered, saying he would be open-minded to
an offer from the Bulls if the other key personalities involved
return.
	   That Jordan, Rodman and, to some extent, Pippen, have such
intense loyalty to Jackson is no surprise. A meditator, a
motivator, an ex-hippie, Jackson used his somewhat offbeat methods
to blend the egos of three of the most talented players ever into a
team.
	   He was always able to get through to his players and relate to
them with _ as Jordan refers to it _ ``that Zen Buddhism stuff.''
He bought them each books he thought would interest them before the
first West Coast road trip.
	   Jackson's one-year, dlrs 6 million deal was negotiated with
Reinsdorf last summer and not Krause. Krause quickly announced that
it be Jackson's final season.
	   Jackson implied throughout the season that this would be his
last.
	   Jackson has the highest winning percentage of any coach in NBA
regular-season (.738) and playoff (.730) history.
	   But despite his six titles, he's captured just one coach of the
year award, that coming in 1996 after the Bulls went 72-10, the
best record in league history.
	   Jackson became Bulls head coach on July 10, 1989, replacing the
fired Doug Collins for whom he had been an assistant the previous
two seasons.
	   He spent 11 of his 13 NBA seasons as a player with the Knicks
and was a member of their 1973 championship team.

	   EDITOR'S NOTE: With their country seemingly in perpetual crisis,
many Russians yearn for a strong leader to take charge and
straighten things out. Some believe they have found that man in

a Siberian province May 17. Who is Lebed? What would he do as

 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
	   KRASNOYARSK, Russia (AP) _ In Russian, the word ``lebed'' means
``swan,'' and Alexander Lebed must surely believe in the childhood
story of the ugly duckling.
	   By his own accounting, he's not much to look at: square head,
pockmarked cheeks, a body like a baby bull and a voice so
supernaturally low it seems designed for the ears of some other
species. When he talks, he has a nervous twitch that makes his lip
curl up on the left, giving the impression _ presumably not
intended _ of a sneer.
	   People look at him and they see the general he once was _ an
autocrat, a dictator-in-waiting. He insists that no, he's a
democrat, the man who could set Russia free from the grip of Czar
Boris, as he likes to call his old antagonist in the Kremlin,
Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
	   Critics talk about him as a man in the mold of Gen. Augusto
Pinochet, the former Chilean military ruler, and he says, no, his
heroes are Charles DeGaulle and Dwight D. Eisenhower, generals who
were democrats, men of reason.
	   The point is, until now, no one could really say if Lebed, who
badly wants to be president of Russia, was the ugly duckling or the
swan.
	   Now they'll know. On May 17, Lebed was elected governor of the
Krasnoyarsk region of Siberia, and soon he'll have a track record
as a leader of something other than a battalion. One way or
another, his feathers will show.
	   Depending on how he does, Lebed could be in a strong position to
become president of Russia in 2000 or 2004.
	   Strong leaders are a vital part of Russian tradition, and many
people yearn for someone like Lebed _ a hero _ to lift them out of
the depression and muck of post-Soviet life. The Cold War may be
over, but Russia's president still exercises vast power in his
region, and still carries the code to the nuclear button.
	   And so the question arises: Who is this man?
	   Is he on the left, the right or the center? He says the center,
but what does that mean in Russia these days? Is he authoritarian
or libertarian, nationalist or internationalist, friend of the West
or its foe?
	   The first thing that strikes a reader of his autobiography, ``My
Life and My Country,'' is that this is a man of overwhelming
ambition. Time and again throughout his career, Alexander Ivanovich
Lebed has been underestimated. Time and again, he has suffered
setbacks. And time and again, he has been patient and he has won.
	   It happened when he was a kid in southern Russia and decided he
wanted to become a military officer. The story, as he relates it,
takes on the weight of myth, so remarkable were the obstacles.
	   There was a broken clavicle that healed badly; he had it
rebroken so it would reknit properly. ``After all, I thought, I
couldn't become an officer with a collarbone like that.''
	   There were multiple rounds of surgery for throat and sinus
disorders, no doubt the antecedents of his amazing voice.
	   He tried skydiving to prepare for paratroop school _ that left
him hospitalized with multiple broken bones and a severed tendon.
	   There were tests failed and tantrums thrown, and countless
people who told him he'd never make it.
	   In the end, after two years of trying, he was admitted to
officer training school and went on to have a celebrated career as
a military officer in Afghanistan, Moldova and elsewhere.
	   Later, he ran for president against Yeltsin in 1996, did
surprisingly well and agreed to join Yeltsin's team as national
security chief. In this role, he notched his greatest
accomplishment, negotiating the peace in the breakaway republic of
Chechnya.
	   By this time he was being seriously viewed as a future president
by people like Alexei Chaplygen, an analyst with a Moscow think
tank, the Center for Studies in Civil Society.
	   ``His strengths,'' Chaplygen says now, ``include charisma and
his ability as a strategist, and also his courage in dealing with
all branches of power.
	   ``As for his weaknesses, I can name excessive
straightforwardness. For a politician, this is not a very good
quality. And also ... he doesn't know his limits. He's
unpredictable and unmanageable.''
	   Lebed didn't know his limits when he ran for governor of
Krasnoyarsk, a region four times the size of France, with a
tremendous pride in its independence and distrust of city slickers.
	   Lebed had never lived in Krasnoyarsk, and early polls suggested
he stood little chance against the incumbent governor, Valery
Zubov, a relative bright light among Russia's provincial leaders.
	   Lebed campaigned tirelessly, short-hopping the region by plane,
tromping through the snow and permafrost in more than 100 towns and
villages, from close to Mongolia to the Arctic Circle.
	   He stood outside in the stinging Siberian wind, the only
hatless, gloveless man in sight, and answered questions from
audiences until they had no more.
	   ``Alexander Ivanovich,'' people would yell, ``are you going to
run for president?''
	   The answer would rumble out in his volcanic bass: ``I'm a
military man and I'm a man of my word. People are asking me about
the election of the year 2000, and so I promise that I will
participate in this election only if I succeed in improving the
economy in the Krasnoyarsk region.''
	   ``Alexander Ivanovich, why do we work without pay and yet our
enterprises are fined only for not paying taxes?'' others asked.
	   A sympathetic nod. ``I came to the conclusion that in some
countries, people live better than we do, in some they live worse,
but nowhere do people live so senselessly.''

Cambodian refugees wait in camp thinking of home

<TEXT>
	   SURIN, Thailand (AP) _ Lying on a bamboo bed in a makeshift
clinic, Paibul Sorlen, 24, grimaces in pain while a health worker
cleans and dresses his maimed leg.
	   Back in his small bamboo-woven shack, Paibul shares his
sufferings with a fellow Cambodian refugee, Buu Jumreun, 33, whose
right leg was amputated after a land mine explosion more than two
years ago.
	   While listening to Paibul's complaints, Buu tries on an
artificial leg that he has made from PVC water pipe. He passes his
days at the refugee camp trying to fashion prosthetic legs from
tree trunks and PVC; although creative, they have yet to work.
	   ``The wood is too heavy, and it hurts to wear PVC. I wish we
could find the right material in such a place,'' Buu says.
	   Paibul is among 20,000 Cambodian refugees moved last fall to the
Huay Chueng Center for Displaced Persons in Surin, 340 kilometers
(210 miles) northeast of Bangkok. The resettlement came after
fighting erupted between rival factions in the O' Smach area of
northern Cambodia.
	   The fighting followed Cambodian leader Hun Sen's bloody coup
that ousted his co-premier, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, last July.
Loyal to Ranariddh, Paibul lost his left leg during the fighting
and fled for safety in Thailand.
	   ``My wound is healing, but the scar lasts forever. ... I am a
useless one-legged man,'' Paibul says despondently.
	   When the camp was first established, no one expected it to be in
existence this long. Thai and Cambodian authorities are planning to
repatriate all the refugees as soon as conditions are safe enough,
United Nations workers say.
	   The Thai army and the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees have conducted several voluntary repatriations this year,
reducing the number of refugees at the camp to approximately
16,000.
	   The lack of health, hygiene and education services are common
problems. At least 3,000 children younger than 9 do not get
schooling or proper nutrition.
	   Despite the bad conditions, not all the refugees are rushing to
get home. Former soldiers, Paibul says, have refused to leave for
fear their lives will be threatened.
	   ``I ran away from the killers. Back in Cambodia, there is no
home or family for me. They were all killed,'' Paibul says.
	   A general election in Cambodia is scheduled for July 26, but the
refugees are doubtful about their future after the vote.
	   Unlike other refugees, Paibul talks openly about politics,
arguing that peace is what Cambodia needs to keep the country
together and move on for the better.
	   ``Whatever the election's result will be _ somebody loses,
somebody must win _ it wouldn't make it any better for the people
if peace is still at bay,'' Paibul says.

New Japanese finance supervisory agency opens doors 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Attempting a clean break with a scandal-tainted
past, Japan on Monday handed supervisory powers over the nation's
troubled financial industry to a new watchdog agency.
	   The move is part of a larger reform effort championed by Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to open up Japan's cozy financial
industry and streamline its powerful bureaucracy.
	   The Financial Supervision Agency takes over duties from Japan's
Finance Ministry, which has been tarnished by a series of
influence-peddling scandals and financial institution failures.
	   The new agency will carry out inspections of banks and brokerage
houses, along with various licensing and regulatory functions. But
some of these duties overlap with authority which the Finance
Ministry retains to monitor financial markets.
	   To signal the agency's independence, a former official from the
Public Prosecutors Office _ a bureaucratic rival of the Finance
Ministry _ was chosen as its head. Masaharu Hino, a former senior
public prosecutor, is the agency's director general.
	   Most other staffers, however, are bureaucrats transferred from
the Finance Ministry, which oversees the government budget and tax
collection.
	   Critics say the agency will have trouble moving out from under
the Finance Ministry's shadow, a charge which has also been levied
at a similar body, the Japanese Securities and Exchange
Surveillance Commission.
	   Like the surveillance commission, the financial supervisory
agency maintains a physical link with the Finance Ministry _ a
walkway connects its headquarters with the ministry building next
door.

KRASNOYARKS: so senselessly.'' 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In the end, he confounded the naysayers. Lebed forced Zubov,
once a successful amateur runner, into a runoff. Then he floored
him like the boxer he once was. People throughout Russia took
notice.
	   ``There are two main conclusions of this election,'' Lebed told
a television interviewer the morning after the May 17 runoff. ``The
first one, which is serious, is that the people turned out to be
more clever than the politicians. And the second one, which is a
joke, is that the former boxer beat the former runner in long
distances.''
	   It was typical Lebed humor: self-aggrandizing and not terribly
funny. Another Lebed joke: He likes to refer to Russia as
``Lebedyania.''
	   In Krasnoyarsk, Lebed has his work cut out for him. Although the
region is in better shape than many in Russia, and has some of the
world's richest deposits of timber and minerals, it also has
enormous problems.
	   Whole industries are at a standstill; workers go without pay
and, often, without work. To the extent that factories work, they
are responsible for some of the worst industrial pollution on
Earth. Organized crime flourishes in the cities.
	   Lyubov Daft, a kindergarten teacher, is among the fed-up
majority who voted for Lebed. Standing inside the school where she
voted, her strawberry hair tumbling over the collar of her black
leather jacket, she spoke with disgust about the managers who run
the region's industry.
	   ``I don't know what he should do, but I hope that with his
strength of character, he'll be hard on them. He's my last hope,''
she said.
	   The question everyone has been asking since Lebed's victory is
whether he can turn things around in Krasnoyarsk in time to run for
president in 2000.
	   ``From my point of view, he possesses good prospects to become a
good governor,'' said Vyacheslav Novikov, host of a public affairs
program on Krasnoyarsk television.
	   But in two years? ``Definitely not.''
	   Novikov is among those who believe that Lebed may have damaged
his prospects for the presidency by winning in Krasnoyarsk.
	   In fact, there are those who believe, darkly, that Lebed was set
up. One source for this belief lies in the remarks of Boris
Berezovsky, a billionaire business tycoon who is a powerful,
shadowy force in Russian politics. Berezovsky said he supported
Lebed in Krasnoyarsk precisely because he doesn't want him to be
president.
	   But there are those who believe that, once again, Lebed is being
underestimated.
	   So far, the names most frequently bandied about for president in
2000 are Viktor Chernomyrdin, the former prime minister; Gennady
Zyuganov, the Communist Party boss; Grigory Yavlinsky, a leader of
the country's liberal forces; and Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.
	   All share one trait: They are Moscow insiders. In a country that
increasingly resents the capital and its perceived prosperity, this
is not an asset. And Lebed, despite his brief and stormy stint in
the Kremlin as national security chief, could be in a prime
position to capitalize on that.
	   In the heat of the campaign in Krasnoyarsk, some wild rumors
were flying around. The most persistent was that Lebed and his
brother, Alexei, another former military officer who is now
governor of the neighboring region of Khakassia, were planning to
create an independent Siberian republic and secede from Russia.
	   ``In a way, I believe they are right,'' said Chaplygen, the
Moscow analyst. He believes Lebed intends to marshal support
throughout Siberia and the Far East and use that for a political
assault on Moscow in the presidential election.
	   Furthermore, he believes Lebed might succeed.
	   ``He's a very strong personality in all respects,'' Chaplygen
said. ``We've observed that, in recent months, his team became very
strong. He wouldn't lack either ideas or the people to carry them
out.''
	   The big question that remains is: What are his ideas? The thing
about Alexander Lebed is, no one really knows.
	   His platform in the election in Krasnoyarsk was so vague as to
be meaningless: He wants the region to keep a larger share of its
taxes. He intends to crack down on corruption. He'll get industry
working again.
	   Most people assume Lebed is a nationalist and populist with
vaguely centrist economic ideas and vaguely authoritarian views on
law and order. He is generally perceived as honest, and apparently
sincere in his distaste for Soviet totalitarianism. (Lebed says his
father spent two years in a Stalinist labor camp for being late to
work.)
	   What kind of president he'd be, nobody knows.
	   At a polling place in Krasnoyarsk, technical college student
Dmitri Vasakin stopped for a minute to give his thoughts about
Lebed. Vasakin, dressed in the international youth uniform of black
jeans, black jacket and collarless shirt, is naturally worried
about his future. In Lebed, he sees a vehicle for hope.
	   Doesn't it bother him that Lebed is an outsider who only wants
to use Krasnoyarsk as stepping stone to higher office? He paused to
consider.
	   ``Of course, a lot of people feel a bit apprehensive choosing a
guy who's not from the territory,'' he answered. ``But I think it's
better to let him try to show what he can do here than if people
were to elect him president and have him fail.
	   ``This will be a kind of test for him. People will see what he
can do and can't do. ... I think people have suffered a lot, and in
this man, they associate hope for a better life.''

	   ``He's a very strong personality in all respects,'' Chaplygen
said. ``We've observed that, in recent months, his team became very
strong. He wouldn't lack either ideas or the people to carry them
out.''
	   The big question that remains is: What are his ideas? The thing
about Alexander Lebed is, no one really knows.
	   His platform in the election in Krasnoyarsk was so vague as to
be meaningless: He wants the region to keep a larger share of its
taxes. He intends to crack down on corruption. He'll get industry
working again.
	   Most people assume Lebed is a nationalist and populist with
vaguely centrist economic ideas and vaguely authoritarian views on
law and order. He is generally perceived as honest, and apparently
sincere in his distaste for Soviet totalitarianism.
	   What kind of president would he be? Ask the people of
Krasnoyarsk _ two yeas from now.

Pacific-Rim trade ministers open talks

	   KUCHING, Malaysia (AP) _ The United States on Monday demanded
Japan serve as the ``engine of growth'' for Asia as two days of
talks opened on liberalizing trade in Pacific-Rim countries.
	   ``The United States has reiterated time and again Japan must be
an engine of growth for Asia,'' U.S. Trade Representative Charlene
Barshefsky told reporters after closed-door talks with her Japanese
counterpart, Mitsuo Horiuchi.
	   ``It must, in addition to applying physical stimulus measures,
as well as dealing appropriately with the banking sector,
deregulate and open its economy,'' said Barshefsky on the first day
of talks between trade ministers of the 18 members of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum.
	   ``These APEC meetings are a test of Japan's willingness to do
just that,'' she said. ''That is, to deregulate and to open its
economy in a meaningful way. Particularly to the economies of the
Asian region which depend so heavily on Japan as a regional engine
of growth.''
	   The U.S. and Japanese strategies for lifting trade barriers and
lowering tariffs for some dlrs 1.5 trillion worth of goods and
services differ widely.
	   In negotiations leading up to the talks, senior-level officials
indicated Japan was holding up a plan to begin liberalizing trade
in nine industries by next year.
	   APEC's mission is free trade among the developed member nations
by 2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   Negotiators are striving to eliminate tariffs and other trade
barriers in the areas of environmental products and services,
energy, fishery, forestry, toys, jewelry, medical goods, chemical
products and telecommunications.
	   The liberalization process is slated to begin in 1999, based on
a ``early voluntary sectoral liberalization'' agreement reached at
last year's APEC summit in Vancouver and expected to be ready for
final signatures by the APEC gathering of world leaders in Kuala
Lumpur in November.
	   Japan, which has just fallen into full-blown recession, said
Sunday it was committed to accelerating trade liberalization,
including tariff reductions. But it wants flexibility in setting
its own free-market schedule and feels the United States is forcing
its hand.
	   ``I think it's a very critical moment for APEC, whether it will
change or not,'' a senior Japanese official told The Associated
Press on Sunday.
	   Japan said the United States, with an eye on the next round of
talks at the World Trade Organization in 2000, intends to make the
list of rapid liberalization sectors binding, with specific time
targets to cut tariffs.
	   ``The U.S. is trying to take advantage of this APEC exercise to
increase the momentum in the WTO process,'' said the senior
Japanese official, who asked not to be named.
	   The United States _ which helped to stabilize the Japanese
currency last week by buying up dlrs 6 billion in yen _ has said
Japan was crucial to making EVSL work.
	   Barshefsky reiterated Monday that the U.S. intended to stand by
the EVSL agreement reached in Vancouver.
	   ``The U.S. will fully participate in a constructive and positive
manner in these meetings to ensure that the leaders' vision of
Vancouver is fully realized,'' she said.
	   ``We will await whether Japan exhibits the same rules.''
	   APEC groups Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and the
United States.
	   Russia, Vietnam and Peru, scheduled for admission in November,
have sent their ministers as observers.

Unrest growing over land demands by Chile's emboldened Indians

<TEXT>
	   PICHIPANGUECO, Chile (AP) _ It took the Spanish conquistadors
and their Chilean heirs nearly four centuries to subdue the fierce
resistance of the Mapuche Indians in southern Chile.
	   Now, Mapuches want the land back and some are ready to fight for
it again.
	   The battle has mostly centered in the courts so far, with more
than 80 lawsuits demanding restitution of land that the Indians
claim the ``huincas'' _ non-native Chileans _ illegally took from
them.
	   But some Mapuches are raising the ``Marichiweu'' _ a war cry
meaning ``we shall overcome tenfold'' _ and have forcefully seized
private farms that belonged to the Indians centuries ago.
	   They lost the land in a war that began soon after the arrival of
the Spanish in 1541 and ended only in 1883 after bloody raids by
the professional army of the young Chilean republic.
	   Hundreds of thousands died over the centuries, often in
remarkably cruel forms.
	   Spanish conqueror Pedro de Valdivia was captured and killed by
multiple blows of the ``chuecas,'' long sticks used for a
traditional Mapuche game similar to field hockey. The Mapuche
leader Caupolican was slain by Spaniards who put him on a sharp
wooden stake.
	   Violence is breaking out again.
	   In the town of Lumaco in December, for instance, Indians seized
a farm owned by a large timber company and set several trucks on
fire.
	   ``There are going to be many more cases like the one in Lumaco
if the main Mapuche demands are not met,'' said Jose Lincoqueo, a
Mapuche lawyer who represents the land-seekers in court.
	   The government admits concern over potential violence, but
officials say extremists are a minority among the half million
Mapuches living in extreme poverty in their region 700 kilometers
(450 miles) south of Santiago, the capital.
	   Another half million Mapuches now live in the cities, where they
fill menial jobs often rejected by others.
	   ``Land seizures have failed to get widespread support,'' the
region's governor, Isaac Vergara, said in an interview. ``The
problem is centered on just four counties.''
	   Large landowners warn they are ready to use arms if new seizures
occur and the government does not protect them.
	   Four years ago, the government established the National Indian
Corporation, known as CONADI, to handle Indian affairs.
	   Moving through a region of snow-capped volcanoes and thick
forests, CONADI officials have met with radical Mapuches _ seeing
firsthand how the Indians live without electricity or plumbing in
wood and straw huts.
	   ``More than 50 percent of the resources in this region are
allocated to the Mapuches, but they want to go faster,'' Vergara
said in the regional capital, Temuco.
	   In the village of Pichipangueco, Segundo Paillalao, a
58-year-old father of five, is one of the leaders in the effort to
regain land.
	   ``My grandfather was cheated by white men,'' he said. ``As he
could not read, he was presented with a piece of paper and told to
sign it to rent his land. But he was really being forced to sell.''
	   Paillalao is one of 80 Mapuches represented in court by
Lincoqueo. The landowner they are suing is a tough rival: Juan
Figueroa, one of Chile's most prominent lawyers and a former
minister of agriculture.
	   On the small patch he still owns, Paillalao scrapes a living
from a few cows and by planting beans and wheat. His children must
walk 6 kilometers (3 1-2 miles) down muddy roads to school in
Temulemu, another Mapuche community.
	   Electric power does not yet reach that community, although the
posts have been erected.
	   Flora Collonao, one of two wives of Temulemu chief Pascual
Pichun, said her family is suing for 58 hectares (143 acres)
``stolen from us'' by a timber company. The family was left with
only a few hectares (acres), and ``there are now five heirs,'' she
said.
	   Lincoqueo's main argument in court is a treaty signed between
the Mapuches and the Spanish monarchy in 1803, before Chile became
an independent nation. It granted the Indians large tracts of land
south of the Bio Bio, a river 500 kilometers (350 miles) south of
Santiago.
	   The lawyer is demanding the return of 14 million hectares (34.5
million acres) to the Mapuches, although he admits a ruling in his
favor would trigger chaos.
	   The head of CONADI, Domingo Namuncura, a Mapuche himself, says
the demands are generally justified and disagrees with other
officials who claim a few agitators are causing the unrest.
	   ``For us, this is a reason for serious concern, something we
must solve,'' he told The Associated Press.
	   But he also said the danger of violence had been exaggerated.
``Conflicts exist in only a dozen Mapuche communities, out of 1,200
and with 150,000 people,'' he said.
	   He noted that in four years CONADI has succeeded in legally
returning 71,000 hectares (about 175,000 acres) to 3,600 Mapuche
families. Next year, that figure should jump to 130,000 hectares
(about 320,000 acres), he said.
	   The government also is granting hundreds of scholarships to
Mapuche students and investing 12 billion pesos (dlrs 26 million
dollars) to build roads and other infrastructure in Mapuche
communities.
	   The Mapuches are the largest minority in Chile, but still their
leaders lament their identity is being eroded by outside influences
and by discrimination against Indians.
	   Lincoqueo, who is married to a non-Mapuche, acknowledges he has
not had time to teach the Mapuche language to his two children.
	   Nowadays in Mapuche areas, one rarely sees the traditional
``trailonco'', or wool headband, nor the ``trapelacucha,'' a large
silver collar that spreads to the chest.
	   Some Mapuches say that soon about the only tradition remaining
in their communities will be poverty.

Angry and isolated, Christians fear they've lost Lebanon 
</HEADLINE>

Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
	   BSHARRI, Lebanon (AP) _ Atop the stirring cliffs of St. Elias
Mountain and a short drive from some of the last cedars of Lebanon,
the Rev. Joseph Sukkar shepherds a service for one of the Arab
world's oldest Christian sects _ and perhaps its most frustrated.
	   The cedars and mountains near his Maronite Catholic church long
symbolized Lebanon's Christians: their distinctiveness in a Middle
East that is overwhelmingly Muslim and their salvation in village
redoubts that protected them in times of trouble.
	   The times are troubled again. Today, though, those mountains and
cedars provide another symbol.
	   They speak of a community's isolation, a growing fear that the
Christians' place is more and more threatened in a country whose
politics, culture and economy they dominated for 50 years.
	   Like the cedars that once blanketed Lebanon, the reach of
Christians has receded, giving rise to anger and frustration that
could endanger Lebanon's fragile, Western democracy, an experiment
that virtually stands alone in an authoritarian Arab world.
	   ``The Christians today are splintered. They are nowhere to be
found in government or in politics,'' Sukkar said after his sermon
at the church, bathed in soft sunlight and a mountain breeze.
	   Behind him, on the church's stone wall, a piece of paper echoed
those worshippers who glanced at it: ``Don't forget us, Mary.''
	   Lebanon's Christians lost the 1975-90 civil war, a devastating
conflict that some darkly hint is not yet over.
	   To stop the fighting, they had to surrender the authority of the
once all-powerful presidency, a post that is reserved for a
Maronite. In parliament, Christians lost their 6-to-5 majority for
an even split between Christians and Muslims that better reflects
the country's murky demographics, an explosive issue in itself
because Lebanon has not conducted a census since 1932.
	   Long-time Christian leaders are in prison, in exile or in the
grave.
	   Lebanese Christians also feel abandoned by their historic
guardians in Europe, their Cold War protectors in America and their
occasional patrons in Israel, which sought allies among right-wing
Maronites during the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
	   Now, watching over them are Syria and its 35,000 soldiers in
Lebanon, attention most Christians would prefer to do without.
	   ``The Syrians are occupying our institutions and they nominate
our ministers,'' said Albert Moukheiber, who served in parliament
for 25 years but lost his seat by boycotting the 1992 election.
``Nothing is done without the will of Syria.''
	   Dory Chamoun, son of the late President Camille Chamoun, calls
anyone working with the government a collaborator.
	   Not all Christians share that anger. Many Greek Orthodox, the
second-biggest Christian sect, long sided with leftists and Syrian
nationalists and chafe at Maronite dominance over other Christians.
	   In the ritzy Christian suburbs of Beirut, the night clubs,
restaurants and chic cafes exude a veneer of prosperity and a
flashy materialism more common to the West than the Arab world.
	   And the Syrian presence, while widely unpopular, has secured
Lebanon its longest peace in a generation.
	   But many Christians share the disgust that the only militia
leader the government imprisoned after the civil war is a Maronite,
Samir Geagea, head of the now-disbanded Lebanese Forces. He was
sentenced to life in prison for the murder of a Christian rival,
his wife and two sons in 1991.
	   Geagea's fate contrasts with other warlords whose shady war
records equaled or surpassed his but today serve in the Cabinet.
	   ``Fifteen years of war, and there's only one criminal in the
country?'' asked Farid el Khazen, a respected Lebanese analyst and
professor at American University of Beirut.
	   Others complain that the government, under Syrian pressure, has
given preference to Muslims, gerrymandering voting districts and
dragging its feet on resettling tens of thousands of Christians
displaced by the war _ charges the government denies.
	   In Geagea's home of Bsharri, a village overlooked by a barren
mountain streaked with snow and the home of Lebanese-American poet
Khalil Gibran, the Rev. Sukkar warns that the tension has reached
the breaking point _ for Christians and for Lebanon.
	   ``The feud will start again,'' he said. ``People are waiting for
the right time and the right conditions to turn things around.''
	   The potential exists, but many believe it is unlikely soon.
	   The Christians have few allies today. Israel is consumed by its
simmering war with Hezbollah guerrillas in southern Lebanon. The
United States and Europe seem more concerned with Lebanon's
stability than its sovereignty.
	   That reality has led a small but growing number of Christians to
urge the community to reconsider its fate: forgo their estrangement
and become more active in a civic life that, while dominated by
Syria, remains one of the Arab world's most vibrant.
	   A hint of that changing attitude occurred in May when Christian
groups took part in Lebanon's first municipal elections in 35
years, making impressive gains. That followed a Christian boycott
of 1992 and 1996 parliamentary elections that left the community
without what it considered its true representation.
	   ``The feeling that they have lost, the feeling that they are a
minority, is an illness of which they have to be cured,'' said
Ghassan Moukheiber, a lawyer and nephew of Albert Moukheiber, the
former parliament member.
	   ``But there is a new mood, which is slowly but surely getting
back in to the Christian community: Play a decisive role,'' he
said. ``That will be the true protection of Christians.''

Singapore heroin seizures up 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ More than 100 kilograms of heroin, mostly of
poor quality, has been seized in Singapore this year, more than the
total for 1997, according to Central Narcotics Bureau statistics
reported Monday.
	   A conviction for trafficking in heroin brings the death penalty
in Singapore. Yet police have seized 5 million Singapore dollars
(dlrs 3 million) worth of the drug since January in raids on
various syndicates, according to a report in The Straits Times
newspaper.
	   Most of the heroin originates from the Golden Triangle and is
smuggled into Singapore across a causeway connecting the island to
Malaysia, according to Muhammad Azni Sarbini, an intelligence
director in the narcotics bureau.
	   The paper also quoted Sarbini as saying the heroin being seized
has been of poor quality and not very pure.
	   The newspaper quoted him as saying the bureau had busted 16
major operations this year, crippling several syndicates.
	   No numbers were given on the total number of people arrested or
convicted. Forty suspected traffickers, addicts and pushers were
arrested in island-wide raids over the weekend.

Martin leaves U.S. Open with confidence 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ After a week filled with excitement and
emotion, Casey Martin was proud of his golf game as he prepared to
return to reality _ life on the Nike Tour.
	   Martin, who has a diseased right leg and walks with a limp, was
the center of media and fan attention for the opening two rounds as
he became the first player to drive a cart in a U.S. Open. The
spotlight dimmed a bit on the weekend, but he still remembered
being close to tears on the first tee Thursday because of the
crowd's adoration.
	   ``It's overwhelming, it's like a dream. People treated me
unbelievable here,'' he said Sunday. ``I just got goosebumps.''
	   Martin will take this week off, then play in the Greater
Hartford Open and then head back to the Nike Tour _ the minor
league of golf.
	   He shot 74-71-74-72 for an 11-over 291 at The Olympic Club, and
came away from the Open with the confidence he can play on the PGA
Tour.
	   ``I have the realization that I can play with these guys,'' he
said. ``I think I have a lot more game than what I showed. I think
if I can play better I can become a fixture out here.''

Janzen wins U.S. Open AP Golf Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with quotes
By RON SIRAK
<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Clearly, the only way to win a U.S. Open at
The Olympic Club is to sneak up on the course in the final round
and catch the field by surprise.
	   That's what worked for Jack Fleck when he ambushed Ben Hogan in
1955.
	   It worked for Billy Casper when he came from seven strokes back
on the final nine holes against Arnold Palmer in 1966.
	   And Scott Simpson slipped an Open away from Tom Watson by coming
from behind in 1987.
	   Lee Janzen pulled the same old trick again Sunday on the firm,
fast and frightening Lake Course at Olympic.
	   Trailing by seven strokes after he made bogeys on two of the
first three holes, Janzen played the final 15 holes four under par
for a 68 to be the only player to match the 72-hole par of 280.
	   Payne Stewart learned the same hard lesson taught to Hogan,
Palmer and Watson _ Olympic is just too tough of challenge on which
to try to protect a lead under U.S. Open pressure where one mildly
bad shot can lead to disaster.
	   Stewart joined that elite trio as another third-round leader who
finished second at an Olympic Open. He was one stroke behind Janzen
at 281 with Bob Tway at 284.
	   ``Lee Janzen shot a 68,'' Stewart said. ``No one who was in
contention in the golf tournament shot in the 60s today but Lee
Janzen. Give him credit.''
	   Don't let the boyish grin and quick tears be deceiving. Let
Janzen stick a nose in front and he's a tough man to beat,
especially in a U.S. Open, especially against Stewart.
	   He did the same thing to Stewart at Baltusrol in 1993.
	   On that final round, Janzen broke a tie with a 20-foot (6-meter)
birdie putt on No. 14 and clinched matters with a chip-in for a
birdie on No. 16 to win his first U.S. Open.
	   This time, he stuck a nose in front with two birdies early on
the back nine and never surrendered the lead.
	   ``It was a dream to win the U.S. Open,'' Janzen said about the
1993 victory. ``Not a day has gone by that I haven't talked about
winning it again.''
	   ``Somehow I did it,'' he said, wiping tears from his eyes.
	   Stewart came to the 18th hole needing a birdie to force an
18-hole playoff. But his approach was 25-feet (7.5-meter) above the
hole and he had a very difficult, very fast downhill, curling putt.
	   When the ball broke just low of the hole Janzen, who was
watching on TV, let out a big sigh and buried his head in a towel.
	   Janzen had closed out his round 20 minutes earlier when he
tapped in a 2-foot (0.6- meter) par putt while his father Larry
clapped in appreciation for his gift for the Father's Day holiday.
	   ``That might not have looked like a long putt but it couldn't
have been longer,'' Janzen said.
	   Tway, Jeff Maggert and Nick Price _ all veterans of major
championship pressure _ had a chance to make a move on Sunday but
none could respond the way Janzen did.
	   Perhaps the most heartbreaking of the also-rans was Tom Lehman,
who started the day four strokes behind Stewart and was playing in
the final group on the final day at the U.S. Open for the fourth
consecutive year.
	   But Lehman added a fifth-place finish to the third, second and
third he has had the three previous years.
	   And none of the young guns expected to contend in this Open was
a factor. David Duval closed with a 69 and was at 287, along with
Lee Westwood, the young Englishman. But Justin Leonard, Ernie Els,
Tiger Woods and Jim Furyk were all far back.
	   Other thrills came from other places.
	   Casey Martin rode up the 18th fairway in his cart to warm cheers
from the gallery and closed with a 72 to be at 291. Jack Nicklaus,
playing the Open for the 42nd time, was at 295, one stroke better
than Els, the defending champion.
	   Amateur Matt Kuchar, who turned 20 on Sunday, shot a 74 and was
at 289, one stroke better than Woods, who closed with a 73 that
included a three-putt from 7 feet (2 meters) on the final hole.
	   John Daly shot a 78, including a quadruple bogey when he
four-putted after missing a one-footer he tried to backhand, and
was at 297.
	   When Stewart, who won the PGA Championship in 1989 and the U.S.
Open in 1991, stood on the second green he could see that there was
no red on the leaderboard.
	   No one among the contenders was making birdies, no one was
making a move.
	   Then, after getting a break when his ball hung in a tree briefly
on No. 5 before falling to the ground, Janzen kick-started his
comeback when he chipped in from 15 feet (4.5 meters) to save par
on the hole. He never made another bogey.
	   Stewart led after each of the first three rounds but finally
gave up the top spot when he made bogeys on Nos. 12 and 13, the
first when he had the bad luck to drive into a divot and the second
when he couldn't get up and down from the thick greenside rough.
	   The victory by Janzen meant that the last 15 major championships
have been won by 15 different people going back to 1994.
	   And it showed once again that The Olympic Club is tough on
leaders down the stretch.

Sampson's future uncertain following Cup AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
By RONALD BLUM
<TEXT>
	   LYON, France (AP) _ Steve Sampson said he wouldn't change a
thing. His boss wouldn't say whether he would replace Sampson after
the World Cup.
	   ``I'm not thinking about my future,'' Sampson said after the
United States lost to Iran 2-1 Sunday night. ``I feel very
confident and very proud of what I've done. If the federation
doesn't want me, I'm sure some other organization will want me.''
	   Sampson, the first American-born coach of the U.S. soccer team,
took over in April 1995 after U.S. Soccer Federation president Alan
Rothenberg fired Bora Milutinovic, who coached the Americans during
the 1994 tournament.
	   Rothenberg made no secret that he tried to persuade Carlos
Queiroz of Portugal and then Carlos Alberto Parreira of Brazil to
take the job. When they said no, it went to Sampson by default on
an acting basis. Wins over Nigeria, Mexico and Argentina that
spring and summer got him a fulltime contract.
	   When the United States stumbled in World Cup qualifying,
Rothenberg waffled on Sampson's future, giving him a contract
through 1998 only after the team clinched a World Cup berth. After
the loss to Iran, Rothenberg wasn't dropping any hints about the
coaching spot.
	   ``After the World Cup, we'll start to assess the future,''
Sampson said. ``I'm not going to do it now.''
	   Even before the start of the tournament, Rothenberg predicted
the United States wouldn't advance beyond the first round. Because
the Americans were in a tough group with European champion Germany
and Yugoslavia, Rothenberg said Sampson would be judged on whether
the team showed progress in its play, not on wins and losses.
	   While the Americans attacked the net often Sunday night, they
were plagued by a repeated failure to convert scoring chances _
something that has bothered them throughout the 1990s.
	   ``It's a bitter disappointment,'' Rothenberg said. ``I'm waiting
to see what we'll do against Yugoslavia. We're playing for pride.''

ST. PETERSBURG: it 6-3. Indians 11, Yankees 0 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   In Cleveland, Bartolo Colon, Manny Ramirez and the Indians
showed the Yankees and their fans that there's more than one
dominant team in the AL.
	   Colon (7-4) struck out 10 in eight innings and Ramirez hit two
of Cleveland's five home runs as Cleveland handed New York its most
lopsided loss this season.
	   Mark Whiten, Travis Fryman and Shawon Dunston also homered for
the Indians, who split a four-game series by pounding Hideki Irabu
(6-3).
	   Irabu entered with the lowest ERA in the league, but allowed a
season-high five runs in three innings, his shortest outing of the
year. His ERA went from 1.68 to 2.19.
	   This was the first series at Jacobs Field between the Yankees,
whose 50-18 record is the best in the majors, and the AL
Central-leading Indians since Cleveland ousted New York in the
playoffs last October.
 &UR; Angels 10, Rangers 7 &QC; 
	   In Anaheim, California, Darin Erstad drove in four runs and
Jason Dickson won his seventh straight decision as the Angels won
for the 18th time in 21 games.
	   Erstad's three-run double keyed a five-run second off Matt
Perisho (0-2), and Anaheim scored five more runs in the third to
take a 10-0 lead.
	   Dickson (8-4), pitching with a broken index finger on his
throwing hand, allowed seven hits and four runs in six innings.
	   The Rangers closed within 10-7 in the ninth before Troy Percival
got his 23rd save in 25 tries.
	   Juan Gonzalez got his major league-leading 89th RBI for Texas.

Dollar rises, Tokyo stock prices edge higher in morning trading 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: UPDATES with midday stock and bond prices, dollar-yen rate
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar soared against the yen Monday amid
disappointment that Japan offered no concrete plans to save its
economy and permanently strengthen the yen at a weekend finance
meeting. Tokyo stock prices edged higher.
	   The dollar bought 137.33 yen by midmorning, up 2.36 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
136.10 yen on Friday. The dollar had risen as high as 138.45 yen in
morning trading.
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
rose 39.01 points, or 0.26 percent, to 15,306.99 points at the
close of the morning session. On Friday, the Nikkei fell 9.356
points, or 0.61 percent.
	   Finance officials from around the world, including Deputy U.S.
Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, met in Tokyo over the weekend,
urging Japan to stimulate its economy and clean up its bad debt
problem. But Japan unveiled no new measures following the meeting.
	   ``If the government doesn't move quickly, yen selling will start
again,'' said Shuji Takano, a foreign exchange dealers at ABN-Amro
in Tokyo.
	   Currency dealers said the yen weakened amid disappointment that
Japan didn't announce a detailed plan to resolve problems at the
nation's banks.
	   But the Ministry of Finance stopped the yen from falling further
by hinting it would intervene again in currency markets. Joint
intervention by the United States and Japan last week brought the
yen up from an eight-year low against the dollar.
	   Though nothing came out of the weekend meeting, the government
on Monday began taking some steps to restore confidence.
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's secretary-general, Koichi
Kato, said the government will make a final decision regarding the
formation of a public ``bridge bank'' to dispose of banks' bad
debts by July 8.
	   Dealers hesitated to bid the dollar up even higher against the
yen because of expectation that further yen weakness would prompt
the United States and Japan to again cooperate to support the
Japanese currency.
	   Eisuke Sakakibara, vice finance minister for international
affairs at the Finance Ministry, hinted at further yen-buying
intervention.
	   ``When Japan has to do what it has to do, it has the ability to
do it,'' Sakakibara told reporters, adding that he was in contact
with his counterparts from other Group of Seven countries and Asian
nations.
	   Expectations for intervention are especially strong ahead of
U.S. President Bill Clinton's visit to China later this week. China
has already complained that the weak yen was putting pressure on
its economy and traders said they expected the United States to
support the yen through the trip.
	   The yen's slide in recent weeks roiled Asian financial markets
by stirring concerns about a possible new wave of currency
devaluations like those that triggered the region's economic
turmoil last year.
	   Earlier last week, the dollar hit a nearly eight-year high of
146.73 yen in global markets, prompting the joint Japan-U.S. move
Wednesday which pushed the dollar back down.
	   On the stock market, the broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all
issues listed on the first section was up 2.56 points, or 0.22
percent, to 1,189.83. The TOPIX closed down 11.57 points, or 0.87
percent, on Friday.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 1.2985 percent from Friday's finish of
1.255 percent, driving its price down to 111.28 yen from 111.47
yen.

Louise Woodward implies Eappens were responsible for baby's death Princess Diana interview 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: ADDS detail in grafs 10-16 of criticism over resemblance to
<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ In her first in-depth interview since returning
home from the United States after being convicted of killing a baby
in her care, Louise Woodward implied the parents were responsible
for the death.
	   ``If the parents didn't do it, who did?'' Ms. Woodward told the
British Broadcasting Corp. in an interview scheduled to be aired on
British television Monday night.
	   Prosecutors had claimed that Ms. Woodward, who returned to
Britain on Thursday with a manslaughter conviction, shook
8-month-old Matthew Eappen to death. She has always maintained her
innocence.
	   ``There was the whole feeling that somebody had to pay and that
somebody had to be me,'' she said in the interview, according to
excerpts released by the BBC.
	   Woodward allowed to leave the United States after a
Massachusetts high court upheld a lower court judge's decision last
November to reduce her second-degree murder conviction to
manslaughter and sentenced her to the 279 days she had already
spent in prison.
	   A BBC spokeswoman, speaking on customary anonymity, said the
interview will cover Ms. Woodward's ``desperate attempts to cope
with Matthew on the day he went to hospital, her arrest, reaction
to the trial and fight to clear her name.''
	   During the program, the 20-year-old former au pair will talk
about life with the Eappen family, her supporters back in Britain
and her reaction to last week's high court decision to allow her to
go home, the BBC said.
	   The Eappen family was not immediately available for comment late
Sunday.
	   Ms. Woodward's mother, Susan, has promised ``lots of answers''
to questions surrounding the baby's death in February 1997.
	   A photograph released by the BBC of Ms. Woodward being
interviewed by the reporter drew criticism Monday from The Sun and
The Mirror tabloid newspapers, which saw echoes of the same
reporter's famous interview with Princess Diana in 1995, in which
she talked of the breakdown of her marriage.
	   ``Woodward seems to model herself on the princess by dressing
and sitting like her,'' The Mirror said. ``She has perfected the
coy, wide-eyed look Diana used.''
	   Even the hotel room where the talk takes place looks similar to
the setting chosen by Diana, the chairs arranged in identical
fashion, the newspaper said, dubbing the interview the ``Princess
Louise'' talk.
	   ``It's downright deliberate. Why not wear a summer dress or hold
the interview in a garden? Louise Woodward is taking off Diana,''
The Mirror quoted royal expert Margaret Holder as saying.
	   ``I can't imagine what this interview is for unless it is to
convey 'I'm as innocent as Diana was' or 'I'm as great a lover of
children as Diana was,'' the newspaper quoted her as saying.
	   The BBC countered that any resemblance to the Princess Diana
interview was ``pure coincidence,'' The Mirror said.
	   ``Don't treat this killer like royalty,'' the newspaper said in
an editorial headline.
	   Although Ms. Woodward said during a press conference on Thursday
that she would receive no payment for the BBC interview and that
she would not sell her story, controversy has since broken out over
the tabloid Daily Mail's confirmation that it paid 40,000 pounds
(dlrs 66,000) to Ms. Woodward's parents in November, before he
conviction was reduced. The newspaper began publishing a series on
Saturday, which it said was based on contacts with the girl and her
parents over several months.
	   In Monday's installment, the newspaper reported on Ms.
Woodward's life inside prison.

Barnes wins Canadian senior event 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS and UPDATES with quotes, details of game
<TEXT>
	   CALGARY, Alberta (AP) _ Brian Barnes is used to making dramatic
comebacks.
	   The strapping, gravelly voiced British golfer, a recovering
alcoholic who five years ago was contemplating suicide, stormed
from three shots back Sunday to capture the AT and T Canada Senior
Open.
	   ``I'd be dead if I hadn't stopped drinking,'' Barnes said. ``I'm
convinced of that, this is a bonus just playing the tournament.''
	   Barnes' win on Father's Day made it even more special for him
and his family.
	   ``My wife had a tough time for a few years and stuck with me,''
he said. ``How can I drink now? Too many good things have happened.
And I like the opportunity to talk about and hopefully help other
people who are in the same situation to make them realize there is
life after booze.''
	   Barnes earned his first Senior PGA Tour victory with a
4-under-par 68 that left him two strokes ahead of three players at
the dlrs 1.1 million tournament.
	   Barnes, 53, started the final round three shots behind
third-round leader Walter Hall at the 6,942-yard (6,346-meter)
Glencoe Golf and Country Club. His Sunday round, which included an
eagle with a 75-foot (23-meter) putt at the par-5 14th, gave him an
11-under 277 total and the dlrs 165,000 first prize.
	   Barnes, who won the British Senior Open in 1995 and 1996,
followed the eagle with a birdie on No. 15 that gave him a
three-shot lead.
	   ``It's lovely winning your own open title, but this has done far
more for me,'' he said. ``Now I'm in a position until this time to
play in every event that I want to.''
	   Dana Quigley also closed with a 68 and finished tied for second
at 279 with Bruce Summerhays and Tom Jenkins, who both had 70s on
Sunday.
	   Hall never recovered from bogeys on Nos. 3, 7 and 8, finished
with a 74 and was alone at 280.
	   ``The guy who is leading is there to be shot at,'' said Barnes,
a renowned drinker and partier who once consumed a six-pack on the
back nine before winning a tournament in a playoff.
	   ``If you're two or three shots behind you're in a position to
relax a little more and concentrate on playing your own game and
not looking over your shoulder all the time.''
	   Barnes' round turned on the 534-yard (488-meter) 14th.
	   ``As the round progressed, I found myself walking slower and
taking a little more time with the shots,'' he said. ``Whenever
I've won tournaments, I've gotten into that kind of zone.''

Giggling golfer earns first LPGA victory AP Sports Writer 
</HEADLINE>
Eds: RECAPS and UPDATES with quotes
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
	   AGAWAM, Massachusetts (AP) _ Now Amy Fruhwirth really has
something to giggle about.
	   The 29-year-old golfer earned her first LPGA tour victory on
Sunday when she shot an even-par 72 to win the Friendly's Classic
and take home a dlrs 90,000 first prize. Nicknamed ``Giggles''
because that's what she does when she's nervous, Fruhwirth parred
the last 12 holes to hold off Charlotta Sorenstam and Kim Saiki by
two strokes.
	   ``I'm not one for a lot of words,'' she said, ``but it's the
best feeling in the world, the best accomplishment. It's a relief I
was able to keep my game together.''
	   Fruhwirth finished at 8-under-par 280 for 72 holes at the
6,381-yard (5,833-meter) Crestview Country Club. Her lone bogey of
the weekend came in the final round on No. 6, a par-3, and she
parred out from there.
	   ``I thought the first time (I won), I'd be jumping up and down
and throw my ball into the crowd. It wasn't like that,'' she said.
``I wanted this so badly, it was more calming.''
	   Saiki, playing with Fruhwirth in the final group, bogeyed the
par-4 15th and birdied No. 16, another par-4, failing to gain
ground on the leader. She finished with a 71 and tied at 282 with
Sorenstam, who shot a 70 Sunday.
	   Pamela Kometani, who had four bogeys on the front nine, birdied
two of the last three holes to finish at 72 and was another stroke
back in fourth. Six others were at 284.
	   After a clear opening day on Thursday, the tournament had two
rain delays on Friday and two more on Saturday. The last, which
halted play in the afternoon, left Fruhwirth on No. 13; she came
back and birdied the last three holes to shoot to the top of the
leaderboard and begin the last round with a three-stroke lead.
	   Her final round was more steady, with the birdie on No. 3, a
par-3, erased three holes later with the lone bogey. No one came
within two strokes of Fruhwirth all day.
	   Saiki got to six under when she put a 7-iron three feet from the
hole on the par-4 4th. But she left a 3-iron short of the green on
15, chipped to eight feet (2.5 meters) and missed the putt that
could have kept her close.
	   She put an 8-iron from 4 feet (1.2 meters) away on 16 and made
the putt to get back into the tie for second place. But even
one-putting eight greens wasn't enough for Saiki, who still seeks
her first tour victory.
	   ``I wanted to win. But I'm very happy for Amy,'' she said. ``The
past couple of years, I've been on the verge of winning. I know it
will come, I just have to be patient.
	   ``My day will come.''
	   Fruhwirth's came on Sunday _ in her sixth year as a pro.
Although she had never won an LPGA tour event, she did win the 1997
JCPenny Classic, paired with Clarence Rose, and finished third
twice.
	   Her nerves were so jumbled that she wouldn't let herself look at
the leaderboard, which she topped all day, until after her first
putt on the 18th green. Caddie Jeff ``Shadow'' Jones had only told
her, ``You're all right.''
	   ``My comfort level is not good enough yet to look at the
leaderboards,'' she said. ``It's just not my way.''

Japan's World Cup game garners highest ratings since 1966 
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's World Cup soccer match with Croatia posted
the highest television ratings in the Tokyo area for a sporting
event in over 30 years, a ratings monitor said Monday.
	   A total of 9,135,000 households in the capital and its
surrounding areas watched Saturday's game, for a rating of 60.9
percent, Video Research said. There are about 15 million households
in the capital region.
	   Japan lost the match, played in Nantes, France, by a score of
1-0. It was shown nationally by public broadcaster NHK.
	   It was the highest rating for a sports TV program since 1966,
when the World Boxing Commission Bantamweight title match between
Japan's Fighting Harada and Eder Jofre of Brazil drew a rating of
63.7 percent, Video Research said.
	   Japan's game with Argentina on June 22 drew a rating of 60.5
percent in the Tokyo region. Japan also lost that game 1-0.
	   Video Research only surveys viewership on a regional basis, not
for the nation as a whole. Each household in the Tokyo area
averages just over three people.
	   The highest rated sports broadcast ever was the women's
volleyball final at the 1964 Tokyo Olympics between Japan and the
Soviet Union, which drew 66.8 percent. Japan won that match to take
the gold medal.
	   The highest rating ever recorded for a program was 81.4 percent
for NHK's annual year-end song program aired on Dec. 31, 1963.

Tarus, Ilyina win first Rock `n' Roll Marathon AP Sports Writer

EDS: SUBS 9th graf to UPDATE numbers.
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Kenya's Philip Tarus went from opening act to
headliner over the course of the inaugural U.S. Rock `n' Roll
Marathon on Sunday.
	   Running the full 26 miles, 385 yards (42.19 kilometers) for the
first time, the 24-year-old Tarus pulled away from countryman and
training partner Christopher Cheboiboch and won the Rock `n' Roll
Marathon in a respectable 2 hours, 10 minutes, 42 seconds.
	   ``At last I see I can run well and finish,'' said Tarus, who
started this year's Boston Marathon as a pacesetter and dropped out
at about the 20-mile mark (after about 32 kilometers).
	   That's about the point Sunday where Tarus had opened a 20-yard
(18-meter) lead over Cheboiboch, 22, who was bothered by a stomach
ailment in his first marathon. Cheboiboch finished in 2:10:53. A
third Kenyan also broke 2:11 _ Jonathan Ndambuki in 2:10:58.
	   ``I knew after 25 kilometers, because some had dropped out,''
said Tarus, who had built a lead of 80 yards (73 meters) as the
course headed toward the finish line downtown.
	   The Kenyans rocked _ they swept the first six spots and seven of
the first 10 _ and so did the course, which featured several bands
along the way.
	   ``The bands were enjoyable,'' Cheboiboch said. ``Seeing as music
is a big part of Kenya, it was very nice.''
	   Nadezhda Ilyina, 34, of Russia won the women's race in 2:34:17,
beating rival Irina Bogacheva, 37, by 11 seconds. Salina Chirchir,
29, of Kenya was third in 2:35:17.
	   But the marathon had some opening-day glitches, most notably the
38-minute delay at the start in Balboa Park. Nine hours after the
start, 15,746 of the 19,978 entrants had finished.
	   The wheelchair racers, who took off 15 minutes before the rest
of the field, came to a stop at the seventh mile (11th kilometer)
and had to wait about 10 to 15 minutes.
	   Just past the Mile 7 marker (At about the 11-kilometer mark), a
U-Haul van backed out of a self-storage complex after the lead pack
of 15 runners went past and stayed on the course for about
three-quarters of a mile (1.2 kilometers) until police intercepted
the driver and forced him off.
	   The delay may have been enough to keep Tarus from cracking 2:10,
which would have earned him a dlrs 5,000 bonus. By the marathon's
midpoint, the sun had broken through the cloud cover and the
temperature began to rise.
	   Cheboiboch said the delay didn't bother the Kenyans, ``because
we were patient.''
	   But the course had a lot of sharp turns, and that took its toll
on the pace.
	   ``Sometimes I changed speed around the curve and to pick up my
speed was a bit difficult,'' Tarus said.
	   Tarus won dlrs 10,000 cash and a sport utility vehicle, plus
other products from Suzuki, the marathon's sponsor.
	   ``Maybe I will sell it because I don't have a driving license,''
said Tarus, who runs about 140 miles (225 kilometers) a week back
home in Kenya.
	   Ilyina said winning this marathon helped make up for being
disqualified from the 1997 Los Angeles Marathon for apparently
taking a shortcut through a gas station while looking for a
bathroom.
	   ``It was very hard for me to lose in LA, but you have to be able
to approach life with an easy attitude,'' she said. ``It happens.''
