<HEADLINE> Toymakers Free To Cut Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Those steep prices that have kept many kids from  
getting the latest interactive playthings that giggle and wiggle 
are coming down. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanks to falling costs of computer chips and other technology,  
toymakers are finally starting to slash prices without sacrificing 
innovation. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, many new high-tech toys and games will sell for  
well below $50 this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's easy to build a great toy, but it's hard to sell it at  
the right price,'' said Sean McGowan, a toy analyst at the 
investment firm Gerard Klauer Mattison. ``This year, we are seeing 
great use of technology at really affordable prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toymakers have stepped up their high-tech offerings in recent  
years to make playtime more entertaining and challenging for 
today's computer-literate kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Innovation hasn't come cheap. Many of these toys -- especially  
the most advanced -- have been selling for more than $100, above 
what most value-conscious Americans will pay for a single toy. 
</P>
<P>
	Entering 1999, however, high-tech toy prices are going the way  
of computer prices: Better products for less. 
</P>
<P>
	``A (computer) chip you could buy in 1980 for $4,000 is now  
selling for under a $1,'' said Doug Glen, chief strategy officer at 
Mattel Inc., the world's biggest toymaker. ``None of us could do 
what we are doing now at a reasonable price just a few years ago.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many toymakers also watched the success of Furby last year.  
Consumers were amazed by its ability to speak 800 words and 
phrases, and to interact with kids. 
</P>
<P>
	And most shoppers paid only $30 for the furry, Gremlinlike toy,  
although some spent thousands in the fervor of the Christmas rush. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole point of technology is to raise the bar on what is  
magical to kids,'' said Chris Byrne, a toy consultant. ``Furby 
managed to do just that and it was affordable -- a perfect 
combination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toy manufacturers showcase their new products for retailers at  
the American International Toy Fair, which begins Monday, and this 
year low-cost toys with unbelievable innovation are more prevalent 
than ever before. Most will appear on store shelves beginning in 
the second half of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	One new company, Zowie Intertainment, has a line of three $50  
CD-ROM-based computer adventure games that are controlled by 
plastic playsets which plug into the computer. In one of its 
titles, ``Redbeard's Pirate Quest,'' children navigate a ship on 
the computer screen by steering the wheel on a playset that also is 
shaped like a ship. And they manipulate characters on the screen by 
moving freestanding dolls around on the playset. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasbro has also come up with four new CD-ROM-based computer  
games. With the Playskool Store, for instance, kids place a 
template of a cash register over the computer's real keyboard, and 
use that to interact with on-screen shoppers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also for $40 is Play-By-Play's My Best Friend doll, which  
employs voice-recognition technology to carry on a limited 
conversation. If the doll asks a question and gets a wrong answer, 
she encourages the child to try again. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiger Electronics' Sports Feel Tennis, $20, is a toy tennis  
racquet that has an embedded motion sensor. A child can play a set 
of virtual tennis by trying to time her swing in reaction to the 
sounds of balls being hit from the opposite side of the virtual 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers are looking for value when they buy toys, just like  
they do when they shop for everything else in their lives,'' Bryne 
said. ``This year, they will find what they are looking for.''

<HEADLINE> HBO Says Honored Film Is a Fake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) -- The way the Alpha Tau Omega brothers  
at Muhlenberg College tell it, two filmmakers just showed up one 
day in 1997 saying they were New York University students shooting 
a fictional comedy -- a sort of ```Animal House' for the '90s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, the film they shot at the school in Allentown  
showed up at the Sundance Film Festival as something else: a 
documentary. 
</P>
<P>
	For its graphic, violent hazing scenes, the HBO-financed ``Frat  
House'' won an award and rave reviews at the renowned independent 
film festival. 
</P>
<P>
	But amid allegations that students were paid to act out hazing  
cruelty, HBO is leaving the film in the can. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no way this will air on HBO,'' said Sheila Nevins,  
vice president of original programming for the cable network. 
``It's not a documentary. When we do children at war, we don't 
create a war. When we do poverty in Appalachia, we don't create the 
want for food. We find the story where it is. 
</P>
<P>
	``The documentary about what goes on behind a fraternity's doors  
is still to be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Filmmakers Tony Phillips and Andrew Gurland insist they did not  
stage any scenes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Absolutely, unequivocally not. We asked people to show us what  
happens,'' said Phillips, 28. ``If you scrutinize any documentary, 
how any documentary films are being made, you'll find similar 
problems. What's being questioned is the credibility of the movie, 
but this is what happens at fraternities.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips and Gurland, 27, who were interns at HBO when shooting  
began, would not comment further. 
</P>
<P>
	ATO brothers say Phillips and Gurland offered the fraternity  
$1,500 to shoot some scenes at the house. The pair directed all the 
action -- with several takes of many scenes -- and starred as pledges 
during the shooting in the spring of 1997. They say ATO brothers 
past and present also posed as pledges. 
</P>
<P>
	The film's narrator says the directors had to agree to become  
pledges before ATO would allow them to film inside the house. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing, it wasn't like `The Real World,''' said David  
Boelker, a 21-year-old Muhlenberg senior and one-time ATO 
president. ``They didn't just come in, put their cameras on and see 
what happened. It wasn't really like `Taxicab Confessions.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Those two television shows -- the first on MTV, the second on HBO  
-- feature real-life footage. 
</P>
<P>
	In the most disturbing scene of ``Frat House,'' one of the  
directors sits inside a dog cage while others pelt him with tobacco 
spit, beer and obscenities. In another, supposedly scalding water 
is poured on pledges' bare backs. Other scenes show ``line-ups,'' 
where brothers torment the potential pledges. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you see the film, you go `God, this is amazing that they  
got this footage,''' said HBO spokesman Quentin Schaffer. ``That's 
the one thing you'd say, `How did they get this? It's 
incredible.''' 
</P>
<P>
	That's because it really is, said Wynn Smiley, national  
executive director of the fraternity. He heard about the film after 
the Sundance Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
	The brothers from Muhlenberg told him and ATO's attorneys that  
the scenes were not real. Some of the film's ``pledges,'' Smiley 
noticed, were upperclassmen, some were officers and some had even 
been kicked out of the fraternity. And Muhlenberg does not allow 
pledging in the spring, when the film was shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was just a joke in their minds,'' Smiley said.  
</P>
<P>
	One year before the shooting, the Muhlenberg fraternity had  
gotten into trouble for hazing violations, including some similar 
to those depicted in ``Frat House.'' Smiley said he kicked out 
several students and put the house on probation for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	On campus, ATO had a reputation for its Greek Week activities  
and pledging. 
</P>
<P>
	``People were like, `I'm not sure what's going on up that  
hill,''' said Jeff Shapiro, former vice president of Sigma Phi 
Epsilon. 
</P>
<P>
	The ATO chapter's behavior has since improved, college officials  
say. 
</P>
<P>
	When HBO heard from Smiley, it did its own interviews.  
</P>
<P>
	HBO discussed ways to salvage the film, but Nevins said she did  
not know how to do that without harming HBO's reputation in 
documentary filmmaking. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, HBO avoided the embarrassment CBS had in December  
when ``60 Minutes'' apologized for running a story based on an 
apparently fake British documentary about heroin smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips has since shot commercials for Miller Beer and a  
documentary on the band Phish, and won a production contract with 
director Ivan Reitman, who produced ``Animal House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips said the ``Frat House'' issue has nothing to do with  
HBO's reputation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's artistic freedom vs. frat-boy loyalty, that's what it  
boils down to,'' Phillips said. ``Frat-boy loyalty, which is found 
in corporate America, which is found ... everywhere.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says Hussein Was Peacemaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton praised the late King  
Hussein of Jordan for ``a rare kind of courage to be a peacemaker'' 
and said he ``will smile on us one more time'' when the Middle East 
finally is at peace. 
</P>
<P>
	``No words can convey what King Hussein meant to the people he  
led for nearly half a century. Words cannot convey what he meant to 
me as a friend and inspiration. Through good times and bad, through 
health and illness, he showed the power of a strong will applied to 
a worthy cause,'' Clinton said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The king, who was monarch of his strategically placed nation for  
43 years, died Sunday of heart failure. The king, 63, had lymphatic 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were  
``deeply saddened'' by the news. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had prayed that this day would not come soon. But God has  
called King Hussein to his reward,'' the president said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House said details about Clinton attending the funeral  
were being worked out. Jordan did not immediately announce funeral 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton recalled that he had seen Hussein a few weeks ago, when  
the king was returning to Jordan after cancer treatment at an 
American hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was no hint of the struggle he was waging,'' Clinton  
said. ``Instead he spoke with his usual passion and humanity about 
Jordan's well-being, the future of the Arab world, the Palestinian 
cause, and peace with Israel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president praised the king for ``a rare kind of courage to  
be a peacemaker -- the courage to learn from the past and imagine a 
better future. When peace finally comes to the Middle East, his 
name will be inscribed upon it. That day, King Hussein will smile 
on us one more time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Secretary of State Madeleine Albright called the king one of the  
century's ``finest and most courageous statesmen'' who was ``a 
wise, eloquent and deeply committed partisan of peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that the king ``rose from his sickbed'' during cancer  
treatment ``to inspire the Palestinians and Israelis to move 
forward on the road to peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The king played a supporting role to Clinton at talks in  
Maryland in October that produced a West Bank agreement between 
Israel and the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although his body was stricken, never has a man spoken with  
greater wisdom, conviction of clarity of mind,'' Albright said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright said bringing peace and prosperity to the Middle East  
``will honor the life and leadership of King Hussein in the way he 
would have wanted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both the president and secretary of state stressed continued  
U.S. support for Jordan and for Crown Prince Abdullah, Hussein's 
son who was proclaimed king by Jordan's cabinet on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United States stands with you -- today, tomorrow, and in  
the future,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright, who met with Abdullah in Amman in late January, said  
the two countries have an ``enduring and deep'' friendship. ``We 
pledge, in the days to come, to stand by Jordan and continue our 
mutual efforts to bring greater prosperity to the Jordanian people 
and lasting peace and stability to the Middle East.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congressional leaders also mourned the king's death.  
</P>
<P>
	``This great man, this great leader, and a faithful friend of  
the United States, presided over his country at a time fraught with 
peril, beset with almost constant threats both internal and 
external,'' said Sen. Jesse Helms, chairman of the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yet throughout his long reign he met the challenges of  
leadership with grace and courage. Without King Hussein, there 
would not today be even the limited peace the Middle East now 
enjoys,'' said Helms, R-N.C. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert said he was ``impressed'' with the  
king's commitment to the Middle East peace process. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was the glue that held the process together,'' said  
Hastert, R-Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``King Hussein was a peacemaker in a troubled region. He brought  
together disparate parties and consistently fought for peace. We 
can best remember his life by continuing his efforts to promote 
peace in the Middle East.''

<HEADLINE> Daytona 500 Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- It figured that Jeff Gordon and Rusty  
Wallace might have another one of their great battles Sunday in the 
Bud Shootout, but both took themselves out of position with 
inexplicable mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is probably something that will never happen to me  
again,'' Wallace said after being booted from the front to the rear 
of the field for missing the mandatory pre-race driver 
introductions. ``I'm glad it happened in a non-points event. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got to pay attention to starting times and stuff like  
that. It was my fault. I screwed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So did Gordon, although his mistake had nothing to do with being  
on time. He simply had trouble finding his pit stall during a stop 
early in a race laden with 1998 Winston Cup pole winners. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't overshoot very often, so it's not something we're  
prepared for,'' Gordon said. ``I blew reverse, trying to get it 
backed up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Had he made it, he would have been penalized 15 seconds and  
remained on the lead lap. Because the crew serviced his car out of 
its stall, Gordon was penalized a lap. 
</P>
<P>
	With nothing to gain and no chance to win, the three-time  
Winston Cup champion and pole sitter for the Daytona 500 next 
Sunday decided to park his car. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *STEWART'S STORY:* Although Tony Stewart has yet to complete his  
first week as a Winston Cup driver, he already has a credibility 
problem with car owner Joe Gibbs. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how his car was running prior to qualifying for the  
Daytona 500, Stewart told Gibbs: ``I think we're all right. But 
we're nothing spectacular.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then Stewart, a former Indy Racing League champion, put his  
Pontiac on the outside of the front row for the race next Sunday 
with a fast lap of 194.599 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw him when I got out of the car,'' Stewart said, grinning.  
``He said, `I'm not believing anything you tell me anymore.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	The surprise front-row start alongside defending Winston Cup  
champion Jeff Gordon has done nothing to cloud the big picture for 
Gibbs or Stewart, however. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not over yet,'' Stewart said, reminding all that one  
fast lap at Daytona International Speedway will not necessarily 
translate to success throughout the 34-race Winston Cup season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one pole,'' Gibbs said in agreement. ``We know what we're  
up against.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart was brought aboard by Gibbs to form a two-car team with  
title contender Bobby Labonte. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *COUNT THE MONEY:* When Darrell Waltrip was asked what has been  
the most dramatic change in his 27 years of Winston Cup racing, he 
didn't think about power, aerodynamics or the competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about money,'' the three-time series champion said.  
``In 1989, when I won the Daytona 500, I got $175,000. This year, 
the winner will get $1.1 million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Waltrip noted that Jeff Gordon's earnings last year exceeded $9  
million, and virtually no one would have believed that possible a 
few seasons ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all about sponsors, money and fans, and there's a lot  
more of them than there ever were before,'' said Waltrip, who has 
earned more than $17 million during his NASCAR career. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CHAMPIONS WEEK:* NASCAR's huge success with extended racing  
programs such as those at Daytona Beach, Charlotte, N.C., and 
Indianapolis that bring drivers from several different series 
together, has convinced the stock car governing body to branch out 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Champions Week, a showcase for Winston Racing Series competitors  
-- those who run weekend races at local tracks -- will become a 
reality in November 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Competition will include modifieds, trucks and street stocks. An  
IROC-type all-star event also will be on the program. 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR has not decided on a location for Champions Week.

<HEADLINE> Antonio McDyess Returns to Phoenix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Antonio McDyess, bracing for a hostile fan  
reaction in his first trip back to Phoenix, smiled and signed 
autographs before he and the rest of the Denver Nuggets took on the 
Suns Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he went out and scored 28 points despite a rough reception  
from the crowd and his former Suns' teammates in a 115-108 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	By coincidence, Phoenix played its home opener against the  
Nuggets, the team that lured McDyess back to Denver just 15 months 
after trading him to the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	He was booed loudly during introductions. A few rows behind  
Denver's bench, a fan held up a sign that read ``McSellout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But McDyess didn't look rattled. Quite the opposite. He opened  
by sinking two 20-footers and had 10 points in the first quarter. 
But in the second, he crashed into Suns' rookie Pat Garrity going 
for a pass and flopped face-down to the court in obvious pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd applauded politely as he finally made it to his feet  
and was helped to the locker room. X-rays of his ribs were 
negative, and he came back in the second half. He played seven 
ineffective minutes in the third quarter, then had an overpowering 
18-point fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort kept the Nuggets close, but the player who replaced  
McDyess in the Suns' lineup and the hearts of the Phoenix fans -- 
Tom Gugliotta -- scored 29 points to lead the home team to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, McDyess admitted he was a bit emotional.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's still kind of sad to me,'' he said. ``The people here  
have been so generous and nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he left the court after warming up, he stopped and signed  
basketballs, programs and pieces of paper from a handful of 
youngsters. At least during warmups, there was little nasty fan 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody said anything bad,'' he said. ``They said, `Why don't  
you come back when you get tired of Denver?''' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess decided to leave Phoenix and re-sign with Denver even  
though Phoenix could have offered him much more money. 
</P>
<P>
	At the last minute, the news conference to announce McDyess'  
signing in Denver was called off because he was having second 
thoughts. Three Suns -- Rex Chapman, Jason Kidd and George McCloud -- 
even took a charter flight to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
	But they sat outside McNichols Arena in a limousine during a  
blizzard and never got a chance to speak with McDyess, who 
eventually signed with Denver the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess said he hadn't spoken with Chapman, Kidd or McCloud  
since he signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wouldn't know what to say,'' he said. ``They left a  
message for me wishing me good luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets came to Phoenix on Saturday and McDyess said he went  
to an arcade at an area mall where he ran into Suns' forward Cliff 
Robinson. They spoke, but said nothing about basketball, McDyess 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess was recognized at the mall and signed autographs. He ran  
into no hostility, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just wanted to know why I left,'' McDyess said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was torn between Phoenix and Denver,'' he said, trying to  
explain why he would leave a perennial playoff team for one that 
has struggled mightily in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The main reason, he said, was just ``a gut feeling I had that  
Denver was the place for me.''

<HEADLINE> UConn Rebounds To Win Big Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STANFORD, Calif. (AP) -- Jim Calhoun sounded more like a  
financier than a basketball coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Five days after suffering their first loss, his Connecticut  
Huskies used relentless pressure to build a big lead and never 
trailed in a 70-59 win Saturday over No. 4 Stanford despite playing 
without their leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, these are the things you put into the bank,''  
Calhoun said. ``Down the line we need this kind of effort, and we 
know it's in us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut was to find out Monday if it had been bumped from  
the top spot in the poll by Duke. But that didn't mean as much to 
the Huskies as winning at Stanford without leading scorer Richard 
Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one really talked about being No. 1 much, because it  
doesn't mean a lot right now,'' said center Jake Voskuhl. ``As far 
as I'm concerned, Duke can have the pressure. We don't need it. 
We've been there. We're just going to enjoy this win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Connecticut was missing both Hamilton and Voskuhl when it lost  
59-42 at home to No. 16 Syracuse last Monday. Hamilton was still 
sidelined with a thigh bruise Saturday, but Voskuhl returned 
despite a stress fracture of his left foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Khalid El-Amin had 23 points, five assists and a season-high  
five steals for Connecticut, which harassed Stanford into 16 
turnovers and 35 percent shooting. The Huskies led by as many as 18 
points in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think UConn's one of the toughest teams I've ever played --  
right up there with when we played Utah in the (1997) NCAA 
Tournament,'' said Stanford center Tim Young. ``They didn't have 
the guy who might be the player of the year, they'd been blown out 
by Syracuse earlier in the week, and then the road trip. That was 
phenomenal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Cardinal, which had not lost at home to a non-conference  
opponent in five seasons, fought back to within two points four 
times in the second half. But Stanford missed several key free 
throws down the stretch, including an air ball by Mark Madsen on 
one foul shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Madsen, a 56 percent foul shooter, went 3-for-8 from the line  
and Stanford was 12-of-24 overall. The Cardinal, usually one of the 
nation's best free throw shooting teams, have struggled at the foul 
line all season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I missed four or five free throws down the stretch and I'm as  
frustrated as anybody,'' Madsen said. ``I can't say anything else 
except we missed them and we have to do better next time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the Huskies, who next play Wednesday night against Boston  
College, the key is getting healthy for the rest of the Big East 
season and the run toward the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want to hold on now until Richard (Hamilton) gets back  
and keep playing at this intensity level,'' said Kevin Freeman, who 
had 12 of his 14 points in the second half against Stanford.

<HEADLINE> US Warns Terrorist-Harbor Nations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration now asserts the  
right to bomb government facilities in nations that provide 
sanctuary to international terrorists, a significant escalation of 
U.S. attempts to thwart terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may not just go in a strike against a terrorist facility;  
we may choose to retaliate against the facilities of the host 
country, if that host country is a knowing, cooperative 
sanctuary,'' Richard Clarke, President Clinton's coordinator for 
counterterrorism, told The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview last week, Clarke described the policy that  
marks a departure from the tactics employed last August when U.S. 
cruise missiles struck at alleged terrorist strongholds in 
Afghanistan and Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the administration contends it could broaden such an attack  
to include government buildings and assets in nations that 
knowingly harbor terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
	The Clinton administration has repeatedly warned nations that  
protect terrorist groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``Countries that persistently host terrorists have no right to  
be safe havens,'' Clinton told the nation Aug. 20, the day the 
United States launched scores of cruise missiles at suspected 
terrorist targets in Afghanistan and Sudan. 
</P>
<P>
	But prior to Clarke's comments, no one in the administration had  
made the leap from a general denunciation of harboring terrorists 
to an explicit threat that governments may find their own 
facilities attacked if they do so. 
</P>
<P>
	Had this tactic been employed in the Aug. 20 strikes, the United  
States might have, for example, targeted Sudan's government 
buildings or the Afghan Taliban headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the scores of cruise missiles used in that strike were  
targeted carefully to avoid government facilities and were aimed at 
the alleged terrorist assets of Osama bin Laden. The administration 
alleges that the exiled Saudi millionaire was behind the bombings 
last summer of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. 
</P>
<P>
	In Afghanistan, U.S. official said their missiles struck a  
remote ``terrorist university.'' In Khartoum, Sudan, cruise 
missiles struck a privately owned pharmaceutical plant suspected of 
producing a precursor to the deadly nerve gas VX. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials emphasized at the time that the missile  
strikes were not aimed at the governments of Sudan and Afghanistan. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not go after those governments' facilities, but those  
governments need to know that if they continue to be a sanctuary, 
that they are now at risk, not just the terrorist facilities in 
those countries,'' Clarke said in the interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials caution that a president seeking to use force against  
a terrorist sanctuary government would face a high burden to show 
that the target government willingly tolerated a terrorist 
presence. The added risk of collateral damage or excessive 
casualties would add political and moral complications. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, a senior administration official familiar with the  
policy described it as a recent addition to the array of options 
Washington could turn to in the war against terror. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials say they don't consider it a change in  
U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, Clarke's comments appear to remove the distinction  
between cases where a nation actively involved in terrorism is 
struck, such as Iraq or Libya, and nations that merely allow 
terrorists to operate within their borders. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said the administration distinguishes between nations that 
``willingly abetted sanctuary as opposed to those that provided 
sanctuary because they didn't control that piece of their 
backyard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bin Laden is known to have terrorist camps in the Philippines,  
for example. The difference, according to State Department 
spokesman James Foley, is that the Philippines and other friendly 
governments cooperate with the United States fighting terrorism. 
Sudan and Afghanistan have refused to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States had long complained that those two countries  
allowed bin Laden to use their territory as safe haven. Then-U.N. 
Ambassador Bill Richardson traveled to Islamabad in the weeks 
before the cruise missile strike and failed to persuade the 
Taliban, the ruling party of the Afghan government, to renounce and 
expel bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, now Clinton's energy secretary, said he used  
diplomacy, not threats of force. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, it is unclear whether the threat of attack on  
government facilities in a terrorist sanctuary nation has actually 
been leveled against any nation. 
</P>
<P>
	In negotiations last week with the Taliban, U.S. envoy Rick  
Inderfurth did not raise the specter of strikes on Taliban assets 
as part of the discussion of bin Laden, who is still believed to be 
hiding in Afghanistan, said a State Department official, who spoke 
on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	David Tucker, author of a classified report on terrorism while  
at the Pentagon under Presidents Bush and Clinton, said the 
administration's policy on terrorist sanctuaries has roots in 
international law on an enemy that seeks sanctuary in a neutral 
country. This argument was used to justify the U.S. invasion of 
Cambodia in 1970. During the 1980s, the Reagan administration 
warned East Germany and other Soviet Bloc countries that they would 
be held responsible for harboring members of the Abu Nidal 
terrorist organization, Tucker said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy Said Improving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Singapore's important electrical manufacturing  
sector showed strength in volume and prices during the last three 
months of 1998 and could push the economy out of recession this 
year, a high government official said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Prime Minister Tony Tan was quoted on government  
television as saying the 1999 gross domestic product could be at 
the higher end of the Ministry of Trade and Industry's prediction 
of minus 1 percent to plus 1 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	His comments followed a suggestion Saturday by Prime Minister  
Goh Chok Tong that tax cuts may be included in the next budget to 
help ailing businesses in what he said would still be a difficult 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you can expect the budget ... to be mildly stimulative  
and perhaps there could be some tax cuts here and there,'' Goh said 
Saturday in comments to local reporters on the budget that will be 
presented to Parliament in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Singapore, which is dependent on trade and regional financial  
business, fell into recession at the end of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Goh warned the current year will remain difficult, but said  
businesses can expect some support in the upcoming budget, 
according to a report in The Sunday Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The fiscal 1998-99 budget is the first to run a deficit since  
the island state's recession in the mid-1980s.

<HEADLINE> Sens. Seek Blumenthal Perjury Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators want a Justice Department  
investigation into presidential aide Sidney Blumenthal's denial 
under oath that he spread negative stories about Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The accuracy of Blumenthal's impeachment deposition was  
questioned by journalist Christopher Hitchens, who said Sunday that 
the aide described Ms. Lewinsky to him and other reporters as a 
``stalker.'' Blumenthal denied in his testimony that he spread that 
information and reiterated it Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it is going to be referred to the Justice Department,  
and that's where it should be,'' said Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	House prosecutors have contended that President Clinton passed  
on false, derogatory information about Ms. Lewinsky to Blumenthal, 
so the aide would repeat the comments to a grand jury and 
elsewhere. Clinton's message, according to Blumenthal, was that Ms. 
Lewinsky was the sexual aggressor and a ``stalker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchens said on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' Sunday that ``when I  
saw'' Blumenthal ``for the first time since the scandal broke, 
that's what he said to me and to my wife and has said to many other 
people, that Monica Lewinsky was a stalker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said, ``I would  
hope that he isn't lying. I think if he is, it's serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were just as adamant, with Sen. Olympia Snowe of  
Maine saying ``certainly the truth should be uncovered with respect 
to whether or not Sidney Blumenthal told the truth under oath.'' 
Added Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas: ``We will insist that we have an 
expedited consideration by the Justice Department.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to Hitchens, Blumenthal issued a statement Sunday  
that focused on a part of his testimony in which he said he spoke 
of Ms. Lewinsky to ``friends.'' That category, he said, included 
Hitchens, a freelance writer for Vanity Fair and The Nation 
magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was never a source for any story about Monica Lewinsky's  
personal life,'' Blumenthal said in the statement issued through 
his lawyer, William McDaniel. ``I did not reveal what the president 
told me to any reporter. As I testified to the Senate, I talked 
every day about the stories in the news concerning Miss Lewinsky to 
my friends and family, just as everyone else is doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though I do not recall the luncheon with my then-friend of 15  
years Christopher Hitchens and his wife, the notion that I was 
trying to plant a story with this rabid anti-Clinton friend is 
absurd. My wife and I are saddened that Christopher has chosen to 
end our friendship in this meaningless way,'' the statement added.

<HEADLINE> Japan Stocks Fall in Early Trading / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks declined in early trading Monday  
amid continued unwinding of shareholdings by corporate investors 
anxious to book profits before the end of the current fiscal year 
in March. The dollar rose against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 73.72 points,  
or 0.53 percent, to 13,824.36 points in the first 30 minutes of 
trading. On Friday, the average closed down 188.77 points, or 1.34 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 112.96 yen in early morning, up 0.90 yen from  
late Friday in Tokyo but below its late New York level of 113.20 
yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, prices dropped on selling by  
companies unloading shares of other firms ahead of the close of 
fiscal 1998 on March 31, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Selling pressure from the unwinding of cross-shareholdings is  
turning out to be very strong,'' said Kunihiro Hatae, general 
manager of the stock division at Tokyo Securities Co. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section slipped 3.68 points, or 0.34 percent, to 1,080.96. 
The TOPIX closed down 6.13 points, or 0.56 percent, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar was higher than late Friday in  
Tokyo, but slightly lower than in New York trading as investors 
awaited further indication from Japanese officials about possible 
changes in bond policy. 
</P>
<P>
	Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa on Friday said the Bank of  
Japan should consider conducting twist operations, in which sales 
of short-term securities are offset by purchases of long-term 
bonds. The operation would help bring down long-term bond yields by 
reducing the supply of bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has been under selling pressure in recent weeks amid  
rising yields on Japan's most widely watched government bond. But 
the greenback surged in New York on Friday on the release of 
stronger-than-expected U.S. employment data. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro traded at 127.36 yen early Monday, up from  
126.88 yen late Friday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government  
bond fell to 2.205 percent from Friday's finish of 2.365 percent, 
driving its price up to 96.86 yen from 95.67 .

<HEADLINE>  Antonio McDyess Returns to Phoenix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Antonio McDyess, bracing for a hostile fan  
reaction in his first trip back to Phoenix, smiled and signed 
autographs before he and the rest of the Denver Nuggets took on the 
Suns Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he went out and scored 28 points despite a rough reception  
from the crowd and his former Suns' teammates in a 115-108 loss. 
</P>
<P>
	By coincidence, Phoenix played its home opener against the  
Nuggets, the team that lured McDyess back to Denver just 15 months 
after trading him to the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
	He was booed loudly during introductions. A few rows behind  
Denver's bench, a fan held up a sign that read ``McSellout.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But McDyess didn't look rattled. Quite the opposite. He opened  
by sinking two 20-footers and had 10 points in the first quarter. 
But in the second, he crashed into Suns' rookie Pat Garrity going 
for a pass and flopped face-down to the court in obvious pain. 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd applauded politely as he finally made it to his feet  
and was helped to the locker room. X-rays of his ribs were 
negative, and he came back in the second half. He played seven 
ineffective minutes in the third quarter, then had an overpowering 
18-point fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The effort kept the Nuggets close, but the player who replaced  
McDyess in the Suns' lineup and the hearts of the Phoenix fans -- 
Tom Gugliotta -- scored 29 points to lead the home team to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, McDyess admitted he was a bit emotional.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's still kind of sad to me,'' he said. ``The people here  
have been so generous and nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he left the court after warming up, he stopped and signed  
basketballs, programs and pieces of paper from a handful of 
youngsters. At least during warmups, there was little nasty fan 
reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nobody said anything bad,'' he said. ``They said, `Why don't  
you come back when you get tired of Denver?''' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess decided to leave Phoenix and re-sign with Denver even  
though Phoenix could have offered him much more money. 
</P>
<P>
	At the last minute, the news conference to announce McDyess'  
signing in Denver was called off because he was having second 
thoughts. Three Suns -- Rex Chapman, Jason Kidd and George McCloud -- 
even took a charter flight to talk to him. 
</P>
<P>
	But they sat outside McNichols Arena in a limousine during a  
blizzard and never got a chance to speak with McDyess, who 
eventually signed with Denver the next day. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess said he hadn't spoken with Chapman, Kidd or McCloud  
since he signed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really wouldn't know what to say,'' he said. ``They left a  
message for me wishing me good luck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets came to Phoenix on Saturday and McDyess said he went  
to an arcade at an area mall where he ran into Suns' forward Cliff 
Robinson. They spoke, but said nothing about basketball, McDyess 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess was recognized at the mall and signed autographs. He ran  
into no hostility, though. 
</P>
<P>
	``They just wanted to know why I left,'' McDyess said.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was torn between Phoenix and Denver,'' he said, trying to  
explain why he would leave a perennial playoff team for one that 
has struggled mightily in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	The main reason, he said, was just ``a gut feeling I had that  
Denver was the place for me.''

<HEADLINE> La. Politicians Vow Not To Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Sidestepping partisan loyalties, eight  
Louisiana incumbents holding statewide offices have signed a mutual 
nonaggression pact that amounts to an election-year political 
Valentine. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite some criticism from his own party, Republican Gov. Mike  
Foster put a positive spin on the deal for incumbents to not get 
involved in each other's re-election races, saying the cooperative 
pact could be a model for national political leaders embroiled in 
the highly partisan impeachment effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't let party get in the way of doing our jobs and I just  
wish Congress would take a page from our book,'' Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a state where Democratic voters outnumber Republicans, the  
deal seems to favor Foster and the one other GOP incumbent, but 
Foster's whopping approval rating -- which hovers around 80 percent 
-- and the fact that Louisiana voters tend to be conservative and 
don't always vote on party lines evens the equation. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some were surprised.  
</P>
<P>
	``This agreement seems amazing,'' said Louisiana State  
University political scientist Wayne Parent. ``This is always a 
volatile political state that thrives on politics and here you have 
... officials who have run for a variety of offices, aspiring to be 
a senator or governor, and here they are all agreeing to help each 
other out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least one influential party activist was outraged.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe it,'' said former state GOP chairman Billy  
Nungesser, referring to Foster's involvement in the deal. ``Here is 
a guy who benefited from the party by becoming a Republican (to run 
in 1995) and now he is going to cut the legs off of the party. It 
doesn't make sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the other Republican to sign, Secretary of State Fox  
McKeithen, said joining the agreement was a no-brainer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly wasn't hard for me to sign that paper,''  
McKeithen said, chortling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats who signed were Lt. Gov. Kathleen Blanco, Attorney  
General Richard P. Ieyoub, Treasurer Ken Duncan, Commissioner of 
Agriculture and Forestry Bob Odom, Commissioner of Insurance Jim 
Brown and Elections Commissioner Jerry M. Fowler. 
</P>
<P>
	For many, the deal wasn't an eyebrow-raiser because Louisiana  
state politicians generally haven't meddled in one each other's 
races since former Gov. Huey Long ran the state like a 
dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
	In Louisiana, Democrats make up most of the registered voters,  
with Republicans numbering about 600,000 of the 2.2 million total, 
about the same number as registered independents. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest test of the pact will come with the planned  
gubernatorial challenge of Democratic U.S. Rep. William Jefferson 
of New Orleans, who says he expects all Democrats to support him 
against Foster. 
</P>
<P>
	Ieyoub appeared to signal the incumbents' position with his  
response, saying Jefferson would make a good governor, but that he 
has his own race to run. 
</P>
<P>
	Foster said the agreement will help him focus on his  
re-election, rather than spending time supporting GOP colleagues, a 
position he took before the deal by refusing to endorse the 
Republican who ran unsuccessfully last year against U.S. Sen. John 
Breaux, saying that Breaux was doing a good job for Louisiana.

	Greene won the trials in 6.48 seconds and, after false starting,  
won the event in 6.45 seconds. The time was just shy of the world 
record of 6.39 seconds he set last year.

	``The false start didn't bother me, it kind of woke me up,'' he

<HEADLINE> Sens. Seek Blumenthal Perjury Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Several Democratic and Republican senators  
demanded Sunday that the Justice Department investigate whether an 
aide to President Clinton committed perjury by denying he spread a 
story that Monica Lewinsky was a stalker. 
</P>
<P>
	The allegation against Sidney Blumenthal came Saturday in an  
affidavit by British journalist Christopher Hitchens, released by 
House impeachment managers. He repeated the charge on television 
Sunday, saying Blumenthal told Hitchens and other reporters: 
``Monica Lewinsky was a stalker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We will insist that we have an expedited consideration by the  
Justice Department,'' Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas said. 
Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, said ``certainly the truth should be 
uncovered with respect to whether or not Sidney Blumenthal told the 
truth under oath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony at the Senate impeachment trial and to prosecutor  
Kenneth Starr's grand jury, Blumenthal denied passing to the news 
media President Clinton's assertion to Blumenthal that Ms. Lewinsky 
made sexual demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to Hitchens, Blumenthal issued a statement Sunday  
that focused on a part of his testimony in which he said he spoke 
of Ms. Lewinsky to ``friends.'' That category, the statement said, 
included Hitchens. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw'' Blumenthal ``for the first time since the scandal  
broke, that's what he said to me and to my wife and has said to 
many other people, that Monica Lewinsky was a stalker,'' Hitchens 
said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchens also said that in the same conversation, Blumenthal  
said ``some ... unpleasant things about poor Kathleen Willey,'' the 
former White House volunteer who alleged Clinton made an unwanted 
sexual advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal said, according to Hitchens, that Mrs. Willey's poll  
``numbers are high now after the accusations she's made, but they 
won't be so high later on.'' Following Mrs. Willey's televised 
accusations, the White House released cordial correspondence 
between the Richmond, Va., woman and the president from the years 
after the time she alleged the incident with Clinton happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan predicted a Justice  
Department inquiry into whether Blumenthal lied, and Democrats 
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Jay Rockefeller of West 
Virginia said there should be a probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California said, ``I would  
hope that he isn't lying. I think if he is, it's serious. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one of the most difficult parts of this for me has  
been the concept of Monica Lewinsky'' being called ``a stalker, 
because that has a certain diabolical ring to it,'' Feinstein said. 
Spreading such derogatory information, she said, ``isn't a nice 
thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein, Gramm, Snowe, Lieberman and Rockefeller appeared on  
NBC. Levin appeared on Fox News Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal's lawyer, William McDaniel, issued a statement  
quoting the presidential aide as saying ``I was never a source for 
any story about Monica Lewinsky's personal life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not reveal what the president told me to any reporter.  
As I testified to the Senate I talked every day about the stories 
in the news concerning Miss Lewinsky to my friends and family, just 
as everyone else is doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though I do not recall the luncheon with my then-friend of 15  
years Christopher Hitchens and his wife, the notion that I was 
trying to plant a story with this rabid anti-Clinton friend is 
absurd. My wife and I are saddened that Christopher has chosen to 
end our friendship in this meaningless way.''

<HEADLINE> Answers About Social Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The charges over President Clinton's Social  
Security plan are flying. Budgetary gimmickry. Financial flim flam. 
Double-counting trickery. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have heaped scorn on Clinton's marquee proposal --  
the use of trillions of dollars in future budget surpluses to 
bolster Social Security without lowering benefits or raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	Some questions and answers:  
</P>
<P>
	Q: What does Clinton want to do?  
</P>
<P>
	A: He wants to use $4.5 trillion in projected surpluses over the  
next 15 years to shore up the government's two biggest benefit 
programs, Social Security and Medicare. He also wants to create new 
private accounts to help workers save more for retirement and, with 
what's left over, boost spending on defense and domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Specifically, Clinton would divide the surpluses by giving  
Social Security, $2.8 trillion, 62 percent; Medicare, $686 billion, 
15 percent; private accounts, $536 billion, 12 percent. The 
remaining $481 billion or 11 percent would go to boost spending for 
military and domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What's the problem with this?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Critics say Clinton's numbers don't add up: Specifically,  
that he is double-counting $2.3 trillion of the $2.8 trillion 
because that money is already earmarked for Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: What does the administration say?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Basically they accept the math. But they contend they aren't  
double counting any more than the current system already does. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: Even in Washington, isn't it hard to spend the same money  
twice? 
</P>
<P>
	A: Not if you use something called the Social Security trust  
fund. Right now, Social Security brings in more in payroll taxes 
each year than it needs to pay current benefits. The excess money 
is credited to the trust fund to be used to pay future benefits. 
That IOU earns interest at the same rate as real Treasury bonds 
sold to the public. The government then takes that money and spends 
it on things like salaries, highways and paper clips -- in effect 
using it a second time. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How is Clinton's plan different?  
</P>
<P>
	A: He would credit the $2.3 trillion in excess Social Security  
collections to the trust fund -- just like the current system. 
That's the first IOU. Then he would spend it -- again -- not to buy 
paper clips and new highways, but to buy back Treasury bonds held 
by the public. That would reduce the $5.5 trillion national debt. 
For each dollar spent this way, Clinton would give the trust fund a 
second IOU. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: How does that do any good?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The administration argues that buying back the debt held by  
the public reduces the government's annual borrowing costs, which 
currently take 11 cents of every dollar spent. Through this plan, 
the government will reduce that figure to 2 cents by the year 2014. 
With less debt, the government will be in better shape to meet the 
baby boomers' needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: So how does that push back the date when Social Security runs  
out of money? 
</P>
<P>
	A: The blunt answer is that it does so only on paper. The trust  
fund will now hold more Treasury bonds -- the second set of IOUs. 
But they will be worth the same as the first set -- nothing. 
</P>
<P>
	To actually pay out benefits, on that future day when retirees'  
demands exceed the annual amount Social Security collects, the 
government will be faced with the same painful choices -- cut 
benefits, increase payroll taxes or tap into the general funds 
paying for the rest of government. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, the government could decide to avoid those painful choices,  
and just borrow more. But this time, it would have to be real 
money. The government would have to borrow from the public by 
selling ``real'' Treasury bonds -- increasing the debt again. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: But why go through this convoluted accounting exercise?  
</P>
<P>
	A: The administration argues that unless the surpluses are  
earmarked for Social Security, Republicans will be tempted to use 
them for tax cuts rather than to pay down the debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Q: So what's likely to happen to Clinton's plan in Congress?  
</P>
<P>
	A: It's unclear. Many Republicans accept the need to use 62  
percent of future surpluses to reduce the national debt, but argue 
over Clinton's approach. They also want the rest of the money for 
tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	If the two sides can't agree, the stalemate might not be such a  
bad thing. The surpluses could still be used to pay down the debt. 
Many economists, including Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, 
see that as the best solution of all -- because it would free up 
capital available to be borrowed by companies, at lower interest 
rates, increasing their productivity.

<HEADLINE> Refreshed or Rusty, Sampras Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- He played a little golf and watched some  
TV. And, for the first time since he was a high school junior, Pete 
Sampras didn't play in a tennis tournament for a couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he returns to the game he dominates, starting with this  
week's Sybase Open. Sampras gets his first chance to show whether 
he's refreshed or rusty on Tuesday night against 84th-ranked Galo 
Blanco of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely felt like I needed this break to start the year  
off mentally, physically as fresh as possible,'' Sampras said. ``So 
I am definitely champing at the bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exhausted after a grueling series of tournaments in late 1998 to  
protect his No. 1 ranking, Sampras passed up the Australian Open in 
January -- the first Grand Slam tournament he has skipped since 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He is just one short of tying Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand  
Slam singles titles, and Sampras has said his main motivation is to 
win more Grand Slams. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also focused on finishing last year as the No. 1 player  
in the world, giving him a record six straight years at the top. To 
protect that ranking, he had to play seven straight weeks in 
October and November -- a process that left him weary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have loved to have gone down to Australia. I just wish  
it started in February,'' he said. ``I wanted to give myself a good 
offseason this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though gone, Sampras certainly was not forgotten at the  
Australian Open. When Yevgeny Kafelnikov won the title, he 
immediately pointed out that his job was made much easier by the 
absence of the world's top player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete, it's really a great, wonderful feeling,'' Kafelnikov  
said after raising the silver trophy. ``Thanks for letting me do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras is beginning his 258th week at No. 1, a dozen short of  
the record held by Ivan Lendl. Opponents wonder whether he'll be as 
sharp as usual at the start of the $350,000 Sybase tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's definitely a shot that he'll be rusty,'' said  
sixth-seeded Jan-Michael Gambill, who would face Sampras in the 
semifinals. ``Pete definitely plays better when he has a few events 
under his belt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gambill has been on the tennis circuit only two years, and he  
understands the exhaustion that forced Sampras to the sidelines for 
the past 10 weeks. Yet he thinks Sampras' relentless pursuit of the 
year-end No. 1 ranking was worth the toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, that's his most impressive accomplishment,'' Gambill  
said. ``He's been head and shoulders above everyone else for six 
straight years, and that's really impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, a two-time Sybase champion, has a relatively easy draw  
into the semifinals. But, once there, the top seed may have to face 
Gambill or No. 3 seed Mark Philippoussis, a U.S. Open finalist last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi, coming off an uninspired fourth-round loss at the  
Australian Open, is the defending champion of the Sybase Open and 
the No. 2 seed this year. He opens against Todd Woodbridge on 
Monday night and could face No. 4 seed Michael Chang in the 
semifinals.

<HEADLINE> Polite Teens Charged in Robbery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Two teen-age girls charged with robbery  
were extraordinarily polite, so polite they got caught. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls walked into a shoe store Thursday and asked employee  
Sonya Graham for a pen and paper. One wrote a note, then handed it 
to the worker, saying, ``I'm sorry to do this. You're so nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The note said: ``I have a gun in my pants, give me all the  
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You came at a bad time,'' the worker said. ``I have a customer  
to wait on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The would-be robbers offered to wait, police said, so the worker  
walked to the back of the store and triggered the store's silent 
alarm system. She then went back to the counter and stalled the 
suspects until police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were real nice,'' said police Lt. Roy Williams, adding  
that the girls were armed with a toy cap pistol. ``They probably 
haven't done this before.''

	Vigil Continues in Jordan  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Weeping crowds kept vigil outside King  
Hussein's hospital as attention focused on the untested Crown 
Prince Abdullah, who received the powers of the monarchy yesterday. 
At stake is Jordan's pivotal role as a Western ally and key 
supporter of Mideast peace efforts. Persian Gulf states also worry 
about ripples from any upheavals in the strategically located but 
resource-poor kingdom. President Clinton asked Congress to speed up 
aid to Jordan, reflecting the belief that a weak economy may be the 
main threat facing him in his first brush with exercising power.

	Kosovo Peace Talks Open in France  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Yugoslav Serbs and Kosovo Albanians  
sat down at the negotiating table yesterday, faced with intense 
international pressure to make peace in two weeks. Despite NATO's 
threat to unleash its missiles and bombs if all parties did not 
start talking by yesterday, Serb officials delayed the ethnic 
Albanians' departure from Kosovo and let it be known they would not 
negotiate with ``terrorists,'' as they call the Kosovo Liberation 
Army rebels. In the end, all parties turned up -- at least for the 
opening session. The real negotiating was to start today, sources 
close to the talks said.

	Senate Watches Lewinsky Deposition  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Monica Lewinsky made her videotape debut  
yesterday as parts of her testimony was played on the Senate floor 
in President Clinton's impeachment trial. House prosecutors aired 
segments of Ms. Lewinsky's deposition in an effort to bolster their 
case against the president. White House lawyer Nicole Seligman 
called the pick-and-choose clips ``terribly misleading.'' TV 
networks broadcast Ms. Lewinsky's appearance nationwide. The trial 
is set to resume tomorrow. 

</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal Named As Rumor Source  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sidney Blumenthal's lawyer was so determined  
to show the White House aide never leaked a rumor about Monica 
Lewinsky being a stalker that he challenged journalists to come 
forward. Now one has. Journalist Christopher Hitchens has sworn an 
affidavit stating Blumenthal several times described Ms. Lewinsky 
as a ``stalker'' and President Clinton as ``the victim'' of a 
predatory and unstable young woman, when they had lunch in March 
1998. Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., said the Justice Department could 
investigate any false testimony given the Senate, but that the 
assertion was ``collateral at best'' to the overall question of 
whether the president should be removed from office.

a veteran democracy activist imprisoned after the government 
crushed pro-democracy protests in 1989, a human rights group said 
today. Sun Weibang, 57, was released Thursday from Weifang prison 
in eastern Shandong province, having served nearly 10 years of a 
12-year sentence, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human 
Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. Sun's release comes 
amid an aggressive government crackdown on dissent that has seen 
other democracy campaigners given lengthy jail terms in recent 
months.

rising rock 'n' roll stars who played their last concert there. 
Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens and J.P. ``The Big Bopper'' Richardson 
died Feb. 3, 1959, just after performing at the Surf. They took off 
from the Mason City airport in the middle of a snowstorm and their 
four-seater plane crashed in a cornfield about five miles north of 
Clear Lake. In 1979, the Surf held a weekend tribute near the time 
of the crash. It has grown into an annual party capped by a concert 
that sells out months in advance.

in overtime yesterday as DePaul stunned No. 3 Cincinnati 61-60, 
ending the Bearcats' six-game winning streak. Before DePaul's 
largest home crowd in nearly seven years at the Rosemont Horizon, 
Coleman stole the ball from Cincinnati's Melvin Levett with four

<HEADLINE> Diet May Help Lower Blood Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A low-fat, higher-protein diet rich in fruits and  
vegetables may be the best treatment for blacks suffering from 
hypertension, a new study suggests. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers examined the effects of three dietary patterns on  
blood pressure in 459 adults with normal-but-high to high blood 
pressure. Sixty percent of the participants were black, 34 percent 
were white and 6 percent were of other races, according to an 
article in today's edition of the Archives of Internal Medicine. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers found that blood pressure was lowered in people  
with blood pressure at the high end of normal, thus reducing the 
need for medication. 
</P>
<P>
	One researcher cautioned that people should not switch their  
diet or change the way they take medication without first 
consulting a physician. Still, she raved about the study's 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are talking about a diet with the potential of preventing  
and treating hypertension and doing it particularly well in people 
at risk, African Americans and people with high blood pressure,'' 
said Dr. Laura Svetkey, associate professor of medicine at Duke 
University Medical Center and lead author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	High blood pressure is a major threat to heart function that  
affects about 50 million adults in the United States. It increases 
the risk of heart failure, heart attack, stroke and kidney failure. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers wanted a majority of black participants because  
previous studies showed blacks are about 40 percent more likely 
than whites to have high blood pressure. Blacks also tend to 
develop it earlier and more severely, according to authors of the 
study, named ``Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension,'' or DASH. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants were required to be free of all hypertension  
medications and were randomly assigned to one of the three 
experimental diets. 
</P>
<P>
	The diets included one with a nutrient composition typical of  
that consumed by most Americans; one that was rich in fruits and 
vegetables; and a third low-fat, low-cholesterol diet -- the 
so-called DASH diet -- containing fruits, vegetables and low-fat 
dairy foods, as well as an increase in protein. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of the eight weeks, researchers found that  
participants who ate the DASH diet significantly lowered their 
blood pressure. Black participants benefited from a larger decrease 
than did whites. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was not aimed at reducing salt intake, inducing weight  
loss or moderating alcohol consumption -- all traditional ways that 
doctors have attempted to treat hypertension. 
</P>
<P>
	Svetkey also said the study -- made up of half women -- also  
offers more proof that such a diet helps lower blood pressure in 
women, whose hypertension problems have been studied less than 
men's.

<HEADLINE> Vikes, Ravens Discuss Johnson Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Minnesota backup quarterback Brad Johnson was  
the subject of renewed trade talks Sunday between the Vikings and 
Baltimore Ravens at the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Vikings coach Dennis Green made a proposal to Ravens director of  
player personnel Ozzie Newsome that involved only draft picks. The 
sides had reached a snag earlier in the week when discussing the 
former Pro Bowl player. 
</P>
<P>
	``He offered me another deal, so I've got something to think  
about on the plane ride home,'' Newsome said. ``He gave me 
something to chew on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Ravens coach Brian Billick was the Vikings' offensive  
coordinator and is familiar with Johnson, who lost his job to 
veteran Randall Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade deadline is Friday and several teams have expressed  
interest in Johnson. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Plane Carrying ATF Agents Crashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MEDINA, Ohio (AP) -- A plane carrying three federal agents  
crashed Sunday in northeast Ohio, where a resident helped pull the 
injured men to safety as the plane burned. 
</P>
<P>
	The men, agents with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and  
Firearms, were on their way to a training session in Louisiana, ATF 
spokesman Patrick Berarducci said. They were hospitalized with 
injuries that did not appear life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	The privately-owned plane crashed at approximately 11:30 a.m.  
seconds after takeoff from a small airport during a snowfall, FAA 
spokesman Tony Molinaro said. 
</P>
<P>
	The single-engine plane apparently hit a tree, Berarducci said.  
</P>
<P>
	A resident near the crash site, Kerry Clark, said he ran to the  
scene and found three dazed, injured men trying to get away from 
the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	After he heard a popping noise, he said an agent identified all  
three as being with the ATF and warned that the fire was setting 
off ammunition aboard the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	He said one man with an injured leg was trying to pull the other  
two away from the plane. Clark said he then pulled all three to a 
grouping of trees, which shielded them. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark and his son covered the three with blankets until help  
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	David Hall, a Columbus-based agent who was piloting the plane,  
and Eric Frey, an agent from Cleveland, were in serious condition. 
Roger Guthrie, based in Detroit, was in guarded condition. 
</P>
<P>
	Medina was the most convenient place for Hall to pick up Frey on  
the way to Louisiana, Berarducci said.

	Jordan's King Hussein Dies  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- King Hussein of Jordan, who became a key  
force for stability in the turbulent Middle East in more than four 
decades as ruler of his strategically placed nation, died today 
following a battle with cancer. He was 63. The king died at 11:43 
a.m. in his bed at the King Hussein Medical City. Queen Noor and 
Hussein's children were all with him when he died, a senior palace 
source said. The cause of death was heart failure brought on by 
complications from cancer, the official said. 

</P>
<P>
	Hussein's Son Becomes New King  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Crown Prince Abdullah was sworn in as king  
today as mosque loudspeakers began sounding verses from the Koran, 
the Muslim holy book, in a sign of mourning. Lawmakers wore their 
red keffiyehs wrapped around their faces in a traditional show of 
sorrow. Intoning the same words his father had customarily used for 
such addresses, Abdullah called on ``my family and my tribe'' to be 
loyal. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Mourns King Hussein's Death  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said he and first lady  
Hillary Rodham Clinton were ``deeply saddened'' by the news of King 
Hussein's death. The president praised the king for ``a rare kind 
of courage to be a peacemaker -- the courage to learn from the past 
and imagine a better future. When peace finally comes to the Middle 
East, his name will be inscribed upon it.'' Clinton will leave 
Washington later today to attend the funeral. The first lady, who 
left late last night on a trip to the Netherlands, was expected to 
meet the president in Jordan.

	Kosovo Peace Talks Continue  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Yugoslav Serbs and Kosovo Albanians  
continued peace negotiations here today, even as new violence 
rocked the war-torn province. A bomb exploded outside an ethnic 
Albanian-owned vegetable market in Pristina yesterday, killing 
three people, witnesses said. The two sides are under international 
pressure to make peace in just two weeks. Negotiators are working 
on a framework plan that calls for a three-year period of autonomy 
for Kosovo, maintenance of Serb territorial integrity, protection 
of minorities and a police force that reflects the ethnic 
community.

	Senate Sees Lewinsky Testimony  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parts of Monica Lewinsky's videotaped  
testimony were aired on the Senate floor yesterday and a senior 
Democrat said he might vote to convict the president, just two 
weeks after calling to dismiss the case. In an ABC interview to be 
aired today, Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said there is ``no doubt 
about it in my mind'' that the charges against Clinton rise to 
``high crime and misdemeanors.'' But he declined to say how he will 
vote on conviction. There was no indication that Ms. Lewinsky's 
testimony had shaken the prospects for Clinton's expected acquittal 
on the two articles of impeachment by the end of the week. The 
trial is scheduled to resume tomorrow at 1 p.m. EST.

	NASA To Launch Comet-Chasing Rocket  
</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA has tentatively rescheduled the  
launch of its comet-chasing Stardust spacecraft for this afternoon 
after an alarm went off just before a rocket was to blast off 
yesterday. The Boeing Delta rocket was scheduled to lift off at 
4:06 p.m. EST yesterday. With less than two minutes remaining in 
the countdown, however, sporadic dips in current were detected from 
the rocket radar beacon and a red alarm went off. NASA has only one 
second each day, through Feb. 25, to launch Stardust to Comet 
Wild-2. The spacecraft is supposed to meet up with the comet in 
2004 and bring back samples of the comet in 2006. It is the first 
U.S. mission devoted to a comet.

	Philippines Says Rape Cases Rising  
</P>
<P>
	MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A worsening drug problem and the  
proliferation of businesses catering to sex produced a record high 
number of rapes in the Philippines last year, a lawmaker said 
today. Sen. Loren Legarda said 3,031 rape cases were reported to 
the Philippine National Police last year. Since 1990, rape cases 
have increased by nearly 70 percent, she said. The number of actual 
rapes is believed to be even higher because many are not reported 
to authorities.

	Hingis Wins Pan Pacific Open  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Martina Hingis, fresh from regaining the No. 1  
ranking the previous day, routed Amanda Coetzer 6-2, 6-1 today to 
capture the Toray Pan Pacific Open. Hingis moved ahead of Lindsay 
Davenport at the top of the rankings after beating Jana Novotna 
yesterday's semifinals. Davenport grabbed top ranking last October.

<HEADLINE> Pebble Beach Pro-Am Notebook  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE, Calif. (AP) -- Based on a tiebreaker formula, pro Frank  
Lickliter and investment banker Robert MacDonnell were declared 
winners of the Pro-Am division at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	The team finished with a 22-under 194 after three rounds.  
</P>
<P>
	Craig Stadler and singer Glenn Frey, and the pairing of Neal  
Lancaster and financial consultant Bob Scott also shot 194s, but 
the tiebreaker formula gave priority to Lickliter's team because he 
had the best 54-hole score of the three pros with 207. 
</P>
<P>
	The final round of the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am was  
called off Sunday because the greens were flooded by heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-five amateurs had made the cut for the final round,  
including baseball players Orel Hershiser and Ken Griffey, Jr., and 
singer Glen Campbell. Sally Krueger of San Francisco, one of two 
women entered in the event, also made the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Krueger and her husband, who serves as her caddie, tried to wait  
out the rain for a time in the contestant's room. She had made it 
to the fifth tee Sunday before play was suspended. 
</P>
<P>
	``They squeegeed the fourth hole for us,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	Actors Bill Murray and Samuel L. Jackson, crowd favorites at  
this year's tournament, and Andy Garcia, who won the pro-am 
division with pro Paul Stankowski in 1997, did not make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Actor Jack Lemmon missed the cut for the estimated 25th time.  
</P>
<P>
	``We'll be back next year,'' pro partner Peter Jacobsen said.  
</P>
<P>
	Cy Young Award-winner Roger Clemens, who also failed to make the  
cut, hit the only hole-in-one of the event on Saturday on the No. 
17 hole at Poppy Hills. It was the first time he had played the 
course and the wet and windy conditions were not in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pumped,'' he said. ``On a day like this you're just  
grinding it out. I got so excited it made my heart sink into my 
stomach.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THE DIE HARDS:* Crowds were sparse for the final round of the  
AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am on Sunday, with only true-blue 
golf fans braving the wind and rain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think the heavy stuff is going to come down for  
awhile,'' fan Wayne Miller said, mimicking a line from the movie 
``Caddyshack'' as rain dripped off the bill of his baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Play was suspended at 9:30 a.m. PST. Scoreboards on the scenic  
coastal course flashed: ``Play has been temporarily suspended! 
Thank you, PGA Tour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fans huddled under trees, tents and umbrellas. The corporate  
tents on the No. 3 hole were filled, as were the posh shops at The 
Lodge at Pebble Beach. Workers in a groundskeeper's shack drank 
sodas as golf carts loaded with squeegees and green blowers waited 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS employee Vinnie Fugett's umbrella blew inside-out in a gust  
of wind and he was soaked. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do I look good or what?'' Fugett said as he passed in a golf  
cart with his irreparable umbrella. ``This was actually a 
full-blown umbrella at one time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About an hour later, it appeared play would resume. Marshals  
massed at the first tee. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's go! Let's go! We're going to play!'' Marshal Craig Van  
Keafer shouted to his co-workers on the first tee. 
</P>
<P>
	But play was not started. The rain was falling more heavily than  
before, and the No. 14 and No. 15 holes were swamped. Sand traps 
along the course were more like quicksand. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m., the final round was finally called off, and Payne  
Stewart, the leader after 54-holes, was declared the winner. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the second year in a row!'' said one fan, who waited in  
the rain for nearly five hours for tournament officials to announce 
their decision. ``Next year I'm staying home and watching it from 
the couch.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *DIVOTS:* R.J. Harper, the director for golf at Pebble Beach,  
said the tournament's jinx over the past several years is 
uncharacteristic. Usually, the course shuts down only three or four 
days a year to rain. ``It looks like it rains here all the time -- 
but it doesn't,'' he said. ... Tournament runner-up Frank 
Lickliter, who shot a 207 after three rounds, said he would have 
played if given the choice. ``I feel like I'm kind of a mudder and 
I think the rain and the win would have probably been to my 
advantage today.''

<HEADLINE> Polite Teens Charged in Robbery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- Two teen-age girls charged with robbery  
were extraordinarily polite, so polite they got caught. 
</P>
<P>
	The girls walked into a shoe store Thursday and asked employee  
Sonya Graham for a pen and paper. One wrote a note, then handed it 
to the worker, saying, ``I'm sorry to do this. You're so nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The note said: ``I have a gun in my pants, give me all the  
money.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You came at a bad time,'' the worker said. ``I have a customer  
to wait on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The would-be robbers offered to wait, police said, so the worker  
walked to the back of the store and triggered the store's silent 
alarm system. She then went back to the counter and stalled the 
suspects until police arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were real nice,'' said police Lt. Roy Williams, adding  
that the girls were armed with a toy cap pistol. ``They probably 
haven't done this before.''

<HEADLINE> White House Outlines Anti-Drug Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) --The Clinton administration is announcing a  
five-part plan designed to cut the nation's drug problem in half by 
2007, with the focus on repairing programs that are not working and 
giving a boost to those that do. 
</P>
<P>
	With a nationwide effort that includes nearly $18 billion to be  
spent this year by the federal government, White House drug policy 
director Barry McCaffrey wants the nation's children to be the 
focal point for the drive against drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House ``seeks to involve parents, coaches, mentors,  
teachers, clergy and other role models in a broad prevention 
campaign,'' McCaffrey said in a three-volume strategy being sent to 
Capitol Hill today. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, who was presiding at an announcement  
ceremony, said ``this strategy takes us into the next century with 
a goal of dramatic reductions in the supply and demand for drugs 
and a real chance of giving our children drug-free communities in 
which to grow up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a message to Congress, President Clinton said that among the  
positive signs are a growing view among young people that drugs are 
risky and a continuing decline in cocaine production overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Studies demonstrate that when our children understand the  
dangers of drugs, their rates of drug use drop,'' said Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The five parts of the administration plan are educating  
children, decreasing the addicted population, breaking the cycle of 
drugs and crime, securing the nation's borders from drugs and 
reducing the drug supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The blend of strategies is aimed at reducing the use and  
availability of drugs by 25 percent by 2002 and 50 percent by 2007. 
Achieving the goal would mean just 3 percent of the U.S. population 
aged 12 and over would be using illegal drugs. The current figure 
is estimated at 6.4 percent. In 1979, the rate was near 15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional goals for the period ending in 2007 are to reduce by  
30 percent the rate of crime associated with drug trafficking and 
use, and cutting the health and social costs associated with drugs 
by 25 percent. As of 1995, the social costs of drug use were 
estimated at $110 billion, a 64 percent increase over 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	A major piece of the drug-control effort is an advertising  
campaign that generates more than $195 million a year in matching 
contributions from media companies. 
</P>
<P>
	A cornerstone of the strategy is accountability for the wide  
array of current anti-drug programs, with boosts for those that 
work and the ability to identify swiftly and repair those that 
aren't producing results. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, Congress had been critical because there were no  
specific measurements for success,'' said Bob Weiner, a spokesman 
for McCaffrey. ``There was some real heat in the government'' 
resisting demands for accountability, but ``no longer do we only 
measure the people working the issue and the dollars spent on it. 
Now you've got to prove bang for the buck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While head of the U.S. Southern Command as an Army general,  
McCaffrey saw first hand in South America how some U.S. approaches 
to drug control succeed where others fail. 
</P>
<P>
	Over a decade or more, some $700 million was spent on  
counter-narcotics aid in Bolivia, with no significant reduction in 
cocaine cultivation, said Pancho Kinney, deputy director for 
strategy in McCaffrey's office. 
</P>
<P>
	When another approach was used starting in 1995, success was  
immediate and has continued, Kinney added. Under the strategy, the 
U.S. military passes along information about drug-carrying 
aircraft, which then would be intercepted by air forces of Colombia 
and Peru.

<HEADLINE> Official: Japan Poised for Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's top economic official said Sunday that the  
Japanese economy hit bottom last fall and will pick up in the 
second half of the fiscal year starting in April, local media 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the worst period came late last September and  
October,'' Economic Planning Agency head Taichi Sakaiya was quoted 
by Kyodo News agency as having said on a debate program aired by 
national broadcaster NHK. 
</P>
<P>
	While the economy remains at a standstill, Sakaiya said he  
expects it to turn up in the last six months of fiscal 1999, led by 
increased personal consumption and housing investment. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said there is a ``strong likelihood'' the economy will  
reach the government's growth target of 0.5 percent for the fiscal 
year ending in March 2000, adding growth may actually surpass that 
projection, Kyodo said. 
</P>
<P>
	The EPA's official 0.5 percent growth forecast -- the lowest  
initial target set since World War II -- has been widely criticized 
as overly optimistic by private sector economists. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's revised economic projection for the current  
fiscal year ending calls for a decrease of 2.2 percent.

<HEADLINE> Dog Judging at Westminster Not Easy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When the Westminster Kennel Club Show opens, the  
dogs and their handlers won't be the only ones under scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
	Westminster is the most prestigious dog show in North America.  
And if only the best get to compete, then only the best get to 
judge them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here you have all the best dogs in any given breed,'' said Bob  
Smith, one of fewer than 30 judges accredited by the American 
Kennel Club to judge all breeds. ``You're under some pressure to 
prove yourself an authority on that breed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-two men and women from among the 3,500 AKC-accredited  
judges will dole out the honors Monday and Tuesday at Madison 
Square Garden for the 123rd edition of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	Dogs of 152 individual breeds will be judged during the two  
days. The breed groups -- working, sporting, herding, terrier, toy, 
hound and non-sporting -- are judged each night. The climax is the 
best-in-show presentation Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Some judges arrived early to do some homework Friday and  
Saturday at the annual symposium of the Dog Judges Association of 
America. For 26 years, the organization has held seminars before 
each Westminster to help judges interpret the AKC's standards for 
each breed. 
</P>
<P>
	Westminster is a contest of conformation: how well each dog  
meets standards of appearance and temperament as outlined by the 
AKC. Each dog already must been named a champion at prior 
AKC-sanctioned shows. 
</P>
<P>
	That means the more than 2,500 dogs are already at the pinnacle  
of the show world, and those who presume to judge them had better 
know their stuff. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like no other show,'' Smith said. ``A lot of judges  
wouldn't admit it, but it's everybody's ambition to judge at the 
Garden.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is a member of the AKC's board of directors and has been  
judging for nearly 30 years. Like all judges, he had to work his 
way through the ranks from single-breed judge to group judge to 
all-breed judge. 
</P>
<P>
	To become a judge, applicants must have been involved in the  
sport at least 10 years, have bred at least four litters of puppies 
and have finished two champion dogs. There are tests on rules, 
anatomy and breed standard, and finally an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	``You also have to have what the legal trade calls `judicial  
temperament,''' Smith said. ``You have to be decisive -- it helps to 
at least look like you know what you're doing. And you have to have 
an eye for the dogs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After that, it's a matter of reputation. Judges are invited to  
shows, not assigned, and consequently they -- like the dogs -- are 
always being watched to make sure their assessments are fair. 
</P>
<P>
	The judges' association holds its annual seminars to help that  
happen. This year, the group's talks included the differences in 
the three setter breeds -- Irish, Gordon and English -- and 
understanding the still somewhat vague standard for the border 
collie, which has only been recognized by the AKC for four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges' decisions are, inevitably, subjective. While remaining  
within the AKC standard, one might prefer a dog that moves well or 
has a good show personality. 
</P>
<P>
	``All champions aren't equal, of course,'' said group judge  
Dorothy Macdonald, who has been judging since 1976. ``If all judges 
liked the same dog, the entries could come into the computer and 
the ribbons be sent home.''

<HEADLINE> PlayStation Fights To Stay on Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FOSTER CITY, Calif. (AP) -- The Sony PlayStation soared to the  
top of the gaming console industry in less than three years. 
Despite increasing competition, it has plans to stay a while. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the video-game industry, the bar clearly has been raised,''  
said Kazuo Hirai, chief operating officer of the Foster City-based 
Sony Computer Entertainment America and the person who is widely 
credited with the introduction and success of the Sony PlayStation 
that now sits in one out of every six U.S. homes. 
</P>
<P>
	While gaming consoles have historically faded from popularity  
after three years, this year PlayStations will break that trend 
with an array of about 100 cutting edge games and a new, handheld 
PocketStation, Hirai predicted in remarks prepared for analysts at 
the American International Toy Fair in New York on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hirai said that huge holiday PlayStation sales -- more than 4  
million were purchased in the last two months -- has created a 
latent demand for software in the marketplace right now. He's 
planning to meet it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through blockbuster titles for a mainstream audience and a  
vast array of games suited for niche audiences, we are focusing on 
the console as the entertainment medium,'' he said. ``As we have 
done all along, we will continue to increase the value within the 
life cycle of the PlayStation by increasing the level of 
entertainment we bring to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Since their introduction in September 1995, PlayStations have  
enjoyed unprecedented success. They make up more than two-thirds of 
the game console market, with more than 50 million consoles 
worldwide. By the end of this year, owners will have more than 600 
titles to choose from, ranging from cute and cuddly kiddie games to 
ominous shoot-em-up adult killing fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
	The fastest selling product in Sony's 50-year history,  
PlayStations have been trouncing their closest competition, 
Nintendo of America, which came out with the more powerful Nintendo 
64 in 1996. Last year, consumers bought twice as many PlayStations 
as Nintendo 64s as prices on both dropped to $129. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically, Sony has been able to develop the leadership role  
in the game console market through its success in attracting top 
developers and franchises,'' said Kevin Hause, an industry analyst 
with International Data Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sony has also benefited from its corporate expertise in  
branding and marketing, which has made not only the PlayStation a 
success, but also the Walkman and many other products,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	University of California, Santa Cruz senior Christine Candelaria  
was one of millions of Americans to find a PlayStation under her 
Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be the greatest thing that ever happened to me. It's  
amazing, it's crazy, I'm totally addicted,'' said Candelaria, a 
longtime gameplayer. Industry research shows that the reason 
consumers pick the less powerful 32-bit PlayStations over the 
64-bit Nintendo consoles is because they have almost ten times has 
many games to choose from. PlayStation games, starting at $20, cost 
about half that of Nintendo 64. 
</P>
<P>
	But analysts say 1999 is going to be tough for Sony. Nintendo is  
bringing out an array of new sports titles to appeal to adult 
players who have been opting for PlayStations. 
</P>
<P>
	And in November, Sega Enterprises Ltd. and Microsoft Corp. will  
launch the Dreamcast system with a 128-bit processor in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	``PlayStation has been a tremendous achievement for Sony, but I  
think they're pretty close to the peak of their cycle,'' said 
Jeremy Schwartz, senior analyst at Forrester Research Inc. in 
Cambridge, Mass. ``They've enjoyed a combination of good graphics, 
good sounds, low price and for its time it had reasonable 
performance. That could change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This year Sony Computer Entertainment America will introduce the  
PocketStation, a handheld extension of the console. Hirai said he 
hopes the PocketStation, launched in Japan last month, will bring 
even more PlayStation users. The company has also said it is 
developing an updated PlayStation, although no release date has 
been set. 
</P>
<P>
	``We started in an interesting position: we were both David and  
Goliath; the industry newcomer and the corporate giant,'' said 
Hirai. ``In just three years, Sony Computer Entertainment America 
climbed from underdog to top dog.''

<HEADLINE>  King Hussein Dies; Abdullah Crowned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan crowned an untested new monarch  
Sunday and plunged into mourning for its beloved King Hussein. 
Distraught citizens sobbed in the streets and world leaders 
converged on the desert kingdom, united in grief for the statesman 
who built bridges for peace in the turbulent Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	The deep political divides between those planning to attend  
Monday's elaborate state funeral served as a powerful reminder of 
Hussein's far-reaching abilities as a mediator and leader -- skills 
that lifted Jordan into a place of international prominence. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even the sky is crying,'' an announcer on Jordanian television  
declared as a rare, dripping fog shrouded the city after the king 
died at 11:43 a.m. (4:43 a.m. EST) from cancer in a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Black flags fluttered from the few taxicabs plying the streets.  
The wail of Koranic verses of mourning filled the country's mosques 
and residents wept on the sidewalks of Amman, Jordan's hilly 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein, who survived repeated assassination attempts as he  
walked the tightrope of Mideast politics, succumbed after a 
seven-month battle with lymphatic cancer. He had lingered 
unconscious on a respirator for two days after returning home to 
Jordan last week to die. 
</P>
<P>
	Courtiers, Jordanian officials and members of the royal family,  
including his dozen children and his wife, the American-born Queen 
Noor, had kept a vigil at the king's bedside while thousands of 
citizens sobbed at the hospital gates. 
</P>
<P>
	In keeping with Islamic tradition, the funeral will be held  
quickly -- an enormous procession through Amman just 24 hours after 
Hussein's heart gave out. 
</P>
<P>
	The elaborately plotted protocols, although, reflected real-life  
regional tensions. The Israeli delegation, for example, was to be 
kept closer to Western leaders than to leaders from harder-line 
Arab states, palace sources said. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton were  
among those planning to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	Underscoring Jordan's determination that the transition be swift  
and smooth, Hussein's eldest son Abdullah, 37, was sworn in just 
four hours later in parliament. 
</P>
<P>
	Before pledging to do his best to serve the country, the new  
king paused before a life-sized portrait of his father. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is God's judgment and God's will,'' Abdullah, a veteran  
military man but a political novice, told the nation in a televised 
address. ``God have mercy on Hussein the father, the brother, the 
commander and the man ....We will preserve Hussein's legacy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Invoking his father's phrasing, he addressed Jordanians as ``my  
family and my tribe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abdullah's first official decree, issued late Sunday, was to  
name Queen Noor's eldest son, 19-year-old Prince Hamzeh, as crown 
prince. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Abdullah's inexperience may be prompting some quiet  
worries among Jordanians, it also brought recollections that 
Hussein himself ascended the Hashemite throne as a boy of 17. 
</P>
<P>
	The late king had an extraordinarily close personal relationship  
with his people, and word of his death brought an outpouring of 
grief. 
</P>
<P>
	``In my heart he will always be my king,'' said Mohammed Ibrahim  
as flags were lowered in the streets of Amman and portraits of the 
king draped with black. 
</P>
<P>
	In a show of royal solidarity, former Crown Prince Hassan showed  
up at the swearing-in at Abdullah's side. The new king has said 
Hassan will continue to serve as a key adviser. 
</P>
<P>
	Praise for Hussein poured in from around the region and the  
world. Israeli President Ezer Weizman called him ``one of the 
greatest leaders of the 20th century, a brave soldier who fought 
for peace.'' Clinton's homage was simpler: ``I loved him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even some critics showed concern. Syria expressed its ``deep  
sadness,'' while Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi prayed ``to God to 
have mercy on his soul, forgive his sins, overlook his mistakes and 
allow him into paradise.'' Iraq, a sometimes bitter opponent, 
reported the death without comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Serving 46 years as king, the British-educated Hussein was the  
Middle East's longest-surviving monarch, weathering coup attempts 
as he steered a calm and steady course in a volatile corner of the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	He waged war against Israel but eventually grew into a  
pro-Western moderate, ending a long enmity with the Jewish state 
and becoming a champion of Mideast peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Born Nov. 14, 1935, Hussein was a descendent of Hashem,  
great-grandfather of the seventh century Prophet Mohammed of Islam. 
He was crowned king on May 2, 1953, after his father, Talal, 
abdicated because of mental illness. 
</P>
<P>
	The young king's mentor was his grandfather, Abdullah, founder  
of Transjordan, a desert territory carved out by the British. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was he who taught me to understand the minds of my people  
and the intricacies of the Arab world. ... He taught me that above 
all else, a leader's greatest duty is to serve,'' Hussein wrote in 
a 1962 autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he took to the path of peace, Hussein relished his role  
as commander in chief. An accomplished pilot who often took the 
controls of the royal jet or helicopter. The funeral was to feature 
full military honors. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a vigorous appearance and daredevil hobbies that  
included water-skiing and skydiving, Hussein had many health 
problems in later years. He had undergone surgery for a cancerous 
kidney in 1992, and last year he had six months of chemotherapy for 
non-Hodgkins lymphoma at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	During his treatment, Hussein left his hospital bed to help  
mediate the Wye River peace accord between Israel and the 
Palestinians, winning accolades from all sides. 
</P>
<P>
	His last days at the helm of state were turbulent ones. Hussein  
abruptly changed the line of succession in late January before 
last-ditch medical treatment that included a second bone-marrow 
transplant. 
</P>
<P>
	His final decline was shocking to Jordanians, with his relapse  
coming only a week after he had made a triumphant return home. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein's first two marriages ended in divorce. His third wife  
died in a 1977 helicopter crash. In 1978 he married Lisa Halaby, a 
Lebanese-American who took the name Noor al-Hussein -- light of 
Hussein.

<HEADLINE> Diet May Help Lower Blood Pressure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A new study indicates that high blood pressure  
can be lowered significantly with a healthy diet and without the 
need for hypertension medication, particularly among blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are talking about a diet with the potential of preventing  
and treating hypertension and doing it particularly well in people 
at risk,'' said Dr. Laura Svetkey, associate professor of medicine 
at Duke University Medical Center and lead author of the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers reached their conclusions, published in Monday's  
edition of the Archives of Internal Medicine, after examining the 
effects of three dietary patterns on blood pressure in 459 adults 
with normal-but-high to high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Participants in the eight-week study were required to be free of  
all hypertension medications and were randomly assigned to one of 
the three diets. 
</P>
<P>
	The diets included one with a nutrient composition typical of  
that consumed by most Americans; one that was rich in fruits and 
vegetables; and a third low-fat, low-cholesterol diet -- the 
so-called DASH diet -- contained fruits, vegetables and low-fat 
dairy foods, as well as an increase in protein. 
</P>
<P>
	Black participants who were on the DASH diet saw their blood  
pressure decrease by an average of 13.2/6.1 points. Whites on the 
diet saw their blood pressure decrease an average of 6.3/4.4 points, 
according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
	Anything greater than 140/90 -- the ratio of systolic to  
diastolic pressure -- is considered high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty percent of the participants were black, 34 percent were  
white and 6 percent were of other races. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers say they wanted a majority of black participants  
because studies have shown that blacks are about 40 percent more 
likely than whites to have high blood pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	Blacks also tend to develop it earlier and more severely,  
according to authors of the study, ``Dietary Approaches to Stop 
Hypertension,'' or DASH. 
</P>
<P>
	High blood pressure is a major threat to heart function that  
affects about 50 million adults in the United States.

<HEADLINE> El Nino May Be 15,000 Years Old </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- It turns out the child is no kid.  
</P>
<P>
	El Nino has been causing climatic chaos going back at least  
15,000 years, according to scientists who have unearthed clues to 
its prehistoric presence in the mud of a South American lake. 
</P>
<P>
	By looking at rain-induced erosion in sediment layers,  
scientists found signs of El Nino as far back as 15,000 years. But 
the phenomenon became more frequent beginning 5,000 years ago, 
appearing in its modern-day cycle of every two to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't say much about how big these events were,'' said  
geology professor Donald Rodbell of Union College in Schenectady, 
who reported on the team's findings in the Jan. 22 issue of Science 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is really the intervals we can address. If this proves  
accurate, we will be able to come up with a real birthday for our 
modern El Nino,'' Rodbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	A periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Peru  
and Ecuador, El Nino wreaks climatic havoc across the globe. The 
1997-98 El Nino, the strongest ever recorded, created record 
rainfall in California, heavy flooding in Peru, drought and 
wildfires in Indonesia, and tornadoes and flooding in the Southeast 
states. It was blamed for 23,000 deaths and $33 billion in damages 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The phenomenon takes its name from the Spanish words for the  
Christ child and is so named because the warm waters typically 
reach South America around Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all its headlines, El Nino is little understood.  
Although theories about the relationship between ocean temperatures 
and atmospheric conditions first were proposed in the 1930s, El 
Nino has been studied in earnest only since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The earliest documentation of El Nino comes from the diaries and  
writings of 15th-century colonists in Ecuador and Peru. Coral, ice 
corings, tree rings and flood deposits have suggested that the 
weather phenomenon is much more ancient, although the evidence was 
always isolated or disconnected. Scientists have been looking for 
tangible proof. 
</P>
<P>
	The sediment provides the first continuous record showing El  
Nino has been occurring regularly for dozens of centuries, said 
Rodbell and colleague Geoffrey Seltzer, an earth sciences professor 
at Syracuse University. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard University paleoclimatologist Konrad Hughen said the  
discovery could be an important development if it proves accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	The news also excited Michael McPhaden, a senior research  
scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 
Pacific Marine Laboratory in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you find a clear signal, it's pretty important. Any time  
you develop an older record of El Ninos, you have a better chance 
of adding to our understanding of El Nino,'' said McPhaden, who led 
a team that studied last year's El Nino through a network of buoys 
in the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real benefit from a record like this is that we can see in  
detail how El Nino's frequency has changed over the years. That 
means someday, maybe, being able to predict when it will occur,'' 
said Art DeGaetano, a meteorologist at Cornell University's 
Northeast Regional Climate Center. 
</P>
<P>
	To learn more about El Nino's history, Rodbell and Seltzer went  
to Lake Pallcachocha, a glacial lake high in the Andes in southern 
Ecuador and about 75 kilometers from the Pacific Ocean where 
warming sea surface temperatures first announce the birth of El 
Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	A scientific team studied a 30-foot core sample from the bottom  
of the lake, looking for fragments of vegetation that were washed 
into the water from the surrounding landscape during the torrential 
rain storms associated with El Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	After finding that the sediment record from 1800 to 1976 closely  
matched the occurrence of El Ninos during that time, researchers 
knew they had an exciting discovery, Rodbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sediment revealed that El Nino-like events began occurring  
about 15,000 years ago but at irregular cycles ranging from 15 to 
70 years, Rodbell said. About 7,000 years ago, the cycles began to 
shorten and become more regular until reaching its present pattern 
about 2,000 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gifford Miller, a leading paleoclimatologist from the  
University of Colorado-Boulder, said it's unlikely that modern El 
Nino will turn out to be much older. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many reasons to suspect that El Nino may not have  
been in operation prior to that,'' said Miller, presently on 
sabbatical in Australia. ``Sea surface temperatures then were 
lower, oceanic surface water circulation was different and sea 
levels were much lower because much ocean water was still locked in 
the ice sheets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Rodbell nor Seltzer is ready to say yet what has driven  
the change, whether it has been global warming, a popularly 
advanced theory, or other variables. 
</P>
<P>
	``The climate system is so enormously complicated that it's very  
difficult to point a finger at one factor. We don't know the answer 
yet,'' Rodbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Rodbell and Seltzer will return to Ecuador with a  
National Science Foundation grant to duplicate their study in other 
lakes and hopefully confirm El Nino's age. More samples also may 
give more clues to what has caused Nino's increased frequency. It 
might raise more questions, too.

<HEADLINE> A Dark Day for German Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Some called it a debacle. Others were stunned.  
Franz Beckenbauer said the loss points to a generational crisis in 
German soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Swift and undisguised anger across Germany followed the national  
team's 3-0 loss to the United States on Saturday in Jacksonville, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``After I heard that the score is 3-0 I thought this can't be  
true,'' said German captain, Oliver Bierhoff, who didn't accompany 
the three-time world champions on their U.S. tour. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the U.S. team's first win over Germany in four games  
between the nations. Eight months earlier, the European champions 
pummeled the Americans 2-0 in the World Cup opener for both 
nations. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the World Cup, Germany won a pair of exhibition  
games played in the United States in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``A debacle in every way -- when did a German team ever get beat  
that badly?'' asked ZDF, a top German TV station on Sunday while 
trying to examine the loss. 
</P>
<P>
	Added U.S. goalie Tony Meola: ``Germany doesn't lose 3-0 to  
anyone, anywhere very often. Around the world people will take 
notice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some called it the low point in the country's long history as a  
soccer superpower. 
</P>
<P>
	``It can't get any worse than this -- 0-3 against the United  
States,'' was the headline of the Berlin daily, Der Tagesspiegel. 
</P>
<P>
	The match was just an exhibition. But Germans do not take kindly  
to losing even those sorts of games. After all, between 1974 and 
1990, Germany reached four of six World Cup finals. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the first time since 1954, we have a generation problem,''  
said Beckenbauer, an icon in German soccer. ``On our national team 
we only have average players. If you can't play soccer, then that's 
got nothing to do with tactics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That the three American goals were scored by players from German  
clubs -- Jovan Kirovski, Claudio Reyna and Tony Sanneh -- was of 
little consolation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't watch this anymore,'' said Michael Braun, a Berlin  
school teacher. ``The Germans have never been this bad. If they 
keep playing like this, no one will care anymore.''

<HEADLINE> Lott Faces Big Challenge This Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Credited for fostering communication between  
Republicans and Democrats in trying times, Senate Majority Leader 
Trent Lott faces his biggest challenge in the finale of the 
impeachment trial. He must keep peace among the factions in his own 
party as senators weigh an alternative punishment for President 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know there are many people on the Republican side who oppose  
censure,'' warned Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, one of the most vocal 
opponents of an idea that most Democrats and some Republicans have 
touted for punishing Clinton if he is acquitted as expected at the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott's stewardship of the second presidential impeachment trial  
in America's history has long been viewed as a make-or-break 
opportunity for Lott to emerge from the long shadows Newt Gingrich 
and to assert himself as leader of the Republican Party. 
</P>
<P>
	So far he gets high marks from senators or both parties for  
striving to keep open communications between Democrats and 
Republicans -- and keep the trial from dissolving into a partisan 
free-for-all. He's also kept to his original schedule to end the 
unpopular trial by mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are really still trying to be fair to all sides, and that's  
a real challenge,'' Lott told reporters two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lott's stature, in the end, will be influenced by how the  
trial ends. With 19 GOP senators facing re-election in 2000 -- 13 of 
whom reside in states carried by Clinton in 1996 -- his resolution 
of the proceeding may also prove crucial to his party's future. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Senate heads toward acquitting Clinton on perjury and  
obstruction of justice charges, Republicans are sharply divided 
over how to rebuke him. Democrats, meanwhile, are shopping around 
language that would condemn Clinton's efforts to cover up an affair 
with Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Moderate Republicans are expressing favor for voting on such a  
censure proposal after the trial ends. ``I would not foreclose on 
censure,'' said Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, whose own idea for a 
more harsh ``findings of fact'' against the president before the 
trial ends has been rejected by her own party . 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope we can make some progress on that,'' Sen. John Chafee,  
R-R.I., said of censure. ``But there is some opposition to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That opposition comes chiefly from conservatives, who until now  
Lott has accommodated by insisting on a final up-or-down vote on 
the articles of impeachment. Publicly opposed to censure on 
constitutional grounds, many conservatives say privately they 
dislike the proposal because it would give political cover to GOP 
senators who vote to acquit. And that could mean more votes to 
acquit than there might be otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am adamantly opposed to censure...I just think it is very  
bad public policy,'' DeWine said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who is influential among his party's  
conservatives, has all but threatened to stage a filibuster to keep 
a vote on censure from coming to the Senate floor. 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to the trial, Lott's most notable work since becoming the  
Senate leader in 1996 was his handling of tobacco legislation, 
which failed to gain passage. Those who know him say the tobacco 
experience weighs heavily. 
</P>
<P>
	So does Gingrich's political demise. The Georgia Republican, who  
steered the GOP to control of Congress for the first time in 40 
years, stepped down three days after the party lost House seats in 
the November election. Party leaders blamed the losses on his 
mishandling of impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott enters the final trial period having doled out political  
favors to both moderates and conservatives. He granted Snowe and 
others the chance to explore a ``finding of fact'' that would 
condemn Clinton's behavior without convicting and removing him from 
office -- despite Lott's own personal opposition to the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	And he has stuck steadfastly to allowing the House prosecutors  
to depose witnesses and to continuing the trial until the Senate 
votes up or down on each article of impeachment, as conservatives 
demanded. 
</P>
<P>
	All along, he has kept the lines of communication open with his  
Democratic counterpart, Minority Leader Tom Daschle -- even when the 
votes fell along partisan lines. The finding of fact, for example, 
died for lack of Democratic support. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Sen. Daschle and Sen. Lott deserve a lot of credit,''  
said Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. ``Particularly Sen. Lott. He has 
not had a united caucus.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``That's been swirling around here for a year, that Lott's  
standing is in danger,'' added Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. ``But I 
don't think Lott's standing has been hurt by this trial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Lott's leadership came in for criticism from some corners  
of his party. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think we made a mistake weeks ago in raising expectations,  
and telling people we were all going to go skipping along here 
together like there wouldn't be any differences,'' said Sen. 
Charles Hagel, R-Neb. who made a bid for the GOP leadership last 
year. ``This is a political process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have permitted witnesses...that's the way a trial  
works normally,'' said Sen. Kit Bond, R-Mo. ``But then again, I 
don't want Sen. Lott's job.''

<HEADLINE> Sens. Seek Blumenthal Perjury Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Journalist Christopher Hitchens said Sunday  
that presidential aide Sidney Blumenthal told him and other 
reporters: ``Monica Lewinsky was a stalker.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchens' televised comments, elaborating on his affidavit that  
House impeachment managers released Saturday, prompted several 
Democratic and Republican senators to demand Sunday that the 
Justice Department investigate whether Blumenthal committed perjury 
by denying he spread the story. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will insist that we have an expedited consideration by the  
Justice Department,'' Republican Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas said. 
Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, said ``certainly the truth should be 
uncovered with respect to whether or not Sidney Blumenthal told the 
truth under oath.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony at the Senate impeachment trial and to prosecutor  
Kenneth Starr's grand jury, Blumenthal denied passing to the news 
media President Clinton's assertion to Blumenthal that Ms. Lewinsky 
made sexual demands. 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to Hitchens, Blumenthal issued a statement Sunday  
that focused on a part of his testimony in which he said he spoke 
of Ms. Lewinsky to ``friends.'' That category, the statement said, 
included Hitchens. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw'' Blumenthal ``for the first time since the scandal  
broke, that's what he said to me and to my wife and has said to 
many other people, that Monica Lewinsky was a stalker,'' Hitchens 
said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hitchens also said that in the same conversation, Blumenthal  
said ``some ... unpleasant things about poor Kathleen Willey,'' the 
former White House volunteer who alleged Clinton made an unwanted 
sexual advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal said, according to Hitchens, that Mrs. Willey's poll  
``numbers are high now after the accusations she's made, but they 
won't be so high later on.'' Following Mrs. Willey's televised 
accusations, the White House released cordial correspondence 
between the Richmond, Va., woman and the president from the years 
after the time she alleged the incident with Clinton happened. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan predicted a Justice  
Department inquiry into whether Blumenthal lied, and Democrats 
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut and Jay Rockefeller of West 
Virginia said there should be a probe. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Sen. Diane Feinstein of California said, ``I would  
hope that he isn't lying. I think if he is, it's serious. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one of the most difficult parts of this for me has  
been the concept of Monica Lewinsky'' being called ``a stalker, 
because that has a certain diabolical ring to it,'' Feinstein said. 
Spreading such derogatory information, she said, ``isn't a nice 
thing to do.'' 

</P>
<P>
	Feinstein, Gramm, Snowe, Lieberman and Rockefeller appeared on  
NBC. Levin appeared on Fox News Sunday. 

</P>
<P>
	Blumenthal's lawyer, William McDaniel, issued a statement  
quoting the presidential aide as saying ``I was never a source for 
any story about Monica Lewinsky's personal life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I did not reveal what the president told me to any reporter.  
As I testified to the Senate I talked every day about the stories 
in the news concerning Miss Lewinsky to my friends and family, just 
as everyone else is doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Though I do not recall the luncheon with my then-friend of 15  
years Christopher Hitchens and his wife, the notion that I was 
trying to plant a story with this rabid anti-Clinton friend is 
absurd. My wife and I are saddened that Christopher has chosen to 
end our friendship in this meaningless way.''

<HEADLINE> In-Line Skaters Prone to Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In in-line skating, pride goes literally  
before a fall. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey finds injuries are more common among more experienced  
skaters, who also are more likely than beginners to try risky 
stunts and to forgo protective gear. 
</P>
<P>
	``The beginners had better safety habits,'' said Dr. Richard M.  
Seldes, an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital of the University of 
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. ``As a skater learned to skate and 
became more comfortable with their ability, they dropped the gear 
and started doing these tricks, and as a result were getting 
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seldes bases this on questionnaires distributed in six cities  
where in-line skating is popular. Between August 1996 and February 
1997, researchers interviewed 938 randomly chosen skaters ages 18 
or older, in New York, Philadelphia, Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles 
and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The skaters were asked about any injuries, what safety equipment  
they wore, how often and how far they skated, the sites in which 
they skated, and whether they did tricks or stunts. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 11 percent of skaters reported having had an injury in  
the past year. The most common body part hurt was the wrist with 15 
percent of all injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common types of injuries, at 19 percent each, were  
fractures and bruises. Sixty-five percent of all injuries required 
medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most commonly injured skater was a self-reported expert  
with more than one year of skating experience,'' said the report in 
the American Journal of Public Health. And those who skated more 
than 10 hours a week had four times the injury risk of those who 
skated only one or two hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 6 percent of all in-line skaters consistently wore all four  
types of safety equipment -- helmets and elbow, knee and wrist 
guards, the study found. Skaters who considered themselves expert 
were more likely to wear less equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, the most common causes of injuries were collisions or  
attempting to avoid collisions (26 percent) and falls while 
attempting tricks (21 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	Skating on streets and park paths was most common, and skating  
in an area with railings, ramps and ledges was least common, with 
only 2 percent of skaters saying this was their usual location. But 
skating in the areas with the railings, ramps and ledges was 8.5 
times more likely to result in an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The pattern indicates that the better skaters might not be as  
good as they think they are, Seldes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are in line with earlier research at the federal  
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ``In our initial work, 
it seems the people who consider themselves experts were more 
likely to attempt tricks,'' said Dr. Christine M. Branche, director 
of the Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention. The tricks may 
account for a higher level of injuries, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the CDC study, published in 1996 in the New England Journal  
of Medicine, the most common falls involved starting skaters 
wearing little or no safety gear who simply lost their balance or 
fell after running into a road defect or debris. The study 
underlined the overriding need to wear safety equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the CDC study relied on data from injuries severe  
enough to require a visit to a hospital emergency room. The authors 
of the new study felt their database was potentially broader, 
because they could include injuries that were not so severe. 
</P>
<P>
	Another expert also believes certain novices to be more at risk.  
``They are the people who have never taken a lesson and didn't wear 
protective gear,'' said Kalinda Mathis, executive director of the 
International In-line Skating Association in Wilmington, N.C., an 
industry group. But experience is not the same as skill, and some 
of the more experienced skaters might not have built skills by 
taking lessons, either, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone needs lessons; it's a lifelong thing,'' said Kris  
Simeone, a Cleveland-based instructor and director of the trade 
group's instructor certification program. Everyone also needs 
safety gear, she said: ``Skaters that come to our program 
understand the importance of gear and wear it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the sport itself is not all that dangerous, the  
association said. It cites 1996 figures from the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission showing that, while skating participants rose 20 
percent in 1996, injuries rose only 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> Missing Boys Safe at Idaho Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDPOINT, Idaho (AP) -- Five teen-age boys who spent the night  
lost on a northern Idaho ski resort that was raked by a snowstorm 
were safe Sunday after three found their way home and two were 
spotted by snowmobilers. 
</P>
<P>
	The rescuers on snowmobiles found the two teen-age brothers, who  
are from Canada, in good condition Sunday afternoon at Schweitzer 
Mountain ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
	Rescuers said the brothers, age 13 and 15, appeared to be OK.  
</P>
<P>
	``The younger boy possibly has frostbitten hands,'' one searcher  
said over two-way radio. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, wind gusts of up to 50 mph combined with 18 inches  
of new snow to create extreme avalanche danger and snow drifts up 
to 10 feet high. Temperatures at the base of the resort dipped to 
23 degrees overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Three teen-age boys -- all 15 and part of a separate skiing party  
from the Canadian brothers-- trekked through waist-deep snow to get 
to safety Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they had been snowboarding and had not seen  
out-of-bound signs. They spent the night inside a snow cave they 
had built as refuge against an overnight storm and started walking 
downhill around dawn. 
</P>
<P>
	The three had been on an outing with a church group from  
Spokane, Wash., about 70 miles southwest of here, and said they 
followed train whistles to find the base of the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	They eventually reached the home of Bill Finley, a member of the  
sheriff's search and rescue team who was home sick. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were soaked clear through and shaking,'' said Finley.  
``Their hands were pure white.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonner County sheriff's Cpl. Bob Howard said the three boys were  
suffering from frostbite and one was ``pretty ill.'' They were 
taken to a hospital in Sandpoint for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schweitzer resort has more than 2,400 acres of ski runs and  
is located in the Selkirk Mountains. The peaks near the resort 
exceed 6,000 feet.

	World Mourns Loss of Jordan's King  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Praise for King Hussein poured in from  
around the Mideast and world on Sunday as news of his death from 
cancer spread. Israeli President Ezer Weizman called him ``one of 
the greatest leaders of the 20th century, a brave soldier who 
fought for peace.'' President Clinton's homage was simpler: ``I 
loved him.'' In Jordan, Hussein's eldest son Abdullah, 37, was 
sworn in just four hours after the death. In accordance to Islamic 
tradition, Hussein's funeral will be held Monday and is expected to 
draw past and present world leaders.

charges against Clinton are in deep trouble and acquittal seems 
virtually assured. Clinton will be in Jordan for the funeral of 
King Hussein during Monday's proceedings.

	Jordan's King Hussein Dies  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- King Hussein of Jordan died today following  
a battle with cancer. He was 63. Hussein became a key force for 
stability in the turbulent Middle East in more than four decades as 
ruler of his strategically placed nation. In Amman, mosque 
loudspeakers began sounding verses from the Koran, the Muslim holy 
book, in a sign of mourning. People scurried, sobbing, through 
rain-soaked streets. The king died at 11:43 a.m. in his bed at the 
King Hussein Medical City. Jordan's Cabinet immediately met and 
proclaimed Crown Prince Abdullah king, a day after he was named 
regent. Abdullah was to be sworn in before Parliament later today. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Says Hussein Was Peacemaker  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton praised the late King  
Hussein of Jordan for ``a rare kind of courage to be a peacemaker'' 
and said he ``will smile on us one more time'' when the Middle East 
finally is at peace. In a statement, the president praised the king 
for ``a rare kind of courage to be a peacemaker -- the courage to 
learn from the past and imagine a better future. When peace finally 
comes to the Middle East, his name will be inscribed upon it. That 
day, King Hussein will smile on us one more time.'' The White House 
said details about Clinton attending the funeral were being worked 
out.

	Byrd Says He Might Vote To Convict  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just two weeks after calling for a motion to  
dismiss the case against President Clinton, Sen. Robert C. Byrd, 
D-W.Va., said that he might vote to convict. In an ABC interview, 
Byrd said there is ``no doubt about it in my mind'' that the 
charges against Clinton rise to ``high crime and misdemeanors.'' 
But he declined to say how he will vote on conviction. ``It will be 
very difficult to stand and say 'not guilty,' very difficult,'' 
Byrd said. Senators got a chance to watch parts of Monica 
Lewinsky's videotaped deposition yesterday. The trial is scheduled

	Kosovo Peace Talks Open in France  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- The real negotiating at the Kosovo  
peace talks begins today. Yugoslav Serbs and Kosovo Albanians sat 
down at the negotiating table yesterday, faced with intense 
international pressure to make peace in two weeks. Despite NATO's 
threat to unleash its missiles and bombs if all parties did not 
start talking by yesterday, Serb officials delayed the ethnic 
Albanians' departure from Kosovo and let it be known they would not 
negotiate with ``terrorists,'' as they call the Kosovo Liberation 
Army rebels. In the end, all parties turned up -- at least for the 
opening session.

	China Releases Dissident From Jail  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese authorities have granted early release to  
a veteran democracy activist imprisoned after the government 
crushed pro-democracy protests in 1989, a human rights group said 
today. Sun Weibang, 57, was released Thursday from Weifang prison 
in eastern Shandong province, having served nearly 10 years of a 
12-year sentence, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human 
Rights and Democratic Movement in China said. Sun's release comes 
amid an aggressive government crackdown on dissent that has seen 
other democracy campaigners given lengthy jail terms in recent 
months.

	SANDPOINT, Idaho (AP) -- Five teen-age boys were reported missing  
yesterday in blizzard conditions at Idaho's Schweitzer Mountain ski 
resort. The ski patrol began a search for the boys about 4:30 p.m., 
but called off the effort hours later because of an avalanche 
threat created by heavy snowfall and wind gusts up to 50 mph, 
Bonner County sheriff's Cpl. Bob Howard said. A ground search was 
expected to resume in the morning, weather permitting, he said.

	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Charles Barkley had eight of his 18  
points during a 15-0 run in the fourth quarter and rookie Cuttino 
Mobley hit a decisive 3-pointer with 20 seconds left as the Houston

Scottie Pippen added 17 points, Mobley had 13 in his NBA debut and 
Hakeem Olajuwon 12 for Houston. Barkley added 20 rebounds. John 
Starks had 15 points in his first game for the Warriors. The 
Warriors led 73-64 entering the fourth quarter after building a 
12-point lead late in the third period, and were up 77-66 when 
Houston began its run.

<HEADLINE> OSU Commits Recruiting Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Ohio State's athletics department is  
reviewing recruiting violations committed by two assistant football 
coaches shortly before last week's signing day. 
</P>
<P>
	Recruiting coordinator Bill Conley visited offensive lineman  
Bryce Bishop outside his Miami home Jan. 31. Defense ends coach 
Shawn Simms visited defensive back Roshard Gilyard that same day at 
his Jacksonville, Fla., home. 
</P>
<P>
	One day earlier and the coaches would have been in the clear.  
But because of an NCAA-mandated ``quiet period'' before players 
sign national letters of intent, recruiting on the Sunday before 
signing day is limited to on-campus visits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many rules, but there is no excuse for not  
knowing,'' Cooper said. ``I should have known it. We all should 
have known it. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I know we did not knowingly violate the rule.''  
</P>
<P>
	Cooper said Heather Lyke, Ohio State assistant athletic director  
and director for compliance services, wrote a report on the 
violations last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will take the appropriate steps,'' athletic director Andy  
Geiger said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bishop signed with the Buckeyes Wednesday, the first day players  
were eligible to sign a letter of intent. Gilyard signed with 
Auburn. 
</P>
<P>
	Conley said the rule apparently got overlooked in the hectic  
shuffle of the final days of the recruiting period. Conley said he 
thought he was making a last gesture of sincerity before returning 
to Columbus. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an inadvertent but honest mistake,'' Conley said. ``We  
didn't have a clue about it being a quiet period.''

<HEADLINE> Kohler Expands Milk Recall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE BEAR LAKE, Minn. (AP) -- Kohler Mix Specialties Inc. has  
expanded its recall nationwide to all cartons of milk products 
produced at its plant here because of possible contamination. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion came four days after Kohler recalled certain  
single-serving cartons of Land O'Lakes 2 percent milk in eight 
Midwest states. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall now includes all 50 states and involves 270,000 cases  
of products, spokeswoman Kathy Tunheim said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	The products include half and half, whipping cream, skim, 1 and  
2 percent and whole milk and chocolate milk packaged for Becker's, 
Dairy Fresh, Hardees, Kemps, Kohler Mix, Land O'Lakes, Muller 
Pinehurst, Oak Grove, Perkins, Roundy's and Wendy's, 
</P>
<P>
	The plant code of ``PLT 27-416'' is found on the top seal of the  
carton along with the use by date. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall was prompted after a customer turned in a carton that  
``had an off odor,'' a Kohler spokesman has said. All samples have 
tested negative for the presence of listeria. There were no reports 
of serious illness. 
</P>
<P>
	Listeria monocytogenes can cause serious and sometimes fatal  
infections in young children, pregnant women, frail or elderly 
people and others with weakened immune systems.

<HEADLINE> Senators To Attend Hussein Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Senators will join the U.S. delegation  
attending the funeral of Jordan's King Hussein, but the Senate 
impeachment trial of President Clinton will continue as scheduled, 
an aide to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott, R-Miss., and Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle of South  
Dakota were choosing a two-senator delegation for the funeral. 
``The trial will not be interrupted,'' Lott spokesman John 
Czwartacki said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, will represent the Republican  
side at the funeral. The Democratic participant was still 
undecided. 
</P>
<P>
	They will miss closing arguments by the House trial managers and  
the White House lawyers, scheduled for Monday, but are scheduled to 
be back by Tuesday when the Senate is likely to vote on whether to 
open up deliberations by the senators on the two impeachment counts 
against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Those deliberations, the last step before the Senate votes on  
whether to convict the president and remove him from office, are 
now scheduled to be in secret.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Cancels Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines canceled about 9 percent of its  
scheduled flights Sunday because of pilot absences, a move believed 
to be in reaction to slowed negotiations of a work agreement over a 
recently acquired carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	American, the nation's second largest airline, canceled 214 of  
its 2,250 scheduled flights as of midday due to what it called a 
higher than normal number of unexpected pilot absences. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone calls to the union and the company Sunday were not  
returned to The Associated Press. But answering services referred 
to separate information hot lines, each of which contained recorded 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``American continues to be very disappointed in this situation  
and sincerely regrets the inconvenience that it causes for our 
customers,'' airline spokesman Tim Smith said in one statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said American was attempting to book passengers on  
additional flights or on other carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots contend that AMR Corp., parent of Fort Worth, Texas-based  
American, has disregarded the contract since purchasing Reno Air 
six weeks ago for $124 million. American must pay lower-paid Reno 
pilots at American Airlines' rates, the pilots say. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Allied Pilots Association did not call for the  
action at American, union president Rich LaVoy said the labor group 
was frustrated by a lack of progress on what he called an important 
work issue and was eager to resume talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the possibility of other acquisitions looming on the  
horizon, APA simply cannot afford to agree to something that will 
come back to haunt all of us if AMR buys other airlines larger and 
more senior than Reno Air,'' LaVoy said in a separate statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps the most unfortunate aspect is that this demonstrates  
that AMR is still using the same penny-wise, pound-foolish 
bargaining method we have suffered through for so many years with 
this airline,'' he said. ``These negotiations still have the big 
opportunity to do things differently by avoiding the temptations to 
save a buck at the pilots' expense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although federal law bars a strike over such an issue, pilots  
can refuse to volunteer for overtime, which can cause flight delays 
and cancelations. On Saturday, American canceled 90 flights 
systemwide when it came up short on pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline and its pilots have had past disagreements,  
including a brief strike in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regret that the disagreement between American Airlines and  
the Allied Pilots Association over the integration of Reno Air into 
the American Airlines system continues,'' Smith said. ``American 
hopes that our operations will return to normal soon and that we 
can continue our negotiations and come to a resolution of this 
matter quickly.''

	Jordan's Hussein Praised Worldwide  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- As news of King Hussein's death from cancer  
spread today, praise for him poured in from around the Mideast and 
the world. Israeli President Ezer Weizman called him ``one of the 
greatest leaders of the 20th century, a brave soldier who fought 
for peace.'' President Clinton's homage was simpler: ``I loved 
him.'' In Jordan, Hussein's eldest son Abdullah, 37, was sworn in 
just four hours after the death. In accordance to Islamic 
tradition, Hussein's funeral will be held tomorrow and is expected 
to draw past and present world leaders. 

</P>
<P>
	Senate To Continue Trial Tomorrow  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will be in Jordan for the  
funeral of King Hussein in Jordan tomorrow, but his defense team 
and House prosecutors will be on the floor of the Senate delivering 
closing statements at his impeachment trial. Today, senators 
discussed how best to craft a censure resolution that could unify 
Republicans and Democrats in a strong condemnation of his conduct.

	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- With the world's population  
expected to hit 6 billion later this year -- an increase of 20 
percent in just 12 years -- 140 non-governmental organizations met 
in the Netherlands today to assess progress toward slowing 
population growth. First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton addressed the 
conference and told groups to keep working despite a serious 
shortfall in funding, both from industrialized donor countries and 
developing nations.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- About 1,000 people rallied today outside the

	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- International mediators spent today  
shuttling between floors of a 14th-century chateau outside Paris, 
meeting with Serbs and ethnic Albanians and trying to make peace in 
Kosovo. A Serb negotiator and a Western mediator said the two sides 
have agreed to basic principles for the talks. Among other things, 
they include keeping Kosovo as part of Yugoslavia for at least 
three more years. That means the ethnic Albanians would give up 
their demand for independence, at least for now.

move, hailed by anti-smoking groups, was the most public sign yet 
of royal opposition to tobacco. A palace spokesman said Gallaher

fighter planes could break a U.S.-backed moratorium on airstrikes.

<P>
	John Cleese -- the British actor-comedian known for his roles in  
Monty Python's Flying Circus -- has been given an honorary

	Cleese was made an honorary A.D. White professor-at-large -- a  
program named after Cornell's first president. He is expected to 
lecture in Ithaca once a year for the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I would rather be a professor than an earl or a

<HEADLINE> Gibson's New Film a Big 'Payback' / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The end of football season brought guys back  
to the movies, helping Mel Gibson's ``Payback'' knock the teen 
romance ``She's All That'' from atop the box office heap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Payback'' had the best opening so far this year with a strong  
$21.4 million in ticket sales, while ``She's All That'' had $12 
million, according to industry estimates Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply Irresistible,'' starring Sarah Michelle Gellar of TV's  
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' debuted with a disappointing $2.4 
million for ninth place. The film was stung by bad reviews and 
fierce competition in the youth market from ``She's All That'' and 
``Varsity Blues,'' which was fourth with $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	After a couple of weeks dominated by teen films, ``Payback'' had  
the older male audience mostly to itself. The film stars Gibson as 
a criminal who goes on a rampage after being robbed and shot in the 
back by his double-crossing wife and a friend. 
</P>
<P>
	Like Gibson's ``Lethal Weapon'' movies, the audience for  
``Payback'' was about 55 percent male and mostly over age 25, 
according to Rob Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion 
Picture Group. 
</P>
<P>
	``February was a good time (for the film) because it's after  
football, after the Super Bowl, and adults start to come back to 
the movies in a big way again,'' Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also finding older audiences was ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which  
DreamWorks re-released to cash in on its Golden Globe wins and the 
buzz surrounding Tuesday's scheduled announcement of Oscar 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ryan,'' the No. 2 movie of 1998 after ``Armageddon,''  
collected $3.6 million for a fifth-place tie with another film with 
Oscar potential, ``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quirky Bill Murray film ``Rushmore'' also did strong  
older-audience business in limited release, grossing $1.9 million 
on 103 screens for a healthy per-theater average of just under 
$18,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Robin Williams' ``Patch Adams'' remained strong,  
collecting $4.5 million for third place. 
</P>
<P>
	For another weekend, the overall box office was down -- this time  
by 7.6 percent -- from the same time last year, when ``Titanic'' was 
shattering records and ``Good Will Hunting'' was charming 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Sunday. Final figures were expected Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Payback,'' $21.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``She's All That,'' $12 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Patch Adams,'' $4.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Varsity Blues,'' $4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Saving Private Ryan,'' $3.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $3.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``A Civil Action,'' $3.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Stepmom,'' $2.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Simply Irresistible,'' $2.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``You've Got Mail,'' $2.3 million.

<HEADLINE> Cincy Coach Frustrated After Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROSEMONT, Ill. (AP) -- Bob Huggins was frustrated just 10 minutes  
after the opening tip. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should we quit right now?'' the fiery Cincinnati coach asked  
officials after a foul call he didn't like. 
</P>
<P>
	Just imagine how Huggins felt after Saturday's game. DePaul's  
Willie Coleman was fouled in the final seconds of overtime and sank 
a game-winning free throw with no time left, giving the Blue Demons 
a 61-60 victory over the third-ranked Bearcats. 
</P>
<P>
	``The players are supposed to decide the outcome, but I can't  
comment,'' Huggins said. ``If I say anything, I'll get in 
trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In their only other loss -- by two points at North  
Carolina-Charlotte -- the Bearcats lost when an inadvertent whistle 
wiped out a late 3-pointer by Melvin Levett. 
</P>
<P>
	Levett was involved again Saturday in the closing seconds.  
Coleman stole the ball from him with four seconds to go, then as he 
was dribbling frantically up the floor put up an awkward shot. 
</P>
<P>
	A disbelieving Levett was called for a foul.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was just trying to stay in front of him,'' Levett said.  
``They called a push. I can't push him with my hands in the air.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Levett, who sustained a cut over his right eye in the  
closing seconds of regulation, took the blame for letting Coleman 
take the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
	``I messed up,'' he said. ``The game got to that point and you  
want a senior, you want a four-year guy to give you that 
leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman, the only senior starter for the freshman-laden Blue  
Demons and a 55 percent shooter from the line, had been in pressure 
free throw situations the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
	In a game against New Mexico this season and against Saint Louis  
last year, he missed key free throws in the closing seconds that 
cost DePaul victories. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he'd made one of two at the end of regulation to  
send the game to overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	Then with no time left in the extra period, he missed the first  
and hit the second, setting off a raucous celebration where a crowd 
of 15,816 was the biggest to watch a DePaul game at the Rosemont 
Horizon in seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew I just had to make one,'' Coleman said. ``Thank God it  
went in. I had a big chance and I made it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cincinnati (21-2, 8-2 Conference USA) had beaten DePaul by 23  
points a month ago and had won 16 straight against the Blue Demons. 
</P>
<P>
	Freshman Quentin Richardson, who scored 10 of DePaul's 12 points  
in overtime, led the Blue Demons (12-9, 6-5) with 25 points. The 
victory enhances DePaul's slim post-season possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a little chance now,'' DePaul coach Pat Kennedy  
said. ``This opens the door.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan Fletcher scored all 11 of Cincinnati's points in overtime  
and finished with 15, but Levett had only 11 on 4-of-11 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bearcats, who played much of the game without foul-troubled  
rebound leader Kenyon Martin, also had 23 turnovers.

<HEADLINE> President Hopefuls Launch 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Steve Forbes and Bill Bradley comfort  
crying women. Alan Keyes bellows, ``We are the fat lady!'' Al Gore, 
for all his vice presidential importance, faces a patently 
parochial campaign issue: Freeway Exit 4-A in Derry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Build it,'' a voter demands.  
</P>
<P>
	Though the first-in-the-nation presidential primaries are a year  
away, and Washington is still focused on President Clinton's Senate 
impeachment trial, Campaign 2000 is gearing up in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven candidates visited the state in the last two weeks, not  
including former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole. The wife of 1996 
Republican nominee Bob Dole takes the next step in her likely 
presidential campaign with a Monday night speech to the local 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	An adviser to Mrs. Dole, speaking on condition of anonymity  
Sunday, said she will speak in broad terms about the themes that 
would dominate her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	She is not expected to take positions on specific issues or  
announce formation of a presidential exploratory committee, saving 
that attention-getting step for later. ``We're not getting down in 
the weeds yet,'' the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others are.  
</P>
<P>
	``And ... they're off!'' state GOP chairman Steve Duprey said  
Saturday night, nodding toward two glass doors in a downtown hotel. 
On the other side of the fingerprint-smudged panes, three 
presidential prospects were addressing Christian Coalition 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Balloons bobbed from the ceiling. Stage lights swept across the  
walls. Handwritten signs hawked audio copies of GOP candidate Alan 
Keyes' ``very best'' speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve floors above, Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson  
sat down with reporters to say it's time to end Clinton's Senate 
trial and begin focusing on 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to turn our eyes away from the Bill Clinton-Monica  
Lewinsky axis,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentiment is shared by most attention-starved candidates.  
Keyes, a fire-and-brimstone speaker who ran for the GOP nomination 
in 1996, is an exception; the trial is not over, he says, until the 
fat lady sings. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we ARE the fat lady!'' Keyes told a roaring Christian  
Coalition crowd, with Robertson stewing a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 1996 retread, millionaire businessman Forbes, served  
eggs, bacon and a dash of compassion for breakfast Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Enola Arvidson shyly raised her hand at the end of Forbes' stump  
speech and explained between sobs that her sister can't afford some 
lifesaving medications. Dabbing her eyes with a green napkin, she 
asked, ``How do we get our medical people to understand that we all 
need help?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, without a pause, answered in his choppy, almost robotic  
cadence. ``I ... am ... sorry ... about ... your ... sister,'' he
said, before launching into a pitch for personal medical savings  
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	A Forbes aide approached Arvidson and promised to look into her  
situation. Arvidson said she was impressed with Forbes despite the 
``pretty standard'' answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just the fact that he sent somebody to talk to me, shows me  
that he cares.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seems every candidate is learning to feel voters' pain.  
</P>
<P>
	Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, in a moment reminiscent of  
President Clinton's 1991 touchy-feely campaign here, comforted a 
pregnant high school dropout during his New Hampshire tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you for your courage in sharing that,'' he said,  
standing up to put his hand on her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry, a Democrat from neighboring Massachusetts, may  
soon join Bradley to challenge Gore. He reportedly has purchased a 
table at the Democrats' ``100 Club'' event on Feb. 18, a sure sign 
of presidential interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is trying to learn his boss' knack for getting big mileage  
from little issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does anybody here ever get stressed out by traffic?'' he asked  
a crowd in Derry on Wednesday. ``Tell me about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The forum on community sprawl and other ``livability'' issues  
also prompted a debate over the merits of a new freeway exit. 
Running for the highest office in the land, Gore was asked at an 
airport news conference, ``Do you support Exit 4-A?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't answer, assuming correctly that the question was posed  
half-jokingly to make a point. Yet the exchange illustrates the 
power of voters in early primary states to turn hometown issues 
into national causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Running for president? Better know about hog farms in Iowa.  
</P>
<P>
	And better help protect the early primary status of Iowa and New  
Hampshire. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, during a recent 
visit here, signed a pledge to help keep New Hampshire the first 
primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the Republicans' early favorite, Dole and Texas  
Gov. George W. Bush, have yet to pay their New Hampshire dues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wide open race,'' Republican Lamar Alexander said  
during his stop. ``We have some people with famous last names, but 
that doesn't mean anybody is going to vote for them for 
president.''

<HEADLINE> Turtle Programs Provoke Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ROQUES, Venezuela (AP) -- On a powder-white island of palm  
trees surrounded by emerald Caribbean waters, marine biologists are 
trying to save one of the oldest species on earth -- sea turtles -- 
by capturing newborns on the beach and raising them in captivity. 
</P>
<P>
	The programs dubbed ``Head Start'' are a big hit with the  
public, but many scientists say they do more harm than good by 
disrupting migration patterns that have helped the turtles survive 
for more than 100 million years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a conservation effort that continues to mystify me, since  
the sea turtles are in no way being prepared for life in the 
wild,'' said Karen Eckert, a San Diego-based marine biologist and 
executive director of WIDECAST, the Wider Caribbean Sea Turtle 
Conservation Network. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Head Start proponents say they are seeing signs of success.  
</P>
<P>
	The scientists are trying to boost the shrinking population by  
raising baby turtles in tanks and skipping some of the treacherous 
early years in the wild. Just one in 1,000 wild turtles survive to 
adulthood. Most are caught by fishermen or eaten by birds, crabs, 
sharks, barricudas and other predators. 
</P>
<P>
	On Los Roques, a pristine archipelago off the coast of  
Venezuela, scientists say that in the last few years the number of 
hawksbill turtle nests on the island where they run their Head 
Start program has jumped from about five to a dozen a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Eckert says the increase in nests may be a natural fluctuation.  
But Juan Carlos Fernandez, head of the Los Roques Scientific 
Foundation, called the results ``impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sea turtles were once so abundant in the Caribbean that  
Christopher Columbus' men had to use poles to help push their boats 
through masses of shells. The biggest sea turtle, the leatherback, 
can grow to 2,000 pounds with a leathery shell 6 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, all seven species of sea turtle in the world are in  
danger of extinction. They've been devastated by development of 
coastal nesting zones, accidental capture and drowning in fishing 
nets, and by fishermen who sell the meat for soup, the eggs as a 
delicacy and the shells to make combs, jewelry or eyeglass frames. 
</P>
<P>
	One response is the scores of Head Start programs that operate  
from St. Vincent to Indonesia to the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	The process starts on Los Roques when female turtles crawl onto  
beaches at night, dig a hole as deep as 2 feet and deposit about 
100 leathery white eggs the size of pingpong balls. 
</P>
<P>
	Two months later the eggs hatch. But as the baby turtles scurry  
into the sea, Head Start workers scoop them up after a half-hour of 
swimming and bring them to water tanks. There, they're fed sardines 
and algae and released two years later. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest problem with Head Start is that it interferes with  
the turtles' crucial ``imprinting'' process, Eckert says. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists don't completely understand it, but as sea turtles  
swim offshore during the first days of their lives, they acquire a 
kind of internal compass using the earth's magnetic field. 
</P>
<P>
	After several years in the open sea, they return to coastal  
feeding areas. Then, using the compass, they return to their 
birthplaces to lay their own eggs -- 25 years or more later and even 
after traveling thousands of miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Head Start turtles are denied the imprinting step, meaning they  
may never return ``home'' to nest. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've totally messed up the natural migration cycle that this  
animal relies on,'' said Eckert's husband Scott, a sea turtle 
expert at Hubbs-Sea World Research Institute in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, he said, the captive turtles may be carrying  
diseases they picked up in the tanks and could infect wild turtles. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernandez acknowledges that Head Start turtles have exhibited  
``crazy'' behaviors such as swimming up to humans looking for food. 
But he says such reports are few. 
</P>
<P>
	Many experts say Head Start workers would be better off  
protecting turtle eggs from poachers, distributing devices that 
keep turtles out of fishermen's nets and helping enforce turtle 
protection laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Such steps have helped rescue the Kemp's ridley, whose numbers  
on Mexico's east coast -- its main breeding ground -- plummeted from 
50,000 nests in the late 1940s to about 200 in the early 1970s. 
Today there are about 500 nests. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be the next bald eagle or peregrine falcon,'' said  
Scott Eckert. ``We'll actually see a species come back from 
extinction.''

<HEADLINE> Slowdown of Population Growth Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) -- Volunteer agencies are ``the  
vanguard'' of U.N. efforts to slow the world's soaring population 
and must not lose heart in the face of dwindling financial support, 
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	With the world's population expected to hit 6 billion later this  
year -- an increase of 20 percent in just 12 years -- 140 
non-governmental organizations met in the Netherlands Sunday to 
assess progress toward slowing population growth since a landmark 
conference in 1994 in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a serious shortfall in funding, both from industrialized  
donor countries and developing nations, Mrs. Clinton called for the 
groups to keep working. 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenge to all of us is to persevere. Don't ever think  
that the work you do day in and day out is not having an impact on 
people's lives,'' she told the meeting ahead of a U.N. forum 
opening Monday. ``You are the vanguard of Cairo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A global resolution adopted at the International Conference on  
Population and Development in Cairo calls for universal access to 
affordable reproductive health services by 2015, including family 
planning, sexual health services and programs for adolescents. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have come a long way in the last years. It may not seem  
fast enough for many of us who are impatient, and I'm sure it seems 
glacial to young people,'' she said. ``(But) if we continue to make 
that progress, we will see Cairo's goals enacted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although volunteers reported progress in achieving some Cairo  
targets, they said momentum was being slowed by funding problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Attiya Inayatullah, the president of International Planned  
Parenthood, called the forum ``a wake-up call to ambivalent and 
disinterested donor countries.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States cut financial support to the U.N. Population  
Fund last year amid congressional concern that it was promoting 
abortion, but it will soon review a proposal by Rep. Carolyn 
Maloney of New York to reinstate funding. 
</P>
<P>
	``We as Americans are not living up to our goals,'' Maloney said  
in The Hague. 
</P>
<P>
	The first lady was scheduled to deliver the keynote address for  
the U.N. forum opening Monday, but will cut short her visit to fly 
to Jordan for King Hussein's funeral. Hussein died Sunday of cancer 
at the age of 63. 
</P>
<P>
	As they did in Cairo, abortion and birth control were expected  
to provoke heated controversy in The Hague, with delegates from the 
Vatican expected to lead the debate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton praised U.S. grassroots groups for playing a key  
role in family planning initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are the ones who have pushed successfully to increase our  
funding for family planning programs in the United States and to 
make abortion in America safe, legal and rare,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> N.D. Farmers Growing More Durum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BISMARCK, N.D. (AP) -- It sounds like a no-lose situation for  
wheat farmers: grow more durum with fewer costly chemicals and then 
collect on a lucrative insurance contract in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmers in North Dakota are counting on that scenario. They are  
buying durum seed, even in areas that are not prime durum-growing 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If nothing changes, I would say our durum acres will be up 60  
percent in this area, or more,'' said Kevin Knodel, manager of the 
Prairie Cooperative grain elevator in Cleveland, N.D. ``That's the 
only topic around here right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Dakota farmers typically produce more than two-thirds of  
the nation's durum, a wheat variety used in pasta. They planted and 
harvested around 3 million acres of it last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A crop insurance change is making durum even more popular.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Agriculture Department officials predict farmers will  
collect payments of up to $2 a bushel on durum this fall through 
crop revenue coverage. Unlike traditional crop insurance, the new 
policies protect farmers from price slumps as well as yield losses. 
</P>
<P>
	In past years, durum was treated the same as spring wheat. This  
year, policies will include an adjustment that reflects the price 
premium that durum typically has over spring wheat, said Gene 
Sonsalla of USDA's Risk Management Agency in Billings, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
	The result is potentially lucrative contracts -- and potentially  
huge bills for taxpayers if the crop is poor and prices are low. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've heard all kinds of horror stories that everyone in North  
Dakota is going to be planting durum this year,'' Sonsalla said 
last week. He added that officials do not yet know how much the 
government might have to pay durum farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Those eligible for the new durum policies are in North Dakota,  
northeastern Montana and northeastern South Dakota. 
</P>
<P>
	``People say it's a windfall, but if you go through a farmer's  
expense sheet, you'll see all the (costs),'' said Tom DeKrey, who 
farms near Steele, in central North Dakota. ``The bottom line is, 
that's about where the prices should be for farmers to get a fair 
return.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the new policies actually discourage farmers from striving  
to produce a quality crop, said Jim Peterson, marketing director 
for the North Dakota Wheat Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	``The incentives are there not to maximize yields,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Farmers might be inclined to use fewer chemicals like fertilizer  
or herbicides, Peterson said, because ``the lower yields you get, 
the more (insurance benefits) you get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Originally, people were thinking a 15 to 20 percent cut in  
durum acres,'' Peterson said. ``If (the policies) stay as is, there 
will be a definite increase. I've heard some predictions as high as 
50 percent. It remains to be seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An increase in the durum crop could further depress prices in  
the United States and possibly overseas, which worries Canadian 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the reports we've seen, it would appear that the  
coverage available for durum is substantially greater than for 
other crops,'' said Jim Pietryk, a spokesman for the Canadian Wheat 
Board. The board controls wheat and barley sales from western 
Canada's prairie provinces. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unlikely the crop insurance policies will be changed at  
this late date, USDA's Sonsalla said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've talked to management in (Washington,) D.C.,'' he said.  
``This is a private insurance company that came up with this 
product. Right now, (management) is saying, `Hold tight and back 
it.'''

<HEADLINE> El Nino May Be 15,000 Years Old </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) -- It turns out the child is no kid.  
</P>
<P>
	El Nino has been causing climatic chaos going back at least  
15,000 years, according to scientists who have unearthed clues to 
its prehistoric presence in the mud of a South American lake. 
</P>
<P>
	By looking at rain-induced erosion in sediment layers,  
scientists found signs of El Nino as far back as 15,000 years. But 
the phenomenon became more frequent beginning 5,000 years ago, 
appearing in its modern-day cycle of every two to eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't say much about how big these events were,'' said  
geology professor Donald Rodbell of Union College in Schenectady, 
who reported on the team's findings in the Jan. 22 issue of Science 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is really the intervals we can address. If this proves  
accurate, we will be able to come up with a real birthday for our 
modern El Nino,'' Rodbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	A periodic warming of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Peru  
and Ecuador, El Nino wreaks climatic havoc across the globe. The 
1997-98 El Nino, the strongest ever recorded, created record 
rainfall in California, heavy flooding in Peru, drought and 
wildfires in Indonesia, and tornadoes and flooding in the Southeast 
states. It was blamed for 23,000 deaths and $33 billion in damages 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	The phenomenon takes its name from the Spanish words for the  
Christ child and is so named because the warm waters typically 
reach South America around Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all its headlines, El Nino is little understood.  
Although theories about the relationship between ocean temperatures 
and atmospheric conditions first were proposed in the 1930s, El 
Nino has been studied in earnest only since the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	The earliest documentation of El Nino comes from the diaries and  
writings of 15th-century colonists in Ecuador and Peru. Coral, ice 
corings, tree rings and flood deposits have suggested that the 
weather phenomenon is much more ancient, although the evidence was 
always isolated or disconnected. Scientists have been looking for 
tangible proof. 
</P>
<P>
	The sediment provides the first continuous record showing El  
Nino has been occurring regularly for dozens of centuries, said 
Rodbell and colleague Geoffrey Seltzer, an earth sciences professor 
at Syracuse University. 
</P>
<P>
	Harvard University paleoclimatologist Konrad Hughen said the  
discovery could be an important development if it proves accurate. 
</P>
<P>
	The news also excited Michael McPhaden, a senior research  
scientist at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's 
Pacific Marine Laboratory in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you find a clear signal, it's pretty important. Any time  
you develop an older record of El Ninos, you have a better chance 
of adding to our understanding of El Nino,'' said McPhaden, who led 
a team that studied last year's El Nino through a network of buoys 
in the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real benefit from a record like this is that we can see in  
detail how El Nino's frequency has changed over the years. That 
means someday, maybe, being able to predict when it will occur,'' 
said Art DeGaetano, a meteorologist at Cornell University's 
Northeast Regional Climate Center. 
</P>
<P>
	To learn more about El Nino's history, Rodbell and Seltzer went  
to Lake Pallcachocha, a glacial lake high in the Andes in southern 
Ecuador and about 75 kilometers from the Pacific Ocean where 
warming sea surface temperatures first announce the birth of El 
Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	A scientific team studied a 30-foot core sample from the bottom  
of the lake, looking for fragments of vegetation that were washed 
into the water from the surrounding landscape during the torrential 
rain storms associated with El Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	After finding that the sediment record from 1800 to 1976 closely  
matched the occurrence of El Ninos during that time, researchers 
knew they had an exciting discovery, Rodbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sediment revealed that El Nino-like events began occurring  
about 15,000 years ago but at irregular cycles ranging from 15 to 
70 years, Rodbell said. About 7,000 years ago, the cycles began to 
shorten and become more regular until reaching its present pattern 
about 2,000 years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Gifford Miller, a leading paleoclimatologist from the  
University of Colorado-Boulder, said it's unlikely that modern El 
Nino will turn out to be much older. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are many reasons to suspect that El Nino may not have  
been in operation prior to that,'' said Miller, presently on 
sabbatical in Australia. ``Sea surface temperatures then were 
lower, oceanic surface water circulation was different and sea 
levels were much lower because much ocean water was still locked in 
the ice sheets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Rodbell nor Seltzer is ready to say yet what has driven  
the change, whether it has been global warming, a popularly 
advanced theory, or other variables. 
</P>
<P>
	``The climate system is so enormously complicated that it's very  
difficult to point a finger at one factor. We don't know the answer 
yet,'' Rodbell said. 
</P>
<P>
	In June, Rodbell and Seltzer will return to Ecuador with a  
National Science Foundation grant to duplicate their study in other 
lakes and hopefully confirm El Nino's age. More samples also may 
give more clues to what has caused Nino's increased frequency. It 
might raise more questions, too.

<HEADLINE> President Hopefuls Launch 2000 Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Steve Forbes and Bill Bradley comfort  
crying women. Alan Keyes bellows, ``We are the fat lady!'' Al Gore, 
for all his vice presidential importance, faces a patently 
parochial campaign issue: Freeway Exit 4-A in Derry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Build it,'' a voter demands.  
</P>
<P>
	Though the first-in-the-nation presidential primaries are a year  
away, and Washington is still focused on President Clinton's Senate 
impeachment trial, Campaign 2000 is gearing up in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven candidates visited the state in the last two weeks, not  
including former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole. The wife of 1996 
Republican nominee Bob Dole takes the next step in her likely 
presidential campaign with a Monday night speech to the local 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	``And .... they're off!'' state GOP chairman Steve Duprey said  
Saturday night, nodding toward two glass doors in a downtown hotel. 
On the other side of the fingerprint-smudged panes, three 
presidential prospects were addressing Christian Coalition 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Balloons bobbed from the ceiling. Stage lights swept across the  
walls. Hard-to-read signs hawked audio copies of GOP candidate Alan 
Keyes' ``very best'' speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve floors above, Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson  
sat down with reporters to say it's time to end Clinton's Senate 
trial and begin focusing on 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to turn our eyes away from the Bill Clinton-Monica  
Lewinsky axis,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentiment is shared by most attention-starved candidates.  
Keyes, a fire-and-brimstone speaker who ran for the GOP nomination 
in 1996, is an exception; the trial is not over, he says, until the 
fat lady sings. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we ARE the fat lady!'' Keyes told a roaring Christian  
Coalition crowd, with Robertson stewing a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 1996 retread, millionaire businessman Forbes, served  
eggs, bacon and a dash of compassion for breakfast Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Enola Arvidson shyly raised her hand at the end of Forbes' stump  
speech. Explaining that her sister can't afford some lifesaving 
medications, Arvidson dabbed her eyes with a green napkin. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do we get our medical people to understand that we all  
need help?'' she sobbed. 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, without a pause, answered in his choppy, almost robotic  
cadence. ``I .. am .. sorry .. about ... your ... sister,'' he 
said, before launching into a pitch for personal medical savings 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	A Forbes aide approached Arividson and promised to look into her  
situation. Arvidson said she was impressed with Forbes despite the 
``pretty standard'' answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just the fact that he sent somebody to talk to me, shows me  
that he cares.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seems every candidate is learning to feel voters' pain.  
</P>
<P>
	Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, in a moment reminiscent of  
President Clinton's 1991 touchy-feely campaign here, comforted a 
pregnant high school dropout during his New Hampshire tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you for your courage in sharing that,'' he said,  
standing up to put his hand on her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry, a Democrat from neighboring Massachusetts, may  
soon join Bradley to challenge Gore. He reportedly has purchased a 
table at the Democrats' ``100 Club'' event on Feb. 18, a sure sign 
of presidential interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is trying to learn his boss' knack for getting big mileage  
from little issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does anybody here ever get stressed out by traffic?'' he asked  
a crowd in Derry on Wednesday. ``Tell me about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The forum on community sprawl and other ``livability'' issues  
also prompted a debate over the merits of a new freeway exit. 
Running for the highest office in the land, Gore was asked at an 
airport news conference, ``Do you support Exit 4-A?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't answer, assuming correctly that the question was posed  
half-jokingly to make a point. Yet the exchange illustrates the 
power of voters in early primary states to turn hometown issues 
into national causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Running for president? Better know about hog farms in Iowa.  
</P>
<P>
	And better help protect the early primary status of Iowa and New  
Hampshire. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, during a recent 
visit here, signed a pledge to help keep New Hampshire the first 
primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the Republicans' early favorite, Dole and Texas  
Gov. George W. Bush, have yet to pay their New Hampshire dues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wide open race,'' Republican Lamar Alexander said  
during his stop. ``We have some people with famous last names, but 
that doesn't mean anybody is going to vote for them for 
president.''

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Politics Worry Tycoons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- When one of Hong Kong's real estate tycoons  
complained that the city may have become a bad place to do 
business, entrepreneur Ng Wai-lim agreed completely. 
</P>
<P>
	He and many other businessmen are disturbed by growing political  
agitation for more government involvement in this capitalist 
enclave's business and social affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Ng, a typical Hong Kong success story at age 38, loathes the  
demonstrations demanding more welfare, more subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
	He says that with the city in one of its worst recessions, the  
economy can't afford to be adding expensive social programs for the 
poor and for workers. Even if it could, he doesn't think such 
things are needed, pointing to his own time at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-two years on, Ng still remembers the hunger pains after  
his father lost work as a mechanic and the grocery money ran out. 
Ng's immigrant family of four, living in a single rental room, had 
to borrow rice from neighbors to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet, starting out as a teen-age molding apprentice, Ng worked  
hard, and with some luck, built up a plastic molding business whose 
two factories ring up sales of $2.6 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``People like me were never taken care of by the society,'' Ng  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he says, populist politicians are telling voters the  
government owes them something and should be taxing the haves to 
pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
	So it struck a chord when property magnate Li Ka-shing -- a  
self-made billionaire who once had to make ends meet by helping his 
mother make plastic flowers -- told reporters he was pulling out of 
a $1.2 billion investment because he doesn't like the way politics 
are evolving. 
</P>
<P>
	``In today's environment, this political environment, I'd rather  
do less,'' Li said, without elaborating. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a bombshell that pushed the stock market sharply lower,  
and led the territory's chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, a 
well-connected shipping magnate handpicked by Beijing, to appeal 
for harmony. 
</P>
<P>
	Tung's pleas aside, the titans of ``Hong Kong Inc.,'' as the  
city's business establishment has been dubbed, wonder whether the 
freewheeling capitalism that made Hong Kong an economic powerhouse 
is in danger. 
</P>
<P>
	Political analysts warn that the growing activism may eventually  
drive a wedge between the haves and have-nots as workers face 
extensive layoffs and pay cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Li's apparent target was the Democratic Party, Hong Kong's main  
opposition group. 
</P>
<P>
	Some party members had criticized Li for threatening to sue  
people who signed contracts to buy apartments in his developments 
before property prices nose-dived with the economy and then backed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats, the largest and best organized among a handful of  
opposition groups, won a following by promising to safeguard 
freedom and human rights when Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese 
sovereignty in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Its activists have since added other causes, leading protest  
rallies in parks and outside government offices and proposing 
legislation for lower rents for the poor, more rights for common 
workers and more money for welfare and education. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin Lee, the Democratic Party chairman, says democracy is  
vital for good business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any investor would look for stability as a place for his  
investment, and he would look for the rule of law, he would look 
for the level playing field, and all these things require an 
accountable government,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The business community worries Hong Kong will lose the stability  
and influence it gained under decades of hands-off British rule. 
Eden Woon, director of the Hong Kong Chamber of Commerce, says the 
group supports democracy, but the recent developments are ``a 
concern and worry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ng is more blunt.  
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats ``are more like communists than the communists,''  
he said. ``They want to take away the wealth of the wealthy to give 
it to other people. This is not what a free society is about. This 
is communism, and it's undemocratic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ng gripes that populist politicians portray business leaders as  
greedy oppressors. Inspired by trade unionists, new employees just 
keep pressing for more and more, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is making employers' lives very difficult,'' Ng said.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Turns Over a New Maple Leaf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The Toronto Maple Leafs just won't go away.  
</P>
<P>
	Thought to be an optical illusion after opening the season with  
a 5-1-1 record, the surprising Maple Leafs have remained one of the 
top teams in the NHL without signs of a letup. 
</P>
<P>
	Saturday night, they beat the New Jersey Devils 3-2 to become  
the second team to reach the 30-victory mark and match their wins 
for all of last season. The Dallas Stars were the first 30-win 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's unbelievable for a hockey club to make a full turnaround  
like this,'' said Steve Sullivan, who had two goals in the win over 
the Devils. ``It's great for us. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different system we're playing this year. It  
complements the talent on this hockey club.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last season's Maple Leafs under Mike Murphy were a  
defensive-oriented team that finished 23rd in scoring in the 
league. Their 30-43-9 record left them at the bottom of the Central 
Division and out of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Under offense-oriented Pat Quinn, the Maple Leafs lead the  
league in goals (165 after 51 games) and lead the Northeast 
Division over the Ottawa Senators with a 30-18-3 record. The teams 
have the same amount of points (63), but the Maple Leafs have two 
more victories. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously we have a lot of depth,'' goaltender Curtis Joseph  
said, referring among other things to seven players with double 
figures in goals, including leading scorer Mats Sundin. ``All four 
lines are scoring. Anytime you get that, you're going to win a lot 
of hockey games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans such as Steve Thomas, with a team-leading 20 goals, and  
Derek King (16) are enjoying comeback seasons and Joseph, picked up 
as a free agent over the summer, has provided the Maple Leafs with 
solid goaltending. 
</P>
<P>
	``(Joseph) provides us with an opportunity to steal points,''  
Quinn said. ``He does that for you. Some nights we are able to take 
advantage and sustain what he has done for us. The other nights, we 
don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs have been consistent, if nothing else. They  
haven't lost more than three games in a row, and that only happened 
once. They have had three-game winning streaks on five occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs' best season since 1992-93 couldn't have  
happened at a better time. They're moving into a new arena, the Air 
Canada Centre, on Feb. 20 after 68 years in venerable Maple Leaf 
Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs hope they will have more to celebrate by the end  
of the season than just a new arena, like another Stanley Cup. The 
Maple Leafs have 13, second highest total in the league, but none 
since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's obviously a number of things,'' Joseph said when asked  
why the Maple Leafs are doing so well this season. ``It's a new 
system that we're playing. Now we have a skating hockey club that 
fits in with the personnel that we have.''

<HEADLINE> Weiss Favored To Win US Skate Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The rebel with the attitude and the  
skating to match is gone, replaced by a mature 22-year-old who 
spends his free time playing with his baby daughter. 
</P>
<P>
	For Michael Weiss, it's finally his turn.  
</P>
<P>
	After finishing second to five-time U.S. champion Todd Eldredge  
for two straight years, Weiss is favored to win the men's title 
this week at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``Competing against Todd and watching him handle the national  
champion title and watching the way he does things has been great 
experience,'' Weiss said. ``The last two national championships, 
I've competed well and competed strongly, and I'm ready to take 
over the title.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Eldredge is keeping his eligible status -- allowing him to  
compete at the national championships, world championships and 
Olympics -- he's doing only a few open events this season and won't 
skate this week. 
</P>
<P>
	That leaves Tim Goebel, the first American to land a quad in  
competition, Dan Hollander and Derrick Delmore as Weiss' main 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think I feel like I have pressure,'' Weiss said. ``At  
every event, there's a little stress. In the last couple of years, 
I've skated up to the way I wanted to. Whether I got the gold medal 
or not wasn't the issue. I skated the best I can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And he did it with his own uncompromising style. Like Elvis  
Stojko, Weiss didn't want to be like all the other skaters. He 
preferred Santana to Chopin, tie-dyed T-shirts to taffeta. 
</P>
<P>
	He shook up the national championships two years ago when he  
became the first American to land a quad -- for about an hour. The 
judges later ruled it didn't count because he two-footed the 
landing, but he got people's attention. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, he was the only skater to attempt a quad lutz.  
</P>
<P>
	But he wanted to be known for more than his jumps. Eldredge  
stayed on top for so long because of his consistency, graceful 
style and spins that are the best in the world. So Weiss began 
refining his skating, showcasing his improving artistry and 
expressions with a long program to ``Immortal Beloved'' last year. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, he chose music from ``Mulan'' for his long program.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really got into the character of the program,'' he said. ``I  
really wanted a long program that I could get into, not necessarily 
the jumps or spins, but really get into the character of the 
program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quad is still there, it's just not the focal point of his  
program. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm focusing a lot more on being consistent and skating a good  
program,'' said Weiss, who was second at both Skate America and 
Trophy Lalique. ``Last year, I was in a different situation. This 
year, I have a little more reputation behind me, a little more 
consistency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he's not leaving his wild streak entirely behind. His short  
program features a medley of Van Halen songs, with some extra 
guitar thrown in to really make it rip. 
</P>
<P>
	``Growing up, Van Halen was one of my favorite bands,'' he said.  
``You always want to skate to a program that inspires you, and Van 
Halen was something that got your juices going and excited to 
skate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss' transformation on the ice isn't just about getting one  
step higher on the podium, it reflects the changes in his personal 
life, too. He married his choreographer, Lisa Thornton, in 1997, 
and the couple had a baby girl, Annie Mae, in September. 
</P>
<P>
	His wife and daughter have traveled with him for much of the  
season, and he freely admits he's a ``corny father.'' He played 
classical music and talked to the baby when his wife was pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	And when he's on the road, if he's not on the ice, he's most  
likely back in his hotel room being a doting dad. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the biggest concerns initially was that being a father  
would distract me. That really hasn't been the case,'' he said. 
``Obviously, your life changes a lot. You're home a little bit 
more, your priorities change. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there's also that new inspiration, that new excitement you  
have in your life that maybe you didn't really realize you were 
missing.''

<HEADLINE> Nation's History Reflected on Paper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Andrew Jackson wrote a letter, it was  
easy to see troops march, hear cannon roar. His was presidential 
decision-making with no fuzzy edges. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing from the White House on Dec. 17, 1832, the president  
told his secretary of war it was high time to stomp out the 
incendiary doctrine that individual states had the right to declare 
federal laws null and void. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must be prepared to act with promptness, and crush the  
monster in its cradle before it matures to manhood,'' Jackson wrote 
Lewis Cass. ``We must be prepared for the crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson's letter -- mustering troops in five days' time,  
collecting shipping, calling for inventories of muskets, ammunition 
and artillery -- is included in ``Letters of a Nation,'' a new 
collection of American writings spanning four centuries published 
by Broadway Books. 
</P>
<P>
	Assembled by Andrew Carroll, director of the American Poetry and  
Literacy Project, the letters have many moods. Some of the writers 
are celebrated, many are newly discovered. Among them are 
presidents from George Washington to Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson successfully faced down adversaries in South Carolina,  
which had threatened the Union over the nullification issue. 
Congress backed him. The crisis subsided without bloodshed. Civil 
war was postponed for nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	While Jackson brimmed with fire, Washington was reluctant when  
called to war. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing from Philadelphia on June 18, 1775, he told his wife  
that to his ``inexpressible concern'' he had been given command of 
``the whole army raised for defense of the American cause.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addressing Martha Washington, the austere general used her  
pet name. 
</P>
<P>
	``You may believe me, my dear Patsy, in the most solemn manner  
that, so far from seeking this appointment, I have used every 
endeavor in my power to avoid it ... But as it has been a kind of 
destiny that has thrown me upon this service, I shall hope that my 
undertaking is designed to achieve some good purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 200 years later, Clinton saw no good purpose in the war  
his generation was asked to fight. 
</P>
<P>
	In a long letter on Dec. 3, 1969 to the officer commanding his  
local Reserve Officer Training Corps program, the future president 
said: 
</P>
<P>
	``No government really rooted in limited, parliamentary  
democracy should have the power to make its citizens fight and kill 
and die in a war they may oppose, a war which even possibly may be 
wrong, a war which, in any case, does not involve immediately the 
peace and freedom of the nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Here are other presidents addressing the issues of war and peace  
in their times: 
</P>
<P>
	--Abraham Lincoln, in an open letter to the New York Tribune,  
explaining his ``official'' position on slavery and winning the 
Civil War: 
</P>
<P>
	``My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and  
it is not either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the 
Union without freeing any slave I would do it. If I could save it 
by freeing all the slaves I would do it: and if I could save it by 
freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. ... I 
intend no modification of my oft-expressed personal wish that all 
men everywhere could be free.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Ulysses S. Grant, to his wife, Julia, on April 25, 1865, just  
days after receiving the surrender of the Confederate army under 
Gen. Robert E. Lee: 
</P>
<P>
	``People who talk now of further retaliation and punishment,  
except of the political leaders, either do not conceive of the 
suffering endured already or they are heartless and unfeeling and 
wish to stay at home, out of the danger ....'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Franklin D. Roosevelt to Prime Minister Winston Churchill on  
Jan. 8, 1942, one day after Pearl Harbor. The salutation refers to 
Churchill's former position as first lord of the admiralty: 
</P>
<P>
	``To the Former Naval Person, London: ``Today all of us are in  
the same boat with you and the people of the Empire and it is a 
ship which will not and cannot be sunk. F.D.R.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Harry S. Truman, to Chicago newspaper columnist Irv Kupcinet,  
on Aug. 5, 1963: ``I knew what I was doing when I stopped the war 
that would have killed half a million youngsters on both sides if 
those bombs had not been dropped. I have no regrets and, under the 
same circumstances, I would do it again -- and this letter is not 
confidential.''

<HEADLINE> Discount Airline to Land in N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- New York to Buffalo, $49.  
</P>
<P>
	New York to Boston, $39.  
</P>
<P>
	New York to Orlando, $79.  
</P>
<P>
	Sound too good to be true? These one-way airfares could be a  
reality by the fall if all goes well for New Air. 
</P>
<P>
	The startup discount airline filed paperwork on Friday with the  
U.S. Department of Transportation seeking permission to fly out of 
John F. Kennedy International Airport to 44 cities around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to be New York's low-fare, hometown airline,'' Robert  
Land, New Air's vice president for governmental affairs and 
associate general counsel, said in a telephone interview Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike many other parts of the country -- such as California,  
where you can fly from Los Angeles to San Francisco for $60 -- New 
York has no major discount airline. 
</P>
<P>
	In its DOT filing, New Air listed 44 cities around the country  
that it is considering serving. They range from major destinations 
like Atlanta, Houston and Washington D.C., to smaller cities like 
Charleston, W.Va., and Grand Rapids, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every city on that list has one thing in common: They're  
either underserved, not served at all or are suffering under the 
weight of high airfares from New York,'' Land said. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are some of New Air's proposed fares, according to its DOT  
filings: 
</P>
<P>
	-- JFK to Buffalo, approximately $49 to $109; current  
unrestricted fare ranges from $202 to $244. 
</P>
<P>
	-- JFK to Boston, approximately $39 to $89; current unrestricted  
fare is $218. 
</P>
<P>
	-- JFK to Orlando, approximately $79 to $159; current  
unrestricted fare is $470. 
</P>
<P>
	Land said the low fares are made possible in part because the  
airline will be using new aircraft, Boeing 737-700s and Airbus 
A320s, which carry between 140 and 160 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``Your maintenance costs are lower, fuel costs are lower and  
labor costs are lower because they require a crew of two instead of 
three,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, another discount airline, Dallas-based Southwest  
Airlines, announced plans to begin serving Long Island MacArthur 
Airport, in Islip. Those flights are expected to begin some time 
this year, with destinations including Baltimore, Providence, R.I., 
and Manchester, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
	JFK is busy between 3 p.m. and 8 p.m., but it is actually  
underutilized at other times. Land said 70 percent of New Air's 
flights would be at other times of day. 
</P>
<P>
	New Air's founder, David Neeleman, 39, who lives in Utah but  
plans to relocate to New York, has raised $130 million for the 
airline from Chase Manhattan, the West Coast investment house 
Weston Presidio, and billionaire investor George Soros. The strong 
backing will help the airline survive if major airlines lower their 
rates to compete.

<HEADLINE> Marv Albert Back the Air </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After a nearly 20-month layoff, Marv Albert was  
already back in midseason form Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Albert was nearly flawless in his radio broadcast of the  
Knicks-Heat game, his first basketball game since the 1997 NBA 
Finals. Albert was fired by NBC three months later after pleading 
guilty to biting a former lover during a sexual encounter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's doing great and I think his greatness as an announcer has  
always been radio,'' said partner John Andariese. ``The listener is 
the winner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albert began his play-by-play career with MSG on radio in 1966.  
He worked Knicks games for MSG on television with Andariese from 
1986 to 1997 before resigning shortly after being fired by NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	He had few problems on Sunday with the adjustment back to radio  
-- despite not feeling completely healthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a little cold, but I felt very comfortable,'' Albert  
said after the game. ``Radio is much more taxing than TV. In 
television you're really setting up the analysts. This is non-stop 
and is a frantic pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the wild first quarter in which both teams shot  
poorly, it took nearly four minutes before Albert got a chance to 
use his signature call of ``Yessss'' when Larry Johnson buried a 
15-footer. 
</P>
<P>
	It took far less time for Albert to offer his respected  
insights. He criticized the game early in the first quarter, 
calling it ``sloppy'', and also pointed out on numerous occasions 
the Knicks dismal free throw shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Albert was not perfect. He misidentified players, but  
that is expected -- especially of someone who has been away from the 
game for so long. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his return was overshadowed by Latrell Sprewell's first  
game at home as a Knick, Albert was welcomed back to Madison Square 
Garden by fans and former colleagues -- including NBC's Bill Walton 
and Jim Gray. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the game, fans lined up to speak with Albert and get his  
autograph. One fan even got his signature on an NBC cap. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to have him back because he is New York  
broadcasting,'' said Mark Gomberg of Wayne, N.J. ``It's great that 
MSG was able to overlook his indiscretions and I only hope that 
they put him back on TV soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it would be ironic if he signed my NBC hat. He  
didn't even flinch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Contrary to a report Thursday on Fox Sports Net, Albert and NBC  
Sports Chairman Dick Ebersol denied they are deep in discussions 
about bringing Albert back to the network. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ebersol did add that he would never eliminate the  
possibility of Albert coming back to NBC.

<HEADLINE> Stephen King Tones Down for TV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fright writer Stephen King doesn't mind toning  
down his horror stories for TV. He thinks it's good for the 
imagination. 
</P>
<P>
	``A little footbinding can be good for you,'' King writes in the  
Feb. 13-19 TV Guide. ``When you know your story is going under the 
gaze of people who are watching for dead folks with open eyes (a 
no-no on network TV), children who utter bad words (another no-no) 
or large amounts of spilled blood (a gigantic no-no), you begin to 
think of alternative ways of getting your point across.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His latest miniseries, ``Stephen King's Storm of the Century,''  
airs on ABC this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Feature films require less self-editing, but King likes TV  
because it reaches the largest possible audience.

<HEADLINE> Bikers Want Equal Rights in Maine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- There's a price to pay for being tough,  
tattooed and clad in leather, complain Maine's bikers -- 
discrimination when they look for a place to dine or spend the 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	United Bikers of Maine is asking the Legislature to add  
motorcyclists to the state Human Rights Act -- the same law that 
protects against discrimination based on race, gender and religion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We know where we can and can't go. We've complained about it  
but there's not much we can do about it,'' said Michael Behr, a 
United Bikers member who wears a leather jacket and has multiple 
ear piercings. He's also president of the Maine Hells Angels. 
</P>
<P>
	They get no support from Gov. Angus King, even though he rides a  
Harley-Davidson. King opposes the proposal along with restaurateurs 
and hotel operators, who say they should have the freedom to be 
``discerning'' about their clientele. 
</P>
<P>
	But Behr said members of United Bikers are tired of being turned  
away from bars, restaurants and hotels just because they wear 
tough-looking black leather jackets covered in ``colors,'' or 
patches representing bike clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some would say that we want special rights,'' said Behr. ``It  
has nothing to do with special rights. We want the same rights as 
everyone else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Howe of the Maine Innkeepers Association said the  
proposal has little to do with legitimate groups that are protected 
under the state human rights law. 
</P>
<P>
	``People cannot change their skin color, or their religion. But  
a biker can change his clothes,'' Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill, modeled after a proposal that made it into law last  
year in Minnesota, would expand the state human rights law to 
prohibit discrimination against motorcyclists or people who wear 
clothing that displays the name of a motorcycle association or 
organization. An Arizona legislative panel rejected a similar law 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
	Bikers say unfair stereotypes started in 1953 with ``The Wild  
One,'' in which Marlon Brando played the leader of a motorcycle 
gang menacing a small town. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't the 60s or the 70s anymore,'' Behr told a  
legislative committee. ``This isn't `let's see how bad we can freak 
out the citizens.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The average biker is 38 years old and married with some college  
education and a household income of $41,000 a year, according to a 
survey by the American Motorcyclist Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like the general population, we cover the spectrum,'' said  
Robert Rasor, spokesman for the association, which also supports 
the Maine proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's future doesn't look promising, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``There is not enough evidence of severe and pervasive  
discrimination to cause motorcyclists to be added high to the Maine 
Human Rights Act,'' said Patricia Ryan, executive director of the 
Maine Human Rights Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the governor says the new proposal disparages  
past arguments for gay rights, civil rights and equality. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a different argument when you argue I was born this way  
versus I was discriminated against because I'm wearing a leather 
jacket,'' said the governor's aide, Dennis Bailey. 
</P>
<P>
	To bikers, however, taking off the patch-festooned jacket is not  
an option, not even to get into a bar or fancy restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't take our patches off,'' Behr said. ``That's not  
something we do. If my patch isn't welcome, my money isn't 
welcome.''

<HEADLINE> Orthodox Jew Commits to Maryland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Tamir Goodman's world consists of  
11-hour school days, basketball and, above all, an uncompromising 
devotion to Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
	He adheres to a kosher diet and wears a yarmulke, even on the  
court. The Jewish religion deems that Saturday, the Sabbath, is a 
day of rest, meaning basketball is strictly forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all this, the University of Maryland has made an oral  
commitment to give Goodman a basketball scholarship. Maryland 
rarely makes this offer to high school juniors, and never before 
has the institution extended such an invitation to an Orthodox Jew. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman averages about 37 points a game for the Talmudical  
Academy, a Jewish day school near Baltimore that has an enrollment 
of only 72 students. 
</P>
<P>
	His basketball prowess has earned him the nickname ``Jewish  
Jordan,'' and Maryland is convinced the 6-foot-3 guard has enough 
skill to make an impact in the same league (the Atlantic Coast 
Conference) as his namesake. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was recruited solely on his athletic talent,'' Maryland  
athletic director Debbie Yow said. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is some question whether Goodman will excel at  
Division I, his father has no doubt Tamir (for whom dating is not 
an option) will remain faithful to his religion after entering a 
whole new world of female students, dormitories and avid fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see him straying. He's a very serious kid,'' Karl  
Goodman said. ``He's going to be under a basketball microscope as 
well as a religious microscope. I don't think he would stray even 
if people weren't watching him, but they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tamir's mother, Chava, constantly watches over him -- except  
during games. Because she is afraid of seeing him get hurt, Chava 
remains outside the arena during games, praying for his health. She 
enters only after the final buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's how I know he's going to remain faithful to his  
religion at Maryland: He's a momma's boy,'' Karl Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamir understands the situation perfectly.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know how much responsibility is now on my shoulders,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamir Goodman is already a part of the scene at Cole Field  
House. He and his coach often sit in seats behind the Maryland 
bench during games, and more than a few fans jostle each other and 
point out The Jewish Kid. 
</P>
<P>
	After a recent game, Goodman and his coach, Harold Katz, sat in  
the floor seats in the emptied arena as Maryland assistant coach 
Billy Hahn assured Goodman that he will have kosher food on the 
table when he joins the team for the 2000-2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a lot of work!'' Hahn said. ``But, of course, you're  
worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping Goodman fed is only a part of the task facing Maryland  
in the months ahead. More important, the Terrapins will try to 
avoid playing on Saturday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all unplowed soil,'' Yow said. ``I've never gone through  
something like this before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman, similarly, already has initiated a different lifestyle.  
Since word got out about his future, he has been sought by media 
outlets ranging from Sports Illustrated to newspapers in Israel. A 
public relations firm was hired to handle the crush. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman's life is now public property.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to go to Maryland. I would definitely do it again  
this way,'' he said. ``I've been dreaming about doing this for a 
long time. It's a good challenge for me and I like challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He surely has one in the ACC. After all, scoring 33 points  
against Antioch High may not equate to success against the likes of 
Duke and North Carolina. Some think Goodman may end up in the third 
row of seats at Cameron Indoor Stadium if his 150-pound frame gets 
bumped under the basket during a battle for a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are going to owe Tamir an apology,'' Katz  
said. ``They say, `Look who he plays against.' I say, `Who does he 
play with?' The other kids on the team try hard, but they don't 
have his talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was evident last week. The school doesn't have a bus for  
road games, so the players arrange their own transportation. 
Goodman got lost, and by the time he showed up his team was 
trailing 20-4 late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman scored 45 points, including the winning tip at the  
buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has Pete Maravich tendencies. I took one look at him and I  
knew he was special,'' said Paul Baker, a scout and ex-college 
coach. ``He sees the whole floor is an unerring shooter. If he 
grows, he has a chance to make a living playing basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For that to happen, Goodman will have to overcome many  
obstacles, not the least of which will be playing under the 
constant scrutiny of a media machine that is already heavily into 
this unique story. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still only a kid,'' Goodman said. ``I'm just Tamir.''

	King Hussein Dies; Abdullah Crowned  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- King Hussein of Jordan, the Middle East's  
longest ruling leader, died of cancer today, plunging the nation he 
ruled for 46 years into deep mourning. He was 63. Underscoring 
Jordan's determination that the transition be swift and smooth, 
Hussein's eldest son Abdullah, 37, was sworn in just four hours 
later in parliament. In keeping with Islamic tradition, the funeral 
will be held tomorrow and is expected to draw leaders from around 
the world.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With videotaped images of Monica Lewinsky  
fresh in senators' minds, House prosecutors and President Clinton's 
defense team spent today packaging familiar evidence into closing 
statements to be delivered at the impeachment trial tomorrow. The 
drama appears certain to be over by the end of the week as charges 
against Clinton are in deep trouble and acquittal seems virtually 
assured. Senators are now looking toward a censure resolution that 
could unify Republicans and Democrats in a strong condemnation of 
his conduct.

said today company officials have asked Brad Silverberg, who led 
Microsoft operating systems upgrades through the past decade, to 
return from a leave of absence. The Times said Microsoft has

recently driven to negotiate by NATO threats. Today, the warring 
factions met separately with mediators at a French chateau, 
agreeing upon 10 basic principles, including keeping what remains 
of Yugoslavia intact. Kosovo's ethnic Albanians would have to give

<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A new study indicates that high blood pressure  
can be lowered significantly with a healthy diet and without the 
need for hypertension medication, particularly among blacks. 
Researchers reached their conclusions, published in tomorrow's 
edition of the Archives of Internal Medicine, after examining the 
effects of three dietary patterns on blood pressure in adults with 
normal-but-high to high blood pressure. Researchers focused on 
black participants because studies have shown that blacks are about 
40 percent more likely than whites to have high blood pressure.

violence took place in remote areas of Kashmir, where several 
groups are fighting for independence from India or for a merger

<HEADLINE> Trump Promoted Miss USA Pageant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRANSON, Mo. (AP) -- Promoting his Miss USA Pageant, Donald Trump  
enjoyed being a big fish in a small pond, dazzling the Ozarks 
locals with the same kind of banter that draws yawns in his 
hometown of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a great genius in the '80s. Then I was a great moron in  
the early '90s,'' Trump said. ``That's probably why I bought this 
pageant -- so I could get a date. Now they call me a genius again. 
It's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The pageant Friday crowned Miss New York Kimberly Ann Pressler,  
21. She'll now compete for the Miss Universe title in May. 
</P>
<P>
	The beauty pageant isn't Trump's only interest in Missouri. He  
recently made on offer to buy Kansas City's troubled Flamingo 
Hilton Casino. Still, the New York real estate developer said 
leaving the Big Apple to visit Branson was more pleasure than 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually, I build buildings. I have to deal with the unions,  
the Mob, some of the roughest men you've ever seen in your life,'' 
he said. ``I come here and see these incredible beauties. It's a 
lot of fun.''

<HEADLINE> Italians To Testify in Gondola Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C. (AP) -- Twenty-two Italians who say they saw a  
Marine Corps jet flying too low shortly before it sent 20 people in 
a gondola to their deaths are expected to be the first witnesses in 
the court-martial of the jet's pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Richard Ashby is charged with 20 counts of involuntary  
manslaughter in the February 1998 accident in which his EA-6B 
Prowler jet snapped a gondola car cable over the village of 
Cavalese. 
</P>
<P>
	People from Italy, Poland, Belgium, Germany, Austria and the  
Netherlands were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening arguments were to begin Monday morning, with at least 21  
relatives of victims expected to attend at United States' 
government expense. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby, 31, of Mission Viejo, Calif., says he didn't know the  
cable was strung across the valley until seconds before hitting it. 
Ashby and his three-man crew were based at a the Cherry Point 
Marine Air Station and assigned to the Aviano, Italy, air base for 
flights over Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
	A military investigation concluded the jet was flying recklessly  
low and too fast, in violation of flight rules. Jets were not 
supposed to fly lower than 1,000 feet in the area. The cable was 
370 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Frank Spinner said Ashby's map didn't have the  
gondola on it. He said the pilot was also hampered by an optical 
illusion that made him think he was higher than he was. 
</P>
<P>
	There also is a question about whether the plane's radar  
altimeter was working properly. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby faces a maximum possible sentence of more than 200 years  
in prison if convicted of all 20 counts as well as charges of 
destruction of private and military property and dereliction of 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby's navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, 31, of Westbury,  
N.Y., faces the same charges as Ashby. His trial is scheduled to 
begin March 1.

	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- If the Olympic bribery scandal has thrown  
a harsh spotlight on Salt Lake, it's nothing like the scrutiny the 
city will face three years from Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	That's when the 2002 Winter Games themselves begin and Utah's  
capital will be striving to show the world it is a worthy Olympic 
host. 
</P>
<P>
	Will the city be ready?  
</P>
<P>
	``The commitment has never been higher,'' Gov. Mike Leavitt  
says. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, by most measures, Salt Lake is well on its way in  
preparing for the winter athletes and the competition from Feb. 
8-24, 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of its venues -- bobsled, luge, figure skating, slalom,  
freestyle skiing and snowboarding -- already are staging national 
and international competitions. The ice for men's hockey in West 
Valley City and curling in Ogden have been in use for a couple 
years and the women's hockey rink in Provo will be finished in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	The University of Utah stadium that will hold 56,000 people for  
the opening and closing ceremonies has been remodeled. Road work 
near mountain venues gets under way this spring. 
</P>
<P>
	The last venues -- a covered speed-skating oval in Kearns, ski  
jumps at the Utah Winter Sports Park, cross-country trails at 
Wasatch State Park, downhill and super-G runs at Snowbasin and the 
Olympic Village -- are on schedule to be finished no later than 18 
months ahead of the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are exactly where we need to be,'' says Grant Thomas, the  
managing director of games venues. 
</P>
<P>
	About the only thing delayed by the scandal is the debut of the  
games' mascot, which was to have been unveiled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake is in good shape in part because it was building  
venues even before it won the now-controversial vote of the 
International Olympic Committee in 1995. Investigators have found 
that before the vote, the bid committee gave more than $1 million 
in cash, free medical care, travel and scholarships to IOC members 
or their relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	It also helps that the Salt Lake Organizing Committee last fall  
finally finished a detailed budget, which is as much a road map for 
preparations of the games as it is a projection of revenue and 
expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``What encourages me the most is that through all this  
craziness, the venue people and sports people have stayed at work 
and the projects are still on track,'' said Jim Page, assistant 
executive director for sports at the U.S. Olympic Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC is even confident about sponsor and volunteer support,  
the two aspects most at risk in the Olympic movement's biggest 
corruption scandal. Investigators all across the Olympic world are 
looking at whether Salt Lake's bid committee spent lavishly on IOC 
members to land the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Joklik, who resigned as SLOC president and is awaiting a  
successor, thinks wary corporate sponsors will come around once the 
scandal fades. 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC has commitments for 70 percent of its budgeted $1.4 billion  
in revenue, and needs $350 million more in commitments from 
corporate sponsors. Joklik expects the goal will be reached within 
only a few months of the August target date. Ticket sales are 
counted as commitments because SLOC has little doubt they will sell 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	``To sponsor the Olympics is an investment that has been tried  
and proven to be worthwhile,'' Joklik said. ``There are few people 
who doubt the Olympics in Salt Lake are going to be very 
successful. Sponsors have to take that into account.'' 
</P>
<P>
	SLOC long has promised to cut spending if there are revenue  
shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
	As for volunteers, ``applications have been coming in thick and  
fast,'' Joklik says. ``We haven't seen the slightest 
disaffection.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC continues to get 20 phone calls a day from those  
interested in joining the 8,000 volunteers needed for test events, 
18,000 for the games themselves and 6,000 working afterward on the 
Paralympic Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	If volunteer enthusiasm is not eroded by the scandal, that's a  
good thing, said John Lucas, a retired Penn State professor and 
Olympics expert. 
</P>
<P>
	``You need these people desperately. They are not just pouring  
coffee for people lost on Peachtree Street,'' Lucas said. ``They 
are essential to any huge international sporting event.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC, for instance, will be using -- and training -- 1,500  
volunteers at figure skating's weeklong U.S. Nationals, which began 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	It is the successful staging of such test events that will  
assure athletes and the Olympic community that Salt Lake, though 
bruised, is capable of putting on world-class competitions. 
</P>
<P>
	And that's particularly important since the city does not have a  
tradition of holding international events, says Page. 
</P>
<P>
	He points to the World Cup bobsled and skeleton races in  
December at the Utah Winter Sports Park near Park City. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to convince the world that you know what you're  
doing. If you don't, they want to get involved, they want to tell 
you how to prepare the ice for the bob run. We were frankly worried 
about that,'' Page said. ``The Europeans went away saying, `Well, 
OK, you can handle it.''' 
</P>
<P>
	The scandal is far from over, however. Investigations by the  
Justice Department and a USOC ethics panel are continuing, and an 
independent Salt Lake ethics panel will issue its report Tuesday on 
the bid committee's misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	But, the governor says, the state's residents seem more  
determined than ever to put on a good show. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defining moment of the games will not be February 1999,''  
Leavitt says. ``The defining moment of the games will be February 
2002.''

<HEADLINE> Turgeon's Back Holds Up in Downhill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Again, Melanie Turgeon carried the hopes of  
Canada on her back. This time, her back was up to the task. 
</P>
<P>
	Turgeon's season has been marred by a back injury during summer  
training, and periodically it has kept her from performing up to 
her potential -- or at all. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Sunday, thanks to some intensive treatment, her back  
didn't plague her during the women's downhill at the World Alpine 
Ski Championships. The result was a seventh-place finish that was 
the best for a North American. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an excellent physio, Allison Megeny, and she's been  
doing some excellent work on my back,'' Turgeon said, referring to 
the downhill squad's physiotherapist. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was bad, with some disk pain. I took some  
anti-inflammatories the last couple days. I'm feeling good and she 
did good work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Turgeon's time of 1 minute, 49.04 seconds was only .84 slower  
than gold medalist Renate Goetschl of Austria and just .67 back of 
bronze medalist Stefanie Schuster of Austria, the third of four 
Austrians at the top of the downhill standings. 
</P>
<P>
	That performance was far different than Turgeon's effort in the  
super-G, the first women's event of the championships. Skiing 
despite a lot of pain in her back, Turgeon's body wasn't up to the 
task and she finished only 19th, 1.75 seconds back. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the race, Gord Vincent, director of public relations for  
Alpine Canada, said, ``Canada really needs a good one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It got it from Turgeon, the 22-year-old, eight-year World Cup  
veteran who made her mark by winning two golds, a silver and two 
bronzes at the World Junior Championships in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just take the Austrians out of the way, and I'm on the  
podium,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little disadvantaged starting the season, with my lack  
of training and my back problems and everything. And I've been 
racing by myself all season, with nobody to push me. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Austrians have a big, strong team that is not only  
competing against the rest of the girls, they're competing against 
the (Austrian) guys. If the guys win medals, the girls have to win 
medals or else they don't get the respect they deserve in 
Austria.''

<HEADLINE> Missing Boys Safe at Idaho Resort </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANDPOINT, Idaho (AP) -- Five teen-age boys who spent the night  
lost on a northern Idaho ski resort that was raked by a snowstorm 
were safe Sunday after three found their way home and two were 
spotted by snowmobilers. 
</P>
<P>
	``There wasn't much to do but keep yourself huddled together,''  
said 15-year-old Aaron Baudry-Peterson, among the three boys who 
found their way home. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just sat there and you didn't get any sleep,'' he said.  
``So I sat there and I prayed all night long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two boys who were found by snowmobilers -- Canadian brothers  
A.J. Kolla, 13, and his 15-year-old brother Mike -- were in good 
condition Sunday afternoon at Schweitzer Mountain ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``The younger boy possibly has frostbitten hands,'' one searcher  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, wind gusts of up to 50 mph combined with 18 inches  
of snow to create extreme avalanche danger and snow drifts up to 10 
feet. Temperatures at the base of the resort dipped to 23 degrees 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of three boys -- all 15 and part of a separate skiing  
party from the Canadian brothers-- trekked through waist-deep snow 
to get to safety Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Another of the boys was identified as Justin Haeger; the fifth  
boy was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	The three boys, who had been on an outing with a church group  
from Spokane, Wash., about 70 miles southwest of here, said they 
had been snowboarding and had not seen out-of-bound signs. They 
spent the night inside a snow cave they had built as refuge against 
the overnight storm and started walking downhill around dawn. 
</P>
<P>
	They said they followed train whistles to find the base of the  
mountain and eventually reached the home of Bill Findley, a member 
of the sheriff's search and rescue team who was home sick. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were soaked clear through and shaking,'' said Findley.  
``Their hands were pure white.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bonner County sheriff's Cpl. Bob Howard said the boys were  
suffering from frostbite and one was ``pretty ill.'' They were 
taken to a hospital in Sandpoint for treatment and released. 
</P>
<P>
	The Schweitzer resort has more than 2,400 acres of ski runs and  
is located in the Selkirk Mountains. The peaks near the resort 
exceed 6,000 feet.

<HEADLINE> Low Blows Mar Boxing Doubleheader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Low blows played a part in both world title  
fights at the Washington Convention Center on Saturday night. And 
that's not counting the cheap shots Bernard Hopkins feels he's been 
dealt by the sport of boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopkins put Robert Allen to the canvass twice with low blows in  
the fourth round and went on to retain his IBF middleweight title 
with a technical knockout in the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharmba Mitchell, who lay in agony after a low shot in the  
seventh round, recovered to retain his WBA super-lightweight title 
with a unanimous decision over Pedro Saiz. 
</P>
<P>
	``You hate to get hit in the (groin),'' Mitchell said,  
appropriately summing up the night. ``It hurt. It made me mad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After his victory, Hopkins stormed out of the ring. An outspoken  
proponent of boxing reform, the champ said the sport was trying to 
blackball him because of his stance against promoters, whom he 
assailed in recent hearing in New York on the business of 
professional boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They tried to blackball me from the world of boxing, but they  
can't do it,'' Hopkins said. ``I don't like a lot of stuff that 
goes on in this business. I'm standing up for my rights. Fighters 
are taken advantage of. It was a disgrace I was only paid $225,000 
for this fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can beat (former WBC champion) Keith Holmes. I can beat (WBA  
champ) William Joppy,'' Hopkins said. ``They can have the three 
belts. It won't make me any money. I can't take three belts to the 
electric company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fight, a rematch of a controversial no contest bout in  
August, wasn't any prettier than Hopkins' remarks. After the two 
low blows, Hopkins dominated the rest of the way, dropping Allen in 
the sixth round before referee Rudy Battle stopped the bout after a 
flurry of punches at 1:18 of the seventh. 
</P>
<P>
	``The low blows took a little bit out of me,'' Allen said. ``Not  
that much, though. I saw white when he hit me'' with the low blows. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think I hit him low,'' Hopkins said. ``He felt my  
power and he was afraid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hopkins, of Philadelphia, improved his record to 35-2-1 with 27  
knockouts. Allen, of Atlanta, fell to 23-3 with 18 KOs. Both 
fighters weighed 159 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The first time the fighters met, on Aug. 28, Hopkins was  
inadvertently pushed through the ropes by the referee near the end 
of the fourth round. Hopkins fell to the floor and injured his 
ankle, and the bout was ruled a no contest. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Mitchell-Saiz fight, Saiz, who had earlier been warned  
for low blows, buckled Mitchell with a left hook to the groin early 
in the seventh. Mitchell cried out in pain, and the fight was 
stopped for about two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	When it resumed, Mitchell was fired up and produced one of his  
best flurries in a fight that saw the two left-handers land scores 
of punches. In the end, Mitchell hurt Saiz more than Saiz hurt 
Mitchell -- Saiz had to stop at one point in the ninth round because 
of blood in his eye -- and the champion was the clear winner on all 
three of judge's scorecards. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hurt my hand in the fourth throwing a hook,'' said Mitchell,  
his right hand heavily iced. ``I think I might have broken it. ... 
I only had two weeks to prepare. I wanted to knock him out, but it 
wasn't to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives from Mitchell's camp said late Sunday his hand  
was only bruised. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitchell, of Takoma Park, Md., improved his record to 44-2 with  
29 knockouts. Saiz, of New York, is 23-5-3 with 16 KOs. Both 
fighters weighed 140 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hopkins-Allen bout was the only survivor in what was once  
billed as a rare title tripleheader featuring three middleweight 
world champions. 
</P>
<P>
	WBC champ Hassine Cherifi was to fight Holmes in a rematch, but  
Cherifi pulled a back muscle in his final sparring session in 
France. Joppy was to defend his belt against Darren Obah, but the 
WBA champ suffered a cracked vertebrae in an automobile accident 
last month.

<HEADLINE> Senators Look to Censure Option </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a perjury charge in deep trouble and  
acquittal virtually assured, senators on Sunday looked beyond 
President Clinton's impeachment trial to a censure resolution that 
could unify Republicans and Democrats in a strong condemnation of 
his conduct. But even censure had opposition. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire impeachment drama appears certain to be over by the  
end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	Several senators said the article alleging grand jury perjury --  
one of two impeachment articles approved by the House on Dec. 19 -- 
could fail to muster even a majority, despite the Republicans' 
55-45 edge in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	And almost everyone involved agreed that the remaining article --  
charging Clinton with obstructing justice -- will fall short of the 
two-thirds majority needed to convict Clinton and eject him from 
the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Working with Democrats on the post-trial alternative of censure,  
Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, said it was still ``very much up in 
the air'' whether language will be found to gain the 60 votes that 
are needed to overcome an expected filibuster. 
</P>
<P>
	With videotaped images of Monica Lewinsky fresh in senators'  
minds, House prosecutors and the Clinton defense team spent the day 
packaging familiar evidence into closing statements to be delivered 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton himself will be away when closing arguments start --  
attending the funeral of Jordan's King Hussein along with national 
leaders from around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	When the roll is called on acquittal or conviction, likely  
Thursday or Friday, almost all Democrats are expected to oppose 
both impeachment articles. However Democrat Sen. Robert Byrd of 
West Virginia, sometimes called the conscience of the Senate, would 
not rule out voting for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is, does this rise to the level of high crimes  
and misdemeanors? I say ``yes,'' said Byrd, who clearly was 
wrestling with his decision despite his earlier and unsuccessful 
motion to dismiss the case entirely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no doubt that he has given false testimony under oath,  
and that he has misled the American people and ... there are 
indications that he did indeed obstruct justice ... '' the Senate 
elder said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Byrd also said Clinton has ``done a lot of good things'' has  
the support of the public, and ``in the interest of our country, I 
may come to the conclusion that we should not remove him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While some Democrats predicted that neither the perjury nor the  
obstruction of justice articles would receive a majority of 51, let 
alone the 67 votes needed for conviction, the perjury count 
appeared to be in the most trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., said on ``Fox News Sunday'' that ``at  
least one'' of the counts -- obstruction -- would receive a majority 
because House managers showed ``a clear pattern here that the 
president was trying to obstruct justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., said on ABC that ``I ... have  
raised all along some questions of whether or not this case is not 
porous in nature. Both counts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Taking ``a Sunday guess,'' Shelby said 10 to 15 Republicans  
might vote for acquittal on perjury, while obstruction would 
capture stronger support for conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, said on Fox the prosecutors  
did ``a very good job'' on the obstruction count and predicted, ``I 
do think there will be over 50 votes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bennett described his censure language as ``a work in progress''  
and said on CBS's ``Face the Nation'' that he's unable to predict 
``with any kind of certainty'' that it would receive enough 
bipartisan backing to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Draft censure language floated by Bennett and Sen. Dianne  
Feinstein, D-Calif., calls the president's conduct ``shameless, 
reckless, and indefensible,'' and says ``he deliberately misled and 
deceived the American people and officials in all branches of the 
United States government. He gave false and misleading testimony 
and impeded discovery of evidence in judicial proceedings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein explained on NBC's ``Meet the Press'' that she's  
looking for an expression ``outside of conviction and removal that 
will go down in history, that will also become part of the legacy 
of this president, that, in essence, will say we find these acts to 
be egregious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on CBS that a censure ``does  
help the Democrats'' but said it would be preferable to leaving the 
whole matter with votes of acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does leave you with sort of an empty feeling and that's  
why, depending upon the words, it may have some appeal on the 
Republican side,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, called the censure language  
``awfully weak'' and said it was a ``covering your fanny 
approach.'' He said he would offer amendments, an approach that 
could amount to a filibuster to kill any censure plan that lacked 
60 votes. 
</P>
<P>
	If the censure issue isn't considered immediately after a vote  
on the impeachment articles this week, ``I really doubt if people 
are going to want to turn to this again'' after next week's 
traditional week-long February recess, said Sen. Orrin Hatch, 
R-Utah.

<HEADLINE> Weather Gives Bridge Growing Pains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- The Casco Bay Bridge linking Portland and  
South Portland boasts a sophisticated computer system that operates 
one of the largest drawbridge spans in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	It's great when it works, but its failings have earned it the  
nickname ``bridge from hell'' from Portland's police chief. 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen months after the $130 million bridge opened, it's still  
going through what some call ``growing pains.'' Those who are 
inconvenienced when the drawbridge gets stuck just call it a 
``pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a disaster for people who use the bridge going in  
either direction,'' said Chief Michael Chitwood. ``Certainly the 
span was built to enhance the flow of traffic and to make river 
traffic more conducive. But it's been a nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is the bridge, which relies on computers and  
hundreds of sensors, can't handle Maine's tough winter weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Too much wind or ice means the traffic gates won't work. Bitter  
cold causes the drawbridge's lubricants to congeal, stopping the 
spans in their tracks while traffic backs up in both directions. 
Corrosion from road salt and sand causes sensors to malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
	Modjeski &AMP; Masters Inc., the Pennsylvania bridge designer, has  
built similar spans but none exactly like the ``state of the art'' 
Casco Bay Bridge, said Eugene Waldner, senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	Waldner described the operational problems as ``relatively  
minor,'' affecting about 2 percent of the bridge openings. ``I do 
not believe there is an inherent design problem,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Transportation is happy overall but  
acknowledges problems are not ``relatively minor'' for those 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Doe, construction engineer for the Maine Department of  
Transportation, said the bridge delays and unplanned closures are 
``super unacceptable'' for motorists and ship captains. 
</P>
<P>
	``What we need to do is get ourselves into a situation with 100  
percent reliability,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the bridge opened with fireworks in August 1997, there  
have been more than 20 instances when the drawbridge has failed, 
including three just last month, said Everett Barnard, bridge 
maintenance engineer for the DOT. 
</P>
<P>
	There is little recourse for angry motorists other than to wait  
it out. Unlike the old bridge, there is no way to turn around. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the same for tanker captains and tug boat operators who  
have had to put on the brakes to avoid crashing into the drawbridge 
when the spans failed to lift. They must either anchor or reverse 
because there is no room for large vessels to turn around in the 
Fore River. 
</P>
<P>
	The longest the drawbridge was out of commission was for three  
days last March because of electrical problems, Barnard said. The 
32,000 motorists who use the bridge each day had to find another 
route. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard has urged tanker pilots and tugboat operators to  
call the bridge early to make sure the spans go up, frustrating 
motorists who must wait longer for the ship to pass through. 
</P>
<P>
	Coast Guard Ensign Wade Gough said it's better for motorists to  
have to wait a little longer than to have another accident like the 
one involving the Julie N, a tanker that smashed into the old 
bridge in 1996, spilling 180,000 gallons of oil into Portland 
Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
	The old bridge, built in 1916, was demolished to make way for  
its successor. The new bridge does not have to raise its spans -- 
230 feet in the air -- for ships that are under 65 feet tall at mean 
tide. That height means it opens less frequently than the old 
bridge. But the wait is longer: about 14 minutes instead of 9 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Portland and South Portland have installed blinking signs to  
warn motorists when the bridge is up so they have the option of 
taking an alternate route. That has helped some. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the problems, it's not all doom and gloom, Barnard said.  
</P>
<P>
	When the bridge works -- which it does the majority of the time --  
it is a smooth, quiet process, he said. And, most importantly, the 
new bridge is safer for ships because the throughfare at 196 feet 
is twice as wide as the old bridge in which tankers had only inches 
of clearance when they passed underneath. 
</P>
<P>
	The old bridge ran manually and did not have the safety elements  
of the new mile-long bridge, said Ralph Knight, who has raised the 
drawbridge on the Fore River for more than 25 years. Now when the 
bridge goes up and down it's a flick of a switch and the sensors do 
all the work. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-foot control panel in the bridge house lights up with  
red, green and yellow lights, and bridge operators, like Knight, 
oversee the event to make sure it goes as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``In all fairness, it's an extremely complex structure,''  
Barnard said. ``It looks simple but if you go into the (control) 
building it's extremely complex and I think with all the parts 
we've got there, we are fortunate to have these small problems 
instead of big problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said people need to work together to make things go  
smoothly on the new bridge. He said that includes motorists who 
should enjoy the quiet interlude that the raised spans afford a 
motorist. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're living in an instant society -- instant coffee and  
instant tea and everything is snap, snap, snap! We all need to slow 
down,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> NYC Rally Protests Police Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- About 1,000 people rallied Sunday outside the  
home of a West African immigrant who died when police fired 41 
shots at him. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are going to fight for justice and not accept anything  
else,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who organized the protest 
outside the brick apartment house in the Bronx where Amadou Diallo 
lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. Attorney's office has begun investigating  
the case and a grand jury convened by the Bronx district attorney 
is expected to begin reviewing evidence on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Diallo, 22, who immigrated from Guinea two years ago and worked  
as a street peddler, died in the vestibule of the building after 
being hit 19 times by four police officers early Thursday morning. 
The officers were looking for a rapist and thought Diallo had a 
gun, but no gun was found. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the protest attracted activists from various causes,  
many who attended were average people and neighborhood residents 
upset and angered by what they perceived as a terrible injustice. 
</P>
<P>
	``That was an execution, plain and simple,'' said Donald Cox,  
19.

<HEADLINE> Teen the Focus of Deadly Love Spats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LYONS, N.Y. (AP) -- In this Erie Canal village, two teen-age love  
spats ended in two killings. Amanda Leoni got caught in the middle 
both times, first as helpless onlooker and then, 15 months later, 
as prey. 
</P>
<P>
	The spats should have ended harmlessly, like adolescent tussles  
do every day in towns big and small. Instead, the ordinary stuff of 
life turned deadly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have to say everyone still is confused and wondering what  
went wrong. It's nothing you can anticipate,'' said Mayor John 
Salone, taking a break from chef duties at his Cafe Roma 
restaurant. ``Unfortunately, a lot of people just shrug it off as 
`another day in the life.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Polly Smith, 18, goes on trial for second-degree murder Monday,  
accused of running her car over Leoni last August for wooing a 
20-year-old man whom Smith had dated on and off for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Leoni, also 18, was fatally injured just a block from her home  
in a sylvan neighborhood of Victorian-era houses with roomy front 
porches. She had returned for the summer after her first year in 
college in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was the nicest, kindest person I've ever known,'' said  
Jenn Pullen, Leoni's best friend since childhood and Smith's second 
cousin. ``She did everything she could to avoid this happening and 
it happened anyways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Popular and bright, the baby-faced Leoni had just been through  
the worst year she could imagine. Some people in this county seat 
of 4,200 people blamed her for her boyfriend's death and, by way of 
taunts and dirty looks, never let her forget it. 
</P>
<P>
	In May 1997, in Leoni's driveway, Christopher Heise died of a  
knife wound to the heart during a fight over her affections with 
his 16-year-old high school buddy, Gavin Dinneen. 
</P>
<P>
	Heise, who was heading into the Air Force, knew his two-year  
courtship of Leoni had turned cool but wasn't ready for someone 
else nosing in. Riled at the sight of Dinneen in her car, he jumped 
in with fists flying. Dinneen reached for a hunting knife hidden in 
his boot. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first teen slaying in the village's memory.  
</P>
<P>
	Dinneen was acquitted of criminally negligent homicide. Jurors  
decided he had acted in fearful self-defense. 
</P>
<P>
	A year later, Smith made no secret of her dismay when Leoni  
quietly began going out with her boyfriend, 20-year-old Justin 
Smith, who came from a neighboring town. She mocked Leoni over 
Heise's fate and a witness, Adam Zulauf, alleges she even 
threatened last June to ``kill her with my car ... if I see her 
walking down the street.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the night of Aug. 24, the two women exchanged angry words,  
followed by Justin Smith telling Leoni he was finished with her. 
</P>
<P>
	Leoni walked away down Church Street, in the middle of a  
thunderstorm, and Polly Smith leaped behind the wheel of her car. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told police the car hit Leoni hard enough to knock her  
over and then Smith accelerated, jamming her under the engine. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith maintained she didn't mean to hit Leoni, only to scare  
her, and that she didn't see her in the dark.

<HEADLINE> Gibson's New Film a Big 'Payback' / Box Office  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Men looking for a post-Super Bowl jolt of  
action and violence found it in theaters this weekend as Mel 
Gibson's revenge film ``Payback'' had the biggest movie opening so 
far this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Starring Gibson as a crook racks up a body count after he's  
double-crossed, ``Payback'' collected $21.4 million in North 
America, knocking the teen romance ``She's All That'' to second 
place with $12 million, estimates showed Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply Irresistible,'' starring Sarah Michelle Gellar of TV's  
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' debuted with a disappointing $2.4 
million for ninth place. The film was stung by bad reviews and 
fierce competition in the youth market from ``She's All That'' and 
``Varsity Blues,'' which was fourth with $4 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Robin Williams' ``Patch Adams'' remained strong,  
collecting $4.5 million for third place. ``Patch'' got a boost from 
being double-billed in hundreds of theaters with sneak previews of 
``October Sky,'' which will be released Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	After a couple of weeks dominated by teen films, ``Payback'' had  
the older male audience mostly to itself. It was among the better 
debuts for a Gibson film, besting ``Conspiracy Theory'' and 
``Maverick'' but falling behind ``Lethal Weapon 4'' and ``Ransom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Gibson's ``Lethal Weapon'' movies, the audience for  
``Payback'' was about 55 percent male and mostly over age 25, 
according to Rob Friedman, vice chairman of the Paramount Motion 
Picture Group. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the studio held onto the film from the summer so it  
wouldn't clash with ``Lethal Weapon 4.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``February was a good time (for the film) because it's after  
football, after the Super Bowl, and adults start to come back to 
the movies in a big way again,'' Friedman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Also finding older audiences was ``Saving Private Ryan,'' which  
DreamWorks re-released to cash in on its Golden Globe wins and the 
buzz surrounding Tuesday's scheduled announcement of Oscar 
nominations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ryan,'' the No. 2 movie of 1998 after ``Armageddon,''  
collected $3.6 million for a fifth-place tie with another film with 
Oscar potential, ``Shakespeare in Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The quirky Bill Murray film ``Rushmore'' also did strong  
older-audience business in limited release, grossing $1.9 million 
on 103 screens for a healthy per-theater average of just under 
$18,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney plans to expand ``Rushmore'' to about 580 screens, hoping  
the film can stretch beyond the art house crowd and looking for an 
assist in the form of an Oscar nomination for Murray. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've done extremely well in the review-sensitive markets and  
as we expand it, we'll kind of hold this picture's hand, do it with 
kid gloves, and see where we end up,'' said Disney marketing 
executive Chuck Viane. 
</P>
<P>
	Once again, the weekend overall box office was down -- this time  
by 7.6 percent -- from the same time last year, when ``Titanic'' was 
shattering records and ``Good Will Hunting'' was charming 
audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Here are estimated grosses at North American theaters for Friday  
through Sunday. Final figures were expected Monday: 
</P>
<P>
	1. ``Payback,'' $21.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	2. ``She's All That,'' $12 million.  
</P>
<P>
	3. ``Patch Adams,'' $4.5 million.  
</P>
<P>
	4. ``Varsity Blues,'' $4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Saving Private Ryan,'' $3.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	5. ``Shakespeare in Love,'' $3.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	7. ``A Civil Action,'' $3.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
	8. ``Stepmom,'' $2.6 million.  
</P>
<P>
	9. ``Simply Irresistible,'' $2.4 million.  
</P>
<P>
	10. ``You've Got Mail,'' $2.3 million.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A rented vehicle collided with a truck on a  
road south of the Pacific Coast city of Mazatlan, killing eight 
people -- including six tourists from Minnesota, police said Sunday. 
Four others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport utility vehicle carrying eight people veered into an  
oncoming lane Saturday and collided with a truck carrying a Mexican 
family from the state of Jalisco, said local police spokesperson 
Marta Torres. 
</P>
<P>
	The tourists who died were identified as Linda Lee Haefner, 45;  
Eugene Melvin Oswald, 72; Pat Smith, 79; Jerry Smith, 62; Cynthia 
Gil Montes, 28, and Joyce Kirthart Patrick, 63. Police did not 
immediately have their hometowns in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed was Jose Torres, the driver of the truck, and his  
11-year-old son, whose name was not immediately available.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's economic crisis has sent  
the government's approval rating plunging to its lowest level, 
according to a poll released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll found 36 percent of Brazilians thought the government  
of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was ``bad or very bad,'' 39 
percent felt it was ``adequate'' and 21 percent said it was ``good 
or very good.'' Four percent had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were the worst since Cardoso took office in 1995,  
reported the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo, which published the 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso was re-elected for a second term in October on the  
strength of his successful economic policies. He was credited with 
bringing sky-high inflation down to only 2 percent in 1998 by 
pegging Brazil's currency to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brazil let its currency float freely on Jan. 13 to save its  
dwindling foreign reserves. The currency has since lost 33 percent 
of its value against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollsters Datafolha interviewed 2,076 Brazilians in 94 towns and  
cities Wednesday and Thursday. The margin of error was two 
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Husband Charged in Maryland Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT AIRY, Md. (AP) -- A man was charged with his wife's murder  
Sunday after state police found her body in a car parked at 
Baltimore-Washington International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Holt, 44, a scientific editor for the Journal of the  
National Cancer Institute, was being held pending a bail hearing on 
charges of first- and second-degree murder and manslaughter, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	State police contacted Holt on Jan. 20 after a family friend  
asked them to check on Nancy Holt, 43, said police Capt. Greg 
Shipley. 
</P>
<P>
	Holt had told the friend his wife was missing for two days but  
he had not contacted police, said police Capt. Greg Shipley. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, police found Mrs. Holt's body covered with a  
blanket on the floor of her car at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
	Police say they believe Holt strangled his wife at their home,  
drove her car to the airport parking lot and took a taxi home. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy was planned for Monday, Shipley said.  
</P>
<P>
	The couple have 11-year-old twins -- a boy and a girl -- and a  
9-year-old daughter, Shipley said.

 *Herman Herst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Herman Herst, a stamp collector, dealer,  
auctioneer and author who created his own postal service and had 
his dog deliver mail, died Jan. 31 at his home in Boca Raton, Fla. 
He was 89. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York-born Herst won scores of philatelic honors in  
Britain and the United States, including the American Philatelic 
Society's Luff Award. He was the only American ever elected to the 
board of the Philatelic Traders Society. 
</P>
<P>
	Herst, who once belonged to 81 stamp clubs, wrote 18 books and  
thousands of columns about stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1953, after discovering an 1862 law that allowed for  
supplemental postal service, Herst opened a private mail service in 
Shrub Oak, N.Y. His children and his German shepherd, Alfie, 
delivered mail for 2 cents a letter. A privately issued stamp 
depicting Alfie became a collectible. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1973, Herst left New York for Florida, where he quickly  
became the state's leading philatelist.

 *King Hussein    	
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Through a half-century of turmoil, Hussein  
bin Talal of Jordan grew from boy king to elder statesman, a symbol 
of endurance and a voice for peace in a landscape of crisis and 
war. He died Sunday of cancer at the age of 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Crowned at age 17 as monarch of a poor desert realm, King  
Hussein grew to command the attention of the world, as he did when 
he interceded, gray and stricken from cancer, at a crucial moment 
in the 1998 Middle East peace talks at the Wye Plantation to help 
break an Israeli-Palestinian deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
	It had been 50 years since Israel's founding set off the first  
of the wars between Arabs and Jews, flooding his country with 
Palestinian refugees, and 45 years since the teen-age prince took 
on what he later called ``the hazardous profession'' of king, to 
rule a nation even younger than himself. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years that followed, Hussein steered his kingdom into  
coexistence with the Jewish state, working to ensure Jordan's 
survival. But his ties to Israel and the West, and his often uneasy 
relations with the Palestinians who make up half the kingdom's 
population, plunged him into crisis after crisis with his fellow 
Arabs. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a lonely and arduous reign, over a tiny nation the size  
of Indiana, sandwiched between such powerful states as Iraq, 
Israel, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria. 
</P>
<P>
	He survived wars with Israel and a civil war, escaped repeated  
coup and assassination attempts, and twice battled cancer to become 
one of the world's longest-ruling leaders, one whose reign 
stretched from Stalin to Yeltsin, from Churchill to Blair, from 
Eisenhower to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein was born Nov. 14, 1935, a descendent of Hashem,  
great-grandfather of Mohammed, the 7th-century prophet of Islam. He 
studied in Amman and Cairo, and at Britain's Harrow prep school and 
Sandhurst Military Academy. 
</P>
<P>
	His rule began after his father, King Talal, abdicated because  
of mental illness.

 *Wassily Leontief    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Wassily Leontief, an academic who won a Nobel  
prize in 1973 for his economic analyses of America's production 
machinery, died Friday. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Leontief's so-called input-output analytical method became a  
permanent part of production planning and forecasting in various 
industrialized nations and in private corporations around the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
	He taught at Harvard for 44 years before joining New York  
University, where he taught into his 90s and directed the Institute 
for Economic Analysis from 1975 until 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Leontief was born in St. Petersburg, Russia and left to attend  
the University of Berlin, where he completed his doctorate in 1929. 
He then spent a year as an economist advising the Government of 
China before coming to the United States.

<HEADLINE> Avalanches in West Leave 5 Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRUCKEE, Calif. (AP) -- An avalanche in the Sierra Nevada buried  
four people for hours, killing one, while three men died in an 
avalanche in the Colorado Rockies and a man on snowshoes was 
engulfed in a massive slide in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	In California, where 2 feet of snow recently fell in the Lake  
Tahoe area, three men and a woman were sledding Saturday afternoon 
when a block of snow gave way. 
</P>
<P>
	All four people were buried in up to 6 feet of snow as they  
walked along the shore of a lake in the northern Sierra Nevada, 35 
miles west of Reno, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	Derek Lerch, 21, said he and Harry Eichelberger, 21, of Chicago,  
were buried close enough to each other that they could talk. But 
they lost contact with their friends and assumed they were dead. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were talking about our best options,'' Lerch said. ``At  
first, I made a vent that I could breathe through. Harry used the 
vent with me for the next several hours until we lost oxygen. He 
then decided to climb out. It wasn't easy, but he made it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eichelberger, who was buried for four hours, reached a nearby  
cabin across the lake at 9:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	About 15 cabin occupants -- young members of a Dartmouth College  
alumni group -- quickly responded. Wearing headlamps and using 
rakes, brooms and mops as probes, they dug out the other three. 
</P>
<P>
	A glove sticking out of the snow led them to Lerch, who was  
aching under the weight of the snow. 
</P>
<P>
	University of California, Berkeley student Malcolm Russell Hart,  
21, of Dover, N.H., died of cardiac arrest after being dug out. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were cold as could be,'' said Lerch, of Chico. ``Harry and  
I shivered for half an hour at the cabin.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The three were being treated for hypothermia.  
</P>
<P>
	``They had air pockets. They were lucky,'' said Nancy Colhoun, a  
nursing supervisor at Tahoe Forest Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	In Colorado, three men were skiing and snowboarding Saturday  
with friends in the central Rockies, 130 miles southwest of Denver, 
when a half-mile avalanche engulfed them. 
</P>
<P>
	Killed were Andrew P. Vork, 19, of Parker, Colo., Casey James  
McKenny, 19, of Marquette, Mich., and Matthew Alan Noddin, 22, of 
Portland, Maine, the Gunnison Country Sheriff's office said. 
</P>
<P>
	The men were taken to the site by snowmobile, which may have  
caused the snow to collapse, officials said. A fourth man, 
apparently on the edge of the avalanche, managed to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	In Utah, Justin Hiel, 22, was snowshoeing with two friends  
Saturday afternoon in a canyon 10 miles south of Salt Lake City 
when he decided to turn back to get warmer clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiel's friends saw an avalanche shortly afterward and could not  
find him. His body was found several hours later in a snow slide 20 
feet deep.

<HEADLINE> Class Given in Writing Love Letters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Nicole Urdang's suitor poured his heart  
through his pen onto every inch of the paper. He wrote not one page 
but 12. And not one string of words, but two, filling each lined 
space, so great was his devotion. 
</P>
<P>
	Urdang read and read. And read and read and read and read.  
</P>
<P>
	``It was so annoying. There are no words to say how annoying,''  
she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Ouch.  
</P>
<P>
	Had the suitor known. Everlasting love is one thing; a  
never-ending love letter is quite another. Two pages max is the 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Oh yes, ye smitten ones. There are rules.  
</P>
<P>
	Urdang, a psychotherapist who navigates couples through rough  
relationship waters, shares love letter-writing guidelines -- just 
in time for Valentine's Day -- at a seminar offered through Just 
Buffalo Literary Center. 
</P>
<P>
	A full class of eight -- six men and two women -- signed on for  
the three-hour tutorial in what, in this age of e-mail, may be a 
dying art. Will there ever be more like Elizabeth Barrett 
Browning's sonnets to her husband: ``How do I love thee? Let me 
count the ways ...''? Or Theodore Roosevelt's missives to Alice: 
``Oh, my sweetest true love, pray for nothing but that I may be 
worthy of you''? 
</P>
<P>
	Urdang, also a poet, hopes so. Love letters, handwritten and  
signed pledges of passion, can infuse existing relationships with 
romance and excitement. ``And if you're trying to woo someone, 
there's nothing as delightful as getting a love letter,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Provided it's not 12 tiny-print pages.  
</P>
<P>
	There are other don'ts, Urdang tells her class, one of them a  
musician hoping to learn to write better ballads. She reads from 
Aldous Huxley's ``Point Counter Point'' in which Everard Webley 
writes to Elinor of his unrequited love: 
</P>
<P>
	``I warn you: one of these days I'll try the good old methods.  
I'll do a slight Rape of the Sabines and then where will your 
ineffable, remote superiority be? How I hate you really for 
compelling me to love you so much! ... And you not here to receive 
the punishment you deserve!'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not a sterling example, Urdang cautions, ``but it's too fetching  
in its badness not to mention.'' (And one student observes: ``Write 
that today and you'd be charged with harassment.'') 
</P>
<P>
	Better, Urdang says, is to sound a little vulnerable. Let your  
intended know you're open to being rejected. But not too 
vulnerable: ``There's nothing more unappealing than someone 
approaching you in a sniveling way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other ``dos'' from Urdang:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Tune into your feelings. Are you missing her? Craving him?  
Thinking about the future together? ``If you take the time to 
examine what you really feel about the person, you'll probably have 
the words.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Use humor. ``Someone who makes you laugh is someone whose  
company you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Be accurate. ``If they have blue eyes and you sing the praises  
of their brown eyes, you're not going to get the points.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Show you were listening by mentioning a favorite movie or  
song. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Write, don't type, especially when signing your name.  
</P>
<P>
	Other don'ts:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Don't rush.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Don't overdo it. ``If it sounds like too much to you, it  
probably is,'' Urdang says. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Don't use disclaimers like ``You probably don't know me but  
... .'' You don't want to start out dissing yourself. ``Who's going 
to be attracted to someone who's insecure?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is really an incredible dance to achieve all of this  
together,'' she admits, and offers this final tip: 
</P>
<P>
	``People who think you can overuse the word `love,' are crazy.  
You can never overuse positive words.''

<HEADLINE> Delahoussaye Wins 6,000th Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Eddie Delahoussaye became the 14th jockey  
in North American horse racing history to win 6,000 races with his 
victory Sunday at Santa Anita Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Delahoussaye's win in the third race was on Sweetcakesanshakes,  
a 4-year-old filly who won by 4 1/2 lengths in the six-furlong $50,000 
allowance race for fillies and mares. The filly was owned by Mike 
Willman and Nikki Hunt and trained by Leonard Dorfman. 
</P>
<P>
	Clifford C. Goodrich, Santa Anita's vice-president and general  
manager, gave Delahoussaye a crystal sculpture of a horse's head to 
commemorate the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
	Delahoussaye, 47, previously won five Triple Crown races  
including two Kentucky Derbies, Seven Breeders' Cup events and was 
selected to racing's Hall of Fame. He started riding thoroughbreds 
in 1967 in New Orleans and rode his first winner in June 29, 1968. 
</P>
<P>
	Other jockeys who have won 6,000 races include Bill Shoemaker,  
Laffit Pincay Jr., Pat Day, David Gall, Angel Cordero Jr., Jorge 
Velasquez, Chris McCarron, Sandy Hawley, Russell Baze, Larry 
Snyder, Carl Gambardella, Earlie Fires and John Longden.

<HEADLINE> White House Outlines Anti-Drug Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hammering home the need for a drug-control  
strategy that measures success and failure, the Clinton 
administration is announcing a five-part plan designed to cut the 
size of the nation's drug problem in half by 2007. 
</P>
<P>
	In a three-volume report to Congress, White House drug policy  
director Barry McCaffrey said drugs cost the country more than 
14,000 lives annually, despite a nationwide effort that includes 
close to $18 billion spent this year by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said that while ``there is some encouraging  
progress in the struggle against drugs, ... the social costs of 
drug use continue to climb.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a message to Congress, Clinton said that among the positive  
signs are a growing view among young people that drugs are risky 
and a continuing decline in cocaine production overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Studies demonstrate that when our children understand the  
dangers of drugs, their rates of drug use drop,'' said Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The five parts of the administration plan are educating  
children, decreasing the addicted population, breaking the cycle of 
drugs and crime, securing the nation's borders from drugs and 
reducing the supply of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
	The blend of strategies is aimed at reducing the use and  
availability of drugs by 50 percent by 2007, 25 percent by 2002. 
Achieving the goal would mean just 3 percent of the U.S. household 
population aged 12 and over would be using illegal drugs. The 
current figure is 6.4 percent. In 1979, the rate was near 15 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore said ``this strategy takes us into the  
next century with a goal of dramatic reductions in the supply and 
demand for drugs and a real chance of giving our children drug-free 
communities in which to grow up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With Clinton attending the funeral of Jordan's King Hussein,  
formal presentation of the plan Monday was being handled by Gore 
and McCaffrey. Advance copies were made available Sunday evening. 
</P>
<P>
	A major piece of the drug-control effort: an advertising  
campaign that generates more than $195 million a year in matching 
contributions from media companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``The strategy seeks to involve parents, coaches, mentors,  
teachers, clergy and other role models in a broad prevention 
campaign,'' said McCaffrey, head of the Office of National Drug 
Control Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	A cornerstone of the strategy is accountability for the wide  
array of current anti-drug programs, with boosts for those that 
work and the ability to identify swiftly and repair those that 
aren't producing results. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past, Congress had been critical because there were no  
specific measurements for success,'' said Bob Weiner, a spokesman 
for McCaffrey. ``There was some real heat in the government'' 
resisting demands for accountability, but ``no longer do we only 
measure the people working the issue and the dollars spent on it. 
Now you've got to prove bang for the buck.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The goals for the period ending in 2007 are to reduce the rate  
of crime associated with drug trafficking and use by 30 percent, 
and reducing the health and social costs associated with drugs by 
25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey also wants to expand alternatives to jail for drug  
users -- an approach based on studies showing that prisoners who get 
treatment are far less likely to commit new crimes than those who 
don't. 
</P>
<P>
	``Efforts to break the cycle of drugs and crime will pay for  
themselves through reduction in prison costs, social costs 
associated with drugs and crime and through the money no longer 
wasted on purchase of drugs,'' according to the new drug-control 
strategy.

<HEADLINE> NASA Launches Comet Chaser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A comet-chasing spacecraft named  
Stardust rocketed away Sunday on a seven-year, 3 billion-mile quest 
to bring back precious comet dust. 
</P>
<P>
	Stardust began its formidable journey one day late, soaring into  
a clear afternoon sky aboard a Boeing Delta rocket. A last-minute 
radar problem on Saturday caused the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's Stardust mission is the first attempt to gather material  
from beyond the moon and return it to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also the first time NASA has sent a robot on an  
extraterrestrial pickup and delivery mission. The last time the 
agency went after samples in outer space was Apollo 17 in 1972, the 
last of the manned lunar landings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only do we have to get to where we're going ... but then  
we've got to turn around and come home again,'' said Carl Pilcher, 
NASA's science director for solar system exploration. ``This 
certainly adds a new level of complexity and difficulty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists feel it's worth the extra effort and risk.  
</P>
<P>
	Comets are frozen time capsules; the icy, rocky bodies are  
thought to be pieces of the original building blocks of the solar 
system and may well contain compounds from which life formed. 
Abundant in water and carbon-based molecules, comets continually 
bombarded Earth some 4 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Comets can tell us about the history of the early solar system  
and the early history perhaps of our own Earth,'' explained the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory's Martha Hanner, an astronomer taking part in 
the $210 million Stardust mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Stardust is to meet up with Comet Wild-2 in January 2004,  
passing within some 90 miles of the 2 1/2-mile-diameter iceball. The 
comet is named for its discoverer, retired astronomy professor Paul 
Wild, pronounced Vilt, who traveled from Switzerland for the 
launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiny comet fragments -- no bigger than a grain of salt --  
hopefully will be trapped by a pop-up collector that's covered with 
a transparent, ultralight glass foam called aerogel. The most 
vulnerable parts of the 850-pound spacecraft, about the size of a 
large refrigerator, are shielded to protect against the swirl of 
particles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going as close as we can without getting killed,'' said  
Stardust's chief scientist, Donald Brownlee, a University of 
Washington astronomer. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well, the comet samples -- along with interstellar  
dust gathered en route to the comet -- will reach Earth in January 
2006. The return capsule will separate from Stardust at an altitude 
of 69,000 miles and parachute into the Utah desert; Stardust will 
remain in orbit around the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, comet discoverer Wild will be 80 years old. He hopes to  
be around for the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it all works very well, of course, that will be gorgeous,''  
Wild said. ``But there are many possibilities of failure or partial 
failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists expect to get less than a thimble full of comet dust  
back, but that would be plenty for the kind of detailed analysis 
that's planned. Even the fanciest science instruments on spacecraft 
cannot begin to compare with the electron microscopes in 
laboratories on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first U.S. mission devoted solely to a comet. NASA  
plans three more over the next four years, two of which will 
attempt landings. 
</P>
<P>
	Going along on Stardust are more than 1 million names etched  
onto a pair of silicon chips. People from around the world 
submitted their names via the Internet; one chip also contains the 
approximately 58,200 names inscribed on the Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Avalanche Buries 4 People in Calif. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TRUCKEE, Calif. (AP) -- An avalanche caught a group of four  
friends and buried them for hours, killing one. 
</P>
<P>
	The entire Lake Tahoe area has been socked by a series of  
powerful storms that have dumped almost 2 feet of snow and created 
blizzard conditions with wind gusting to 100 mph. Many ski resorts 
in the Sierra Nevada had to close down because of the storms. 
</P>
<P>
	The avalanche occurred Saturday, trapping the four for six hours  
as they walked along the shore of Lake Mary near Norden in the 
Tahoe-Donner summer area. 
</P>
<P>
	One man eventually dug his way out and freed one of the others,  
and the pair ran across the frozen lake to get help, said Nancy 
Colhoun, a nursing supervisor at Tahoe Forest Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	They reached a cabin used by ski patrol members, who dug the  
other two out of the snow. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had air pockets. They were lucky,'' Colhoun said.  
</P>
<P>
	One of the four, a 21-year-old man, died of cardiac arrest after  
being dug out. 
</P>
<P>
	The other three, two men and a woman, were being treated for  
hypothermia.

<HEADLINE> Whoopi Not Worried About 'Squares' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Whoopi Goldberg doesn't want to hear trash talk  
from people who think her doing ``Hollywood Squares'' is a major 
comedown for the Academy Award-winning actress. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't need to have three films coming out and watch my hair  
fall out worrying about the opening weekend gross,'' Goldberg says 
in the Feb. 13-19 TV Guide. ``I like this schedule and the money is 
good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through her clout, the ``Hollywood Squares'' center square and  
executive producer has been able to get such guests as Robin 
Williams, Billy Crystal, Danny Glover, Melanie Griffith, Rosie 
O'Donnell, Trisha Yearwood and Garth Brooks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them are doing this as a favor to me. Some figure it  
can't hurt their careers,'' Goldberg said. ``I cherish all the 
people who have said yes because they don't care what the 
perception is.''

<HEADLINE> Campaign 2000 Under Way in N.H. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Steve Forbes and Bill Bradley comfort  
crying women. Alan Keyes bellows, ``We are the fat lady!'' Al Gore, 
for all his vice presidential importance, faces a patently 
parochial campaign issue: Freeway Exit 4-A in Derry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Build it,'' a voter demands.  
</P>
<P>
	Though the first-in-the-nation presidential primaries are a year  
away, and Washington is still focused on President Clinton's Senate 
impeachment trial, Campaign 2000 is gearing up in New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven candidates visited the state in the last two weeks, not  
including former Cabinet secretary Elizabeth Dole. The wife of 1996 
Republican nominee Bob Dole takes the next step in her likely 
presidential campaign with a Monday night speech to 1,200 people 
for the local Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
	An adviser to Mrs. Dole, speaking on condition of anonymity  
Sunday, said she will speak in broad terms about the themes that 
would dominate her campaign. With interest rising, Mrs. Dole 
extended her schedule to host a breakfast with New Hampshire 
supporters Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	She is not expected to take positions on specific issues or  
announce formation of a presidential exploratory committee, saving 
that attention-getting step for later. ``We're not getting down in 
the weeds yet,'' the adviser said. 
</P>
<P>
	Others are.  
</P>
<P>
	``And ... they're off!'' state GOP chairman Steve Duprey said  
Saturday night, nodding toward two glass doors in a downtown hotel. 
On the other side of the fingerprint-smudged panes, three 
presidential prospects were addressing Christian Coalition 
activists. 
</P>
<P>
	Balloons bobbed from the ceiling. Stage lights swept across the  
walls. Handwritten signs hawked audio copies of GOP candidate Alan 
Keyes' ``very best'' speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Twelve floors above, Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson  
sat down with reporters to say it's time to end Clinton's Senate 
trial and begin focusing on 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to turn our eyes away from the Bill Clinton-Monica  
Lewinsky axis,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentiment is shared by most attention-starved candidates.  
Keyes, a fire-and-brimstone speaker who ran for the GOP nomination 
in 1996, is an exception; the trial is not over, he says, until the 
fat lady sings. 
</P>
<P>
	``And we ARE the fat lady!'' Keyes told a roaring Christian  
Coalition crowd, with Robertson stewing a few feet away. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 1996 retread, millionaire businessman Forbes, served  
eggs, bacon and a dash of compassion for breakfast Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Enola Arvidson shyly raised her hand at the end of Forbes' stump  
speech and explained between sobs that her sister can't afford some 
lifesaving medications. Dabbing her eyes with a green napkin, she 
asked, ``How do we get our medical people to understand that we all 
need help?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forbes, without a pause, answered in his choppy, almost robotic  
cadence. ``I ... am ... sorry ... about ... your ... sister,'' he
said, before launching into a pitch for personal medical savings  
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	A Forbes aide approached Arvidson and promised to look into her  
situation. Arvidson said she was impressed with Forbes despite the 
``pretty standard'' answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just the fact that he sent somebody to talk to me, shows me  
that he cares.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It seems every candidate is learning to feel voters' pain.  
</P>
<P>
	Former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley, in a moment reminiscent of  
President Clinton's 1991 touchy-feely campaign here, comforted a 
pregnant high school dropout during his New Hampshire tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thank you for your courage in sharing that,'' he said,  
standing up to put his hand on her shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Kerry, a Democrat from neighboring Massachusetts, may  
soon join Bradley to challenge Gore. He reportedly has purchased a 
table at the Democrats' ``100 Club'' event on Feb. 18, a sure sign 
of presidential interest. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is trying to learn his boss' knack for getting big mileage  
from little issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Does anybody here ever get stressed out by traffic?'' he asked  
a crowd in Derry on Wednesday. ``Tell me about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The forum on community sprawl and other ``livability'' issues  
also prompted a debate over the merits of a new freeway exit. 
Running for the highest office in the land, Gore was asked at an 
airport news conference, ``Do you support Exit 4-A?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't answer, assuming correctly that the question was posed  
half-jokingly to make a point. Yet the exchange illustrates the 
power of voters in early primary states to turn hometown issues 
into national causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Running for president? Better know about hog farms in Iowa.  
</P>
<P>
	And better help protect the early primary status of Iowa and New  
Hampshire. Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, during a recent 
visit here, signed a pledge to help keep New Hampshire the first 
primary state. 
</P>
<P>
	By contrast, the Republicans' early favorite, Dole and Texas  
Gov. George W. Bush, have yet to pay their New Hampshire dues. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wide open race,'' Republican Lamar Alexander said  
during his stop. ``We have some people with famous last names, but 
that doesn't mean anybody is going to vote for them for 
president.''

<HEADLINE> Suspect in 1982 Murder Surrenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A Milwaukee man surrendered Sunday on charges he  
killed two people in a slaying for which another man was sentenced 
to death. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's attorney's office, having reviewed a videotaped of  
an alleged confession by Alstory Simon, issued warrants for both 
him and his estranged wife, Inez Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The warrants accused Simon of two counts of murder and Jackson  
of obstructing justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Anthony Porter, originally imprisoned for the slayings, spent  
his first weekend of freedom in 17 years. Porter was scheduled to 
die in September, but his appeal was granted two days before the 
lethal injection. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon surrendered Sunday afternoon at a Chicago police station,  
his lawyer Jack Rimland said in a telephone interview with WTMJ-AM, 
Milwaukee. His wife also turned herself in. 
</P>
<P>
	Rimland said Simon's videotaped comments ``indicated he was  
acting in self-defense, based on my viewing of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his client plans to plea innocent to the slayings.  
</P>
<P>
	Porter, 43, was freed Friday after a private investigator and  
journalism students from Northwestern University obtained the 
alleged confession. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon allegedly admitted he killed Jerry Hillard, 18, and  
Marilyn Green, 19, in 1982 over a drug debt. His wife allegedly 
knew about the killings but said nothing until recently.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Man Turns Jumbo Jet Into Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUREL, Ore. (AP) -- Transporting Bruce Campbell's new home from  
the airport to the countryside was a cinch. Getting it up the 
driveway was another matter. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49-year-old electrical engineer who bought a used Boeing 727  
to turn into a bachelor apartment saw the jet make an incredible 
journey Saturday -- from a muddy field near the Hillsboro airport to 
the doorstep of his neighbor's property about 12 miles south. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awesome. It's spine-tingling,'' Campbell said, as the jet  
was towed up the narrow asphalt path, its blue and white fuselage a 
startling disruption to the backdrop of fog-covered hills and quiet 
farms. ``It's fascinating how wonderful that marriage is: a natural 
environment and slick, cool, high technology.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of onlookers, many with bleary-eyed children, stood in  
the rain to watch the 127-foot-long aircraft negotiate the streets 
of downtown Hillsboro about 3:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane, pulled by a semi-truck rig at a top speed of 4 mph,  
arrived about 6:30 a.m. at the Laurel Valley general store, where 
workers waited for dawn to break before ascending the winding road 
leading to Paul and Chris Denfeld's 500-acre walnut and hazelnut 
groves. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan involved towing the fuselage, resting on wheeled  
dollies, into a gravel-strewn gully behind the Denfelds' barn, 
where it would remain until spring, when Campbell could figure out 
a way to get it up the steep slope to his 10-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rest of the asphalt driveway was too thin to support the  
weight of the 32-ton aircraft, and the idea of crossing over a 
shallow ditch and winching the plane about 400 feet up a muddy side 
road seemed impossible. 
</P>
<P>
	About 20 exhausted workers went home and the plane, unable to  
taxi, stayed put on the driveway. Using three large trucks, the 
plane was pulled up the driveway Sunday. But work was stopped until 
more gravel could be hauled in to support the plane, which was left 
next to a goat pen in full view of the road below. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not real thrilled about it being in sight of the house,''  
Chris Denfeld said. ``But we're into this now, so we just have to 
learn to laugh about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell, who had dreamed of living inside a jetliner since  
childhood, got his wish last Halloween when the 727 he bought for 
$100,000 was decommissioned by Greece's Olympic Airways and flown 
to Hillsboro, a town of about 45,000 west of Portland. Campbell 
will outfit the plane with a bedroom, bathroom and workshop, and 
possibly a deck. He'll also re-attach the wings then. 
</P>
<P>
	But first it had to be moved, a complex undertaking that will  
end up costing Campbell about $25,000. For months, he worked to 
obtain the permits needed to effectively bring the city to a 
standstill for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
	While the plane fell short of its destination Saturday, the  
operation had the upbeat atmosphere of an old-fashioned 
barn-raising. And Campbell was thrilled just to have his new toy 
closer to home.

<HEADLINE> King's Death May Roil Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- The passing of the crown in Jordan may be  
followed by a series of changes and upheavals in the volatile 
Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan's new ruler is yet to be tested in a crisis. Israel's  
elections on May 17 will determine the future of Israel's peace 
with the Palestinians. Yasser Arafat has vowed to declare 
Palestinian statehood this year. Key Mideast countries, including 
Saudi Arabia and Syria, have aging and ailing leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	In Jordan, King Abdullah, Hussein's son and successor, will face  
the domestic challenges of unemployment, poverty and water 
shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	He will also have to keep an eye on his neighbors. For years,  
Jordan has been the target of meddling and intimidation from 
abroad. In the 1970s and 80s, Syria threatened Jordan with invasion 
and Israel put its troops on the border ready to intervene. 
Jordan's large Palestinian population staged an uprising that ended 
in massive bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, hundreds of thousands of Iraqis in Jordan provide a  
possible avenue for Iraq's Saddam Hussein to pressure Jordan's new 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	Hussein's death is also the start of a generational shift in the  
Middle East. King Fahd of Saudi Arabia is close to 75. His health 
problems -- a stroke, diabetes, gall bladder and arthritis -- have 
left day-to-day government in the hands of Crown Prince Abdullah, 
himself in his 70s. 
</P>
<P>
	Syrian President Hafez Assad, 68, who has suffered repeated  
heart problems, is reportedly maneuvering to have his son Bashar, a 
colonel in the army, succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
	Future governments may set new tones for Saudi Arabia, among the  
region's wealthiest states, and Syria, a leader of anti-Israel 
militance. 
</P>
<P>
	For Israel, the change in the Hashemite monarchy in Jordan  
throws into question the stability of a key buffer state between 
the Jewish state and the Arab world. 
</P>
<P>
	It will likely be years before Jordan's new king wields the sort  
of clout that his father brought to bear in international affairs. 
The absence of Hussein-the-peacemaker may be critical, especially 
at a time when the besieged Clinton administration is trying to 
keep the Israeli-Arab peace process from collapsing. 
</P>
<P>
	On May 17, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's hard-line  
approach to negotiations with the Palestinians will be tested in 
nationwide elections. His dovish Labor Party opponent, Ehud Barak, 
would likely go ahead with more West Bank withdrawals than 
Netanyahu, who has attached a series of conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Arafat has vowed to declare a Palestinian state this year,  
possibly even May 4, when the interim peace agreement with Israel 
expires. That could set the stage for a major showdown with Israel, 
since Netanyahu has threatened to annex key parts of the West Bank 
in reprisal. 
</P>
<P>
	Also uncertain is the role of Islamic militants in the Israeli  
election and the future of Jordan. Senior Palestinian officials say 
they fear that radical Hamas and Iranian-backed militants could 
launch new suicide bombings in Israel, like those that marred 
Israel's last election campaign in 1996. Netanyahu came to power on 
a wave of Israeli anger against those attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamas leaders say they won't provoke unrest in Jordan as a step  
toward taking over Israel, but they denounce Jordan for refusing to 
let its territory be used for anti-Israeli attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without an ally like the Hashemites, Jordan would have become  
a rallying point for Arab and Islamic armies'' in support of the 
Palestinians, said an editorial Friday in the weekly Hamas 
magazine, Al Risala. 
</P>
<P>
	And in any period of regional turbulence, experts say, Islamic  
militants in Iran and Saddam Hussein's government in Iraq could try 
to exploit uncertainty for their own ends.

<HEADLINE> UAE: Include Iraq in OPEC Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABU DHABI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iraq should be part of  
any ``serious'' future agreement by the Organization of the 
Petroleum Exporting Countries to further cut output, United Arab 
Emirates Oil Minister Obaid bin Saif Al-Nasseri said late Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no point in having an agreement while Iraq is making  
up for the quantity that has been agreed to be cut or lifted from 
the market,'' the minister said in an interview with Dow Jones 
Newswires following talks with visiting U.S. Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  
are expected to meet on March 23 to discuss oil prices, which have 
plummeted to near-record lows because of an oil supply glut. Iraq, 
however, is unlikely to agree to any cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq was exempted from the 2.6 million barrels a day in OPEC  
production cuts agreed to by the other 10 OPEC members in 1998 
because its production levels are controlled by the United Nations' 
through the U.N.-Iraq oil-for-food deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the United Nations boosted Iraq's allowed oil sales  
to $5.2 billion every six months from $2 billion every six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq is now pumping at its maximum capacity of 2.5 million  
barrels a day and is looking to buy spare parts for its dilapidated 
oil industry to boost production. With oil prices hovering between 
$11-$12 a barrel, however, Iraq is only earning about $3 billion 
every six months from oil sales. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked whether he thought Iraq would agree to cut oil  
production -- when oil sales are the only funds it gets under 
sanctions for humanitarian aid for its people -- Nasseri said ``to 
agree or not to agree is their decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Iraq has said it desperately needs the oil revenues and has  
called on Saudi Arabia, OPEC's largest producer, to cut its 
production. 
</P>
<P>
	After Iraq was banned from exporting oil, Saudi Arabia took over  
most of its pre-1990 OPEC daily quota of about 3 million barrels. 
Saudi Arabia has refused to relinquish the additional production 
capacity even though Iraq has resumed exporting oil.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Cancels Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines canceled about 9 percent of its  
scheduled flights Sunday because of pilot absences, a move believed 
to be in reaction to slowed negotiations of a work agreement over a 
recently acquired carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	American, the nation's second largest airline, canceled 214 of  
its 2,250 scheduled flights as of midday due to what it called a 
higher than normal number of unexpected pilot absences. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone calls to the union and the company Sunday were not  
returned to The Associated Press. But answering services referred 
to separate information hot lines, each of which contained recorded 
statements. 
</P>
<P>
	``American continues to be very disappointed in this situation  
and sincerely regrets the inconvenience that it causes for our 
customers,'' airline spokesman Tim Smith said in one statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said American was attempting to book passengers on  
additional flights or on other carriers. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilots contend that AMR Corp., parent of Fort Worth, Texas-based  
American, has disregarded the contract since purchasing Reno Air 
six weeks ago for $124 million. American must pay lower-paid Reno 
pilots at American Airlines' rates, the pilots say. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Allied Pilots Association did not call for the  
action at American, union president Rich LaVoy said the labor group 
was frustrated by a lack of progress on what he called an important 
work issue and was eager to resume talks. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the possibility of other acquisitions looming on the  
horizon, APA simply cannot afford to agree to something that will 
come back to haunt all of us if AMR buys other airlines larger and 
more senior than Reno Air,'' LaVoy said in a separate statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps the most unfortunate aspect is that this demonstrates  
that AMR is still using the same penny-wise, pound-foolish 
bargaining method we have suffered through for so many years with 
this airline,'' he said. ``These negotiations still have the big 
opportunity to do things differently by avoiding the temptations to 
save a buck at the pilots' expense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although federal law bars a strike over such an issue, pilots  
can refuse to volunteer for overtime, which can cause flight delays 
and cancelations. On Saturday, American canceled 90 flights 
systemwide when it came up short on pilots. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline and its pilots have had past disagreements,  
including a brief strike in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``We regret that the disagreement between American Airlines and  
the Allied Pilots Association over the integration of Reno Air into 
the American Airlines system continues,'' Smith said. ``American 
hopes that our operations will return to normal soon and that we 
can continue our negotiations and come to a resolution of this 
matter quickly.''

<HEADLINE> Sosa Picks up NL MVP Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Sammy Sosa is still as amazed by his MVP season  
as anyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``1998. What a year. What a year,'' he said Sunday after  
receiving the National League MVP from the New York chapter of the 
Baseball Writers Association of America. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa won the award after hitting 66 home runs and thrilling the  
country during the great home run chase with Mark McGwire. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thank all the beautiful people in America who I never met,  
but I know were watching me,'' Sosa said. 
</P>
<P>
	McGwire, who did not attend the dinner, was named the Sid Mercer  
Player of the Year by the association. 
</P>
<P>
	New York Yankees outfielder Darryl Strawberry won the You Gotta  
Have Heart Award for the way he handled his struggle with colon 
cancer diagnosed during the Yankees' playoff run. 
</P>
<P>
	``He knows how to fight. He's fought back before and I expect to  
see him in spring training and in all probability in left field,'' 
said Yankees manager Joe Torre, who received his AL Manager of the 
Year Award. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry has agreed to a minor-league contract for 1999 and  
will be battling Shane Spencer, Ricky Ledee and Chad Curtis for the 
starting left field job for the Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	``This year they say left field will be a crowd,'' Strawberry  
said. ``I say good. I like a challenge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were several other members of the World Series champion  
Yankees in attendance, including Derek Jeter, Orlando ``El Duque'' 
Hernandez and Scott Brosius -- who received the Babe Ruth Award for 
winning the World Series MVP. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yankees, who set a record with 125 wins last season, were  
awarded the Joe Dimaggio Toast of the Town Award. 
</P>
<P>
	Yogi Berra and George Steinbrenner sat next to each other on the  
dais one month after ending a feud that kept the Hall of Fame 
catcher away from the Yankees for nearly 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with Sosa and Torre, the other winners of the BBWAA 1998  
awards were honored -- Juan Gonzalez (AL MVP), Ben Grieve (AL Rookie 
of the Year), Tom Glavine (NL Cy Young), and Larry Dierker (NL 
Manager of the Year). Roger Clemens (AL Cy Young) and Kerry Wood 
(NL Rookie of the Year) were not in attendance. 
</P>
<P>
	Mets pitcher Al Leiter, former Mets Tom Seaver, Jerry Koosman  
and Lee Mazzilli, and Padres outfielder Tony Gwynn were also 
honored by the association.

	Jordan's King Hussein Is Dead  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- King Hussein of Jordan died today following  
a battle with cancer. He was 63. Queen Noor and Hussein's children 
were all with him when he died, a senior palace source said. The 
immediate cause of death was heart failure brought on by 
complications from cancer, the official said. The king died at 
11:43 a.m. local time and his oldest son, Crown Prince Abdullah, 
was sworn in as king just four hours later in a solemn ceremony at 
Parliament. 

</P>
<P>
	Jordanians Mourn Beloved King  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Hundreds of people, sobbing wildly and  
shouting the King Hussein's name, surged toward the gates of the 
hospital where he died today. Guards blocked their way, but there 
was no confrontation. Some of them were crying as well. ``We would 
give our life for yours,'' young men chanted, waving portraits of 
the king wrinkled by a cold and steady rain. Some people collapsed 
in agony. A woman lay weeping in the mud on the foggy roadside. 
Stores closed and black banners were quickly displayed. ``Goodbye'' 
was the simple message on one sign. Black cloth also hung from a 
large portrait of Hussein in a main square. Flags at government 
ministries and embassies were lowered to half-staff to begin a 
40-day mourning period. 

</P>
<P>
	Leaders Express Grief Over Hussein  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leaders around the world today mourned the death  
of Jordan's King Hussein. French President Jacques Chirac said 
Hussein's ``extraordinary devotion ... to the Jordanian people was 
an example for all the leaders of the world.'' Former President 
George Bush said he considered Hussein a 'close, personal friend 
who supported the United States in every way possible.'' In Israel, 
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said, ``There was no one more 
gracious, considerate and kind; no one more hospitable and 
generous; no one more capable of understanding and empathy.''

	Kosovo Talks Enter Second Day  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Yugoslav Serbs and Kosovo Albanians  
continued peace negotiations here today, even as new violence 
rocked the war-torn province. A bomb exploded outside an ethnic 
Albanian-owned vegetable market in Pristina yesterday, killing 
three people, witnesses said. The two sides are under international 
pressure to make peace in just two weeks. Negotiators are working 
on a framework plan that calls for a three-year period of autonomy 
for Kosovo, maintenance of Serb territorial integrity, protection 
of minorities and a police force that reflects the ethnic 
community. 

</P>

	Senate Watches Lewinsky Tape  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Parts of Monica Lewinsky's videotaped  
testimony were aired on the Senate floor and nationwide yesterday 
and a senior Democrat said he might vote to convict the president, 
just two weeks after calling to dismiss the case. In an ABC 
interview to be aired today, Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said 
there is ``no doubt about it in my mind'' that the charges against 
Clinton rise to ``high crime and misdemeanors.'' But he declined to 
say how he will vote on conviction. There was no indication that 
Ms. Lewinsky's testimony had shaken the prospects for Clinton's 
expected acquittal on the two articles of impeachment by the end of 
the week. The trial is scheduled to resume tomorrow at 1 p.m. EST.

	Russian Opposes More NATO Expansion

<P>
	MUNICH, Germany (AP) -- Led by the United States, NATO is intent  
on ``destruction of the existing world order,'' a senior Russian 
official declared in today's close to a weekend of cordial talks 
among allied officials looking ahead to NATO's 50th anniversary. 
Yevgeny Gusarov, the deputy foreign minister of Russia, said that 
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should not even think of 
expanding after it inducts Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic 
at an April summit in Washington.

	SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- About 12,000 couples were married in a  
mass ceremony at Seoul's Chamsil Olympic Stadium today. A spokesman 
for Rev. Sun Myung Moon's Unification Church said the ceremony, in 
which 30,000 married couples also renewed their vows, was the 
largest wedding ever. Church officials said an estimated 360 
million people in 130 countries watched or renewed their vows via 
satellite and through Internet link-ups. Some young brides were 
holding the photos of new husbands who they said could not get off 
work to attend the ceremony.

Greg Norman International. Langer, seeking his first victory in 15 
months, was ahead by a stroke entering the par-3 18th, a disastrous 
finish that included a penalty stroke for mishandling his marker. 
Langer closed with a 7-under-par 80 for a 285 total. Long's 72 put 
him at 9-under 283 on The Lakes course.

<HEADLINE> Gas Prices Fall a Penny a Gallon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMARILLO, Calif. (AP) -- Gasoline prices plunged nearly a penny  
per gallon as retailers continued to scramble for customers in the 
glutted market, an industry analyst said Sunday . 
</P>
<P>
	The average price, including all grades and taxes, was $1.0141  
per gallon on Friday, down .94 cent from two weeks earlier, 
according to the Lundberg Survey of 10,000 stations nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	When adjusted for inflation, that is the lowest price in the  
history of the retail gas market and follows months of declines 
linked to an oversupply of crude and refined oil products, Trilby 
Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bigger picture does not suggest higher prices soon. In  
fact, the price crash may not be over,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The faltering world economy weakened demand, she said. ``It had  
to do especially with the Asian economic crises, followed by those 
in Russia and parts of Latin America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The winter driving season in the U.S. also had lessened demand.  
</P>
<P>
	Retailers have responded by cutting their profit margins ``in  
order to chase sales,'' Ms. Lundberg said, adding that such 
reductions accounted for about half of the latest decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for self-serve regular gasoline in U.S. cities ranged in  
average from 81 cents per gallon in Cheyenne, Wyo. to $1.50 in 
Honolulu. In about a third of the cities surveyed, the price was 
less than 90 cents per gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of those are in the Midwest and southern regions where  
the taxes tend to be a lot lower,'' Ms. Lundberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	While bad news for gas station owners, the drops may help the  
overall economy, she added. ``Low prices may be indirectly 
encouraging retail sales of goods and services in general by 
encouraging consumers to drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Average prices at self-service stations were 95.26 cents per  
gallon for regular gasoline, $1.0634 for mid-grade and $1.1487 for 
premium. 
</P>
<P>
	Full-service prices were $1.4155 for regular, $1.5075 for  
mid-grade and $1.5799 for premium.

	King Hussein of Jordan Dies  
</P>
<P>
	AMMAN, Jordan (AP) -- Jordan crowned an untested new monarch  
today and plunged into mourning for its beloved King Hussein. The 
king died at 11:43 a.m. (4:43 a.m. EST) from cancer in a hospital. 
Distraught citizens sobbed in the streets and world leaders 
converged on the desert kingdom, united in grief for the statesman 
who brought bridges of peace to the turbulent Middle East. Hussein, 
who had fought a seven-month battle with lymphatic cancer, had 
lingered unconscious on a respirator for two days after returning 
home to Jordan last week to die. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Leads Funeral Delegation  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton praised King Hussein of  
Jordan today as a ``partner and friend'' before leading a 
delegation that includes three former presidents to his funeral. In 
keeping with Islamic tradition, the funeral will be held quickly -- 
an enormous procession through the streets of Amman. Accompanying 
Clinton to Jordan were former Presidents Bush, Carter and Ford. 
First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was to meet Clinton in Jordan. 
Russian President Boris Yeltsin, himself recovering from a recent 
illness, will lead the Russian delegation to the funeral. 

</P>
<P>
	Senators Look to Censure Option  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With acquittal virtually assured, senators  
today looked beyond President Clinton's impeachment trial to a 
censure resolution that could unify Republicans and Democrats in a 
strong condemnation of his conduct. Working with Democrats on the 
post-trial alternative of censure, Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, 
said it was still ``very much up in the air'' whether language will 
be found to gain the 60 votes that are needed to overcome an 
expected filibuster. House prosecutors and the Clinton defense team 
spent the day packaging familiar evidence into closing statements 
to be delivered tomorrow. 

</P>
<P>
	Progress Made in Kosovo Peace Talks  
</P>
<P>
	RAMBOUILLET, France (AP) -- Serb officials and Kosovo Albanians  
agreed on principles that would keep the embattled province inside 
Yugoslavia for at least three more years as they met separately 
today with international mediators at a French chateau. Getting 
down to work after yesterday's ceremonial opening of the peace 
talks, the mediators presented Kosovo's warring factions with a 
plan worked out by the six-nation Contact Group. The plan requires 
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians to give up their demand for independence 
for their province -- at least during a three-year interim period. 
Both a Serb negotiator and a Western mediator said all sides had 
accepted those principles. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Warns Terrorist-Harbor Nations  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration now asserts the  
right to bomb government facilities in nations that provide 
sanctuary to international terrorists, a significant escalation of 
U.S. attempts to thwart terrorism. ``We may not just go in a strike 
against a terrorist facility; we may choose to retaliate against 
the facilities of the host country, if that host country is a 
knowing, cooperative sanctuary,'' Richard Clarke, President 
Clinton's coordinator for counterterrorism, told The Associated 
Press.

	Mexican Leftists Predict Victory

	CHILPANCINGO, Mexico (AP) -- Mexico's main leftist party

hoping for a boost heading into next year's presidential vote. The 
leftist Democratic Revolution Party said it would win the 
governorships of Guerrero and Baja California Sur, two western 
states home to wealthy tourist resorts. The Institutional 
Revolutionary Party, which has run Mexico for 70 years, suffered 
divisive primary campaigns in both states.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Latrell Sprewell threw up a brick from 3-point  
range with 10 seconds left and Patrick Ewing followed by missing a 
layup as the New York Knicks lost their home opener, 83-79 today to 
the Miami Heat. Sprewell finished 2-for-12 from the field and 
scored just five points. Sprewell also didn't have much success 
defensively stopping Jamal Mashburn, who led Miami with 23 points. 
Alonzo Mourning added 16, Terry Porter had 13 and Tim Hardaway 11 
for the Heat in a rematch of last year's first-round playoff series 
won by New York 3-2.

	Now he returns to the game he dominates, starting with this  
week's Sybase Open. Sampras gets his first chance to show whether 
he's refreshed or rusty on Tuesday night against 84th-ranked Galo 
Blanco of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	``I definitely felt like I needed this break to start the year  
off mentally, physically as fresh as possible,'' Sampras said. ``So 
I am definitely champing at the bit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Exhausted after a grueling series of tournaments in late 1998 to  
protect his No. 1 ranking, Sampras passed up the Australian Open in 
January -- the first Grand Slam tournament he has skipped since 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
	He is just one short of tying Roy Emerson's record of 12 Grand  
Slam singles titles, and Sampras has said his main motivation is to 
win more Grand Slams. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also focused on finishing last year as the No. 1 player  
in the world, giving him a record six straight years at the top. To 
protect that ranking, he had to play seven straight weeks in 
October and November -- a process that left him weary. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have loved to have gone down to Australia. I just wish  
it started in February,'' he said. ``I wanted to give myself a good 
offseason this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though gone, Sampras certainly was not forgotten at the  
Australian Open. When Yevgeny Kafelnikov won the title, he 
immediately pointed out that his job was made much easier by the 
absence of the world's top player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pete, it's really a great, wonderful feeling,'' Kafelnikov  
said after raising the silver trophy. ``Thanks for letting me do 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras is beginning his 258th week at No. 1, a dozen short of  
the record held by Ivan Lendl. Opponents wonder whether he'll be as 
sharp as usual at the start of the $350,000 Sybase tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's definitely a shot that he'll be rusty,'' said  
sixth-seeded Jan-Michael Gambill, who would face Sampras in the 
semifinals. ``Pete definitely plays better when he has a few events 
under his belt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gambill has been on the tennis circuit only two years, and he  
understands the exhaustion that forced Sampras to the sidelines for 
the past 10 weeks. Yet he thinks Sampras' relentless pursuit of the 
year-end No. 1 ranking was worth the toll. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, that's his most impressive accomplishment,'' Gambill  
said. ``He's been head and shoulders above everyone else for six 
straight years, and that's really impressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sampras, a two-time Sybase champion, has a relatively easy draw  
into the semifinals. But, once there, the top seed may have to face 
Gambill or No. 3 seed Mark Philippoussis, a U.S. Open finalist last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Andre Agassi, coming off an uninspired fourth-round loss at the  
Australian Open, is the defending champion of the Sybase Open and 
the No. 2 seed this year. He opens against Todd Woodbridge on 
Monday night and could face No. 4 seed Michael Chang in the 
semifinals.

<HEADLINE>  Goetschl Wins World Downhill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Renate Goetschl led an Austrian sweep of the  
top four places in the women's downhill Sunday in the World Alpine 
Ski Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	The powerful Austrian team now has claimed 10 of a possible 15  
medals in these championships, including four golds. For the 
Austrian women, it was their second medal sweep; they claimed the 
top three places in the super-G Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	With downhill stars Picabo Street of Sun Valley, Idaho, and  
Katja Seizinger of Germany recuperating from injuries, the was was 
open for the Austrians to dominate, and they barged through. 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl, who already claimed silver medals in both the super-G  
and combined events, had slower times than teammate Michaela 
Dorfmeister after the second and third intermediate times, but she 
skied the bottom section of the course perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I skied well in the last part,'' she said. ``I had a good  
line. I couldn't ski it better. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a great World Championships. My goal was to win any  
medal, because at Nagano (in the 1998 Olympics) I put too much 
pressure on myself and went home without anything. Now I have won 
three medals. This has been an unforgettable week for me. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have three girls on the podium, this is unbelievable for  
Austria.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl, who leads this season's World Cup downhill standings,  
finished in 1 minute, 48.20 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorfmeister, bowing her head in disappointment after Goetschl's  
run, settled for the silver medal at 1:48.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Stefanie Schuster, matching the best finish of her career, was  
third at 1:48.37, and Alexandra Meissnitzer took fourth at 1:48.47. 
</P>
<P>
	Megan Gerety of Anchorage, Alaska, was the top American, taking  
eighth at 1:49.30. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the top racers chose late start numbers because of the  
possibility of overnight snow, which would have slowed the course 
for the early runners. Vail received only a dusting of snow 
overnight, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Schuster, who has been consistently fast in training on this  
mountain throughout her career, drew bib No. 3, and her solid run 
produced a lead that withstood the challenge of the next 14 racers. 
But it soon became clear that her major threats would come from her 
teammates. 
</P>
<P>
	Meissnitzer, racing 17th, had quicker intermediate times than  
Schuster but lost precious seconds at the bottom and was .10 
seconds slower. 
</P>
<P>
	Dorfmeister, racing 18th, overcame a slow start to beat Schuster  
by .02 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Hilde Gerg, Italy's Isolde Kostner and France's  
Florence Masnada then came up short, but Goetschl, with bib No. 22, 
was the best of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Goetschl, skiing aggressively but smoothly, was .55 seconds  
behind Dorfmeister after the second intermediate clocking and still 
.16 seconds behind at the third intermediate. Racing flawlessly 
over the last series of jumps and turns, she edged Dorfmeister by 
.15 seconds at the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lost it on the bottom, in the last three turns,'' said  
Dorfmeister, who won a bronze medal in super-G Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirsten Clark of Raymond, Maine, was 16th at 1:50.08. Kate  
Monahan of Aspen, Colo., took 19th at 1:50.42, and Jonna Mendes of 
South Lake Tahoe, Calif., was 25th at 1:51.06. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerety was quick for most of her run, clocking the third-fastest  
time through the last intermediate clocking. But she lost valuable 
time at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	``The jumps were quite a bit bigger today than in training,''  
Gerety said. ``I launched off the last one and got a bit behind the 
course.''

<HEADLINE> N.H. May Have To Move Up Primary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- It's that time again, or maybe it isn't.  
</P>
<P>
	This month should mark the one-year countdown to the  
first-in-the-nation presidential primary, but the date could be 
bumped up to keep ahead of other states that are trying to steal 
some of the spotlight from New Hampshire. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now, there are so many states changing their laws to  
move their primary around, it's really impossible to come up with 
any odds,'' Secretary of State Bill Gardner said of the chances 
that his state's Feb. 15, 2000, election will hold. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, more than half the states are considering earlier  
primaries, with as many as 30 possible by mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
	In Michigan, two state senators are trying change their  
presidential primary from late March to the second Tuesday in 
February -- Feb. 8 in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire law requires its primary to be held seven days  
before any other binding primary. National Democratic Party rules 
protect New Hampshire's right to hold its primary first; Republican 
Party rules do not. 
</P>
<P>
	The primary has been held on the third Tuesday in February for  
the last three elections. Moving the date earlier offers several 
interesting possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
	How about Valentine's-Primary Day? Show your love for democracy  
by casting your vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Or Ground Hog-Primary Day -- candidates who see their shadows are  
in for six more weeks of campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	If New Hampshire lawmakers decide this year to join the rest of  
the nation in honoring Martin Luther King Jr., with a permanent 
holiday, the state could celebrate Martin Luther King Civil Rights 
Primary Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Or, in the most drastic scenario, New Hampshire could ring in  
the New Year with First Night-First Primary festivities. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardner typically sets the primary date in the fall preceding  
the election. He anticipates making his decision around the same 
time this year, depending on how other states fare in their 
attempts to change their dates. 
</P>
<P>
	California already has changed its date from June to March 7.  
New Jersey is among several states seeking to share that date. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers in nine western states are deciding whether to hold a  
regional primary March 10. A regional task forced approved the plan 
Last month, but it must pass muster in each state's legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	If states succeed in all their changes, more than three-quarters  
of the U.S. population could vote in 10 days in March. New 
Hampshire's leadoff status notwithstanding, such crowding doesn't 
sit well with Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have 30 states having primaries within a two- to  
three-week period, it makes it quite difficult for a candidate to 
campaign in many of those states,'' he said. ``So fund raising and 
television advertising become significantly more important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Gardner and his fellow secretaries of state  
endorsed the idea of creating a system of rotating regional 
primaries starting in 2004. Iowa, with the nation's first caucuses, 
and New Hampshire could lead the way, while other states would be 
required to schedule primaries according to a national plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the nomination process was more spread out like it used to  
be, it would be better than crunched up, compacted like it is 
now,'' Gardner said. ``That would give the candidates more time to 
provide the information voters need to make a decision.''

<P>
	FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) -- About 400 union members picketed and many  
patrons called off bets in support of Freehold Raceway employees 
who lost their jobs after the track was sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The Asbury Park Press reported Sunday that 12 track managers,  
two electricians and one carpenter were fired. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers  
Local Union 400 spent about five hours Saturday picketing at the 
entrance to the raceway. 
</P>
<P>
	They said the electricians and the carpenter had spent a  
combined 66 years working at the harness track. 
</P>
<P>
	Pennwood Corp., a company formed by Penn National Gaming Inc.  
and Greenwood New Jersey Inc., bought the track and the right to 
lease Garden State Park in Cherry Hill in a nearly $60 million deal 
completed Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
	Freehold Raceway officials had no comment on the union's  
actions. They released a statement in a flier to patrons saying the 
dispute was between workers and a subcontractor hired after the 
racetrack's sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrons were forced to use automatic betting machines because  
only two of the 60 tellers crossed picket lines. The two tellers 
spent the day paying off bets but not placing any. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount wagered was down 42 percent from last week, according  
to daily reports issued by the raceway. Bettors wagered $179,967, 
while a typical winter Saturday yields about $300,000 in bets.

	MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A rented vehicle collided with a truck on a  
road south of the Pacific Coast city of Mazatlan, killing eight 
people -- including five tourists from Minnesota, police said 
Sunday. Four others were injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The sport utility vehicle carrying eight people veered into an  
oncoming lane Saturday and collided with a truck carrying a Mexican 
family from the state of Jalisco, said local police spokesperson 
Marta Torres. 
</P>
<P>
	The tourists who died were identified as Linda Lee Haefner, 45;  
Eugene Melvin Oswald, 72; Pat Smith, 79; Jerry Smith, 62, and Joyce 
Kirthart Patrick, 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Deputy Attorney General Jose Diego Avila Varon said they were  
from Brownsville, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
	Also killed was Cynthia Gil Montes, 28, the wife of the driver  
of the tourist's car, Jose Torres, the driver of the truck, and his 
11-year-old son, whose name was not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Avila Varon said that the driver of the tourists' car had been  
arrested but was being treated in a hospital for injuries. He was 
identified as Walter Rebollar Rios. Three children were also 
injured.

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's economic crisis has sent  
the government's approval rating plunging to its lowest level, 
according to a poll released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The poll found 36 percent of Brazilians thought the government  
of President Fernando Henrique Cardoso was ``bad or very bad,'' 39 
percent felt it was ``adequate'' and 21 percent said it was ``good 
or very good.'' Four percent had no opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were the worst since Cardoso took office in 1995,  
reported the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo, which published the 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Cardoso was re-elected for a second term in October on the  
strength of his successful economic policies. He was credited with 
bringing sky-high inflation down to only 2 percent in 1998 by 
pegging Brazil's currency to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	But Brazil let its currency float freely on Jan. 13 to save its  
dwindling foreign reserves. The currency has since lost 33 percent 
of its value against the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Pollsters Datafolha interviewed 2,076 Brazilians in 94 towns and  
cities Wednesday and Thursday. The margin of error was two 
percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Free House Wins at Santa Anita </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ARCADIA, Calif. (AP) -- Free House beat Malek in a stretch duel  
to win Sunday's $300,000 San Antonio Handicap by a neck at Santa 
Anita. 
</P>
<P>
	Returning from a four-month layoff, Free House covered 1 1-8  
miles in 1:48 2-5 under Chris McCarron and paid $3.40 and $2.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Malek returned $2.40, while Dramatic Gold was another four  
lengths back in third. Lord Grillo was last. There was no show 
wagering after the field was reduced to four when Cavonnier was 
scratched earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``Malek put pressure on us all day,'' said Paco Gonzalez, who  
trains Free House. ``He already had one race this year, and we 
hadn't run in four months. We had the high weight. Our horse ran a 
big race. He's a different horse now. He's more kind. He takes 
everything easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarron guided Free House to the early lead, letting Malek come  
within a head rounding the turn and into the stretch before a hard 
drive to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	The victory, worth $180,000, increased Free House's career  
earnings to $2.478 million, with eight wins in 20 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	In the $200,000 La Canada Stakes for 4-year-old fillies,  
Manistique won her sixth race in seven starts when she beat Magical 
Allure by 2 1/2 lengths in 1:48 4-5 over 1 1-8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ridden by Gary Stevens, Manistique paid $3.20, $2.60 and $2.20.  
</P>
<P>
	In Sunday's third race, Eddie Delahoussaye won his 6,000th  
career race aboard Sweetcakesanshakes, making him the 14th jockey 
in North America history to reach the milestone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't trade my career with that of anybody else,'' said  
the 47-year-old Delahoussaye.

<HEADLINE> Report: Microsoft Shakeup Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDMOND, Wash. (AP) -- Software giant Microsoft Corp. is on the  
verge of a sweeping organizational shakeup to put much more focus 
on the Internet, The Seattle Times reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said company officials have asked Brad Silverberg,  
who led Microsoft's MS-DOS and Windows operating systems upgrades 
through the past decade, to return from an extended leave of 
absence and help make the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverberg, 44, who has been on sabbatical since a corporate  
power struggle two years ago, was an early advocate for Microsoft 
developing Internet software, including its own browser. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said Microsoft has offered Silverberg the chance to  
oversee operations of consumer versions of Windows and the 
company's online businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverberg declined to discuss any offer last week, saying only  
that he has not made a decision and was happy with life away from 
work, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The pending changes are apparently not related to the  
long-running federal antitrust case against Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft declined to comment on any specific reorganization  
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are discussions in the company about how best to map the  
organization to the important customer opportunities,'' spokeswoman 
Marianne Allison told The Associated Press on Sunday. ``The 
discussions are ongoing. But it's inappropriate to comment 
specifically on what structure might result, since some decisions 
have yet to be resolved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reorganizations are not rare at Microsoft, a company that has  
grown explosively in the past two decades to become the planet's 
dominant software company. But the revamping contemplated could be 
one of the broadest the company has seen, The Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times quoted unidentified company sources as saying  
Microsoft president Steve Ballmer, second in command only to 
founder and chairman Bill Gates, was driving the reorganization out 
of concern the company has drifted away from a focus on customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ballmer was made president and given day-to-day oversight of the  
company last year by Gates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times said the reorganization would be along four  
customer-oriented segments: 
</P>
<P>
	--Consumer. The group would include Windows, online and Internet  
customers who use their computers for entertainment, e-mail, Web 
surfing and personal applications. 
</P>
<P>
	--Enterprise. This would focus on large corporations,  
institutions and others with networks of personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Developers. Microsoft wants to renew relationships with  
programmers, who have been wooed by Internet applications and Java, 
a programming platform from arch-rival Sun Microsystems Inc.

<HEADLINE> NASA Launches Comet Chaser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- A comet-chasing spacecraft named  
Stardust rocketed away Sunday on a seven-year, 3 billion-mile quest 
to bring back precious comet dust. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's Stardust began its formidable journey one day late,  
soaring into a clear afternoon sky aboard a Boeing Delta rocket. A 
last-minute radar problem on Saturday caused the delay. 
</P>
<P>
	Launch controllers applauded and punched the air when, a  
half-hour after liftoff, the final stage of the rocket propelled 
Stardust into a solar orbit in pursuit of Comet Wild-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's most exciting to get this beautiful spacecraft on its  
way,'' said Stardust's chief scientist, Donald Brownlee, a 
University of Washington astronomer. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA's Stardust mission is the first attempt to gather material  
from beyond the moon and return it to Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	It is also the first time NASA has sent a robot on an  
extraterrestrial pickup and delivery mission. The last time the 
agency went after samples in outer space was Apollo 17 in 1972, the 
last of the manned lunar landings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not only do we have to get to where we're going ... but then  
we've got to turn around and come home again,'' said Carl Pilcher, 
NASA's science director for solar system exploration. ``This 
certainly adds a new level of complexity and difficulty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists feel it's worth the extra effort and risk.  
</P>
<P>
	Comets are frozen time capsules; the icy, rocky bodies are  
thought to be pieces of the original building blocks of the solar 
system and may well contain compounds from which life formed. 
Abundant in water and carbon-based molecules, comets continually 
bombarded Earth some 4 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Comets can tell us about the history of the early solar system  
and the early history perhaps of our own Earth,'' explained the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory's Martha Hanner, an astronomer taking part in 
the $210 million Stardust mission. 
</P>
<P>
	Stardust is to meet up with Comet Wild-2 in January 2004,  
passing within some 90 miles of the 2 1/2-mile-diameter iceball. The 
comet is named for its discoverer, retired astronomy professor Paul 
Wild, pronounced Vilt, who traveled from Switzerland for the 
launch. 
</P>
<P>
	Tiny comet fragments -- no bigger than a grain of salt --  
hopefully will be trapped by a pop-up collector that's covered with 
a transparent, ultralight glass foam called aerogel. The most 
vulnerable parts of the 850-pound spacecraft, about the size of a 
large refrigerator, are shielded to protect against the swirl of 
particles. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going as close as we can without getting killed,'' said  
Brownlee, the chief scientist. 
</P>
<P>
	If all goes well, the comet samples -- along with interstellar  
dust gathered en route to the comet -- will reach Earth in January 
2006. The return capsule will separate from Stardust at an altitude 
of 69,000 miles and parachute into the Utah desert; Stardust will 
remain in orbit around the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	By then, comet discoverer Wild will be 80 years old. He hopes to  
be around for the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it all works very well, of course, that will be gorgeous,''  
Wild said. ``But there are many possibilities of failure or partial 
failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists expect to get less than a thimble full of comet dust  
back, but that would be plenty for the kind of detailed analysis 
that's planned. Even the fanciest science instruments on spacecraft 
cannot begin to compare with the electron microscopes in 
laboratories on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	This is the first U.S. mission devoted solely to a comet. NASA  
plans three more over the next four years, two of which will 
attempt landings. 
</P>
<P>
	Going along on Stardust are more than 1 million names etched  
onto a pair of silicon chips. People from around the world 
submitted their names via the Internet; one chip also contains the 
approximately 58,200 names inscribed on the Vietnam Veterans 
Memorial in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Americans Dominate Ski Juniors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEAUPRE, Quebec (AP) -- Kim Rogers and Matthew Beardsley  
completed a week of domination by U.S. skiers, winning the downhill 
titles Sunday on the last day of the North American Junior 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Rogers, of Rutland, Vt., won the women's title in 1 minute,  
12.71 seconds at Mt. Ste. Anne, edging Courtney Strait of Clifton 
Park, N.Y. Strait, who picked up the giant slalom and super-G 
championships last week, took silver in 1:12.77. 
</P>
<P>
	Alex Munteanu, of Cortland, N.Y., was third as the  
championships, which were diluted without any skiers from western 
Canada, concluded in sunshine and cold, crisp weather. 
</P>
<P>
	In the men's downhill, Beardsley, of Breckenridge, Colo., took  
the gold medal with a time of 1:09.11 with Travis Townes of Vail, 
Colo., second in 1:09.54. Wade Bishop of Winter Park, Colo., was 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	Although U.S. women won every race title, Kristina Metzger of  
Canada took the combined calculation, mixing downhill, slalom and 
GS results. 
</P>
<P>
	Brad Hogan of Holmes, N.Y., was the men's combined champion as  
races were staged at three ski areas near Quebec City -- Stoneham 
and LeRelais in addition to Mt. Ste. Anne -- in preparation for the 
2000 World Junior Alpine Championships here.

<HEADLINE> Big Stocks Making Big News / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- One of the biggest stock-market stories of the  
late 1990s has been the renaissance of the blue chips. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the past several decades on Wall Street, investors  
learned to think of big stocks as slow and stodgy, ``mature'' 
companies that can't hope to grow as fast as their newer, smaller 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	But over the past few years, that stereotype has been shattered  
with a dazzling display of earnings progress by dozens of big 
companies, ranging from old-line conglomerates like General 
Electric to more specialized operators such as Microsoft and Intel. 
</P>
<P>
	In an increasingly global economy, ``certain big companies have  
figured out how to use their muscle,'' says Beth Terrana, manager 
of the $10.5 billion Fidelity Fund in Boston. ``In doing so, 
they've generated great returns. I think it's really hard for small 
companies to compete.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The many fans of small-company investing know whereof she  
speaks. Over the five-year period through the end of 1998, notes 
the research firm of Lipper Inc., the Russell 1,000 index of the 
largest-company stocks climbed 156.42 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That left the Russell 2,000 index of medium-sized and smaller  
companies, up 63.18 percent over the same span, in the dust. 
</P>
<P>
	For most of this time, many small-stock aficionados assumed that  
the trend was just a passing phase. There have always been cycles, 
they recalled, when small stocks moved in and out of favor in the 
investment world. 
</P>
<P>
	Over long periods, study after study showed that small stocks  
were the place to be, because the typical small company simply was 
more maneuverable and had more room to grow than a big enterprise 
where layers of bureaucracy accumulated, intent on protecting 
existing fiefdoms rather than conquering new worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, however, more and more people wonder whether those ideas  
have lost at least some of their validity. Amid great economic 
turbulence from the mid-1980s through the early '90s, many large 
companies subjected themselves to a radical restructuring, 
overhauling their operations and cutting costs. 
</P>
<P>
	That stood them in good stead when technological progress and  
the spread of capitalism around the world opened up many new global 
business opportunities as the 1990s progressed. In this setting, 
size often looked more like an advantage than a hindrance. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, big companies now may have a much better chance  
than small companies to snap up depressed assets in 
emerging-markets economies, because they have the financial clout 
and foreign presence to negotiate deals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors have historically moved down the capitalization  
scale (to smaller companies) to find attractive growth,'' notes 
Thomas Galvin, investment strategist at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; 
Jenrette Securities Corp. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this task is becoming less critical now that the largest  
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 company, Microsoft, posted a remarkable 74 
percent profit gain in the fourth quarter of 1998 on top of a 45 
percent increase in the year-earlier quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	``A check of the top 25 firms in the S&AMP;P 500 shows roughly 18  
percent growth on an unweighted basis, with many companies 
exploiting weak international markets through direct investment and 
cross-border mergers that will give these heavyweights larger 
market shares coming out of this global crisis than when it 
started, as well as a lower cost base and fatter profits. 
</P>
<P>
	``To us, the results underscore why big-cap growth continues to  
win out.''

<HEADLINE> Nagano Marks Olympic Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAGANO, Japan (AP) -- Nagano marked the anniversary of the 1998  
Winter Olympics on Sunday with dancing, drums and concerns that it 
may be linked to a growing Olympics bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	As drummers, dancers and souvenir hawkers livened up the streets  
of this city in Japan's central alps, a Japan Olympics official 
said eight International Olympic Committee members may have 
violated restrictions on travel to Nagano before it won hosting 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Like several other Olympic sites, including 2002 Winter Games'  
host Salt Lake City, Nagano's Olympic bidding group has come under 
fire for allegedly bribing IOC members with lavish gifts and favors 
in an effort to win their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	The bribery scandal has created a major crisis within the IOC,  
deeply tarnishing its image and leading to the resignations of 
several members and the suggested censure of several more. 
</P>
<P>
	Yushiro Yagi, head of a Japanese panel investigating Nagano's  
bid, said the Nagano bidding committee ``for the most part did not 
appear to have done anything inappropriate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said there did appear to have been more visits to Nagano  
by IOC members than necessary, and said as many as eight IOC 
members may have violated restrictions on the frequency and 
duration of trips to this city before it was chosen as host. 
</P>
<P>
	He also questioned the destruction of documents related to  
bidding committee spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some points which are difficult to accept,  
particularly the destruction of such documents,'' he said. Nagano 
officials in charge of the books said they were disposed of in 
keeping with normal procedures regarding how long documents must be 
preserved. 
</P>
<P>
	Yagi refused to give further details, but said a formal report  
on the committee's findings would be completed and submitted to the 
International Olympic Committee by Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC Vice President Pal Schmitt, here to celebrate the  
anniversary, said any possible violations regarding excessive 
travel would be looked into. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it is documented that unnecessarily they were here against  
our charter ... we will investigate,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, across town, school children in bright blue and red  
costumes held a traditional drum concert near Zenko-ji, a Buddhist 
temple and Nagano's most famous landmark, and skiing and curling 
competitions were held in surrounding towns to commemorate the 
Games. 
</P>
<P>
	In the city center, nearly a thousand people turned out for the  
main celebration Sunday at Olympic Square. 
</P>
<P>
	The Shinano Mainichi, a Nagano newspaper, called the anniversary  
a ``disappointment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The shadow of the bidding scandal that began in Salt Lake City  
looms large in the Nagano sky,'' it said in a front-page editorial.

<HEADLINE> Used Cars Being Sold on Internet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Automakers are turning to the Internet to  
help them sell the growing number of late-model used cars and 
trucks they're getting back after leases expire. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. began testing Internet sales of its used vehicles  
last year in San Francisco, Atlanta, Boston and Houston, and plans 
to expand the program to additional cities soon. Ford also will 
begin advertising the off-lease vehicles on Microsoft CarPoint and 
AutoConnect, which have two of the largest automotive classified 
listings on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Mercedes-Benz of North America plans to offer a similar program  
for its used cars, Mike Jackson, president and chief executive, 
said during a weekend interview at the annual National Automobile 
Dealers Association convention in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're already working on it,'' he said. ``In another year,  
we'll be up and running.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the popularity of leasing has increased over the past decade,  
automakers have found themselves with large numbers of low-mileage, 
late-model used cars and trucks as leases have expired. The 
vehicles usually go to auctions, where dealers buy them to resell 
on their lots. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford's program allows the automaker to recover the higher retail  
price for the vehicles than it would get at a wholesale auction, 
while still giving dealers a cut and a role in the sale without the 
usual inventory expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford says it selects only the best of its Ford, Lincoln and  
Mercury vehicles coming off lease, as well as some from its rental 
and company fleets. All are 3 years old or newer, have under 36,000 
miles, have undergone a thorough inspection and carry a minimum 
one-year, 12,000-mile warranty and 24-hour roadside assistance. 
Prices are nonnegotiable. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers find the vehicle they want from the database on the  
``Ford Pre-Owned Showroom'' on the Internet. They then put down a 
$300 deposit, which is refundable if they later decide they don't 
like the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
	The consumer selects a nearby dealer where the car or truck is  
delivered within 48 hours. If the vehicle meets the consumer's 
expectations after a test drive, the purchase is completed. Ford 
also allows the consumer to return the vehicle within three days or 
300 miles after the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
	Financing can be completed online before the vehicle arrives.  
</P>
<P>
	The program, which began last May, has been a testing ground for  
Ford to determine how to sell cars and trucks via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea was to test whether people would be willing to shop  
and at least initiate the process to buy a certified used 
vehicle,'' Ford spokeswoman Joy Wolfe said. Apparently, they are. 
</P>
<P>
	At a briefing Saturday, David Ropes, director of corporate  
advertising, would not say when the program would go nationwide, 
but he hinted that was not far off. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wouldn't be expanding it if we weren't successful with  
it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Ford nor Mercedes is planning to bypass their franchised  
dealers in their Internet programs. With Ford, the dealer gets a 
fixed commission for handling the vehicle's delivery and final 
paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
	``The farthest thing from our mind is to cut dealers out of the  
process,'' Ropes said. It's important for the dealer to be involved 
because that's where Ford hopes the buyer will return for service 
and accessories, he said.

<HEADLINE>  Orthodox Jew Commits to Maryland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Tamir Goodman's world consists of  
11-hour school days, basketball and, above all, an uncompromising 
devotion to Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
	He adheres to a kosher diet and wears a yarmulke, even on the  
court. The Jewish religion deems that Saturday, the Sabbath, is a 
day of rest, meaning basketball is strictly forbidden. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all this, the University of Maryland has made an oral  
commitment to give Goodman a basketball scholarship. Maryland 
rarely makes this offer to high school juniors, and never before 
has the institution extended such an invitation to an Orthodox Jew. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman averages about 37 points a game for the Talmudical  
Academy, a Jewish day school near Baltimore that has an enrollment 
of only 72 students. 
</P>
<P>
	His basketball prowess has earned him the nickname ``Jewish  
Jordan,'' and Maryland is convinced the 6-foot-3 guard has enough 
skill to make an impact in the same league (the Atlantic Coast 
Conference) as his namesake. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was recruited solely on his athletic talent,'' Maryland  
athletic director Debbie Yow said. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is some question whether Goodman will excel at  
Division I, his father has no doubt Tamir (for whom dating is not 
an option) will remain faithful to his religion after entering a 
whole new world of female students, dormitories and avid fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see him straying. He's a very serious kid,'' Karl  
Goodman said. ``He's going to be under a basketball microscope as 
well as a religious microscope. I don't think he would stray even 
if people weren't watching him, but they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tamir's mother, Chava, constantly watches over him -- except  
during games. Because she is afraid of seeing him get hurt, Chava 
remains outside the arena during games, praying for his health. She 
enters only after the final buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's how I know he's going to remain faithful to his  
religion at Maryland: He's a momma's boy,'' Karl Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamir understands the situation perfectly.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know how much responsibility is now on my shoulders,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamir Goodman is already a part of the scene at Cole Field  
House. He and his coach often sit in seats behind the Maryland 
bench during games, and more than a few fans jostle each other and 
point out The Jewish Kid. 
</P>
<P>
	After a recent game, Goodman and his coach, Harold Katz, sat in  
the floor seats in the emptied arena as Maryland assistant coach 
Billy Hahn assured Goodman that he will have kosher food on the 
table when he joins the team for the 2000-2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a lot of work!'' Hahn said. ``But, of course, you're  
worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping Goodman fed is only a part of the task facing Maryland  
in the months ahead. More important, the Terrapins will try to 
avoid playing on Saturday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all unplowed soil,'' Yow said. ``I've never gone through  
something like this before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman, similarly, already has initiated a different lifestyle.  
Since word got out about his future, he has been sought by media 
outlets ranging from Sports Illustrated to newspapers in Israel. A 
public relations firm was hired to handle the crush. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman's life is now public property.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to go to Maryland. I would definitely do it again  
this way,'' he said. ``I've been dreaming about doing this for a 
long time. It's a good challenge for me and I like challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He surely has one in the ACC. After all, scoring 33 points  
against Antioch High may not equate to success against the likes of 
Duke and North Carolina. Some think Goodman may end up in the third 
row of seats at Cameron Indoor Stadium if his 150-pound frame gets 
bumped under the basket during a battle for a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are going to owe Tamir an apology,'' Katz  
said. ``They say, `Look who he plays against.' I say, `Who does he 
play with?' The other kids on the team try hard, but they don't 
have his talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was evident last week. The school doesn't have a bus for  
road games, so the players arrange their own transportation. 
Goodman got lost, and by the time he showed up his team was 
trailing 20-4 late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman scored 45 points, including the winning tip at the  
buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has Pete Maravich tendencies. I took one look at him and I  
knew he was special,'' said Paul Baker, a scout and ex-college 
coach. ``He sees the whole floor is an unerring shooter. If he 
grows, he has a chance to make a living playing basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For that to happen, Goodman will have to overcome many  
obstacles, not the least of which will be playing under the 
constant scrutiny of a media machine that is already heavily into 
this unique story. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still only a kid,'' Goodman said. ``I'm just Tamir.''

	Despite all this, the University of Maryland has made an oral  
commitment to give Goodman a basketball scholarship. Maryland 
rarely makes this offer to high school juniors, and never before 
has the institution extended such an invitation to an Orthodox Jew. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman averages about 37 points a game for the Talmudical  
Academy, a Jewish day school near Baltimore that has an enrollment 
of only 72 students. 
</P>
<P>
	His basketball prowess has earned him the nickname ``Jewish  
Jordan,'' and Maryland is convinced the 6-foot-3 guard has enough 
skill to make an impact in the same league (the Atlantic Coast 
Conference) as his namesake. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was recruited solely on his athletic talent,'' Maryland  
athletic director Debbie Yow said. 
</P>
<P>
	While there is some question whether Goodman will excel at  
Division I, his father has no doubt Tamir (for whom dating is not 
an option) will remain faithful to his religion after entering a 
whole new world of female students, dormitories and avid fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't see him straying. He's a very serious kid,'' Karl  
Goodman said. ``He's going to be under a basketball microscope as 
well as a religious microscope. I don't think he would stray even 
if people weren't watching him, but they are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tamir's mother, Chava, constantly watches over him -- except  
during games. Because she is afraid of seeing him get hurt, Chava 
remains outside the arena during games, praying for his health. She 
enters only after the final buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here's how I know he's going to remain faithful to his  
religion at Maryland: He's a momma's boy,'' Karl Goodman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamir understands the situation perfectly.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know how much responsibility is now on my shoulders,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tamir Goodman is already a part of the scene at Cole Field  
House. He and his coach often sit in seats behind the Maryland 
bench during games, and more than a few fans jostle each other and 
point out The Jewish Kid. 
</P>
<P>
	After a recent game, Goodman and his coach, Harold Katz, sat in  
the floor seats in the emptied arena as Maryland assistant coach 
Billy Hahn assured Goodman that he will have kosher food on the 
table when he joins the team for the 2000-2001 season. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a lot of work!'' Hahn said. ``But, of course, you're  
worth it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Keeping Goodman fed is only a part of the task facing Maryland  
in the months ahead. More important, the Terrapins will try to 
avoid playing on Saturday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all unplowed soil,'' Yow said. ``I've never gone through  
something like this before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman, similarly, already has initiated a different lifestyle.  
Since word got out about his future, he has been sought by media 
outlets ranging from Sports Illustrated to newspapers in Israel. A 
public relations firm was hired to handle the crush. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman's life is now public property.  
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to go to Maryland. I would definitely do it again  
this way,'' he said. ``I've been dreaming about doing this for a 
long time. It's a good challenge for me and I like challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He surely has one in the ACC. After all, scoring 33 points  
against Antioch High may not equate to success against the likes of 
Duke and North Carolina. Some think Goodman may end up in the third 
row of seats at Cameron Indoor Stadium if his 150-pound frame gets 
bumped under the basket during a battle for a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people are going to owe Tamir an apology,'' Katz  
said. ``They say, `Look who he plays against.' I say, `Who does he 
play with?' The other kids on the team try hard, but they don't 
have his talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That was evident last week. The school doesn't have a bus for  
road games, so the players arrange their own transportation. 
Goodman got lost, and by the time he showed up his team was 
trailing 20-4 late in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Goodman scored 45 points, including the winning tip at the  
buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has Pete Maravich tendencies. I took one look at him and I  
knew he was special,'' said Paul Baker, a scout and ex-college 
coach. ``He sees the whole floor is an unerring shooter. If he 
grows, he has a chance to make a living playing basketball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For that to happen, Goodman will have to overcome many  
obstacles, not the least of which will be playing under the 
constant scrutiny of a media machine that is already heavily into 
this unique story. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still only a kid,'' Goodman said. ``I'm just Tamir.''

<HEADLINE> No Alzeheimer's-Fillings Link Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- There appears to be no link between  
Alzheimer's disease and mercury used in dental fillings, say 
University of Kentucky researchers. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a link has been speculated on in the past, as scientists  
took closer looks at the effects of heavy metals on the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	But the University of Kentucky study said there appears to be no  
harm from mercury fillings. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although very small amounts of mercury are released from  
dental amalgam -- generally when rubbed or abraded due to brushing 
or eating -- it is not taken up by the brain,'' said Dr. Stanley 
Saxe, one of the authors of the study published in Monday's Journal 
of the American Dental Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Saxe is a professor emeritus of periodontics and geriatric  
dentistry in the UK College of Dentistry. 
</P>
<P>
	Dental amalgam has been used since the early 1830s and receives  
high marks for its strength and durability. But amalgam is composed 
of 50 percent mercury, a neurotoxin, causing controversy over its 
possible public health risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Some dentists have encouraged patients to have their amalgam  
fillings removed and replaced by other tooth restoration materials. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers began their study in 1991, funded by a grant  
from the National Institutes of Health. They examined the brains of 
68 people with Alzheimer's and a control group of 33 who were not 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
	Zaven Khachaturian, former director of Alzheimer's research at  
NIH, said the question about a possible Alzheimers-mercury 
connection has been around for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
	``The finding by the Kentucky group, I think, is quite  
significant for the Alzheimer's constituency and their families, to 
at least alleviate some of the concerns they have,'' said 
Khachaturian now retired senior consultant to the Alzheimer's 
Association.

<HEADLINE> Daily News Interviews Quincy Jones </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Quincy Jones says there's only one downside  
to the prospect of downloading music over the Internet -- he'd buy 
too much of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll say 'I don't know anything about it, but I'll take some  
of that, some classical music, ``The Mysterious Voices of 
Bulgaria,'' all of that,''' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	The Grammy-winning musician and record producer says he is eager  
to forego record stores because ``our current system of music 
distribution is so archaic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know what it means, but the changes are certainly  
here,'' Jones, 65, told Sunday's Daily News. 
</P>
<P>
	``When computers can document what your taste is all about, and  
they come to your house every Saturday knowing what you like, 
they'll own you,'' he said. ``They'll get all your money.''

<HEADLINE> In-Line Skaters Prone to Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In in-line skating, pride goes literally  
before a fall. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey finds injuries are more common among more experienced  
skaters, who also are more likely than beginners to try risky 
stunts and to forgo protective gear. 
</P>
<P>
	``The beginners had better safety habits,'' said Dr. Richard M.  
Seldes, an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital of the University of 
Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. ``As a skater learned to skate and 
became more comfortable with their ability, they dropped the gear 
and started doing these tricks, and as a result were getting 
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seldes bases this on questionnaires distributed in six cities  
where in-line skating is popular. Between August 1996 and February 
1997, researchers interviewed 938 randomly chosen skaters ages 18 
or older, in New York, Philadelphia, Houston, Chicago, Los Angeles 
and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	The skaters were asked about any injuries, what safety equipment  
they wore, how often and how far they skated, the sites in which 
they skated, and whether they did tricks or stunts. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, 11 percent of skaters reported having had an injury in  
the past year. The most common body part hurt was the wrist with 15 
percent of all injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The most common types of injuries, at 19 percent each, were  
fractures and bruises. Sixty-five percent of all injuries required 
medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most commonly injured skater was a self-reported expert  
with more than one year of skating experience,'' said the report in 
the American Journal of Public Health. And those who skated more 
than 10 hours a week had four times the injury risk of those who 
skated only one or two hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Only 6 percent of all in-line skaters consistently wore all four  
types of safety equipment -- helmets and elbow, knee and wrist 
guards, the study found. Skaters who considered themselves expert 
were more likely to wear less equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Similarly, the most common causes of injuries were collisions or  
attempting to avoid collisions (26 percent) and falls while 
attempting tricks (21 percent). 
</P>
<P>
	Skating on streets and park paths was most common, and skating  
in an area with railings, ramps and ledges was least common, with 
only 2 percent of skaters saying this was their usual location. But 
skating in the areas with the railings, ramps and ledges was 8.5 
times more likely to result in an injury. 
</P>
<P>
	The pattern indicates that the better skaters might not be as  
good as they think they are, Seldes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings are in line with earlier research at the federal  
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ``In our initial work, 
it seems the people who consider themselves experts were more 
likely to attempt tricks,'' said Dr. Christine M. Branche, director 
of the Division of Unintentional Injury Prevention. The tricks may 
account for a higher level of injuries, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the CDC study, published in 1996 in the New England Journal  
of Medicine, the most common falls involved starting skaters 
wearing little or no safety gear who simply lost their balance or 
fell after running into a road defect or debris. The study 
underlined the overriding need to wear safety equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the CDC study relied on data from injuries severe  
enough to require a visit to a hospital emergency room. The authors 
of the new study felt their database was potentially broader, 
because they could include injuries that were not so severe. 
</P>
<P>
	Another expert also believes certain novices to be more at risk.  
``They are the people who have never taken a lesson and didn't wear 
protective gear,'' said Kalinda Mathis, executive director of the 
International In-line Skating Association in Wilmington, N.C., an 
industry group. But experience is not the same as skill, and some 
of the more experienced skaters might not have built skills by 
taking lessons, either, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone needs lessons; it's a lifelong thing,'' said Kris  
Simeone, a Cleveland-based instructor and director of the trade 
group's instructor certification program. Everyone also needs 
safety gear, she said: ``Skaters that come to our program 
understand the importance of gear and wear it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, the sport itself is not all that dangerous, the  
association said. It cites 1996 figures from the Consumer Product 
Safety Commission showing that, while skating participants rose 20 
percent in 1996, injuries rose only 3 percent.
