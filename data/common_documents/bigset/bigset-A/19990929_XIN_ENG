<HEADLINE> Health of Tanzanian Founding Father Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The health of Tanzanian
founding father Julius Nyerere who is in critical condition is
improving, the State House said in a press release here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, 77, now suffering from chronic lymphocytic leukemia
(blood cancer), is under round-the-clock medical care at St.
Thomas Hospital in London, while his wife Maria Nyerere and his
two daughters Anna and Rose are taking turns in assisting him, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said the government is trying to get the best treatment
available in Britain for Nyerere, adding that President Benjamin
Mkapa is closely monitoring the elder African statesman's
condition.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Administration and Local Governments Kingunge
Ngombale-Mwiru left the Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam for London
Tuesday to administer issues concerning Nyerere in collaboration
with Tanzanian High Commission in Britain, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere led the then Tanganyika to independence from Britain in
1961 and masterminded its union of Zanzibar isles in 1964 to form
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
After retiring as president in 1985, he played an advisory role
in both Tanzanian politics and African affairs. He tirelessly
mediated Burundi peace talks in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa made a stopover in London last Saturday after concluding
a 12-day working visit to the United States. He visited Nyerere at
the hospital. An aide to Mkapa said Nyerere was a bit conscious,
but he could not speak at that time.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere began to talk and wanted to walk out of the ward later
but was stopped by nurses, the aide told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa has asked the nation to pray for Nyerere, who is highly
respected as Mwalimu or teacher in Kiswahili language, for his
wisdom and integrity.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Slams U.N., NATO Forces in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Tuesday
voiced its dissatisfaction with the performance of the United
Nations and the NATO-led peacekeeping forces in the Serbian
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Zivadin Jovanvic, the Yugoslav foreign minister, was
particularly harsh in his criticism of the U.N. special
representative for Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner of France, who is
heading the U.N. civilian operation in Kosovo, saying that
Belgrade dislikes "his work and his attitude."
</P>
<P>
"He looks and acts more like a special representative of NATO
rather than a representative of the U.N. secretary-general," said
the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic said that while the U.N. chief supported Kosovo
being a province of Serbia, Kouchner had taken many steps in the
opposition direction, such as introducing the German mark as
currency and the establishment of a new customs and border
operation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he voiced his strong opposition to the
transformation of the rebel ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army
(KLA) into a protection force, saying the terrorist group is "the
seeds of destabilization not only of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia but of the entire region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the NATO-led peacekeeping force and the United
Nations had been anything but successful in safeguarding Serbs
in the province.
</P>
<P>
More than 250,000 Serbs had been driven by force out of Kosovo,
more than 400 Serbs killed, 500 kidnapped and 600 wounded since
the troops were deployed and the U.N. mission created.
</P>
<P>
He said 200,000 people from Albania and Macedonia were in
Kosovo illegally and many of them were transforming the region
into "a haven for arms smugglers and narcotics traffickers, money
launders and white-slave traders."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that he had some difficulties in
getting a visa to come to the 54th General Assembly session and
had some limitations in moving around in New York. "We can not
move 10 blocs away from our hotel."

<HEADLINE> 16 Tanzanian Bankers questioned over Billions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian police have
started questioning 16 people in connection with the theft and
fraud at the National Bank of Commerce (NBC), local newspaper The
Guardian reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A senior police officer was quoted as saying that the suspects,
who were all former employees of the bank, allegedly have caused
losses of billions of Tanzanian shillings (about one U.S. dollar
for 800 Tanzanian shillings) by theft and fraud since January.
</P>
<P>
Simon Mwageni, senior assistant commissioner of Police of the
Criminal Investigation Department, said NBC Managing Director
Gerald Jordan had already submitted some evidence concerning the
losses in 34 bank branches.
</P>
<P>
However, Mwageni refused to mention the exact amount of losses
that the bank incurred.
</P>
<P>
"What I can assure you is that the suspects will never escape,"

GAZA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) called on the Israeli government to cancel its
plan to build 2,600 housing units in the West Bank and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The call came in a message sent by PNA Minister of Local
Government and Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat to Dany
Yatom, an official with the Israeli Prime Minister's Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Erekat cautioned that the implementation of the recent Israeli
decisions on Jewish settlement expansion will have destructive
impact on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
He sent messages to the same effect to United States
coordinator of the Middle East peace process Dennis Ross and the
representative of the United Nations Secretary General in
Palestine Tery Larsen.
</P>
<P>
Erekat also sent messages to leaders of the European Union
members, and Asian, African, Latin American countries, urging them
to step in to pressure Israel to cancel the settlement expansion
plans.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat condemned the new Israeli
settlement activities as "undermining the peace process and
violating the signed accords."

<HEADLINE> IMF, World Bank Annual Meetings Open in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Annual Meetings of the
Boards of Governors of the World Bank and International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Opened here Tuesday with the horizon brightening for
world economy.
</P>
<P>
Declaring the meetings open, Mahesh Acharya, Chairman of the
Boards of Governors and Finance Minister of Nepal, said there are
two major challenges facing the world, that is to learn lessons
from the recent crisis and to address the pressing needs of the
most disadvantaged members.
</P>
<P>
"It is imperative that the reform of the international
financial system leads to early and sustained results to help us
deal more effectively with future challenges and to raise living
standards," Mahesh Acharya said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international financial institutions to pay
special attention to substantial debt relief, a sustained poverty
reduction effort and other important social needs.
</P>
<P>
Acharya urged contributors to make additional financial
commitments to ensure success of the Heavily Indebted Poor
Countries (HIPC) Initiative so as to provide faster, deeper and
broader debt relief to the poor countries.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony, President of the World Bank
James D. Wolfensohn called for the establishment of a new
international development architecture to parallel the new
global financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
Such an architecture includes a coalition built on the
cooperation of all the players, the United Nations, governments,
multilaterals, the private sector and civil society, Wolfensohn
said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a coalition in which we recognized that, yes, we
must break the chains of debt, but we must also have the
resources to go much further and break the chains of poverty,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"It would be a coalition that recognizes that we must have a
trade system that works, with rules and norms that are fair,
comprehensive and inclusive," he added.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said it would be a coalition that recognizes that
environment knows no border and that recognizes the power of
modern research to democratize health -- to harness new vaccines
to eradicate AIDS, Malaria, TB and Polio.
</P>
<P>
It would be a coalition to make the information revolution
truly universal, to bridge the growing knowledge gap, to connect
all developing and transitional economies to the world and to
each other, to be a real vehicle for sharing and learning via
satellite, e-mail and the Internet, he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the same occasion, IMF Managing Director Michel
Camdessus stressed that there is a pressing need to move quickly
to implement the reform of the international monetary and
financial system and the offensive to eradicate poverty and to
humanize globalization.
</P>
<P>
"There is still urgent need for action, for implementation of
reforms decided," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the major lessons from the financial crisis, Camdessus said
that cooperation is a must in the new world of globalization.
</P>
<P>
"A second lesson, a lesson of this very moment, is that we
always run the risk, when economic prospects have improved, of
moving too slowly to implement the reforms that are needed," he
added.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 32,000 Refugees Flee Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 32,000 people have fled
the breakaway republic of Chechnya to escape air strikes by
federal fighter jets, which entered the sixth day Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Of those who were registered as refugees, 25,000 moved into
Ingushetia, 3,000 into Stavropol territory and North Ossetia each
and about 1,000 into Daghestan, the Interfax news agency reported,
quoting Yuri Biragov, deputy head of the Russian Federal Migration
Service (FMS).
</P>
<P>
However, Biragov pointed out that some refugees fleeing
Chechnya had not registered with local FMS offices.
</P>
<P>
The service started Tuesday to register refugees and issue them
the so-called Form 7, "a primary document issued to a citizen who
has left his/her residence and arrived elsewhere because of
extraordinary events such as hostilities."
</P>
<P>
"The status of such a citizen remains uncertain," Biragov said.
"At the moment we are engaged only in registration."
</P>
<P>
"Whether they will be regarded as displaced persons will be
decided later," he said.
</P>
<P>
At least 28 million rubles (about 1.11 million U.S. dollars) a
month will be needed to meet the primary needs of those people who
have fled Chechnya, Biragov said.
</P>
<P>
His service on Tuesday sent to Ingushetia 3,000 beds and linen,
100 tents, 15 tons of rice, 10 tons of condensed milk, 30 tons of
pasta and 10 tons of sugar, Biragov said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Ingush President Ruslan Aushev alerted the public to a
pending humanitarian catastrophe in his republic, saying
Ingushetia had already absorbed over 60,000 Chechen refugees.
</P>
<P>
"We urgently need humanitarian assistance, notably temporary
housing, warm clothes and blankets ahead of winter, as well as
food. The republic is unable to handle this problem on its own,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Following his plea, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin dispatched
Emergency Situations Minister Sergei Shoigu to Ingushetia.
</P>
<P>
Shoigu, however, said assertions about a humanitarian
catastrophe were premature.
</P>
<P>
The situation is "serious enough" but it does not require
international aid. "We are in a position to handle it ourselves,"
he said, adding that the number of refugees coming to Ingushetia
was only 15,000.
</P>
<P>
Shoigu said that people are fleeing Chechnya because they "are
afraid, not because federal forces are missing their targets."
</P>
<P>
Putin also disputed Aushev's intention to turn to the U.N. for
aid in dealing with the refugee problem.
</P>
<P>
He said the government regards the refugees as Russian citizens
but there could be terrorists among them and special services are
attending to this issue.
</P>
<P>
The government may ask international organizations for aid in
dealing with the refugee issue but there is no need to do so now,
Putin said.

SANTIAGO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chilean Foreign Minister
Juan Gabriel Valdes postponed his visit to Russia, planned for
next month, due to the extradition process against ex-military
chief Augusto Pinochet in London.
</P>
<P>
The situation arose in Chile because the Pinochet case demands
that Valdes is present in the country, officials from the Foreign
Ministry, who requested anonymity, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The head of Chilean diplomacy was due to visit Russia from
October 7 to 11 to strengthen the links between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Ministry declined to give details of the new dates
for the rescheduled trip by Valdes.
</P>
<P>
A London Tribunal began proceedings on September 27, in the
extradition case of Pinochet, at the request of a Spanish judge.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish judge, Baltasar Garzon, requested the extradition
of Pinochet to try him on charges of committing crimes against
humanity during the military regime in Chile, from 1973 to 1990.
Pinochet has been held in London since October 1998.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic relations between Chile and Spain became tense
after the refusal by Madrid to allow the Pinochet case to be
undertaken by international arbitration, as was requested by
Santiago. Endite

and the budget may be adopted before the end of the year, Zhukov

concerned with the implementation of the Security Council
resolution 1244, and "only the faithful implementation of the
resolution can lead to peace and security" in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"He gives his full support for the full and strict
implementation of the resolution, the principle of sovereignty,
and the dialogue within the (Kosovo) autonomy in the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia, and equality to all citizens and all
ethnic groups in Kosovo, and the resolution of the Kosovo issue
through peaceful and political means," Jovanovic said.
</P>
<P>
Annan's statement was echoed by leaders of some 50 countries,
and they all voiced full support for "the full and strict
implementation" of the Security Council resolution 1244, which,
adopted on June 10, demands the full respect for the sovereignty
and territorial integrity by all Member States.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the resolution is the main issue on the
agenda during his separate meetings with foreign ministers of some
50 countries and heads of state and heads of governments of
various countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they also discussed the humanitarian situation in
the wake of NATO air strikes, which began on March 24 and lasted
78 days, and the renewal of Yugoslav seat in the United Nations
and other international organizations, he said.
</P>
<P>
With the prompt withdrawal of Yugoslav troops and security
forces from Kosovo, a Serbian province, the rebel Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) staged a political comeback in the region,
worsening the security situation on the ground and leading to an
ethnic cleansing, he said. "About 250,000 Serbs and non-Albanians
have been pushed by force out of that part of Serbia."

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Privatizes Management of Water Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The management of the water
supply systems in seven Mozambican cities will be handed over to a
private operator as from November 30 under a contract signed here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
According to Mozambique News Agency, a consortium named Aguas
de Mocambique (Waters of Mozambique) has won the international
tender for the management of the water systems of Maputo in the
south, Beira and Quelimane in the centre, and Nampula and Pemba in
the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Maputo system also caters for the adjoining city of Matola,
while the Beira system extends to the city of Dondo, about 30
kilometers to the northwest.
</P>
<P>
Aguas de Mocambique is led by the French company Saur
International, which provides 38.5 percent of the consortium's
capital. Another 31.5 percent comes from the Portuguese company
IPE-Aguas de Portugal, with the remaining 30 percent from
Mazi-Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The latter consists of a prominent Mozambican NGO, the
Community Development Foundation, headed by former Education
Minister Graca Machel, and the private companies Norte
Investimentos, FLOTUR, and Mg-Mocambique Gestores.
</P>
<P>
The government body that signed the contract with the
consortium is the newly established Water Supply Investment and
Assets Fund (FIPAG).
</P>
<P>
Privatizing the management of urban water supply is one of the
 conditions imposed by donors and funding agencies for the
provision of 117 million U.S. dollars to improve the services.
</P>
<P>
Among the sources of this funding are the World Bank, the
African Development Bank, the Dutch government and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
Of this amount, 25 million U.S. dollars is earmarked for
running the services, while the remaining 92 million U.S. dollars
will be used to rehabilitate and expand the water supply network
in all seven cities.
</P>
<P>
For Maputo and Matola, the contract is valid for 15 years,
whereas for the other cities it will expire after five years.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, the Mozambican government remains the
owner of all infrastructures and water assets.

<HEADLINE> Belgrade Opposes Transformation of KLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia Tuesday
voiced its strong opposition to the transformation of the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), saying that the terrorist and
separatist group should be disbanded.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Zivadin Jovanovic, who arrived here
for the 54th General Assembly session, made statement in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"KLA should be disbanded, not transformed, it should be
disarmed, not semi-armed," he said.
</P>
<P>
The KLA and the NATO-led peacekeeping force signed an agreement
in Pristina, provincial capital of Kosovo, a week ago, under which
the ethnic Albanian guerrilla group was transformed into the
civilian Kosovo Protection Corps.
</P>
<P>
However, the armed group still was not fully disarmed because
Belgrade said it concealed some weapons in Kosovo, a Serbian
province, Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
"It is a unique situation where somebody in this Organization
supports the terrorist and separatist group," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav Justice Ministry said in a statement last
Wednesday that the United Nations "is seeking through its mission
in Kosovo to legalize the activities of KLA terrorist and criminal
gangs in the form of a civil force for the protection of Kosovo."
</P>
<P>
"The Yugoslav Government considers that the agreement on the
transformation of KLA has no foundation," and "constitutes a
violation" of the Security Council resolution 1244, which, adopted
on June 10, urges the demilitarization of KLA, he said. "It would
have unforeseeable consequences for peace and security in Kosovo."

<P>
BAGHDAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Six Iraqi civilians were
injured in U.S. and British air raids on residential areas in the
southern Iraqi province of Misan on Monday, an Iraqi military
spokesman announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.S. and British warplanes coming from
Saudi and Kuwaiti bases bombed the villages of Mizbaniya and
Talaae in Misan province.
</P>
<P>
The bombardment injured six civilians, including two children,
and destroyed a number of civilian houses, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's airstrikes against Iraq, the United
States and British warplanes have made nearly 13,000 sorties over
the no-fly zones in Iraq, and have been regularly attacking Iraqi
civilian and military targets, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led Western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The anti-industrial pollution
committee of the Arab countries opened its seventh meeting on
Tuesday at the Arab League headquarters in Cairo to discuss ways
of protecting the environment in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, the committee will study research
papers on the impact of sugar plants on the environment, said
Fatmah al Mallah, director of the Arab League Environment
Department.
</P>
<P>
The participants will also review the experiments on and
experience in controlling pollution caused by the sugar plants in
some Arab countries, al Mallah was quoted by Egypt's Middle East
News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
The committee members will visit a number of Egyptian sugar
factories to inspect some programs worked out by the Egyptian
government to fight industrial pollution, she added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was convened in accordance with recommendations and
resolutions adopted by the Arab Environment Ministers Council, al
Mallah said.
</P>
<P>
The council's resolutions are aimed at following up the
implementation of a program it has hammered out for the year
1998-99 to fight industrial pollution in Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The committee will report the outcome of its discussions to the
ministerial council to help it take proper steps in environmental
protection, she said.
</P>
<P>
Lack of environmental protection awareness and necessary
facilities has caused serious industrial pollution.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, Arab countries have enhanced their consciousness and
begun to step up efforts to protect the environment from further
deteriorating.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebel Leader to Go Home via Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's rebel leader,
Foday Sankoh, Tuesday left Cote d'Ivoire for Liberia on his way
home to join an unity government formed under the Lome Peace
Accord, said reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
He would personally thank Liberian President Charles Taylor for
his contribution to the Sierra Leone peace process, said the
leader of the United Revolutionary Front (URF), which had fought
nearly a decade of civil war with different Sierra Leonean
governments.
</P>
<P>
After the stop in Liberia, "I am going to Sierra Leone to make
my own contribution to the peace accord," said Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
A S. Leone presidential aide said last week that both Foday
Sankoh and Johnny Koroma, leader of May 1997 coup and a
short-lived military regime followed, were expected to arrive in
Freetown, S. Leone's capital, by October 1.
</P>
<P>
The two rebel leaders' long absence in S.Leone has caused
great concern for the international community, especially the west
African countries who helped broker the July 7 Lome peace accord.
</P>
<P>
The demilitarization of the rebels, which should have started
in mid- August, remains undone, while clashes between the rebels
and government or among different rebel factions have been
reported frequently.
</P>
<P>
According to Lome accord, Sankoh is to get the position of
chairman of a national minerals commission with the rank of
vice-president, while Koroma will take charge of a national
commission overseeing implementation of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Under the intensive pressure for him to come back to facilitate
the peace process, Sankoh last month started his tour to "visit
old friends" on his way back to Freetown.

<HEADLINE> Death Rates Lower in Wedlock in Britain: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Death rates among married
people are lower, according to research released by the British
government on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The "Deaths in England and Wales" survey shows that married men
were less likely to die at any age between 20 and 84 than their
non-married counterparts, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
For married women, death rates were lower at all ages from 20
onwards.
</P>
<P>
In fact, single, widowed or divorced men in their 50s and early
60s were up to two-and-a-half times more likely to die.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Yoav Ben-Shlomo, a senior lecturer in epidemiology in the
department of social medicine at Bristol University, said many
factors were thought to give married people an advantage.
</P>
<P>
He said that those with existing health problems were less
likely to attract a spouse, and those who developed problems when
married more likely to suffer a marriage breakdown.
</P>
<P>
Another argument, he said, was that the lifestyle of the
unmarried was generally unhealthier than that of the married.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The alcohol consumption of divorced men tended to be
higher - perhaps one reason they became divorced in the first
place."
</P>
<P>
Married people, he said, tended to be better supported
psychologically, which has been shown to yield health benefits -
and have better access to healthcare.
</P>
<P>
The survey, released by the Office for National Statistics,
includes information on death rates by age, sex and marital
status, by cause and general life expectancy.
</P>
<P>
Average life expectancy is now 74.6 years for men and 79.7
years for women.
</P>
<P>
Men now live 4.7 years longer than in 1975-77, and women 3.7
years longer.

<HEADLINE> Blair Says Foundations Laid for New Britain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOURNEMOUTH, Britain, September 28 (Xinhua) -- British Prime
Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday issued another declaration of war
against conservatism, which he said blocks his Labor Party's
reform program for a New Britain.
</P>
<P>
However, Blair told the Labor Party's on-going annual
conference that "The foundations of a New Britain are being laid"
and "The political landscape of Britain has changed forever."
</P>
<P>
Reviewing the Labor's two years in government, Blair dwelled on
the its successful economic policy, saying that after decades of
Tory (Conservative) "boom and bust," the Labor Government has
handed out "the best economic news in a generation," as 650,000
more jobs have been created, inflation is low, and unemployment is
falling.
</P>
<P>
More importantly, Blair said, "economic efficiency and social
justice are finally working in partnership together," after what
he called "a century of antagonism."
</P>
<P>
"We are demonstrating that it is possible to cut poverty and
run the economy well," he added.
</P>
<P>
But a lot remains to be done, including "more than 1 million
still unemployed, schools and hospitals still needing investment,
pensioners still living in hardship, and people still petrified by
crime and drugs," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He spoke of the challenges facing Britain in the next century,
saying: "We know what a 21st century nation needs -- a
knowledge-based economy, a strong civic society and a confident
place in the world."
</P>
<P>
In contrast to the past centuries when land, plant and capital
were considered the most important resources, "talent is the 21st
century's wealth," he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to liberate Britain from the old structures, old
prejudices, and old ways of doing things, the nation needs to
defeat the forces of conservatism, which are "not just in the
Conservative Party but within us, within our nation," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
"What threatens the nation-state today is not change, but the
refusal to change in a world opening up and becoming ever more
interdependent," he said. "The old air of superiority based on
past glory must give way to the ambition to succeed, based on the
merit of what Britain stands for today.

<HEADLINE> Blair on UK's Destiny with Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOURNEMOUTH, Britain, September 28 (Xinhua) -- British Prime
Minister Tony Blair on Tuesday lashed out at the "Europhobes" in
Britain, indicating that the country's destiny is with Europe.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Labor Party's annual conference, Blair posed the
question of whether Britain's destiny is with Europe or not.
</P>
<P>
"If the answer is no, then we should leave," he said. "But we
would leave an economic union in which 50 percent of our trade is
done, on which millions of British jobs depend. Our economic
future would be uncertain. But what is certain is that we would
not be a power."
</P>
<P>
"Britain would no longer play a determining part in the future
of the continent to which we belong," he said. "That would be the
real end of one thousand years of history."
</P>
<P>
"We can choose this destiny. But we should do it with our eyes
open and our senses alert, not blindfold and dulled by the
incessant propaganda of Europhobes," he said, in what would be
considered the sternist remarks he made recently.
</P>
<P>
However, the single currency is a decision dependent on the
economic conditions and on the consent of the British people in a
referendum, he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we believe our destiny is with Europe, then let us leave
behind the muddling through, the hesitation, the half-heartedness
which has characterized British relations with Europe for forty
years and play our part with confidence and pride giving us the
chance to defeat the forces of conservatism, economic and
political, that hold Europe back too," he said.
</P>
<P>
Britain is stronger with the United States today because its
strong in Europe, he said. "Britain has the potential to be the
bridge between Europe and America."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Dips In September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
NEW YORK, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Consumer Confidence
Index in the United States continued to dip in September after
slips in both July and August, indicating a slower economy.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a prominent business-financed research
group, said in a report Tuesday that the index dropped to 134.2
in September from 136.0 in August.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the September dip, confidence levels are still at
historically high levels," said Lynn Franco, Director of The
Conference Board's Consumer Research Center. "We anticipate no
dramatic shifts soon in consumer spending patterns."
</P>
<P>
Franco said "The latest figure is only five points off the
June roading, with consumers generally optimistic about both the
economy and job prospects."
</P>
<P>
Consumer sentiment is an important economic indicator in the
United States because consumer spending accounts for two-thirds
of the nation's overall economic activity.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the dip in the consumer conference suggested
that the U.S. Federal Reserve' tight monetary policy is slowing
the economy. The Federal Reserve raised interest rates twice
in the past few months in an effort to cool off the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said the proportion of consumers
expecting business conditions to worsen rose to 7.1 percent, up
from 6.80 percent last month. Those expecting conditions to
improve over the next six months dropped to 16.4 percent from
17.5 percent in August, it said.
</P>
<P>
The Board said nearly 16 percent of consumers expect more
jobs to be available in the next six months, down from 17.7
percent in previous survey, and consumers expecting increase in
their incomes declined to 25.9 percent from 26.6 percent in
August.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Community Urged to Pressure Turkey on Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Greece Tuesday urged the
international community to pressure Turkey into helping resolve
the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on statements made by Turkish Prime Minister Bulent
Ecevit concerning the prospects of resolving the Cyprus problem,
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas Tuesday voiced the hope
that the international community could provide the push to Turkey
to move forward on Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He added that the key to settle the issue lies with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit has reportedly ruled out any compromise by his
government on the Cyprus problem, demanding that Greek-Turkish
differences be resolved before a solution is sought for the issue
of Cyprus, which has been divided into the Greek
Cypriots-controlled south and the Turkish Cypriots-dominated north
since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern
third of the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union
with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Reppas pointed out that the Greek government was pessimistic
about progress on the Cyprus issue in the near future because
Ecevit's statements indicated Turkey was sticking to its old
position.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Cyprus issue was an international problem and
not the Greek-Turkish disputes.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman stated that Greece and Turkey, which have nearly
gone to war three times in the past 25 years for territorial
disputes and the Cyprus problem, could deal with their differences
through international law.

<P>
The reports provide an overview of the state of the islands'
environment from a regional perspective and evaluate policy
responses and highlight the priority issues that the international
community should address.
</P>
<P>
The reports indicate that since the adoption of the Barbados
Program of Action, progress has not been as much as hoped for.
Notwithstanding important improvements, the overall environmental
conditions in small island states are still a major concern.
</P>
<P>
The pressures faced by the Caribbean, Pacific islands and
Western Indian Ocean regions are all too familiar, increasing
populations coupled with limited land area and a fragile
resource base, the real and potential impact of climate change
and natural disasters, increasing urbanization, changing
patterns of production and consumption and the associated
increases in the amount and type of waste, coupled with
increasing poverty.
</P>
<P>
In addition, tourism, which is fast becoming the most
important industry for small island states, has contributed to
pressure on land and water resources, and the increase in high
per capita generation of waste, which has doubled in some
countries in the last 30 years.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Mayor Expects Rapid Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, the largest
industrial base in China, is expected to enjoy a 10 percent
economic growth rate this year, according to Mayor Xu Kuangdi.
</P>
<P>
Xu made this remark at a banquet held this evening for
delegates attending the '99 Fortune Global Forum. The three-day
gathering of more than 800 CEOs from more than 500 corporations
from around the world will conclude tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
Xu noted that in the past six years, the city registered an
average of 12.6 percent annual growth rate to reach a gross
domestic product (GDP) of 368.8 billion yuan in 1998. The service
industry, with finance, commerce, trade, transportation and real
estate as major sectors, is growing fast and has become a driving
force for economic growth, said Xu.
</P>
<P>
In the past twenty years, the city invested a total of 240
billion yuan in infrastructure construction, about 40 times that
of the previous 30 years combined.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of June, investors from more
than 80 countries and regions had invested in nearly 20,000
projects in the city, backed up by contracted foreign funds of 37
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
China recently adopted a policy to open wider to the outside
world in the service and trade sectors, allowing foreign banks in
Pudong to do Chinese yuan business on a trial basis and to extend
their business to adjacent Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. "
Shanghai will grasp firmly this opportunity to further improve its
investment environment and woo more investment," said Xu.
</P>
<P>
He also cited the city's commitment to improving environmental
protection and bringing about a distinct change in the quality of
the environment in the city in three years.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 28 (xinhua) -- Angolan rebels have destroyed
five bridges along the principle supporting line for the
government troops fighting in central Angola, a highway leading to
Bailundo, the political headquarter of the rebel National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Local analysts consider that the destruction of the bridges is
aimed to impede the government from rushing military supplies for
FAA, which is fighting against UNITA rebels in the province of
Huambo, according to a report Tuesday by the official news agency
Angop.
</P>
<P>
Bailundo has been under the control of UNITA since 1975 when
Angola gained independence from the former colonist Portugal and
soon fell into civil conflicts.
</P>
<P>
A metal bridge above the Kulay River, only 35 kilometers away
from the town of Balombo, became the latest objective of the
UNITA's attempt.
</P>
<P>
Balombo is an important fortress on the most important highway
connecting Bailundo and the outside world, which is also the
principle supporting line for the government troops fighting in
the interior part of the country.

<HEADLINE> Economists on China's SOE Reform at Fortune Forum (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- One of the major challenges
China is confronted with is deepening the reform of its state-
owned enterprises (SOEs), both foreign and Chinese economists
agreed today at the ongoing Fortune Global Forum.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting today on China's economic development, former U.S.
trade representative Carla Hills, research fellow of the Chinese
Academy of Sciences, Hu Angang, senior fellow of the Brookings
Institution, Nicholas Lardy, and Professor Justin Yifu Lin of
Beijing University, all proposed that the success of the SOE
reform lies in reducing the burdens of enterprises, creating more
employment opportunities, and sharpening their competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
Professor Lin said that while the output of the SOEs accounts
for half of China's gross domestic product, they employ two-thirds
of the country's labor force. "Therefore, the SOE reform is an
important issue," he added.
</P>
<P>
Too many governmental functions shouldered by SOEs increase
their production costs, thus dragging them into an unfavorable
position in market competition, Lin said. Therefore, he added, the
priority of the SOE reform should be the establishment of a social
security system.
</P>
<P>
As an expert on the Chinese economy, Lardy said that the debt-
equity swap is part of the solution to the SOE reform.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his hope that this practice will play a more
important role in the reforms, adding that he also appreciates the
efforts to reform China's pension system.

<P>
Hu Angang, an expert on China's taxation reform and regional
disparities, said that no nation, especially one with a huge
population, can avoid new challenges. The point is how to adjust
the policy in the face of these challenges.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that one important factor hindering the SOE reform is
the lack of a comprehensive social security system.
</P>
<P>
"I think reform of the social security system should be listed
as the top priority in the next five-year plan," he said. "The
issue of employment should be another priority."
</P>
<P>
In another development, former U.S. trade representative Carla
Hills, who was in charge of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
negations with China in the Bush administration, said that China's
accession to the World Trade Organization will help improve the
efficiency of the country's SOEs.
</P>
<P>
As more foreign firms enter China, a competitive environment
will be created and they will have to improve their
competitiveness, she said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Foreign Minister Says Most U.N. Members  Support Principle of Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Foreign
Minister Zivadin Jovanovic here Tuesday said that most of the 188
U.N. Member States have condemned the NATO military action against
Yugoslavia and supported the sovereignty and territorial integrity
of the Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister told a press conference that "This 54th
session of the General Assembly of the United Nations is
reflecting the drama of the (Kosovo) war on the eve of the new
millennium."
</P>
<P>
"This drama was started on March 24 this year by the aggression
of NATO against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia," he said,
"This blunt use of force has been done in violation of the U.N.
Charter, basic principles of international law, and setting up a
very dangerous precedent of (the) use of force contrary to (the)
U.N. Charter and without the involvement of the Security Council,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO began the unilateral military action against Yugoslavia
without the authorization of the 15-nation Security Council,
which, under the Charter, has the primary responsibility to
maintain peace and security in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the killing of many innocent civilians and the
destruction of civilian infrastructure, NATO air strikes brought
about a loss of some 100 billion U.S. dollars in Yugoslavia, said
the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"NATO countries are bound by international law to pay the war
damage to Yugoslavia," he said.
</P>
<P>
"On the question of intervention or no intervention, there is a
vast majority of the international community clearly advocate the
respect for the international law and the U.N. Charter," he said.

to make money. He said that his company will be very much aware of
the culture and sensitivity of China and strive to establish a
long-term friendship with the Chinese people and government.
</P>
<P>
"That's the way that we shall grow with China," he said.

<P>
For these reasons, Viacom, which announced a merger with the U.
S. TV network CBS earlier this month, chose to establish a major
presence in China through a music channel -- MTV.

manufacturing compact disks in Shanghai.
</P>

first foreign company to expand operations into wider scopes in
the publishing industry in China.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A multi-million-dollar cinema
megaplex is being built in Laval, north of Montreal, Quebec.
</P>
<P>
Local media said Tuesday that the project of 30 million
Canadian dollars (about 20 million U.S. dollars) will be an
18-screen complex, with a giant flying saucer set atop the
theatre.
</P>
<P>
A joint venture between Famous Players Inc. and Ivanhoe Inc.,
the 4900-seat Colossus Laval is planned to open in Autumn of 2000
to "transport guests to the future of Quebec moviegoing," the

<HEADLINE> S. African President Meets Angolan Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 28 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki Tuesday received a special envoy from Angolan
President Jose Eduardo dos Santos in Cape Town, South African
Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Angola has been torn by civil war since November last year
after the collapse of the 1994 Lusaka peace pact.
</P>
<P>
SAPA quoted a South African presidential aide as saying that
the secretary-general of the ruling People's Liberation Movement
of Angola (MPLA), Joao Lorenco, was bringing a special message
from dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
The aide declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Dos Santos also sent an envoy to meet with Mozambican President
Joaquim Chissano, who is the Southern African Development
Community chairman, earlier on Tuesday, SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
Chissano, who left for New York later in the day, was to
discuss the Angolan conflict with the United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan conflict was also on Mbeki's agenda when he visited
New York last week and the subject of talks with U.S. President
Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
A few weeks ago, representatives of Angolan rebels contacted
several southern African heads of state, indicating that they were
keen for a negotiating process to be facilitated.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Mbeki may raise this issue with the MPLA
delegation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mbeki's spokesman Parks Mankahlana said a statement
by Angola' s deputy foreign minister accusing South Africa of
aiding Angolan rebels and calling for international sanctions
against Pretoria had been clarified.

BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Following are the highlights
of the diplomatic news in China released by Xinhua today.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-China Cooperation Benefits All: Kissinger
</P>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Former Secretary of State of
the United States Henry Kissinger said here today that maintaining
cooperation between China and the United States will be good to
the United States, China and the whole world as well.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger said at a luncheon during the ongoing Fortune Global
Forum, which began Monday, that the two countries should resolve
their disputes through diplomatic channels on the basis of mutual
understanding and accommodation. He stressed that it is hard to
imagine that Asia will prosper under the circumstances of a cold
war between the United States and China.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger Urges China, U.S. to Resolve WTO at Proper Time
</P>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger said here today that the United States and
China should resolve the issue of China's accession to the World
Trade Organization (WTO) at a time it should be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger said in a speech at a luncheon at the ongoing Fortune
Global Forum that China's accession to the WTO will be good to
China, the United States and the world at large. He said the two
sides missed a chance for settlement of the WTO issues last April
mainly because of the "internal problems" on the part of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President to Visit Six Nations
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
is to visit six countries from October 18 to November 3.
</P>

China Indignant at Anti-China U.S. Defense Act: FM Spokeswoman
</P>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua)-- China is intensely indignant
at and strongly opposes the anti-China U.S. Defense Authorization
Act, said Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Zhang Qiyue here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The 2000 Fiscal Year Defense Authorization Act, which was
passed recently by the U.S. Congress, contains many anti-China
clauses proposed by a small number of congressmen, the spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at today's routine press conference, Zhang described
the act as attempting to interfere in China's internal affairs and
impair Sino-U.S. relationship by making use of such issues as
Taiwan, China's efforts for national defense, Sino-U.S. scientific
exchange, the alleged China "espionage case" and non-proliferation.

<HEADLINE> Bad Loans in Thailand Decrease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Thai financial institutions
in July recorded total non-performing loans (NPLs) of 2.645
trillion baht (66.125 billion U.S. dollars) or 47.10 percent of
total credits, posing a drop of 9.6 billion baht (240 million
dollars) from a month early.
</P>
<P>
The drop of NPLs is due to quickened write-offs and debt
restructuring process in and out of court, according to a press
release issued by Government House of Thailand Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, though local commercial banks, private or state-owned,
witnessed a decrease in NPLs in July, bad loans of foreign banks'
branches and finance companies rose further.
</P>
<P>
As of August, about 680 billion baht (17 billion dollars) of
NPLs were restructured in Thailand, sending the total restructured
amount to 1.885 trillion (47.125 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
NPLs in Thailand are expected to dramatically decline to 700
billion baht (1.75 billion dollars) either at the end of this year
or early next year, according to an official of the Debt
Restructuring Committee.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts cautioned that the authorities seemed
too optimistic on the NPLs situation with the forecast that NPLs
should start to fall quickly in the fourth quarter of this year.
They noted that problems still exist as some restructured loans
may return to be NPLs again.

Protest Against Japanese Court Ruling
</P>
<P>
Chinese people from all walks of life and some friendly
Japanese protested recently in Harbin, capital of northeast China'
s Heilongjiang Province, over the ruling by a Tokyo District Court
on September 22 that the Japanese government is not responsible
for compensating 10 Chinese plaintiffs, victims and surviving
family members of Japanese atrocities during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Japan inflicted tremendous sufferings on the Chinese people
during the war, but the court did not acknowledge the right of
foreign individuals to seek compensation for war damages from
Japan.
</P>
<P>
The ruling is regarded as unjust and extremely absurd, as it
tramples on international law and has deeply hurt the feelings of
the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Reception in Honor of Overseas Chinese

<P>
Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan today reiterated that there is
only one China in the world, and Taiwan is a part of Chinese

on the eve of the 50th anniversary of the founding of the People'
s Republic of China on October 1.

opposes separation, adding that the compatriots across the Taiwan
Straits are born from the same ancestors, which separatist forces
cannot resist.

<HEADLINE> Lee Kuan Yew Predicts China Will Become Major World Player (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China could become one of
the major players of the world by the year 2050, Senior Minister
of Singapore Lee Kuan Yew said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee said in a speech at a luncheon reception of the Fortune
Global Forum that by the middle of next century, China's economy
would be about four-fifth that of the United States. "In 2050,
China's per capita income would reach 12,000 US dollars,
equivalent to the average Korean's before the Asian financial
crisis."
</P>
<P>
He said that by that time, China would have completed three
transitions -- from a planned to a market economy, from a mainly
agrarian to an industrialized society, and from a centralized to a
more participatory system of governance, although they are an
enormously complex set of tasks to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that given the size of the Chinese economy, by
year 2050 the Renminbi, China's official currency, is likely to be
a major international currency, floating freely against the other
three major currencies -- the US dollar, the euro and the yen, and
the world's trade and reserve holdings will be dominated by these
four currencies.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said that if the rule of law becomes firmly
established in China in the next two to three decades, by 2050
Shanghai could be a global financial center. With controls over
capital flow gradually dismantled, the domestic market opened, and
the Renminbi fully convertible, Shanghai could rise to the ranks
of New York and London.

<HEADLINE> China Holds National Day Reception for Overseas Chinese (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 3,000 overseas Chinese
and compatriots from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan gathered in the
Great Hall of the People in Beijing this evening to celebrate the
50th founding anniversary of the People's Republic of China (PRC).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the reception, Hu Jintao, PRC vice president,
welcomed the compatriots and extended earnest greetings and wishes
to the overseas Chinese and compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Hu said that led by the Communist Party of China (CPC), Chinese
people waged long-term revolutionary struggle to overturned
oppression by the "three big mountains" -- imperialism, feudalism
and bureaucrat capitalism, and founded new China 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Chinese people has become master of their own
country and society, and China, a country with 5,000-year old
civilization, marched into a new development era, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, China has enjoyed overwhelming changes
from poor to rich, from backward to prosperous, and has completed
an independent national economic system. The country's prestige is
rising worldwide with the achievements in socialist modernization
construction scored in the reform and opening-up over the past two
decades.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Durable-Goods Orders Increase in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Department
reported Wednesday that orders to U.S. factories for durable goods
in August rose 0.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted 206.9 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
August's increase of durable goods was led by a bigger demand
for airplanes, automobiles and other transportation equipment, the
Department said. It followed a revised 4 percent gain in July,
better than the previously estimated. July's performance marked
the biggest one-month gain since November 1997 when durable-goods
orders rose 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last month's performance, the 12th increase in the last 15
months, was better than many analysts had expected. They were
forecasting orders would fall by 0.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Orders for transportation equipment posted the biggest gain in
August, rising 4.6 percent to the highest level since May, when
orders rose 9.9 percent. This marked the fourth consecutive
increase. In July, orders for transportation equipment rose 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
The transportation sector is often volatile from month to month
because it includes such big-ticket purchases as airplanes. The
increase in transportation orders comes as the auto industry
expects a year of record sales in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The report said that orders for industrial machinery, including
computers and machine tools, dropped 2 percent in August,
following a hefty 10.5 percent gain in July.
</P>
<P>
Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment, which
includes everything from semiconductors, circuit boards and
telecommunications equipment to home appliances, posted a 0.1
percent decline, following a strong 7.1 percent gain in July.
</P>
<P>
If excluding transportation, overall orders for durable goods
would have fallen 0.2 percent in August, the fifth decrease in the
last eight months.
</P>
<P>
The overall economy, however, has continued to thrive, powered
by strong consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
One of the U.S. industries that has suffered the most from the
global turmoil has still been steel.
</P>
<P>
August's report said primary metals, the category that includes
steel, saw orders fall 1.7 percent in August, down for the first
time since March. In July, orders for primary metals jumped 2.9
percent.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of big-ticket durable goods, a good sign of current
demand, went up by 1.3 percent in August. This marked the 13th
increase in the last 15 months.

<P>
Foreseeing the 21st century, Hu noted that Chinese people are
confident and able to overcome all difficulties and build China
into a strong, prosperous, democratic and civilized country at its
100th founding anniversary.
</P>
<P>
The goal will be surely realized under the leadership of the
CPC Central Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core, with Deng
Xiaoping Theory as guideline, and with united efforts by Chinese
people at home and overseas, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, 1997
indicated a significant progress in the country's reunification.
The practice in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the
past two years proves that the policy of "One Country, Two Systems
" is correct and wise for keeping long term stability and
prosperity in the region.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that it is only about two months before Macao
returns to the motherland. With the example of Hong Kong's smooth
return, the participation of the Macao compatriots, and
cooperation between China and Portugal, Macao will surely realize
a smooth return, he said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Taiwan issue, Hu said a peaceful reunification
between both sides of the Taiwan Straits is the common desire of
the Chinese people both at home and overseas.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton last month sent a secret letter to Iranian
President M. Khatemi in which he held out the prospect of better
relations between the two countries if Iran helps U.S.
investigators find the culprits behind the 1996 bombing of a U.S.
military facility in Saudi Arabia, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>

linked to a group called the Islamic Movement.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- An opposition campaign to forge a coalition that would back
a single presidential candidate collapsed, greatly increasing the
chances that the Institutional Revolutionary Party, which has
controlled Mexico for seven decades, would retain power in next
year's election.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States is likely to regain a seat on the
important U.N. budget committee, clearing one hurdle that the

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Ready to Welcome China's National Day (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- It's easy to say that the
National Day is approaching while signs of celebrations are seen
almost everywhere across the two-year old Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) of China.
</P>
<P>
Buntings, posters and banners along streets, decorations on
walls of skyscrapers remind people the day is coming to mark the
50th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China
(PRC).
</P>
<P>
People from all walks of life have participated in various
activities organized by the government and communities for the
celebration throughout the whole region.
</P>
<P>
Among the activities are sports games, photo exhibitions,
drawing and calligraphy competitions, carnivals, songs and dances.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the preparatory work for the celebrations began two
months ago. On July 19, a preparatory committee for celebrating
the 50th anniversary of the founding of the PRC was launched at
the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Over 800 noted figures from 19 circles in Hong Kong were
invited to take part in the preparation of the event.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the SAR, and Jiang Enzhu,
director of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, are among the
honorary presidents of the preparatory committee.
</P>
<P>
The committee has a 120-member presidium composed of social
celebrities, as well as 15 advisors including Administrative
Secretary Anson Chan.
</P>
<P>
Various societies and overseas Chinese associations in Hong
Kong have also jointly set up a preparatory committee for

<HEADLINE> China Continues to Be Major Investment Destination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Despite this year's decline
in capital influx, China will continue to be a major destination
to foreign investment in the years to come, according to
participants in the '99 Fortune Global Forum.
</P>
<P>
The business elite are in the view that China is more and more
attractive to overseas investors because it has maintained
political stability and rapid economic growth for years and has
great market potential.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months this year, China approved 9,368
overseas-funded enterprises during the first seven months of this
year, with combined contractual overseas investment of 22.2
billion U.S. dollars and paid-in overseas capital of 21.4 billion
U.S. dollars, down 18 percent, 20 percent and 10 percent,
respectively, on a year-on-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment to China grew by almost 10 billion U.
S. dollars each year between 1991 and 1996, according to
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute this year's decline partly to the growing
transnational mergers and acquisition in developed countries,
which has led to the first drop in capital flow to developing
countries since 1985.
</P>
<P>
Another major factor is the adverse impact of the Asian
financial crisis which reduced the capital export of many Asian
countries and regions, China's major source of overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
However, participants in the forum have expressed confidence in
the Chinese economy and many said that they will make further
efforts to increase their presence in China.
</P>
<P>
There is no country but China that has both great growth
potential and huge market capacity, according to Richard Junior
Wagoner, president of General Motors.
</P>
<P>
There are many new areas in China yet to be tapped by overseas
investors, said Shigeji Ueshima, president and CEO of Mitsui &AMP; Co.,
Ltd., adding that his company is considering entering three new
sectors including distribution.
</P>
<P>
Many participants have noticed China's new preferential
policies to encourage foreign investors, saying that the move will
provide more opportunities to overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
These policies, announced earlier this month, include tax
breaks and lift of restrictions on overseas investment in 10
sectors including finance, insurance, telecommunications, foreign
trade and aviation.

<HEADLINE> Barak's Aide Says Israeli-Syrian Talks Will Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A top aide to Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak said Wednesday that he believes the
Israeli-Syrian talks could be resumed "in the coming weeks"
although Damascus has been toughening its stand on how they
should be restarted.
</P>
<P>
Danny Yatom, Barak's chief of staff, told Israel Radio that
despite its tough position, Syria understands it should not lose
the current "window of opportunity" in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Damascus will ultimately go back to the negotiating table with
Israel, probably with the help of the United States, Yatom said.
</P>
<P>
Since Barak took office two months ago with a pledge to revive
the Middle East peace process stalled in the last three years,
Syria and Israel have exchanged a string of messages through third
parties expressing interest in resuming their talks, which broke
off in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
But the two sides have yet to find a common formula for the
restarting of the talks.
</P>
<P>
Syria insists that the negotiations be restarted from where
they left off, saying former Israeli government of Yitzhak Rabin
had made a commitment to a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights,
a strategic plateau seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war,
in the previous talks.
</P>
<P>
Claiming readiness to make "painful concessions" on the Golan
for the sake of peace, Barak has been vague on how much Israel
will give up on the plateau.
</P>
<P>
His diplomatic aides including Yatom have said Israel is
willing to resume the talks from the point they broke off, but
with different interpretations.
</P>
<P>
Israeli minister in the prime minister's office Haim Ramon
Tuesday criticized Damascus for its tough stand, saying the stand
turns the desired outcome of negotiations into a precondition.
</P>
<P>
In the last few days, both Israel and Syria have intensified
diplomatic efforts to seek international support for their
positions.
</P>
<P>
Despite the remaining obstacles, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said Tuesday that Washington is optimistic that
the stalled Israeli-Syrian and Israeli-Lebanese talks can be
kick-started.
</P>
<P>
She has held separate talks with Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa in the
last few days in New York, on the sidelines of the annual United
Nations General Assembly session.
</P>
<P>
Israel feels the urgent need to restart the talks with Syria
also because of its desire to pull the Israeli troops out of an
occupation zone in southern Lebanon, where Syria is a main power
broker.
</P>
<P>
Barak has set a one-year timetable, or by July next year, to
"bring the boys" back from the 15-kilometer-deep border zone
Israel carved out in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its
northern border areas from guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Wednesday that army chief of staff Shaul
Mofaz is holding consultations with military officials on a
possible withdrawal from southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The radio said the Northern Command of the army has already
begun examining the possibility of both a withdrawal following a
peace agreement with Lebanon or a unilateral pullback without any
agreement.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese, International Entrepreneurs Flex Same Gene at Fortune Forum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Both Chinese and
international entrepreneurs attending the '99 Fortune Global Forum
today showed that they have the same gene no matter whether they
are good citizens in a fledging market economy or the richest
fellow working for others in the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a global perspectives session on "Entrepreneurship"
of the Forum, Chairman of China's New Hope Group Liu Yonghao said
that the forum provides a rare opportunity for Chinese
entrepreneurs to learn from the elite in the international
business circles.
</P>
<P>
He said that as a private business owner in China, he has to
rely on strategic farsightedness and a good mind to steer his
company to success in a market system that is yet to be perfected.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore I seize every opportunity to learn from the
experience and lessons of global companies by going to many
international business meetings such as the Fortune Global Forum,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Ted Turner, vice-chairman of Time Warner Inc., told an
enlivened audience at the session that he has become "the richest
person who ever worked for someone else" in the world since he had
his company taken up by Time.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the move was aimed to take in large amount of
capital to his company, he said that multinational companies
should invest their money in the most effective way. He said that
his annual donation of one billion U.S. dollars to the United
Nations is to "invest in the future of mankind."
</P>
<P>
Jerry Yang, co-founder of YAHOO!, also told the audience about
his experience in setting up the business at the session, saying
that the success of a company depends on its capability of opening
up new businesses before competitors do the same.
</P>
<P>
The forum sponsored by Fortune magazine of Time Warner Inc. has
attracted over 500 Chinese and international entrepreneurs to
participate, including heads of 60 of the Fortune top 500
companies in the world.
</P>
<P>
Sources with Time Warner said that the meeting has been
successful. Fortune Managing Editor John Huey said at today's
session that entrepreneurs around the world "have the same DNA"
wherever they come from.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Publish List of Non-Y2K-Ready Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
plans to publish by Thursday a list of firms and agencies that
have not disclosed their state of readiness for the millennium
bug, a senior official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Amable Aguiluz, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Year
2000 Compliance, said in an interview that these firms and
agencies will be deemed non-Y2K ready if they fail to make their
disclosure soon.
</P>
<P>
"If you don't disclose, you are deemed non-Y2K ready. As such,
you expose yourself to damage suits, while government offenders
face administrative charges as well," he said.
</P>
<P>
The millennium bug is a built-in flaw in some old computer
systems that prevents them from recognizing year 2000 from 1900.
Earlier, the government set September 30 as the deadline for the
Y2K compliance for all sectors nationwide.
</P>
<P>
However, Aguiluz said the Y2K Commission's list of firms which
have not disclosed their readiness for the millennium bug may
contain as many as 18,000 entries.
</P>
<P>
With less than three months prior to the start of the year
2000, the Philippine government will continue to work full-time in
making sure public services are sustained beyond December 31,
1999, he added.

<HEADLINE> Pro-Israeli Militiaman Killed in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A member of the pro-Israeli
South Lebanon Army (SLA) was killed and two others were wounded
Wednesday in south Lebanon, Lebanese security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The fatality occurred when the country's leading guerrilla
group Hezbollah launched attacks on the militia's outpost at Rshaf
inside the Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
A militiaman was also wounded during the attacks, the sources
said, adding another militiaman was injured in an earlier attack
on the same post.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes bombed a number of villages and wadies in
and around the zone to revenge for the casualties its SLA ally had
suffered in the day.
</P>
<P>
The fresh fatality raised to 18 the number of SLA members
killed in south Lebanon since the start of this year while 13
Israeli soldiers lost their lives.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 to protect its north from Lebanese guerrillas'
cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
oust Israeli troops and SLA out of the country.

<P>
Four other smugglers were injured in the operation which

According to ANF officials the raid was conducted on an

ANF team reached near the drug caravan, the smugglers opened fire
with sophisticated weapons including rocket propelled grenades and
machine guns.
</P>

The ANF men returned the fire resulting in the death of two
drug traffickers and injury of another four.

kilograms of heroin was recovered from the vehicle they left,
which was the biggest haul of heroin in the history of the
province, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
The officials said the contraband drug was smuggled into
Pakistan from Afghanistan for onward transshipment to some foreign
destination.

attend the talks."
</P>
<P>
Papapetrou is accompanying Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides to
New York where Clerides addressed the U.N. General Assembly and
held meetings with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the international community has been trying to
bring the two sides to the negotiation table for reunification
through a bicommunal settlement. But no tangible progress has
been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Denktash insists that he would not enter negotiations unless
his breakaway state in northern Cyprus, backed by Turkey, be
internationally recognized and talk with Nicosia on an equal
basis.

<HEADLINE> China's WTO Accession Important for U.S., China: Rubin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China's accession to the
World Trade Organization (WTO) is of enormous interests both for
the United States and China, former U.S. Secretary of Treasury
Robert Rubin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Noting that though the U.S. government failed to sign an
agreement with China on China's accession to the WTO last April,
he said, there is enormous recognition of the importance of China'
s accession to the WTO to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Speaking as a special guest speaker at the end of the '99
Fortune Global Forum here this afternoon, he said: "I also believe
that all our interests--promoting human rights, protecting
national security, and economic success--all of our interests are
best served by engagement with China, by a constructive
relationship with a strong and stable China."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Fortune Global Forum in Shanghai commands real
influence in China, the U.S. and around the world.
</P>
<P>
"And use of that influence to promote the common good is badly
needed in at least three key areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
"First, the well being of all of our nations--and the
furtherance of all of our interests--are advanced by a strong and
constructive relationship between the U.S. and China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Our two countries will have differences; there may be
occasional crises. But this group of influential participants
should do what it does not do now--at least in the United States--
which is to act on an on-going basis to support a calm, long-term
and sensible perspective in the political and public arenas with
respect to our relationship," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Second, the economic well being of each of our nations, even
the largest, will be ever more affected by the well being of other
economies around the world," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"Thus, it is in the interest of all of us that each of our
nations be on a sensible policy course, embracing change, opening
our trading markets, educating our people, maintaining sound
fiscal and monetary policies, and all the rest," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Third, those who lead private sector institutions--especially
financial institutions--should soberly take account of the lessons
of the past three years--and the whole history of markets and
economies--with respect to sound risk management," he said.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Fortune Global Forum closed here this afternoon.
It was attended by over 500 international and Chinese business
leaders, as well as some 300 government officials and celebrities
from the political and academic circles.

<HEADLINE> China Cracking Down On Illegal Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China's intensified efforts
to crack down on illegal contracts since the issue of the Contract
Law in March have contributed a great deal to maintaining a good
market order in the country.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce
said today that China handled more than 3,000 cases involving
illegal contracts in the first half of this year, an increase of
20 percent from the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The illegal contracts involved a total value of 1.8 billion
yuan, five percent less than the figure a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
An official with the administration noted that the Contract Law,
which is to take effect on October 1, provides practical legal
basis for the standardization of business activities. It is
expected to help private enterprises pay attention to the standard
ways of dealing with contracts, an important thing many of them
have long neglected.
</P>
<P>
About four billion contracts are clinched annually in China.
Last year, 1.5 million cases of economic disputes were handled,
most of which were related to contracts.

<HEADLINE> "Miandi" Says Farewell to Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The last batch of 3,000
little yellow taxicabs known as Miandi (bread-shaped) will soon be
eliminated from this Chinese capital by October 1, 1999, today's "
Beijing Daily" reports.
</P>
<P>
The "Miandi" has been quite popular among local citizens
because of its low cost and convenience since it first appeared at
the end of 1980s. In 1993, the number soared to 23,000.
</P>
<P>
However, its rapid increase caused controversy when Beijing
fell to be one of the top 10 cities that suffered worst atmosphere
pollution in the world.
</P>
<P>
Accounting for less than two percent of local automotive
vehicles, these mini-vans produced eight percent of the city's
total vehicle emissions, official tests showed.
</P>
<P>
Bad safety records is another reason for clearing the "Miandi"
out of the taxi fleet. Most of them have already logged more than
500,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, about 14,000 "Miandi" exit from taxi fleet in Beijing,
and another 6,000 retreated from the fleet in March this year.
</P>
<P>
"Miandi has become a part of the history of Beijing," the paper
says.

ISLAMABAD, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange
(KSE) index fell for the second day Wednesday due to rumour that
IMF tranche of 280 million U.S. dollars might be delayed because

for Washington to hold discussion with IMF and National Power, the
major share holder of Hubco, for the settlement of the tariff
dispute," said Shahid Rawjani, a dealer with Prudential Securities
Pvt. Ltd.
</P>
<P>
He said this news deployed buying interest who pinned their
hopes of an early solution of the Independent Power Producers
(IPPs) dispute especially of Hubco.
</P>
<P>
But following a rumour in the second half of the day that the
talks have remained inconclusive and that IMF would delay the
release of 280 million dollar loan tranche prompted the people to
start selling, Rawjani said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's general
insurance market remained soft in the first half of 1999,
according to the statistics released Wednesday by the Office of
the Commissioner of Insurance.
</P>
<P>
According to the quarterly statistical returns submitted by
insurers, gross premiums for the first half of 1999 amounted to 9
billion HK dollars (1,153 million U.S. dollars), representing a
decline of 7.7 percent as compared with the corresponding period
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The underwriting loss for the first half of 1999 was however
reduced to 71 million HK dollars (9.1 million U.S. dollars).

</P>
<P>
Comparing with the first half of 1998, a high growth rate of
42.6 percent was noted, which was largely attributable to the
upsurge in single premium policies of Linked business.

<P>
GAZA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Wednesday held the Israeli government responsible
for the delay in opening the southern safe corridor.
</P>
<P>
The passage which is scheduled to open on October 1 as
stipulated in the recently-inked Palestinian-Israeli peace
agreement, or the Sharm Al Sheikh Memorandum, will open to traffic
Sunday, two days behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released Wednesday, Jamil Al Toreifi, lawyer at
the Ministry of Civil Affairs, said that the Israeli side was
putting unacceptable conditions for the opening of the southern
safe corridor that links Gaza strip and Tarkumia, near the West
Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer said that the conditions would render the corridor
unsafe, underlining that the Palestinian side rejected any
harassment, detentions or humiliations by Israel to Palestinian
citizens using the corridor.
</P>
<P>
He also rejected that the Palestinians should go to the Israeli
liaison and coordination offices to obtain a permission card for
using the passage, stressing that the PNA was the sole
representative of the Palestinian people.

<P>
SHANGHAI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China's Minister of Science

steps to accelerate high-tech development and to help more Chinese
enterprises into the ranks of the world's leading 500
multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
In response to questions raised at a press conference at the '

preparing to build a venture capital system to support high-tech
development.
</P>
<P>
She said an incentive mechanism also needs to be in place to
ensure that scientists and engineers will benefit financially from
enterprises for their research and development achievements.
</P>
<P>
The minister also called on Chinese scientists not to engage in
academic research only, but to seek to increase their ability to
do research and put research results for market competition.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said to promote software development, China has cut down
the value-added tax on high-tech products from 17 percent to six
percent. China's software industry should target at the domestic

contribution made by the scientific and technological sector in
national economic growth by 10 percentage points in the next five
years.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Faces Challenge to Manage Recovery: DPM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Singapore faces the
immediate challenge to manage the economic recovery so that the
economy can be fully restored without mishap, Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lee said this at the inaugural Nation Manpower Summit attended
by employer organizations, chambers of commerce and trade unions
of the island state.
</P>
<P>
The three key issues Lee said Singapore needs to focus on are
manpower training and upgrading, implementing a more flexible wage
system and restoring CPF contribution rates.
</P>
<P>
He said that Singapore cannot compete on the basis of low costs
as the wage level in Singapore is already much higher than that in
many countries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Singapore has to compete on the basis of
capabilities and justify the higher wages by offering investors
that extra plus in terms of business environment and the quality
of workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
To do so requires restructuring and upgrading the economy to
attract investments in activities higher up in the value chain,
the deputy prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Lee called for a tripartite effort by the government, employees
and employers to achieve the goal of upgrading and retraining
Singaporeans continuously.
</P>
<P>
The next issue in managing economic recovery is putting in
place a more flexible wage system, he said.
</P>
<P>
There is a need to build up a monthly variable bonus and review
retrenchment benefits, he said.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government, employees and employers work
out a tripartite guideline on what should happen at the company,
industry or national level to trigger a cut on the monthly
variable bonus.
</P>
<P>
As for the third issue concerning the Central Provident Fund
(CPF) cut, Lee said the government will only make a final decision
this November when the third quarter economic figures are
available.

<HEADLINE> Sex Charges Against German Businessman Dropped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- German businessman Helmut
Hofer has finally been away from death sentence after an Iranian
court dropped the adultery charge against him at a trial Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Head of a Tehran public court, Yusef Musavi, said at the
closed-door trial that the adultery charge against Hofer which
carries death sentence in Iran was not proved.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that "Hofer's sentence is not death."
</P>
<P>
Hofer's lawyer said that only misdemeanor charges of improper
relationship remain against him. The trial has been adjourned and
a final verdict is expected within a week.
</P>
<P>
Hofer, 57, had been sentenced to death twice previously by two
different courts for having an affair with a 26-year-old Iranian
medical student.
</P>
<P>
Under Iranian law, sex outside marriage is punishable by
flogging; but if the man is not Muslim, he faces capital
punishment.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was initially sentenced to death in January 1998. Iran's
Justice Ministry ordered a retrial after Hofer insisted he had
converted to Islam before having sex with the woman.
</P>
<P>
He was again convicted and sentenced to death. But in February,
the Supreme court rejected the verdict and ordered a second
retrial.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was freed on bail in April, but arrested again in August
on charges of "links with foreign elements."

<HEADLINE> Eximbank Permitted to Support Export of Hi-Tech Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The China Export and Import
Bank (Eximbank) has been given green light to include new and hi-
tech products in its export credit and concessional loan
businesses, according to a spokesman for the bank.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that the Eximbank has decided to officially
start policy financial support to the export of new and hi-tech
products as of October 1, including export credit, concessional
loans, export credit insurance and foreign-oriented warranty.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1994 as one of China's three policy banks, the
Eximbank mainly offers financing support to the export of
machinery and electronics products, ships, complete set of
equipment and other products.
</P>
<P>
The export of new and hi-tech products has been playing an
increasingly important role in China's foreign trade in recent
years. In 1998 China's export of new and hi-tech products exceeded
15.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the Eximbank's key support will go to
products that are on the state's list of new and hi-tech products
for export.

<P>
Ericsson, the Swedish telecommunications giant, which has made
China its largest market since last year, revealed that from now
through the end of 2000, it will double its investment in China to
600 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Dutch/Shell Group also announced that it will not
only participate in the development of China's energy industry,
but also join in and support China's strategy of sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
Shell has just signed a contract valued at three billion U.S.
dollars on the development of a large gas field.
</P>
<P>
These strategic investment plans, all formulated after careful
consideration, fully demonstrate the powerful allure of the
Chinese market to transnational conglomerates. The latest survey
by Fortune Magazine on foreign investors in China shows that large-
scale and systematic investment by transnational companies that
began in 1993 will reach a new peak by 2006.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 200 of Fortune's top 500 companies have invested
in China. By the end of last year, China had actually used foreign
investment of 406.9 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Experts held that major causes of China's fascination to
foreign investors are political and social stability, steady
economic development, a profitable huge market, increasingly
important status in the global economy, and the constantly-
improving investment environment.
</P>
<P>
Forum participants said that the development process from small
pilot investments in the 1980s to the systematic investment in
recent years indicates that a stable China governed according to
laws has increased their investment confidence.

<P>
SHANGHAI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- As the Fortune Global Forum
wrapped up here today, global business leaders made it clear that
the world has high hopes for China's future, and the global
business circle will focus on this nation brimming with vitality
and hope.
</P>
<P>
The '99 Fortune Global Forum, the largest in history, has been
attended by representatives from 60 of Fortune Magazine's top 500
companies and hundreds of Chinese and overseas enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Themed "China: the Next 50 Years", the three-day forum hosted
wide-ranging discussions on topics on the minds of most investors,
including China's information industry, financial and enterprise
reforms and market potentials.
</P>
<P>
Praising China's great successes in the opening and reform
drive, the world's most famous entrepreneurs also stressed their
long-term obligations to China.
</P>
<P>
General Motors Corp. of the United States, which has been first
among the top 500 companies for three years in succession,
produced its 10,000th Buick sedan car in China on September 25 in
a joint venture with the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation.
The joint venture plans to produce 300,000 Buicks annually in
China by 2010.
</P>
<P>

Zeng Peiyan, minister in charge of the State Development
Planning Commission, told representatives that China is
formulating its 10th Five-Year Plan (2001-2005), which will focus
on the development of infrastructure and basic industries,
including water conservancy, energy, transport, telecommunications,
raw materials, environmental protection and high technologies.
</P>
<P>
As a result, China will be able to maintain fairly high
economic growth speed in the coming five to 10 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Taking environmental protection as an example, in the coming 10
years the output value of China's environmental protection
industry is expected to have an annual growth rate of 15 percent
to 20 percent; by 2010, the output value will reach 35 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, by 2010 China's power industry will increase its
installed capacity by 200 million kilowatts, its program-controled
telephones will have 200 million new lines, and investment in
infrastructure will amount to a trillion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
When talking about China's reforms of state-owned enterprises,
representatives held that the ongoing SOE reforms need large
amounts of capital, advanced technologies and management, and
cooperation between foreign investors and China in this area will
reap mutual benefits.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, China continues to offer
preferential policies for overseas investment, while guiding and
encouraging foreign investors to put their money in energy,
transportation and other key fields. Finance, insurance and other
service fields are also being gradually opened to overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
Vice Chairman of the Royal Dutch/Shell Group Maarten van den
Bergh described China's promises to reforms as "very clear and
very ambitious."
</P>
<P>
"I believe, in the coming 50 years, China will be more
prosperous on today's solid basis and will hold an even more
important position in global economy," he said.

Chairman and CEO of Nokia Corporation Jorma Ollila said, "We
are pleased to see China's legal system is improving. Cooperation
is set on mutual trust, and the experience of Chinese leaders in
managing the country over the past years makes us confident in our
China investment."
</P>
<P>
Over the past 20 years, China's annual average economic growth
reached 9.7 percent, with gross domestic product jumping to
seventh in the world and foreign trade volume rising to 11th. The
Chinese economy has become an indispensable part of the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
Justin Yifu Lin, a professor of the China Center for Economic
Research at Beijing University, said, "The share in the Chinese
market will decide whether a transnational conglomerate can edge
into the top 500 list or raise its ranking on the list in the next
century. China is the world's largest potential market, and is the
logical choice for conglomerates to maintain their status."
</P>
<P>
In the process of economic globalization, the steady growth of
the Chinese economy has contributed greatly to the prosperity and
development of the Asian and even the global economy. Contributing
editor of Fortune magazine Jim Rohwer said that China showed an
active attitude of responsibility in minimizing the adverse effect
of the Asian financial crisis over the past two years, and managed
to maintain a stable economic growth, convincing investors that
China is one of their ideal choices.
</P>
<P>
Global capital always flow to profitable places. With a 1.2-
billion-strong population, China has great market potential.
Surveys show that two thirds of foreign-funded firms in China are
making profits, while most of them believe that they will get rich
returns in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
Richard Wagoner said, "Seen from either the scale or growth
potential, China is a fascinating market. As a global competitor,
GM pays special attention to the Chinese and the whole Asian-
Pacific market. GM's cooperation with China is like a marriage,
the mutual input is not half to half, but 100 percent to 100
percent."

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Introduce 1.2 Million Mobile Phone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria plans to introduce 1.2
million mobile phone lines to the country in the next two years,
setting up a Global System for Mobile Communication or GSM network
covering major cities across the country.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Communications, Alhaji Elewi, on an
inspection of M-Tel company, the approved main GSM service
provider, in Abuja Tuesady, said government also plans to bring
down the price of cellular phones to between 25,000 and 30,000
naira (263 to 316 U.S. dollars), reported the Vanguard, a leading
Nigerian newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The current price for a cellular phone is around 170,000 (1,790
dollars) .
</P>
<P>
"I can assure you that it will be more or less at par with the
fixed lines," said the minister referring to the future price of
the cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
The minister said money would not be a problem in implementing
these projects. He blamed past military regimes for most of the
woes facing the telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
"Telephone lines, both fixed and mobile, are expensive in
Nigeria because we have not done enough. Our military interregnum
has affected the national plan generally, not only
telecommunications."
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Elewi cleared the air on the issue of licenses and
number of carriers, saying that no categorical statement would be
made until on-going work on new telecom policy was finalized.
</P>
<P>
"I have never, and will never say there will be only one or two
private operators," he said. According to him, "under the new
communications policy government is of the view that there should
be more national carriers to encourage expansion and to break the
monopoly of NITEL, and to make communications life more enjoyable
to the people at large.
</P>
<P>
*We are trying to correct the past errors. We are trying to
develop a new policy, in the best interest of the country," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Elewi added that contracts for the supply of payphone
cards to four companies were being looked into, while approval
had been given for massive importation of the cards to be
installed in various parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
In his address to M-Tel management, the minister said, "the
message I have brought here is the transparency of the present
administration. Along with transparency are other virtues like
honesty, efficiency, fiscal prudence and dedication to duty.

<HEADLINE> S. African Airways to Buy 49% Shares of Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has
decided to sell 49 percent shares of the Uganda Airlines
Corporation to South African Airways and the sales and management
contracts would be signed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's Divestiture Reform and Implementation Committee has
sanctioned the sale contract after 18 months of nerve-wracking
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, South African Airways will pump seven
million U.S. dollars into the venture to form Uganda Airlines
Limited, the Monitor daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The documents have been forwarded to the Attorney General's
office to ensure everything is legal and in tune with Uganda's
interest, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The newly-formed venture will be emblazoned with flags and
names of both Uganda and South Africa, and the flying crane, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni blew the whistle on the
privatization of the Uganda Airlines Corp. in March 1998,
attracting four bidders including British Airways, South African
Airways, Air Mauritius and Sabena.
</P>
<P>
However, other parties pulled out before the bids were opened
on April 23, 1999 and the South African company turned out to be
the winner.
</P>
<P>
While giving the new airline all the advantages of an
international airline network, and renewed capital, the purchase
deal saves the Ugandan government some 700,000 dollars in monthly
expenditure on the Uganda Airlines Corporation.
</P>
<P>
The South African Airways, reportedly the biggest airline in
Africa, has an annual turnover of 12 million dollars and has a
fleet of 60 aircraft.

ADDIS ABABA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is considering
to open embassy or a consulate in Beirut, Lebanon, in a bid to
ease the plight of Ethiopian girls residing and working there, the
Reporter newspaper said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of Ethiopian women, who are working in Lebanon
as housewives, are physically and sexually abused by their
employers and employment agents, said Tilahun Gizaw, head of the
Middle East section in the Ethiopian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Such reports have been on the rise since recently, Tilahun was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a problem with the Lebanese government," he
stressed. " Illegal employment agencies are squarely responsible
for this,"
</P>
<P>
According to the senior official, the Ethiopian Foreign
Ministry is discussing the issue with other government departments
concerned, including the Immigration Authority, the Women's
Affairs Bureau in the Prime Minister' s Office and judicial
organs.
</P>
<P>
Some 15,000 to 20,000 Ethiopians are estimated to be residing
in Lebanon at present. Most of them are young girls who are
staying there in search of work, and are usually employed as
housemaids.
</P>
<P>
Now Lebanon has no embassy in Addis Ababa.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen Says "No" to U.S. Pressure on KR Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister
Hun Sen emphasized Wednesday that any assistance to the Khmer
Rouge trial must be in respect to Cambodia's sovereignty and in
the framework of guarantee of peace and national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"We will never allow any outside pressure on Cambodian
sovereignty on Khmer Rouge (KR) trials," Hun Sen told reporters at
a teachers' graduation ceremony in Phnom Penh.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said that "we have the right to try former KR leaders
in our own country. It is a matter of peace and war and a matter
of life and death," adding that the United Nations has only three
options which he had already put forward in a memo to U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
"The answer for this moment is in which way the U.N. will
involve in the KR trial," said Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister was referring to a two-page note from the
U.S. State Department which asked Cambodian government to "work
hard to reach an agreement with the U.N." and "be more flexible"
in establishing a trial of former KR leaders.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. wants to see the establishment under Cambodian law of
a special court with a majority of U.N.-appointed judges. But the
Cambodian government has steadfastly defied this proposal, citing
national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The details of the note, presented Monday to Minister of
Council of Ministers Sok An by U.S. ambassador Kent Wiedemann,
were not available now.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia is capable to hold a trial by itself without financial
support from any country, Hun Sen stressed, adding "the best way
is that the U.N. should not involve and let Cambodia to proceed
the trial in the framework of its sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen warned that "if the U.N. does not recognize of what the
Cambodian court has done, it means that the U.N. only and always
recognizes the Khmer Rouge (as legal government)."
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen also said that the Cambodian government has never asked
any country to recognize the trial results. "It does not like the
general election last year," he said.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO Helps Restore 1,300-Year-Old Imperial Hall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO)
announced here today it has received funding necessary for the
restoration of a huge 1,300-year-old imperial hall in Xi'an,
northwest Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO's China office and China's State Administration of
Cultural Heritage endorsed the second phase of the rehab project
on Hanyuan Hall of the Daming Palace, with a donation worth 1.35
million U.S. dollars provided by the Japanese government through
the UNESCO/Japan Funds-In-Trust.
</P>
<P>
Emperors of the Tang Dynasty (618-907 A.D.) presided over
morning meetings and other important rituals in Hanyuan Hall,
built in 634.
</P>
<P>
However, numerous wars damaged or destroyed much of the
magnificent building in the Tang capital.
</P>
<P>
Before the first phase of the restoration project, which began
in 1995, the remaining section of the hall was only 200 meters
long, 100 meters wide and 15 meters high.
</P>
<P>
Japan also donated one million U.S. dollars to Shaanxi Province
for the first phase, which was completed early this year.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO official E. Moukala said that UNESCO's China office
organized a meeting between China, Japan and UNESCO, during which
all the three sides expressed their satisfaction with the first
phase of the work.
</P>
<P>
Two thirds of the total restoration on the hall will be
completed in the 18-month second-phase plan, which started in
August.

Chinese scholars to make contributions to national development.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chinese people who study abroad and return to
China to work will continue to get support from governments at all

to serve the country in various ways.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier made the remarks while meeting with 100
overseas Chinese scholars with Ph.D.s who are visiting China to
study the country's agricultural and high-tech development.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Chinese scientists can play a significant role in

<HEADLINE> Africa Urged to Pay More Attention to Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Africa will obtain
high-quality coffee if it pays more attention to research, the
Inter-African Coffee Organization has said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the organization, Josefa Sacko, said in
Luanda lately that only full investigation in breeds, production
and other issues can meet the exigence of the globalization of the
coffee production, which has exerted pressure upon the African
planters.
</P>
<P>
Sacko, an Angolan native, stressed the importance of
investigation in quality for the future development of the coffee
production in the continent, the Journal of Angola newspaper
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newly-elected African coffee boss said that she will make
efforts to improve the quality and the production of coffee
produced in Africa, harmonize the policies on coffee of African
countries and try to recover Angola's share in the international
market.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the preparation for rehabilitating the Robust coffee
in Angola's central province of Kwanza-sul is under way, which
will benefit her motherland, Sacko noted.
</P>
<P>
She also said that the position of the secretary-general of the
Inter- African Coffee Organization permits her to help overcome
some difficulties facing the African continent, the once important
coffee producer.
</P>
<P>
But the price of the Robust coffee produced in most southern
and west African countries is only half of that of the Arab coffee
produced in other regions.
</P>
<P>
The production of coffee in Angola suffered a lot from the
25-year civil conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The southern African country produced less than 10,000 tons of
coffee in 1998. It produced 225,000 tons in 1974, ranking fourth
in the world and second in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Iran Releases 276 Iraqi POWs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Wednesday released 276
Iraqi prisoner of war (POWs) unilaterally, the official Iranian
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
According to the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), the
decision to free the Iraqis was made on the occasion of 100th
birth anniversary of the late Iranian spiritual leader Imam
Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Brigadier Mohammad Balar, the spokesman and head of
the Public Relations and Publicity Department of POWs Commissions,
said the Iraqis will be released in the presence of a red cross
representative.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said "Iran, unlike Iraq, has freed many Iraqi POWs
unilaterally so far."
</P>
<P>
A total of 55,438 Iraqi POWs have been released by Iran,
including 6,078 unilaterally, while Iraq freed 39,417 Iranian POWs
since since 1981. There are still 2,806 Iranian POWs being kept in
Iraqi prisons, according to Iranian figures.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors fought an eight-year bloody war from 1980 to
1988, in which some 1 million people from both sides were killed.
</P>
<P>
The issue of POWs has become one of the major obstacles that
impeded improvement of relations between the two countries.

CAIRO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic

</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development

compared with 6.3 billion in 1997.

African Arab states fell from 3 billion dollars to 2.6 billion,
the Arabic newspaper Al Hayat reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The first conference on the treatment of solid wastes
in the Arab states that has just concluded in Alexandria calling
for learning successful experiences of other countries,
particularly the U.S., South Africa and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The conference invited private sector to participate in related

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Air Raids on Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Russian jets have flown about
30 missions against rebel positions in the breakaway republic
Chechnya over the past 24 hours, the Interfax news agency reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Two large depots of arms and ammunition sufficient to equip up
to 40,000 people -- the strength of four motorized infantry
divisions -- have been eliminated in the strikes, Interfax said,
quoting the headquarters of the federal forces in North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters also said that 10 unofficial mini-oil
refineries that belonged to Shamil Basayev and other Chechen rebel
commanders were destroyed in different parts of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In addition, federal front-line planes have mined 15 kilometers
of roads that may be used by the rebels in their possible
infiltration into neighboring republics. The rebels have launched
two waves of incursions into Daghestan since August, both repelled
later by federal troops.
</P>
<P>
The bombing raids will continue Wednesday on targets detected
earlier, the seventh consecutive day of an air campaign designed
to root out Islamic rebels in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin
said that he had commissioned Chairman of the Daghestani State
Council Magomedali Magomedov to hold a meeting with Chechen
President Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
The meeting between Magomedov and Maskhadov is scheduled to
start at around noon Wednesday in Khasavyurt, Interfax said,
quoting the press service of the Daghestani State Council.
</P>
<P>
As the air raids continue, more and more refugees were fleeing
Chechnya. According to Yuri Biragov, deputy head of the Russian
Federal Migration Service, nearly 32,000 people have fled to
neighboring regions.
</P>
<P>
Of those who were registered as refugees, 25,000 moved into
Ingushetia, 3,000 each into Stavropol territory and North Ossetia,
and about 1,000 into Daghestan, Biragov said Tuesday.

LONDON, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading British newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>

were holding Britain back. He told Labor that it was on course to
become the dominant political force of the next century.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair on Tuesday vowed to destroy vested interests in
government, public services and the professions, which he said
were stultifying the economy and holding back the development of a
meritocracy.
</P>
<P>
Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- British mothers are to be given new respect as part of the
Government's drive to improve family life. Tony Blair is to launch
a campaign next week that will stress that it is as valid for
mothers to stay at home and look after their children as it is for
women to go out to work.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- Tony Blair promised on Tuesday to abandon the caution shown
in his first two years in power by sweeping away the "forces of

<HEADLINE> Beijingers Look Forward to PRC 50th Anniversary </HEADLINE>

<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Last April, middle school
teacher Zhang Haitao was given a once-in-a-lifetime assignment:
organizing the students from Beijing's No. 177 Middle School for
China's National Day Parade on October 1.
</P>
<P>
Three months later, the 26-year-old man was diagnosed with
cancer.
</P>
<P>
"I was overjoyed when I got the assignment, for I have looked
forward to participating in the mass parade for the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China. It
is really a pity I can't attend the spectacular event because of
my illness," Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang is just one of the legions of Chinese who will enjoy the
excitement of the day from a distance.
</P>
<P>
Song Changqi, 44, is disabled and has spent years searching for
wheeled chairs and other conveyances to accommodate the
handicapped.
</P>
<P>
He won't be joining the group of wheeled chair-bound Chinese
who for the first time in history are participating in the
National Day parade. However, he'll be watching them with pride:
he designed a new type of wheeled chair especially for the grand
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In the past, Chinese wheeled chairs have not accommodated the
various needs of the handicapped and the use of imported wheeled
chairs is too costly.
</P>
<P>
With 300,000 yuan (about 36,000 U.S. dollars) and a group of
engineers, Song produced 30 lightweight, collapsible, adjustable
wheeled chairs in just 15 days.
</P>
<P>
"Though I myself will not be able to be in the parade, I feel
proud just the same to have the participants like me use the self-
developed new wheeled chairs," Song said.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen-year-old Zhou Yankun burst into tears when she got the
news that she would not be one of the youngsters piecing together
Chinese characters in the parade, because she is under the
required height of 155 cm.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Zhou attended each practice session, watching
enviously as her taller classmates formed the words.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government has announced that 67 key construction
projects will be finished by October 1 in honor of the day. Also,
numerous green patches have been cleared and hundreds of thousands
of flowers have been used to decorate the main avenues and squares.

<HEADLINE> HK Hotel Occupancy Levels Rise to 78 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's hotel occupancy
levels rose to 78 percent in the first eight months of this year,
according to the Hong Kong Hotel Associations (HKHA).
</P>
<P>
The average occupancy levels for all kinds of hotels in the
region have shown an encouraging improvement as Hong Kong sees a
recovery in visitor arrivals, said Ivan Lee, chairman of the HKHA,
at a media briefing Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The future now looks brighter for our industry than it did
this time last year," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
Lee attributed the rise in hotel occupancy to the improvement
in staff training, service standards and performance of food and
beverage business over the past years.
</P>
<P>
The occupancy levels at Hong Kong's hotels in the first eight
months last year were 73 percent.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that occupancies for the year as a whole could
return to 80 percent, up from 76 percent last year," he said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in occupancy levels is particularly positive given
that the room inventory in Hong Kong increased by about 10 percent
in 1999 to 37,000 rooms.
</P>

However, hotel rates have fallen on average by 20 percent since

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Raise Employers' CPF Rates: Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government
will raise the rate of the employers' contribution to the Central
Provident Fund (CPF) in the first half of next year, Deputy Prime
Minister Lee Hsien Loong said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural Nation Manpower Summit, Lee said
decisions on the quantum and timing CPF increasing for the next
year will only be made in November when the third quarter economic
figures are available.
</P>
<P>
Lee said that he does not expect a three percent points
increase, adding that "an increase of about two percent points
looks much more realistic," despite the forecast of four to five
percent growth from the Trade and Industry Ministry for this year.
</P>
<P>
But even if Singapore exceeded his forecast, it is still be
nowhere near the 10 to 12 percent achieved in 1987 and 1988, and
Singapore must continue to monitor costs, especially in the
electronics sector where restructuring is continuing, the deputy
Prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Singapore government announced a package of
wage-cutting plans, including the halving of employers' CPF
contributions by 10 percent, to reduce business costs in face of
the Asian economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading French Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Although the Russian authorities said that the bombing
campaign against Chechnya is aimed at protecting the Russian
population from terrorism, this new war could be a master move in
the strategy of the Kremlin to keep its power in anticipation of
the legislative elections in December and the presidential
election next year.
</P>
<P>
-- British Foreign Office has successfully established in the
new European Commission headed by the very pro-English Romano
Prodi. The reform of the European Commission -- which copied
French institutions when it was set up -- is masterminded by
former British Labor leader Neil Kinnock, who does not speak one
word of French and has refused to have one Frenchman in his team.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- In an exclusive interview with Le Figaro, the Russian
governor of Krasnoyarsk (Siberia) Alexander Lebed accused the clan
of President Boris Yeltsin of being involved in the series of
bombing attacks committed in the past few weeks across Russia. He
said that the president and his "family" are ready to do
everything to prevent the holding of the legislative and
presidential elections, which they are set to lose.
</P>
<P>
-- The Socialist government of France was embarrassed by a
directive of the European Union on work week. The directive said
that partial time work week is more attractive than the legally
fixed work week in all European countries, as the former is at
least one hour shorter. The government will have to consider
presenting a law on 34-hour partial time work week, after adopting
the 35-hour work week.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Bonny Community, Gas Company Sign Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Bonny community in
Rivers State and Nigerian Liquefied Natural Gas (NLNG) have
signed a peace agreement, bringing to an end a week-long crisis
which disrupted production of the 3.8 billion U.S. Dollars plant.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement signed at a meeting on Tuesday in capital
Abuja under the auspices of President Olusegun Obasanjo, both
sides resolved that they would endeavor to prevent any recurrence
of the unfortunate incident, according to a New Nigerian report
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was also agreed at the meeting that channels for
consultation and communication would be established between the
company and host community with the governor of Rivers State as
the chairman.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the Nigerian government is already
taking action to provide new employment generating activities
and other welfare projects that will ensure improved quality of
life in the oil and gas producing Niger-Delta region.
</P>
<P>
President Obasanjo last Sunday visited Bonny area where the
NLNG commissioned this month is located and held discussions with
traditional and community leaders, local government officials and
youths of the region.
</P>
<P>
The crisis erupted in the area early last week when the youths
in the area disrupted production at the NLNG in protest against
alleged failure of the company to implement measures contained in
an environmental impact assessment report which the NLNG had
accepted.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's first shipment of liquefied gas to buyers in Europe
is now scheduled to start off on October 15, which is original
scheduled for October 1.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Lebanon in a New Political Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's government and
opposition have recently launched a new cycle of war of words
against each other, plunging the civil war-stricken country into a
new political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
The storm was triggered by Post and Telecommunications
Minister Issam Naaman, a close ally of Prime Minister Salim Hoss,
who accused former premier and Hoss's long-time rival Rafik Hariri
of handing out financial aid to students in an attempt to secure
votes in next year's parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Hariri's foundation is reportedly paying 200 U.S. dollars for
each needy student in Beirut to meet their spiraling tuition
fees as the new scholastic year begins.
</P>
<P>
Pro-government deputies Najah Wakim, Zaher Khatib and Mustafa
Saad went to the extent of claiming that the money Hariri was
shelling out to students was "only a very small drop of the riches
he has stolen" when he was prime minister from 1992 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
The accusations quickly met with unprecedented counter-attacks
by Hariri's supporters, including his sister, parliament member
Bahia Hariri.
</P>
<P>
She took a direct jab at the current regime of President Emile
Lahoud and Hoss, saying "people cannot be governed by force or
arms or by telephone-tapping (apparatus), but by positive
construction, love and tolerance."
</P>
<P>
She was referring to Lahoud, a former army commander who has
been accused by the opposition, since his accession to power last
November, of trying to militarize the country by his security and
intelligence service agencies.
</P>
<P>
She then assaulted Hoss by saying that governing nations
requires the wisdom of statesmen, and half-men cannot possibly
succeed in shouldering power and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Her allegations were meant that Hoss, from the country's Sunni
Muslim community, was conferring his executive power granted by
the Taif Accord to Lahoud, from Christian community.
</P>
<P>
The Taif Accord, which brought Lebanon's 15-year civil war to
an end, vests executive powers in the premier and his council of
ministers, or cabinet, as a whole, virtually making the president
a figurehead.
</P>
<P>
According to Lebanon's Constitution, the country's presidents
always come from Christians, house speakers from Shiite Muslims
and prime ministers from Sunni Muslims and other top positions
are also shared among these three communities.
</P>
<P>
Critics claim that Hoss was making no effort to stop the
towering Lahoud from dwarfing the premier's stature. They also
said Deputy Prime Minister Michel Murr, also a Christian whose
daughter was married to Lahoud's son, was acting, in tandem with
the president, as if he was the real prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return from New York where he attended the annual
United Nations General Assembly, Hoss rushed to strike back by
issuing a statement in which he said "those standing behind this
unfair, misleading and biased campaign against the government are
known for their power lust."
</P>
<P>
"They will be unable to obscure realities even with their vast
media and money power," Hoss said in an obvious allusion to the
fabulous fortune Hariri made as a construction contractor in Saudi
Arabia, and the media empire he established during his six-year
reign as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Murr, on his part, denied that he was trespassing on anyone's
powers. In fact, he said, he was exercising only 50 percent of his
constitutional powers.
</P>
<P>
In order to ease the political tension, House Speaker Nabih
Berri, the country's another powerful figure and the Shiite
community leader, on Tuesday made two uncommon visits to Hoss and
Hariri in an alleged efforts to engineer a truce between the two
camps.
</P>
<P>
But observers believe that unless Syria comes out for
intervention, the storm on Lebanon's political spectrum would not
be easily terminated.
</P>
<P>
Syria, a undisputed power broker in Lebanon, maintains 350,000
troops in the country ostensibly as peacekeepers to prevent the
reignition of the civil war.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Basketball player Dennis
Rodman is being sued by a woman who claims Rodman sexually
assaulted her after he and a friend invited her to a hotel room,
reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The case is the second lawsuit against Rodman for alleged
actions late October 2 and early October 3 at The Argyle Hotel.
The earlier lawsuit is from a cocktail waitress who claimed Rodman
groped her at the Sunset Strip hotel.
</P>
<P>
According to the complaint filed Tuesday, the woman, Bridgette
Chaker, asked why there was no one else in the room for the "party
" to which she was invited. The lawsuit claims: "Rodman refused to
let the woman leave the room, blocking her exit to the door."
</P>
<P>
The complaint filed in Superior Court claims unspecified
monetary damages. It alleges assault, battery, intentional
infliction of emotional distress and false imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Los Angeles County District Attorney's spokeswoman Sandi
Gibbons said Tuesday that prosecutors were still investigating the
allegations made against Rodman, and have not yet decided whether
to file charges.
</P>
<P>
Rodman's lawyer, Michael Harrison, did not immediately return a
call seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> Deng Xiaoping's Soul Lives On Back In His Old Village (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
One Japanese journalist wrote that his relations with the
villagers were more than he could imagine. When Deng was in
distress, the villagers were in distress too. However, he has been
always seen as one of them. His old home, a compound in a grove of
bamboos has been maintained. In 1951, when his relatives who were
living in the 130-year-old house passed away, Deng allowed
neighbors who didn't have any place to live to move in. So, it was,
at one time or another, occupied by 14 different families. It has
also served as a public dining hall, warehouse, and kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the compound was turned into a museum and opened to
the public. There have been 5.8 million visitors, 40 percent of
them foreigners, to "Deng's Old Courtyard", as villagers call it.
Although none of these people ever met the legendary villager,
they never hesitate to tell childhood stories about Deng to the
visitors, whose numbers keep growing.
</P>
<P>
As a boy, Deng was cute, intelligent, playful, and kind-hearted,
they say. He could be found participating in all kinds of games,
but seemed to especially like digging for earthworms in the mud-
brick homes, pitting crickets against each other, capturing
dragonflies with a net, and stirring up ants.

Perhaps the most interesting about Deng is the one about him
stealing five Yinyuan (silver dollars) from his father, a huge
amount of money, enough to buy 250 kilograms of rice. This "crime"
was later discovered to be a charitable act to help one of his
classmates who was worried about the fate of his seriously ill
sister because the family didn't have enough money to send the
girl to a doctor.
</P>
<P>
When Deng was in power, he never used his position to help his
relatives. Once, an uncle asked him to get government assistance
for the family. The uncle received some money, but it was from
Deng's own pocket.
</P>
<P>
Deng died on February 19, 1997.

<P>
ANKARA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A total of 13 rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) were killed in recent

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Members Agree to Extend Scope of AIA Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The ASEAN Investment Area
(AIA) Council has agreed to extend the scope of the AIA Agreement
to cover services incidental to manufacturing, agriculture,
forestry, fisheries and mining.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister of Trade and Industry George Yeo briefed on
this recommendation at a press conference Wednesday after the 2nd
AIA Council Meeting this morning.
</P>
<P>
Yeo, who chaired the council meeting, said this enhancement
was done in view of the increasing importance of the services
content in these sectors and meant ASEAN has begun the process of
opening up its closed or restricted industries and sectors for
investment.
</P>
<P>
According to Yeo, the council has tasked the Coordinating
Committee on Investment to work out details of the implementation
of these recommendations as soon as possible to capitalize on the
upswing in the regional economies, and members countries are
targeting to finalize their negotiations on services incidental to
the five sectors by march 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
Yeo said all participants reaffirmed their countries'
commitment to opening up industries and granting national
treatment to all ASEAN investors immediately.
</P>
<P>
A 1999-2003 Work program has been developed to support the
implementation of the AIA Agreement and the Hanoi Plan of Action
adopted by the ASEAN Summit held in Hanoi last December, Yeo
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Aotegen and Zengezabu from
northwestern China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region won the gold
and silver medals of horse racing competition's final event of 10,
000 meters speed race at China's on-going National Games for
Traditional Sports of Minority Nationalities here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The gold medal for the 3,000m speed event went to Pubociren, a
racer from southwestern China's Tibet autonomous Region, which
brought his delegation's gold medal tally to four, at the Games.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with their racers triumphant
at the 10,000m speed races at the five previous National Games,
fielded four teenager Kazak racers at the Beijing Games, including
Biekedaolieti, the youngest at the age of nine.
</P>
<P>
Experienced Aotegen came from behind in the 10,00m race's later
stage to take the lead from Biekedaolieti for the victory.
</P>
<P>
Inner Mongolia's Zenggezhabu won the silver and Biekedaolieti's
teammate Bierikebole took the bronze.
</P>
<P>
"I could have won the race if my horse had not foiled my
efforts," said a disappointed Biekedaolieti.
</P>
<P>
In Tuesday's "Hada picking-up" competitions, Habateer of Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region won the gold and Tudenggesang and
Zhaxitajie from Tibet Autonomous Region took the silver and bronze
medals.
</P>
<P>
Racers from Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Tibet Autonomous
Region and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region shared all the 11 gold
on offer. Experts attribute their victory in the horse racing
competitions at the National Games to their long history of animal
husbandry. The harsh profession on horseback makes racing skills
a necessity for the herdsmen in the regions.

HELSINKI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Wednesday
welcomed the statement made by the Democratic People's Republic of
Korea to freeze missile tests during its talks with the United

<HEADLINE> World's Largest Tiger Breeding Base In China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- It took Guilin's 500,000-sq.m.
Xiongsen Bear and Tiger Village only 5 years to increase its
number of tigers from 32 to 171 to become the world's largest
tiger breeding base.
</P>
<P>
The park, in the suburbs of the picturesque city of Guilin in
south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, now has Siberian,
South China, Bengal, and White tigers. At the present rate of
breeding, the number of tigers is expected to reach 500 by the
year 2000 and 1,000 by 2003, according the International Wildlife
Conservation Association.
</P>
<P>
But, it warns that the world's tiger population has dropped
from 100,000 at the turn of the century to around 6,000 because of
shrinking natural habitats and poaching, putting the animal on the
verge of extinction.
</P>
<P>
To ensure its existence, more than 150 nature reserves have
been set up and 280 zoos and breeding centers around the world are
using modern technology to help tigers reproduce. China began
putting 400 million yuan into improving conditions at the breeding
center in 1993. But getting tigers to breed is a very complicated
task, according to Guo Honglin, who works in the village. He
explains that the tiger has a low reproduction rate and a life
span of 15 to 20 years. The breeding span of a female tiger lasts
only about six years.
</P>
<P>
However, better wildlife care and immunity from disease as well
as animal surgery have increased the reproduction rate to over 95
percent and prolonged the breeding period of female tigers to 12.5
years. Tigers in the park even give birth to triplets or
quadruplets. The center has tried using Caesarean section on
tigers and gave the first blood transfusion to a tiger suffering
from anemia.
</P>
<P>
To avoid inbreeding, it has set up a DNA Data Bank for 40 tiger
families, the largest so far in the world, and has imported more
than a dozen tigers from the U.S., Australia, Italy, and
Bangladesh to expand the gene pool.
</P>
<P>
Its newest project is training tigers to return to the wild,
according to Zhou Weisen, the center's director, and helping them
adapt to natural living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Man has brought the number of Siberian tigers down to 30 and
South China tigers down to less than 40 in the wild, says Meng
Xianlin, the director of the China Endangered Species Import and
Export Management Office.

TOKYO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices closed lower in
Tokyo Wednesday due to profit-taking following a sharp gain on the

The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First

The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 11.18 points, or 0.76 percent, to 1,

</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section went up to 373.49 million shares
from 350.52 million shares Tuesday, but trading remained sluggish,

<HEADLINE> Diseases Curb SADC's Livestock Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Prevalence of animal diseases
has affected the development of the livestock sector in the
Southern African Development Community (SADC), according to head
of the SADC livestock sector, Musa Finikiso.
</P>
<P>
Diseases such as foot and month, contagious bovine pleura
pneumonia (CBPP) and rinder pest have posed a great challenge to
the region, the Times of Zambia newspaper Wednesday quoted
Finikiso as saying.
</P>
<P>
The SADC official disclosed that because of the state of the
livestock industry in the region, the European Union (EU) is still
reluctant to import livestock products from the region.
</P>
<P>
The reluctance by the EU to import from the SADC has greatly
affected trade between the two groupings, Finikiso said.
</P>
<P>
He said the SADC is currently engaged in the development of a
program to be funded by the EU to find means and ways of
eradicating animal diseases in the region.
</P>
<P>
With a combined livestock population of 44 million cattle, 46
million sheep, 30 million goats and about four million pigs, the
14-member SADC has more livestock than any other African region.
</P>
<P>
The combined livestock strength, if fully realized, has the
potential to transform the region into one of Africa's largest
producer and exporter of animal products.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Imam Working For National Unity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- An expansion project at the
Hairu Middle School for Girls was recently completed in northwest
China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and Hong Weizong, the imam
who set the school up, says he will make it a cradle of the unity
of the ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The 59-year-old Hong is the third generation of his family to
become an imam and says that they had one thing in common: a
devotion to the unity of all ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
When his grandfather was imam, he hid two Communist soldiers in
a secret place for seven days to protect them from warlords. For
seven days, Hong and his wife brought food and water three times a
day to the Red Army soldiers. Later, the Red Army sent Hong's
family a silk banner in recognition of their role in promoting
national unity.
</P>
<P>
Hong's father became an imam after the founding of the Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region in 1958 and donated 80 of his family's rooms
to a local school for use as classrooms.
</P>
<P>
Hong Weizong has carried on the family tradition as a religious
leader. When villagers of the ethnic Hui group quarrel with Han
villagers, Hong tries his best to persuade them to turn hostility
into friendship.
</P>
<P>
When the Hairu girls school was founded, Hong demanded that
ethnic Hui pupils and Han pupils be treated equally and, when he
heard two Han girls were in financial difficulty, he offered to
pay their tuition himself.

<HEADLINE> Caribbean Countries Fear Zambia's Sugar Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Some Caribbean countries are
campaigning to block Zambia's sugar export to the European Union
(EU), the Times of Zambia newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
They are fearing that Zambia will swallow their quota
allocation of sugar exports because of its stronger export
capacity for the commodity, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
The island countries feel that if Zambia is given a chance to
export it will do better than them, Zambian Deputy Commerce, Trade
and Industry Minister Norman Chibamba said in Lusaka Tuesday. He
did not name these countries.
</P>
<P>
Zambia exports 12,500 tons of sugar to the EU currently under
the special preferential sugar arrangement, the deputy minister
said, adding that his country is hopeful it will soon be allocated
a quota.
</P>
<P>
Chibamba noted that some countries have quotas for exporting
sugar to the EU but have no capacity to do so.
</P>
<P>
They have resorted to buying sugar from the international
market and then sell the commodity to the EU, he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Sugar prices are very high on the EU markets, so those people
with the quotas fell that if we are given a chance, we would do
better and we can eventually win their quotas. What is happening
now is that we are experiencing some kind of war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chibamba added that his country's performance has pleased the
EU which is looking forward to its exports.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that we are equal partners who should benefit from
the sugar protocol and should fully participate," the deputy
minister stressed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua)-- China is setting up a high-
quality transportation network, with the construction of the
nation's transport infrastructure expanding steadily over the past
50 years.
</P>
<P>
 China's double-track railway stretched more than 19,000 km in
1998, an increase over 867 km in 1949, which accounted for 34.2
percent of the railways in operation, up from 4 percent 50 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
 The length of electric rail took up 22.5 percent of the total
in 1998, an increase of 20.4 percentage points over 1978.
</P>
<P>
 In 1949 among the total 80,800 km of highway, only 40 percent
was asphalted or covered with cement; the current figure is 93
percent.
</P>
<P>
 China's expressway system has boomed since the late 1980s,

<HEADLINE> Restoring 3,000-Year-Old Imperial Chinese City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 29 (Xinhua) -- China is protecting palace
relics that date back to the Shang Dynasty (1600 B.C.-- 1100 B.C.)
in the city of Yanshi in Henan Province and is planning a relics
park.
</P>
<P>
Restoration of the 50,000-square-meter palace started in the
early 1980s. A stone drainage system and the earliest royal garden
with a pond and a pavilion were discovered at that time.
</P>
<P>
The Shang Dynasty is known for its oracle bone and tortoise
shell inscriptions, which are considered to be the earliest form
of writing in the world. They were discovered at Anyang in Henan.
</P>
<P>
It has long been the wish of the people here to use modern
technology to make the 3,000-year-old palace available to the
public to give them a better understanding of ancient capitals,
according to Du Jinpeng, of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Workers are now clearing up around the palace and removing
modern buildings from the site. The restoration work is expected
to be completed next year.

<HEADLINE> Deng Xiaoping's Soul Lives On Back In His Old Village (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The village of Paifang in
Sichuan Province, where Deng Xiaoping, the architect of China's
reforms and opening-up, was born in 1904, has always been
politically linked with him, although he never returned after
leaving it in 1919.
</P>
<P>
The small mountain village has changed its name three times
because of links with Deng and his family. Paifang, which means
gateway, is a wooden or stone gate-like structure in a village or
town, which used to be built as a result of a decree from an
emperor as a reward for extreme loyalty in an official, or
chastity in a woman, or for filial piety or reputable moral
conduct.
</P>
<P>
Deng Shimin, Deng Xiaoping's great-great-grandfather, made a
notable contribution to the state and was rewarded with a Paifang
by the Qianlong emperor of the Qing Dynasty in the late 1700s. The
village's name then became Paifang.
</P>
<P>
In 1958, the village changed its name to "Weida Dadui" (Great
Brigade) during the Great Leap Forward, a time of disaster and in
1962, the village regained its old name when Deng, then General
Secretary of the Communist Party, together with President Liu
Shaoqi, started changing the nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
But, its name again changed during the Great Cultural
Revolution (1966-1976), when it became "Fanxiu" (Anti-Revisionist)
Village, turning against Deng, who had been accused of being the
No.2 revisionist, after Liu Shaoqi, and brought down. Many of Deng
's relatives in the village were criticized and bullied by Red
Guards during that catastrophic campaign.
</P>
<P>
Then, the old village name returned in 1978, when Deng returned
to the political limelight and began the reform and opening-up
drive.
</P>
<P>
Villagers here say they have never actually received any direct
benefits from their connection to the great leader: neither cash
nor food. But in the past two decades, they have benefited from
his reform and opening-up policies, just like the rest of the
Chinese, according to Li Xiaofeng, a retired local official.

<HEADLINE> Investments in Middle East Lag Behind: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investments in
Western Asia are lagging behind most countries of the world, the
Daily Star Wednesday quoted a United Nations report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 World Investment Report, released by the Beirut-based
U.N. Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), said
foreign direct investment in the Arab states and Turkey in 1998
stood at 4.5 billion U.S. dollars, representing only 0.7 percent
of the world total.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in the Middle East was much lower than in
South Korea and Malaysia, each of which drew more than 25 billion
dollars. China received 45 billion dollars and 29 billion dollars
went to Brazil, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies invested 2.4 billion dollars in Saudi
Arabia, representing 52.4 percent of all investments in the Arab
states. Most of these investments went to oil-related products.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments in Lebanon stood at 230 million dollars in
1998 compared with 64 million dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies and individuals have more than 500 million
dollars in fixed assets in Lebanon, mostly held in properties.
Most foreign investments in Lebanon went into real estate
development such as hotels and tourist projects.
</P>
<P>
Zaki Fattah, chief economist at ESCWA, said that Arab
countries must improve their image by passing new investment
laws, providing a proper investment climate, building
infrastructure, improving transparency, combating administrative
corruption and training the local labor force.

<HEADLINE> Lifetime Record Of 108-Year Old Chinese Man </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Hou Youcheng, a 108-year-old
man from Xiaoyi City in China's Shanxi Province, has been keeping
a diary for most of his life.
</P>
<P>
Hou is now permanently hospitalized and has to be kept on
oxygen, but his last diary entry on January 31 said, "My life as a
teacher has allowed me to witness the great changes in our country
in education since the founding of New China in 1949."
</P>
<P>
Hou was born in 1892 (in the late Qing Dynasty) and went to a
private school for five years when he was young. He later set up a
primary school to teach Chinese culture during the anti-Japanese
war (1937-1945). "Japanese troops occupied the city last year," he
wrote angrily in his diary on January 15, 1938, "all the primary
schools have been closed and children are not allowed to learn
their own mother tongue and folk culture. Why can't we Chinese do
what we want to on our own land?"
</P>
<P>
On October 3, 1947, he showed his great joy that the city had
got rid of the Japanese invaders and he was able to resume his
teaching with the support of the Chinese Communist Party. He
returned to primary school after the founding of the New China in
1949.
</P>
<P>
Even at the age of 90 he set up a primary school with several
dozen other retired teachers. Hou Zhaoxiong, Hou's second son,
says that his father devoted his whole life to the nation's
education cause.
</P>
<P>
On his 105th birthday Hou wrote, "I will spare no effort in
spreading knowledge in China and I will not only set up a primary
school, but also middle schools, and even colleges in order to
train people for the motherland." When he heard about Hong Kong's
return to the motherland in 1997, he sent a telegraph to Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa to express his great happiness and said
that he was excited to hear the news.
</P>
<P>
His children say that he kept on recording his daily life
until he could no longer pick up a pen. If his diaries were
stacked one on top of the other the pile would be taller than Hou
himself.

<HEADLINE> Dutch Suspends New Development Aid To Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Netherlands Parliament has
 suspended new development aid to Zimbabwe in a move which has
surprised the Dutch government, a Zimbabwean newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch government had not expected aid to Zimbabwe to be
suspended since some of the contentious issues and misconceptions
had been cleared, the Herald daily quoted Dutch Ambassador to
Zimbabwe Beatrix Ambags as saying in Harare Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands has been providing about 15 million U.S.
dollars to Zimbabwe annually for development programs in the
southern African country over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
However, the Dutch parliament cited poor macro-economic
performance and alleged lack of good governance as reasons for
withholding aid to Zimbabwe, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The parliament has also come up with a new list of criteria for
 selecting countries for assistance under its structural bilateral
 development cooperation, it added.
</P>
<P>
There was a growing consensus in the Netherlands that the
effectiveness of aid was closely tied to the policy environment of
recipient countries.
</P>
<P>
The new policy changes require that Dutch assistance of a
structural and long-term nature would be concentrated on limited
number of countries, according to the Herald.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said a list of 20 countries was sent to the
Dutch parliament for consideration, but the legislature agreed to
"slim" the number of countries.
</P>
<P>
"After that it came down to 17 countries and Zimbabwe
disappeared from the list. It was against the will of the Dutch
government, but it was parliament that took the decision," she
said.
</P>
<P>
The envoy expressed hope that the situation could be reviewed
and Zimbabwe could be back on the list of development aid
recipients if the situation in the country changes.
</P>
<P>
"At the time of selection, there were some problems in this
country. There was confusion about the land reform program, the
involvement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
socio-economic stagnation and the treatment of journalists," she
added.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Implement AIDS Program in Schools </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government will
soon implement a HIV/AIDS program in all primary and secondary
schools across the country with two million people infected with
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Joseph Mungai, Chairman of the Kenyan National AIDS Committee,
said in capital Nairobi Tuesday that information on the killer
disease will be posted in every classroom to ensure that pupils
are informed about AIDS from an early age.
</P>
<P>
The program, approved by the Office of the President and the
ministries of health and education, will be implemented by the
National AIDS/STD Control Program, the Daily Nation newspaper
Wednesday quoted Mungai as saying.
</P>
<P>
The chairman noted that the move is aimed at attempting to
check the alarming spread of the pandemic.
</P>
<P>
"Although it is expensive to reach out the target, we have no
choice since most of the new infections are affecting those below
19 years," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
In Kenya, there are 700,000 secondary students, 6.6 million
primary pupils and about three million pre-primary children.
</P>
<P>
Mungai also called on head teachers, youth groups and opinion
leaders to play a major role in the dissemination of information.
</P>
<P>
Since the first AIDS case was found in Kenya in 1984, about
700,00 Kenyans have died of the killer disease.
</P>
<P>
Out of the two million Kenyans infected with AIDS, 100,000 are
children below five years.

<HEADLINE> Zambians' Life Expectancy Drops to 37 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Life expectancy in Zambia has
dropped to 37 years from 49 in 1992, according to a report
published by the Zambian government and the United Nations
International Children's Fund (UNICEF).
</P>
<P>
The mid-term review showed that Zambia's ranking among other
nations in life expectancy, access to education, and economic
growth has steadily deteriorated over the past three decades, the
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The government/UNICEF report said that the rapid move to a
liberalized and open economy may have been too fast, reducing
family or community abilities to cope with the adverse effects of
retrenchments and privatization.
</P>
<P>
"The opportunity costs are enormous: poverty results in social
strain, insecurity, reduced prospects for economic growth; debt
absorbs resources otherwise available for health, education and
other basic social services," it noted.
</P>
<P>
With the increased morbidity and mortality, HIV/AIDS places
additional demands on the provision of social services, while
undermining the ability to provide these services, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
"For example, the annual number of teachers dying per year is
greater than the number of graduates from teacher training
colleges," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.N. Development Program's 1999 Human
Development Report also showed that of the 79 countries for which
data are available between 1975 and 1997, Zambia is the only one
where the value of the Human Development Index is lower than it
was in 1975.

</P>
<P>
In a written statement sent to Xinhua Tuesday night, Demirel

preventing the spread of financial and economic crisis that hit
southeastern Asia in 1997, showing that as a world state, China is
taking responsibility in all aspects.
</P>

exist between the peoples of Turkey and China, saying the two
countries have made satisfactory results in developing bilateral

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minorities Delegation Attending National Day Celebrations Formed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- A delegation of Chinese
ethnic minority groups to attend the National Day celebrations was
formed here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The delegation comprises 423 people representing model groups
or individuals attending an ongoing conference held by the State
Council here to award their contributions to the development of
Chinese ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The delegation will attend the National Day gala celebrations
on Friday and other events over the weekend. They are also
expected to visit some rural villages and enterprises in and
around Beijing and hear a report on Beijing's economic and social
development.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 honorary representatives from the Hong Kong SAR
and specially-invited representatives from Macao and Taiwan
attending the conference will also join the delegation.
</P>
<P>
An official with the State Ethnic Affairs Commission said that
the members of the delegation represent all 56 ethnic groups and
are from all provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, the
Central Committee of the Party, departments of the State Council,
democratic parties, business associations, people's organizations,
the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's
Armed Police.
</P>
<P>
"Though these model representatives are from different
industries, they have made outstanding contributions to the unity
and progress of the nation's ethnic groups on their own posts,"
said Jiang Jiafu, head of the delegation and vice-minister of the
State Ethnic Affairs Commission at a gathering here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped that all members of the delegation will take
the opportunity to broaden their vision and spread brotherly
feelings among all ethnic groups, so as to contribute still more
to the unity and progress of the Chinese nation.

<HEADLINE> More Is Being Learned About Mysterious Ancient Kingdom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Studies on the Western Xia
Dynasty (1038-1227) have increased knowledge of the mysterious
kingdom over the past 50 years.
</P>
<P>
The dynasty was set up mainly by the nomadic Dangxiang ethnic
group and once ruled an area that included today's Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, Gansu Province, parts of Shaanxi and Qinghai
provinces, and the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region. Mongolian
invaders destroyed almost all records of the Western Xia after
they conquered it and there are few records of the kingdom known
to exist. Even the comprehensive "Twenty-four Histories" tells
little about it.
</P>
<P>
The first compilation on the dynasty was completed by Li Fanwen
in 1997 and the number of treatises and reports on it has grown to
nearly 500 over the past decade, according to Wang Tianshun,
director of the Western Xia Dynasty Research Institute of Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists have discovered nearly 1,000 sites belonging to
the dynasty and the finds have shown that the dynasty printed 95
Buddhist classics in Chinese and the Western Xia language, some
820 Buddhist texts in Chinese, and some 70 texts in Tibetan.
</P>
<P>
Studies of the dynasty in the past 50 years encompass politics,
economy, military affairs, culture, religion, customs, and
philology.
</P>
<P>
There are now special research institutes devoted to the study
of the Western Xia in China, Russia, Japan, and several other
countries.

delayed past its scheduled date of Sunday, Internal Security
Minister Shlomo Ben-Ami told the Jerusalem Post Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>

the Palestinians seeking to use the route.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. believes that the stalled Israeli-Syrian and
Israeli-Lebanese peace talks can be kick-started despite remaining
obstacles, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Tuesday.
</P>

with unusual trust and respect."
</P>
<P>

-- The communities near the Israeli-Lebanese border have been
ordered to prepare plans listing their security requirements

Kinneret come under its control after a future Israeli troop

the lake.
</P>
<P>
Senior Israeli sources said the hard-line demand meant that the
Israeli-Syrian talks were deadlocked.

<HEADLINE> Wild Herb and Coarse Grains Returning To Chinese Tables </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, September 29 (Xinhua)-- A current Chinese joke goes
like this: the grandfather tells his grandson, "In the old days,
we ate wild herb and coarse food grains every day," and the
grandson replies, "Wow, you must have been rich at the time."
</P>
<P>
Wild herb and coarse grains were the main foodstuff for Chinese
during hard times, in the past, but with the improved standard of
living they gradually began to disappear from the dining table.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, people have become interested in them
and believe that they contain more nutritious elements. In
restaurants even, some dishes made of wild herb and coarse grains
are more expensive than other common dishes.
</P>
<P>
In the past, people were too poor to afford rice and flour for
daily meals and had to depend on the wild herb and coarse grains,
but now they can buy any kind of food they like and are getting
fed up with having too much refined food.
</P>
<P>
In Lanzhou, capital of Gansu Province, street vendors sell
steamed corn on the cob, baked potatoes, sweet potatoes, and
millet gruel, which are favorite snacks of adults as well as
children. In Tianzhu County not far from Lanzhou, peddlers sell
wild herb and coarse food grains instead of tourist souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
People are also buying these items to cook at home. One local
observer says that in the hard life of the past, people ate wild
herb and coarse food grains just to avoid starving to death, but
today they want to taste something fresh and are paying greater
attention to nutrition in the improved society.
</P>
<P>
This change in people's taste has also given farmers an idea
and some have been adjusting their farming methods and have been
cultivating coarse grains to meet the market need. In many parts
of China, coarse grains have become a new business and are thought
to be a good way for farmers in underdeveloped areas to get out of
poverty.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Lure Foreign Investment at Fund Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka is striving to
bring back foreign investment into its cash-starved stock market
through a conference of institutional fund managers in Colombo
next week.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Colombo Stock Exchange told Xinhua
Wednesday that the conference organized by the exchange will be
held here on October 4 and 5 with the participation of 26 foreign
fund managers from 10 countries including Australia, China's Hong
Kong, India and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
He said the meeting would help fund managers learn more about
Sri Lanka's economic, market and corporate conditions.
</P>
<P>
The foreign fund managers will be hosted by Sri Lankan
President and Minister of Finance Chandrika Kumaratunga during the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Colombo stock market has relied heavily on foreign fund's
trading. It lost more than 40 percent of its value between May and
September 1998 after neighboring India and Pakistan conducted
tit-for-tat nuclear tests which forced foreign fund managers to
withdraw from South Asia including Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
About 10 local companies will make presentations at the meeting
on diversified holdings, construction and engineering,
manufacturing, telecommunications, insurance, banks and finance.
</P>
<P>
Presentations will also be made by Dr. A.S. Jayawardena,
governor of the Central Bank, P.B. Jayasundera, chairman of the
Public Enterprises Commission, Dr. Saman Kelegama, executive
director of the Institute of Policy Studies, and Thilan
Wijesinghe, chairman of the Board of Investment.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A great deal of
humanitarian work needs to be done in East Timor as the security
situation continues to improve there due to the presence of the U.
N.-authorized multinational force (MNF), said a U.N. official
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Jamsheed Marker, personal representative of U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan, made the statement at the end of a one-hour
tripartite meeting among Indonesia, Portugal and the U.N., chaired
by Annan in New York.
</P>
<P>
Marker said the current priority is to get central services and
civil society restarted in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
The issue of displaced persons in West Timor was discussed at
the meeting, said Marker.
</P>
<P>
"It was agreed that measures should be quickly taken to enable
them to express their views freely" with regard to whether they
will stay in West Timor, or whether they want to return to East
Timor or to be rehabilitated somewhere else, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. accounts, over 500,000 out of the 890,000
East Timorese were displaced by violence since the announcement of
East Timor referendum result on September 4 and another 150,000
moved into West Timor and other areas.
</P>
<P>
The tripartite talks, attended by Indonesian Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas and his Portuguese counterpart Jaime Gama, also
discussed the modalities of the third phase of implementing the
outcome of the August 30 referendum in East Timor, said Marker.
</P>
<P>
The phase provides for the United Nations to make preparations
for East Timor's transition to independence.
</P>
<P>
An agreement reached in May sees the ballot on East Timor's
future as the first phase and the hand-over of authority from
Indonesia to the U.N. as the second.
</P>
<P>
The parties will continue the dialog Wednesday and the U.N.
chief is expected to issue a new report on the latest developments
in East Timor, it was disclosed.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Seeks Foreign Jobs for More Male Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Sri Lankan government is
encouraging more male workers to seek employment abroad since huge
outflow of housemaids have resulted in a series of social problems
at home.
</P>
<P>
Many a problem in society including suicide and child abuse is
traced to the absence of the housewife in the household, said an
official with the Foreign Employment Bureau Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said male workers can seek jobs in the Middle East as there
is an increasing demand for Sri Lankan skilled workers such as
welders, painters, electricians and plumbers.
</P>
<P>
However, the government's new move was blamed by local women's
organizations as sexual discrimination.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has the world's highest suicide rate. About 7,000 Sri
Lankans kill themselves each year. Most suicides are blamed on the
depression and alcoholism which have been aggravated with the
housewives working abroad.
</P>
<P>
There are annually 10,000 to 15,000 boys, aged between 8 and
15, sexually abused by paedophiles from Western Europe, according
to a report compiled by a local organization called Protecting
Children and Environment Everywhere early this year.
</P>
<P>
The absence of mothers is blamed as one of the main reasons why
children fall victim to foreign paedophiles.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1.2 million Sri Lankans working abroad, 80
percent of them female. Overseas remittance has been a major
source of revenue which helps sustain the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan overseas workers remitted back to the country 880
million dollars in 1998. They already remitted 497 million dollars
in the first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Meet Euro-1 Emission Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's Ministry of Works
and Transport has decided to meet the Euro-1 emission standard in
the country from January 1, 2001, The Kathmandu Post reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Shushil Agrawal, deputy director general of
the Department of Transport Management (DOTM), as saying Tuesday
that the new norms called "Nepal 2001" would require all kinds of
vehicles seeking registration across the country to compulsorily
meet Euro-1 standard.
</P>
<P>
Euro-1 standard, imposed in Europe in the early 90s with a view
to reducing vehicular emission level, requires vehicles emit
reduced amount of toxic pollutants into the air.
</P>
<P>
"vehicles failing to meet Euro-1 emission norms will not be
registered across the country from the very first day of the year
2001," said Shushil.
</P>
<P>
Of over 200,000 vehicles in Nepal, over 130,000 are
concentrated in the bowl-shaped Kathmandu Valley. Studies
conducted in successive years have shown the capital's air quality
beyond World Health Organization's permissible limits.

To support the last three-months of military operations,

Colombia's peso was devalued by 28 percent in the first nine

yearly during the period of 2000-2002.

<HEADLINE> Cocaine Hidden in Containers Uncovered in Sweden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Goteborg customhouse
has uncovered three cases of smuggling drug hidden in banana
containers over the past eight months, seizing 352 kilograms of
high-quality cocaine, the Swedish customhouse announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In February, customhouse officials discovered 243 kilograms of
cocaine in a banana container aboard a cargo ship from Central-
Southern America. Then in August, they discovered 104 kilograms
of cocaine in a similar circumstance.
</P>
<P>
Recently, five kilograms of that stuff was found in a banana
container from the same region.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, only 11 kilograms of cocaine was seized last year
in the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Erling Johansson, an official in charge of customhouses in
western Sweden, said the cocaine, 855 in purity, would fetch over
1 billion Swedish Krona (120 million U.S. dollars), based on
current street price in the country.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the ultimate destination of the cocaine might
not be Sweden, but some other European countries. Sweden might
just be used as a transshipment point.

their cars at least once a week, the cumulative impact of these
increases is really starting to hit household budgets."

In early July, petrol sold for an average national price of
41.5 U.S. cents a liter for 91-octane and 44.1 U.S. cents a liter
for 96-octane. But now the prices have risen to 49 cents and 52
cents respectively.
</P>
<P>
Shell spokesman Antonius Papaspiropoulos was quoted as saying
local petrol price increases have not kept up with increasing
costs to oil companies when the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) restricts oil supply.
</P>
<P>
He predicted further rises, saying "While OPEC countries
continue to impose restrictions on oil output, pump prices around
the world will continue to soar."

<HEADLINE> Renovated Qinghai-Tibet Road Gets High Marks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The Qinghai-Tibet Road in
western China has a new look after renovations over the past nine
years, and the newly improved highway received high appraisals
from experts Tuesday in Golmud in northwest Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
This road is a key state project supporting economic
development in the Tibet Autonomous Region and is the highest road
in the world, with an average elevation of 4,000 meters.
</P>
<P>
Part of the highway traverses an area of perma-frost to the
longest extent of any such road in the world.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, China added 1.3 billion yuan (156 million US dollars)
to renovate the road and tackle key problems facing the project.
</P>
<P>
Automobiles can now travel along the highway at speeds twice as
fast as that prior to the renovations.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Condemns Grenade Attack in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia on Tuesday
strongly condemned two grenade blasts in a Serb-dominated city in
Kosovo and urged the United Nations' special mission and
international peacekeepers to take "thorough and professional"
action to curb terrorism in the province.
</P>
<P>
Two grenades exploded Tuesday in a market in the city of Polje,
killing two people and injuring 36. The incident triggered off
massive protests by the Serb population. The protesters blocked a
road linking the provincial capital of Pristina and the city of
Peci and clashed with international peace-keepers, leaving five
injured.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the U.N. mission and the international peace-
keeping force, Stanimir Vukichevich, head of a commission in
charge of cooperation between Yugoslavia and the U.N. mission,
urged the two institutions to take measures to guarantee the
safety of civilians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Vukichevich said the attack on the market was a result of the
two institutions' "connivance and partial" policy on the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA) and it is an evidence that the KLA has not
yet been disarmed. He also claimed the terrorists were trying to
arouse panic among the local Serbs.
</P>
<P>
A NATO spokesman said four people, two ethnic Albanians and two
unidentified persons, have been detained in connection with the
Tuesday grenade attack.
</P>
<P>
The KLA should be de-militarized by September this year as
provided for in an agreement signed earlier by Yugoslavia and NATO.
</P>
<P>
The Yugoslav official demanded the U.N. mission and the peace-
keeping forces release the results of their investigation on the
incident as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Demands 14.6 million Dollars for Three Sports Events </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports
Council (KONI) has requested a 124 billion rupiah (14.6 million U.
S.dollars) budget for athlete preparation for three major sporting
events.
</P>
<P>
The three events are the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, the 2001
Southeast Asian (SEA) Games in Kuala Lumpur and the 2002 Asian
Games in Pusan, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
KONI's planning and budget deputy Sudharno said that the budget
plan had been submitted to the office of the state minister of
youth affairs and sports.
</P>
<P>
For the 2000 Olympics, KONI will need 6.9 billion rupiah to
prepare athletes at a centralized training program to be held in
February next year.
</P>
<P>
KONI plans to send 66 athletes from archery, badminton, beach
volleyball, boxing, rowing and canoeing, swimming and diving,
taekwondo, track and field, weightlifting and windsurfing.
</P>
<P>
Sudharno said sports organizations and KONI's provincial
chapters must work together to prepare athletes before they joined
the centralized training program.
</P>
<P>
For the 2001 SEA Games, KONI requested a 100 billion rupiah
fund to train more than 1,000 athletes for nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
KONI, which hopes to grab the overall title in the next Games,
will train 1,297 athletes before admitting 60 percent of the
figure. It also plans to send athletes for tryouts on two
occasions.
</P>
<P>
In the SEA Games held in Brunei Darussalam last month,
Indonesia took third place behind Thailand and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
For the 2002 Asiad, KONI needs about 17.1 billion rupiah to
lift its medal tally from six gold medals, Sudharno was quoted by
the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.

<HEADLINE> Plentiful Underground Water Discovered In Northwestern China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 29 (Xinhua) -- Chinese hydrologists have found
water in a karst formation in arid northwestern China that is
equal in size to 10 large reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
The new water source will provide 25.4 billion cubic meters of
mineral water a year. This is 23 times the amount of the Great
Artesian Basin in Australia and similar to the amount of storage
capacity of the Three Gorges Dam.
</P>
<P>
Some 350 wells have been dug in the Junggar, Tarim and Ordos
basins in 5 provinces and autonomous regions in that area, which
can provide 665,000 cubic meters of water a day, according to Li
Lierong of the Land and Resources Ministry.
</P>
<P>
This is part of a national water-location scheme that began in
1995, which has benefited more than one million people in the
northwest. The Ordos is a sedimentary basin that was formed during
the Mesozoic Era.
</P>
<P>
The first well was dug in Shaanxi Province, after which large
amounts of water were found in mountainous parts of Gansu and
Ningxia. In the Ih Ju League of Inner Mongolia a well with a daily
output of 10,000 cubic meters of water has also been dug.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years, farmers living on arid plains in
northern Shaanxi Province have dug 40 water wells from 500 to 1,
000 meters deep. according to Xu Qingzhou, a senior engineer in
charge of the water exploration project. Each well provides 5,000
cubic meters of water on average a day.

MANILA, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Philippine newspapers Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Manila Bulletin:
</P>
<P>
-- At least 16 people, including five government soldiers, were
killed and more than 20 others injured in an hour-long battle
between Philippine government troops and rebels, in Tungawan,
Zamboanga del Sur, the Southern Philippines, Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Sun Star:
</P>
<P>
-- As many as 23,000 old school buildings could become death
traps if a strong earthquake hits the Philippines, an education
official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Business World:
</P>
<P>
-- The Philippine peso hit a low of 41.10 to the U.S. dollar
Tuesday as it continued to trail the Thai baht. It, however,
recovered after banks took profits on their trading positions.

<P>
Yuan Daoxian, of the Chinese Academy of Sciences who is a well-
known karst expert, described the discovery as a breakthrough in
hydrogeological research and significant for economic and social
development in northwestern China.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China includes Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces
and the Ningxia Hui, Xinjiang Uygur, and Inner Mongolia autonomous
regions and has a total area of 3.3 million square kilometers, or
one third of China's territory. The region has many natural
resources and is a leading grain, cotton, energy, and raw
materials producer.
</P>
<P>
However, the region's annual water resources are only 210
billion cubic meters on average, or about a tenth of the national
total. By 2000, the region is expected to have an annual shortfall
of 15 billion cubic meters of water because of limited
precipitation and a high rate of evaporation.
</P>
<P>
To date, 80 percent of the surface water in the northwest has
been utilized but underground water only accounts for a quarter of
its recoverable reserves and a tenth of the region's annual water
consumption.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the better development of underground water is an
important means of solving the water shortage problem, said Dang
Xueya, a senior engineer in charge of water in Shaanxi.
</P>
<P>
The Land and Resources Ministry has decided to spend 80 million
yuan (about 9.6 million U.S. dollars) on water exploration in the
Ordos through 2002.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Government, Rebels to Resume Talks Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian
government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC)
will resume peace talks next week, Presidential High Commissioner
for Peace Victor Ricardo announced on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo said the date will be announced after a new round of
talks with the spokesman of FARC at the end of this week.
</P>
<P>
Peace talks between the government and FARC, the biggest
guerrilla group in Colombia, started in January and halted in mid-
July because of the latter's objection to international
verification.
</P>
<P>
A week ago, the Colombian government withdrew previous requests
for an international monitoring team to oversee the talks aimed to
end the nearly four-decade-long civil war, which has claimed 35,
000 lives over the past 10 years in Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Chelsea Win First Match in Champions League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea battled away for
their first win in Group H at Champions League against a resolute
Galatasaray side on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish side's strength was seriously undermined in the
match when Brazilian World Cup goalkeeper Claudio Taffarel was
sent off in the 32nd minute for handling the ball 20 meters
outside his penalty area.
</P>
<P>
Galatasaray were still hard to break down but not as imposing
as they had been for the opening spell, although it was not until
the 55th minute when substitute goalkeeper Mehmet Bolukbasi was
finally beaten by some clever Dan Petrescu trickery for the only
goal of the game.
</P>
<P>
If Brazilian Taffarel was Galatasaray's villain then Brazilians
Giovanni, with two goals, and Luciano, with one, were the heroes
for Olympiakos Piraeus in Olympiakos's 3-1 win over Molde in Group
E.
</P>
<P>
The Norwegian side have now lost all three matches and have no
hope of qualifying for the second round.
</P>
<P>
The victory moved Olympiakos on to four points in the group,
but they still trail Real Madrid and Porto who occupy the top two
positions.
</P>
<P>
Real Madrid, bidding to win the European Cup for the eighth
time, beat Portuguese champions Porto 3-1 in a fiercely contested
match between the old Iberian rivals to go top of the group.
</P>
<P>
Real's victory in their 200th match in Europe's premier club
competition took them to seven points from three matches -- one
ahead of Porto -- and maintained their unbeaten start to the
season in both domestic and European competition.
</P>
<P>
Real won with goals from Fernando Morientes (22), Ivan Helguera
(37) and Fernando Hierro (67pen) with Mario Jardel taking
advantage of a goalkeeper howler by Albano Bizarri to score for
Porto after 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Bizarri dropped the ball at Jardel's feet after appearing to
catch a high cross -- but luckily for him Real went on to victory.
</P>
<P>
But while Real were winning, two other powerful clubs faltered,
with AC Milan held to a 1-1 draw at home by surprise contenders
Hertha Berlin in Group H.
</P>
<P>
Iranian striker Ali Daei, who scored twice in Hertha's 2-1 win
over Chelsea last week, silenced the San Siro when he put Hertha
ahead after 69 minutes before German international Oliver Bierhoff
equalised for the Italian champions four minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Hertha's highly-vaunted German rivals Bayern Munich also drew 1-
1 but were far less happy with their point after leading against
Valencia for 75 minutes in their Group F match.
</P>
<P>
Elber put Bayern ahead after only five minutes and they held
that lead until Gerard Lopez equalised in the 80th minute.
</P>
<P>
That result kept Valencia as leaders of Group F on five points
with Bayern second on the same points tally, but the Spanish side
top the table on the countback system used to determine Champions
League positions.
</P>
<P>
The biggest win of the night was in Group G with Sparta Prague
crushing Willem II Tilburg of the Netherlands 4-0 which keeps
Sparta in with a chance of a place in the second round,and to all
intents and purposes eliminates the Dutch side.
</P>
<P>
Girondins Bordeaux top Group G with seven points after their 2-
1 home win over Spartak Moscow. Sparta Prague have five,Spartak
four and Willem II none.
</P>
<P>
Rangers of Scotland won for the first time when they defeated
PSV Eindhoven 1-0 in Group F.
</P>
<P>
Eight matches in Groups A, B, C and D will be played on
Wednesday before the Champions League takes a break until the week
of October 19.

<HEADLINE> N.Y. State Adopts Boxing Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The New York State
Athletic Commission adopted on Tuesday reforms scrutinizing boxing
promoters, judges and sanctioning bodies in response to the
controversial Holyfield-Lewis draw decision last March.
</P>
<P>
The regulations give state officials a bigger say in selecting
judges, require boxing judges to disclose personal financial
information and limit promoters' contracts with fighters to a
maximum of three years.
</P>
<P>
Evander Holyfield, holder of the World Boxing Association and
International Boxing Federation titles, and World Boxing Council
champion Lennox Lewis fought to a widely-derided draw on March 13
in New York's Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
Many expert observers were shocked by the decision because they
thought Lewis had clearly won. The decision raised questions about
possible corruption or whether the judging was incompetent.
</P>
<P>
The New York Commission voted to require each sanctioning body
with an interest in a title fight to submit three candidates for
judge, rather than just one, from whom the Commission will select
by itself. The commission reserves the right to reject the
nominations and select judges without further nominations.

<HEADLINE> Sihanouk Hails China As Perfect Example for Third World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, September 29 (Xinhua) -- The people's Republic of
China has become a real powerful country and gives the Third World
a perfect example of patriotism and devotion, Cambodian King
Norodom Sihanouk said in a recent written statement to Xinhua on
the country's 50th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
"The founding of the People's Republic of China is one of the
most important events in the 20th century," he emphasized, "Since
then, the heroic Chinese people, under the leadership of the
Communist Party of China, have worked with faith, enthusiasm and
wisdom to build their country and have achieved a great success."
</P>
<P>
The king highly praised Chinese leaders, saying the country "
has developed in a spectacular way thanks to the policy of reform,
opening-up and modernization drive initiated by late senior leader
Deng Xiaoping, which was successfully pursued by the third
generation of leadership with President Jiang Zemin at the core."
</P>
<P>
Sihanouk, who turns 77 on October 31, is a revered king and a
stabilizing force in Cambodian politics. As an old friend of
China, he has paid frequent visits to China's mainland.
</P>
<P>
"With an impressive success in social reform, economy and
science, the People's Republic of China has become a real power,
supported by its modernized People's Liberation Army," said the
King.
</P>
<P>
Referring to China's foreign policy, King Sihanouk said that
China "has always adhered to the five principles of peaceful
coexistence, which has considerably enhanced her status" on the
world arena.
</P>
<P>
"Despite her own needs for rehabilitation and national
construction, the People's Republic of China did not hesitate to
share materials and human resources with brother countries who
needed help," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"In the 21st century," the King said, "As a powerful symbol of
love of peace, equality, justice, progress and peaceful
coexistence, China will play a big and important role and exercise
a big and beneficial influence in the region and in the entire
world."
</P>
<P>
On Sino-Cambodian relations, Sihanouk said, "Having gone
through the test of time, this model friendship will undoubtedly
blossom in the coming century."

<HEADLINE> Scientists Create Plastic-Producing GM Crop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Scientists from the
biotechnology giant Monsanto said Tuesday they have successfully
created genetically-modified (GM) crops that could produce
biodegradable plastic.
</P>
<P>
The plastic, particularly suitable for commercial use, is also
a considerable feat of genetic engineering, Dr Kenneth Gruys and
colleagues reported in the journal Nature Biotechnology.
</P>
<P>
Their experimental research involved inserting four genes of
plastic-producing bacteria into special varieties of oilseed rape
and cress.
</P>
<P>
Although the results are promising, the researchers said that
the GM crops can only produce plastic as approximately 3 percent
of dry weight, which is six times lower than has been managed in
other experiments.
</P>
<P>
"The low yield suggests substantial room for improvement before
commercialization," the researchers said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
However, they believed that if the enhancements in yield can be
ultimately achieved, plants could one day become remarkably
efficient "biological factories," producing oils, plastics, and
animal feed all in one crop.

<HEADLINE> Study: Heart Drug May Prevent Blindness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- A standard heart drug may help
prevent some effects of the inherited form of blindness called
retinitis pigmentosa, French researchers said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Retinitis pigmentosa, a disease that gradually destroys the
eye's light-sensing cells, called rods and cones, is believed to
be caused by a defect in one or more genes.
</P>
<P>
No treatment is known to stop the disease which affects around
100,000 people in the United States alone, though doses of vitamin
A can retard it slightly in some cases.
</P>
<P>
Now a new study, carried out by Serge Picaud and colleagues
from Louis Pasteur University in Strasbourg, France, showed that
diltiazem, a commonly prescribed heart drug, appears to "preserve
visual function" in a mouse model of retinitis pigmentosa.
</P>
<P>
After giving daily injections of diltiazem to specially bred
"retinal degeneration" mice, the researchers found that this
treatment can rescue rod photoreceptors from degeneration, thus
preserving the eyesight of these mice.
</P>
<P>
Reporting their findings in the October issue of the Nature
Medicine journal, the researchers said that while the drug's exact
mechanism of protection is unknown, administration of diltiazem
could "represent a new line of treatment" for the disease.
</P>
<P>
"If the treatment could postpone the occurrence of blindness by
a few years, it would be a big achievement, but this remains to be
demonstrated in humans," they wrote.

UNITED NATIONS, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's oil exports
totaled 4.56 billion U.S. dollars in the current 180-day phase
ending November 21, the United Nations Office of the Iraq Program
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With current prices and the current rate of export, Iraq will
be able to export 7.17 billion dollars worth of oil in Phase VI
beginning May 25, well above the 5.25 billion dollars authorized
by U.N. resolution 1242 (1999).
</P>
<P>
The resolution also indicates the Security Council's intentions
to review that ceiling if the need arises.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq in 1990 after its invasion
of Kuwait. Security Council Resolution 1153 adopted in February
1998 allows Iraq to export oil worth 5.25 billion dollars, raising
the previous ceiling of 2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In Phase IV and V, Iraq was unable to meet the export ceiling
because of insufficient oil equipment and contracts held by some
members of the U.N. sanction committee.

<HEADLINE> Fresh Fighting Erupts in Northern Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Fierce fighting broke out
Tuesday in Afghanistan's far north between the dominant Taliban
militia and the opposition forces, said news reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The reports of fresh fighting came a day after the Taliban
captured Imam Sahib and Dasht-i-Archi districts in Kunduz
province.
</P>
<P>
Independent sources said civilians in Taloqan, provincial
capital of Takhar, were fleeing the city amid fears the advancing
Taliban army would shortly overrun the opposition-held town.
</P>
<P>
Internally displaced people are expected to head for Badakhshan
province or cross the northern border into Tajikistan, one foreign
aid source said.
</P>
<P>
Since the Taliban launched a major offensive in the north on
Saturday, Taloqan has been bombed regularly by the militia's jet
fighters which the opposition says have left 31 dead and dozens
injured over the past four days.

<HEADLINE> Mexico City Mayor Resigns to Be Presidential Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Mexico City Mayor
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Tuesday presented his resignation to put
himself in the running for the 2000 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Cardenas is head of the leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party
(PRD), the second largest opposition party in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Cardenas, who has already competed on two occasions for the
Mexican presidency (in 1988 and 1994), will be substituted by the
"number two" of the government of the Mexican capital, Rosario
Robles, according to an announcement made by the PRD in the
Assembly of Representatives of the Federal District.
</P>
<P>
Cardenas, who has been in command since December 5, 1997,
became the first opposition candidate to hold this position, in
the first democratic elections in Mexico City in this century.
</P>
<P>
Robles will be the first woman to have governed this
super-populated metropolis of 8 million residents, or 20 million
if the suburbs of the city are included in the metropolitan zone.
</P>
<P>
Cardenas, at the head of a great central-leftist alliance, was
considered "the electoral earthquake" who was at the point of
winning the presidential elections against the then candidate of
the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), Carlos
Salinas, who finally triumphed.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, however, he did not have the same success and ended in
third place in the presidential elections which were won by the
acting president Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest polls, Cardenas is tailing the
businessman Vicente Fox, of the central-rightist National Action
Party (PAN), as the favorite opposition candidate for the July 2,
2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the PAN, PRD and the other six parties to
form an electoral alliance are on the way to ruin, and all the
evidence leads the analysts to believe that Cardenas and Fox will
have to measure themselves at the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
Mexican law states that to be a presidential candidate, it is
not possible to hold the position of head of the Federal District
Government for a period of six months prior to the elections.
</P>
<P>
Cardenas is the son of the revered ex-Mexican president, Lazaro
Cardenas, who in 1938 nationalized the petroleum industry.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Mobile Handset Sales Continue to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Driven by continued
growth in the digital handset market, U.S. mobile handset sales
surpassed 10.3 million units in the second quarter of this year,
research firm Dataquest reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Digital handsets accounted for 77.8 percent of the U.S. mobile
handset sales in the second quarter, according to the research
firm, while the rest came from analog handsets. In comparison,
1998 year-end results showed that analog handsets had 40 percent
of the handset market.
</P>
<P>
Dataquest analysts said that code-division multiple access
(CDMA) handsets are an increasingly large component of the strong
growth of digital mobile telephony in the United States.
</P>
<P>
CDMA uses a spread spectrum technique that codes each digital
packet and allows multiple calls to be placed on one channel,
boosting the caller capacity 20 to 35 times that of the analog
network. CDMA phones are noted for their excellent call quality
and long battery life.
</P>
<P>
Within the U.S. digital handset market, CDMA technology
represented 47 percent of sales in the second quarter. Year-end
1998 results showed CDMA had 38 percent of the digital handset
market.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, time-division multiple access (TDMA) technology had 46
percent of digital handset sales, but in the second quarter of
1999, TDMA slipped to 39 percent of sales. TDMA interleaves
multiple digital signals onto a single high-speed channel. For
cellular, TDMA triples the capacity of the original analog method.

<HEADLINE> Petrescu Keeps Chelsea Euro Dreams Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea's revived their
flagging Champions League campaign - but only just as they
struggled to a 1-0 win over ten-men Galatasaray at Stamford Bridge
Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish side were threatening an upset before Brazilian
keeper Claudio Taffarel was sent off after 30 minutes for
deliberate handball as he raced out of his box to challenge
Chelsea's Dan Petrescu.
</P>
<P>
Forced to re-shuffle, ten-men Galatasaray sacrificed striker
Urdem Arif who until then had been their most menacing player.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal proved the game's turning point and although
Galatasaray battled bravely, Chelsea eventually found the net on
the hour mark when Petrescu chipped the winner.
</P>
<P>
But it was tense 90 minutes for Chelsea and it took the
introduction of inspirational midfielder Gus Poyet in the second
half to break the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Poyet, brought on for Gabriele Ambrosetti in the 52nd minute,
came close with his first touch - his header from a Zola free-kick
sailing inches wide.
</P>
<P>
But within seven minutes his presence in midfield produced
results.
</P>
<P>
He helped set up a chance for Petrescu, and although the
initial shot was saved by replacement keeper Bolukbasi Mehmet,
Petrescu kept his head to collect the re-bound, switch feet, and
side-foot a chip into the empty net.
</P>
<P>
After a shock defeat to Hertha Berlin, Chelsea desperately
needed a home win to keep their Champions League campaign on track.

<HEADLINE> Riedle Seals Fulham Switch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Former German international
Karlheinz Riedle plans to end his glittering playing days at
Fulham after completing a 200,000 pounds move from Liverpool.
</P>
<P>
The German international has signed an 18-month contract with
the First Division club after failing to make an impact with
Gerard Houllier's new-look Anfield team. And the 34-year-old
striker, who chose Fulham ahead of three Premiership clubs -
thought to be Derby, Sheffield Wednesday and Newcastle - revealed
he plans to see out his illustrious career at Craven Cottage.
</P>
<P>
"This will definitely be my last move," said Riedle, who was
capped 42 times by his country. "I don't think Fulham are a very
big club in Germany. They don't really follow Division One so much
like the English don't follow their Second Division, but they will
have heard of them now!"
</P>
<P>
Houllier only used Riedle twice this season and the German, who
scored 16 international goals, decided to look elsewhere for first-
team football in the twilight of his career.

<HEADLINE> China Urges Creation of Better Development Climate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Finance Minister
Xiang Huaicheng urged here Tuesday the developed countries to take
actions to create a better environment for the healthy development
of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual meetings of the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), Xiang called upon the developed
countries to increase resource transfer to and import from
developing countries, implement active and responsible fiscal and
monetary policies, and coordinate their interest and exchange
rates policies.
</P>
<P>
Xiang warned that the global economic environment, though
improved, has not stabilized completely and there are still many
uncertainties in today's world economy.
</P>
<P>
"To further consolidate the recovery and stabilize the world
economy is a challenging task before the governments around the
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Xiang also called upon developing countries to continue their
economic restructuring to this end.
</P>
<P>
In order to prevent any future crisis, Xiang said, it is
important to strengthen the international financial cooperation
and promote the trouble-free and smooth operation of the
international financial market.
</P>
<P>
The international community should help developing countries
improve their financial supervision and risk prevention capacity,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Xiang also stressed the need for the international community to
strengthen the supervision on short-term capital flow and contain
the excessive speculation of cross-border hot money.
</P>
<P>
On reforming the international financial architecture and
establishing a new international financial order, Xiang said the
developing countries' full participation is essential, and their
interests and demands must be reflected.
</P>
<P>
"The policy choices by the affected countries or regions to
overcome the crisis must be respected, and no model should be
imposed indiscriminately," he said.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis also caused serious difficulties to
China's economy, but the Chinese government has taken effective
measures based on its own circumstances and maintained a rapid
growth of the economy, the finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government, taking into account the need to
maintain a healthy development for the Asian and the global
economy, has adopted a highly responsible policy stance and made
tremendous sacrifice by keeping the Chinese currency stable,
thereby contributing to the recovery of the Asian economy, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Xiang expressed his hope that the World Bank, as the largest
development finance institution, will build upon its comparative
advantages to provide more concessional funds and further promote
the capital flow to its developing country members.
</P>
<P>
"We also hope that the Bank will strictly keep its political
neutrality in the conduct of its business, and resist any attempt
to politicize the Bank," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese minister urged all the member countries, the major
shareholders in particular, to respect and protect the Bank's
Articles of Agreement to create a better environment for the
Bank to fulfill its development mandate.

<HEADLINE> Inward Investment In UK Up 18 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Inward investment into Britain
last year increased by 18 percent over the previous year, from
276.3 billion U.S. dollars to 326.8 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The figures by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development show that after the U.S., the UK was the second
highest recipient of foreign direct investment (FDI) in 1998 and
top of the European Union FDI league table in the same year.
</P>
<P>
The figures were welcomed by British campaigners against early
participation in the euro system, who said they disproved claims
that investors would shy away from the UK unless it joins.
</P>
<P>
"Inward investment last year was at record levels, including
huge increases from the Far East. This gives the lie to claims
that being outside the euro-zone will be harmful," said Nick
Herbert, chief executive of Business for Sterling.
</P>
<P>
However, Andrew Fraser, head of the government's Invest in
Britain Bureau, said investors appeared to have been reassured by
the government's positive rhetoric on the euro.

NAIROBI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The floods sweeping across
the northern part of Ghana last week have claimed at least 47
lives, Ghana news Agency reported Tuesday.

acres of farm crops estimated at several millions of cedis was
destroyed".

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian Civil Servants Ask for Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 28 (Xinhua) -- The Greater Accra regional
branch of the Civil Servants Association (CSA) Tuesday gave the
government a two-week ultimatum to respond to their grievances
about the anomalies in the implementation of the Ghana Universal
Salary Structure (GUSS).
</P>
<P>
The association said while waiting for the response, it would
start wearing red bands as from Friday to put pressure on the
government to give its members better remuneration, according to
Ghana News Agency.
</P>
<P>
This line of action was taken at a meeting organized by the
Greater Accra regional and district branches of the association
for its local representatives.
</P>
<P>
The meeting examined the Price Waterhouse salary administration
to determine whether it has benefited civil servants as promised
in the Memorandum of Understanding.
</P>
<P>
Acting Regional Chairman James Amissah said since the
implementation of the first phase of the GUSS in June this year,
the association had expressed its disappointment about the
anomalies and has been pressurizing both the government and the
Central Management Board (CMB) for rectification.
</P>
<P>
"It is sad to announce that despite all our efforts to correct
these anomalies, they still exist," he said while asking the
members to lend their support to the National Secretariat to solve
the problem.
</P>
<P>
Joris Kawawa, Director of Grievances, said the hopes and
aspirations of civil servants were not met after the
implementation because what "they have made us to understand was
different from what they have implemented".
</P>
<P>
According to the Memorandum of Understanding, no civil servant
is going to be made worse off under the new universal wages and
salary structure, he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting agreed to resort to pressure to make the government
aware of what exactly is pertaining on the ground.

LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- European markets slid sharply
Tuesday amid heavy profit-taking, interest rate worries and an
early retreat on Wall Street.

In London, as investors await further developments and
potential counterbids for NatWest, many chose to take profits

Germany's electronic Xetra Dax gave up 120.54 points, or 2.3

</P>
<P>
Deutsche Telekom shares fell 2.82 percent to 38.24 euros amid
concerns that talks between MCI WorldCom Inc and Sprint Corp could

Broader uncertainty in the market about the direction of the

rates at next month's Fed meeting also dogged the market.

<HEADLINE> No Evidence Against Pinochet, Lawyer Tells British Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 28 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers for former Chilean
leader Augusto Pinochet Tuesday told an extradition hearing in
London that there is no evidence against the retired general.
</P>
<P>
On the second day of the hearing held at Bow Street
Magistrates' Court in central London, Clive Nicholls, who
represents Pinochet, argued that it was not enough for Spain
simply to describe tortures allegedly committed in Chile to
justify extraditing Pinochet.
</P>
<P>
"The responsibility, as opposed to a mere description of
events, must be established by evidence. There is no such evidence
in this case and therefore he is entitled to immunity," Nicholls
said.
</P>
<P>
While evidence was not needed in a normal European extradition
case, the fact that Pinochet was a former head of state meant
proof of the torture charges against him was a prerequisite, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet, 83, is currently under house arrest in Surrey,
southwest of London. He is accused of ordering beatings, burnings,
sexual abuse and electric shock treatment during his 17-year rule
of Chile which ended in 1990.
</P>
<P>
It took 20 minutes to read out the 35 charges against Pinochet,
a life senator in Chile, who was arrested in a London hospital
last October while he was recovering from a minor operation.
</P>
<P>
The hearing is expected to last five days, at the end of which
the court will probably reserve the decision to a later date.
</P>
<P>
Another of the general's lawyers, Julian Knowles, said all the
charges made it clear the alleged tortures were carried out by
other people.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that Senator Pinochet is not accused in Spain of
being a principal, of actually having had his hand on the act. The
case is that he gave the orders, that he was a counselor," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Knowles said the former Chilean leader did not bear even
secondary responsibility for the tortures.
</P>
<P>
Under English law, to establish secondary responsibility there
had to be some element of communication between a secondary party
and the person directly responsible for the offense, and some
element of encouragement of the offense, he said.
