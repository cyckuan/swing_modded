<HEADLINE>   EU Suggests International Charter on Internet Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union has
proposed an international charter on the regulation of the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The draft charter came in response to the United States Green
Paper on Internet governance, said Martin Bangemann, European
commissioner in charge of telecommunications and information
technologies.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the principle of the charter should show no
principle or discrimination, but reflect a wide range of
international interests.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to EU member states to take a common position on
the proposal of an international charter.
</P>
<P>
EU officials claimed that the U.S. Green Paper, published last
Wednesday, appeared not to recognize the need to implement an
international approach.
</P>
<P>
"The current U.S. proposals could consolidate permanent U.S.
jurisdiction over the Internet as a whole," they said.
</P>
<P>
The EU counter-proposal, expected to come out as a draft reply
after the European council of telecommunications ministers meet on
Thursday, would include the private sector in the future
organization of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The EU's specific objectives, according to commission
officials, were to strive for balanced and equitable private sector
participation in Internet governance, including adequate
procedures for the representation of consumer and user interests.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner Bangemann said that he did not want Internet wars
but hoped to encourage competition.
</P>
<P>
The EU wanted to apply competition rules in the Internet to
ensure that the transition to the new structures did not create or
strengthen dominant companies and organizations charged with the
regulation of the Internet.

<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Cabinet Wednesday
held its last meeting during which the eleven ministers submitted
their resignations to President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, government spokesman Manolis
Christofides said the new cabinet will give its affirmation to
the president on Saturday and have its first meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, who was re-elected for a second five-year term in
office, will be sworn in as the eighth president of the Cyprus
Republic since its independence in 1960 during a ceremonial
session of the 56-seat House of Representatives Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
Clerides won a narrow victory over former Foreign Minister
George Iacovou in run-off elections on February 15.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Clerides is awaiting for the Cyprus National
Democratic Union's (EDEK) reply to the invitation for
participation in the government.
</P>
<P>
Clerides is expected to announce the composition of the new
government on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The president has pledged to form a national unity government
after winning the victory. But two other political parties, the
Progress Party of Working People (AKEL) and the Democratic Party
(DIKO) which had supported Iacovou during the presidential
elections, refused to participate in the Clerides' government.

<HEADLINE> Violent Crime Rises Sharply in Greece in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Greece saw a steady increase of
violent crime with the sharpest rise being murder, the Athens News
newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
An 80-page report, which was prepared by an expert commission
set up earlier last year by Greece's Public Order Minister George
Romeos and released Tuesday, showed a significant increase in four
out of five categories of violent crime (armed robbery, theft,
murder, rape and drug) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The greatest annual increase was noted in murder, with a total
of 251 reported cases in 1997, up 33 percent from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
The drug-related crime was reported to have the second highest
leap in cases with a 28 percent increase. The 6,000 cases were
coupled with about 230 deaths connected to narcotics.
</P>
<P>
Armed robberies also increased by over 20 percent from the
previous year while rape enjoyed a 12 percent increase with 164
reported cases.
</P>
<P>
Theft was the only crime category with an annual drop of 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
To combat violent crime throughout the country, Greece has
recently announced measures including 1,500 extra policemen in the
trouble-hit areas in Athens and extra police patrol cars and plans
for the creation of a special force.

TOKYO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Japan plans to resume
low-interest official development assistance (ODA) loans to
Myanmar (Burma) after a ten-year suspension, Kyodo News Service
reported.
</P>
<P>
Japan is considering to provide a 2.5 billion yen (about 19.7
million U.S. dollars) to help Myanmar fix a runway at the Yangon
international airport, Kyodo quoted government sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement with Myanmar, Japan had promised to extend
27 billion yen (about 212.6 million dollars) ODA loans for the
expansion of the airport.
</P>
<P>
But Japan suspended the loans midway in 1988 because of the
political unrest in the country.

<HEADLINE> Algeria Calls for Arab Strategy for Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Algeria has called for outlining
an Arab strategy on confronting terrorism which has panicked the
northern African country for six years, the Middle East News
Agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The strategy should cover the security and judicial aspects and
take into consideration the internal and external dimensions of
this phenomenon, according to a proposal presented by Algeria
Wednesday to the Cairo-based Arab Labor Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, to be sent to the 25th session of the Arab Labor
Conference to be held in the Egyptian southern city of Luxor next
Monday, calls on the countries that harbor terrorists to prevent
them from taking advantage of the loopholes of local legislation
to seek asylum and get money or weapons.
</P>
<P>
It also urges Arab labor ministers and other VIPs, who will
attend the conference, to declare their rejection of terrorist
acts in Algeria, calling upon the conferees to side with the
Algerian people and government in their struggle against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The presentation of the proposal came just two days after two
bombs ripped out Algeria's biggest gas pipeline in the most
violent blow to the government's major hard currency earner.
</P>
<P>
The dual bombings occurred amid new army sweeps against Muslim
militants who are fighting a war against the government.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim insurgency has killed an estimated 75,000 people
since 1992, when the government canceled legislative elections
which the now-banned Islamic Salvation Front was set to win.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Overseas Investment to Plunge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, February 25 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's overseas
investment will fall sharply in 1998 for the second consecutive
year, the Export and Import Bank of Korea said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 140 corporations which planned to invest overseas, 108
have cancelled or put off indefinitely their plans mainly because
of the difficulties in raising investment funds, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the decreasing overseas investment to the
financial crisis, which was caused by corporate failures and bad
loans of financial institutions in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached with the International Monetary Fund
for a bail-out loan of 57 billion dollars, South Korea has to
restructure its economy and open its markets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the country, once the 11th largest economy in the
world, has to pay back a large part of its foreign debts which
amount to 163 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Protect Its Export Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government has
complained of foreign limitations on Russian exports, claiming
they have cost the country billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dmitri Sukhoparov, head of the department for regulating
foreign economic activity, said Wednesday that Russia's losses due
to limitations amounted to 1.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"Limitations apply to a wide range of Russian goods, including
fertilizers, textiles, rolling stock and seamless pipes," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are 60 limitations on Russian exports in
world markets, including 49 anti-dumping measures _ 18 of which are
applied by the European Union _ import quotas, licensing and
technical barriers.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, despite the limitations, the Ministry had
managed to safeguard some of its interests. Russia had gained five
billion U.S. dollars from overcoming limitations on Russian
exports between 1992-1997.
</P>
<P>
Sukhoparov also claimed a special agency was needed for
coordinating moves in trade disputes to support Russian exporters.
</P>
<P>
He said Moscow would consistently protect its exporters'
interests in talks with the World Trade Organization and the
European Union.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Parliament to Dissolve </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho parliament will
be dissolved at this weekend to pave the way for political
parties to campaign for the country's third democratic elections
on May 23, a report reaching here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,400 polling stations will be set up throughout the
hilly country for the elections, the Independent Electoral
Commission said.
</P>
<P>
Monyane Moleleki, deputy secretary-general of the ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD), said the thrust of the
party's election campaign would focus on social security, job
creation, education and the economy.
</P>
<P>
The LCD's former leader, 79-year-old Prime Minister Ntsu
Mokhehle has declared himself unavailable for re-election. He
declined re-election to the party leadership, citing ill-health
and old age.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili, who filled the
position of party leaders, and his deputy, Foreign Minister
Kelebone Maope, are expected to contest the premiership.
</P>
<P>
It was generally believed that poverty, unemployment, crime
and the government's intention to prevent religious groups from
playing a role in education will be among the issues opposition
parties will raise during the coming election campaign.
</P>
<P>
The main parties contesting the election are the LCD, the
Basutoland Congress Party, Marematlou Freedom Party, the Basotho
National Party (BNP), the National Progressive Party and the
Sefate Democratic Union.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho held the first democratic elections in 1965, which was
won by the Basotho National Party. The BNP formed a government
led by prime minister Leabua Jonathan after the country gained
independence from Britain in October 1966.
</P>
<P>
The first post-independence elections took place in January
1970, but the BNP refused to relinquish power to the Basutoland
Congress party when it was defeated at the polls.
</P>
<P>
Jonathan ruled Lesotho until January 1986, when he was toppled
in a military coup led by Major General Justine Lekhanya Metsing.
</P>
<P>
The Lesotho Military Council ruled for about seven years
before calling an election on March 27, 1993 and handing the
reins of power to the winning Basutoland Congress Party, which
split last year when the majority of its MPs formed the Lesotho
Congress for Democracy and declared themselves the government.

HARARE, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Home Affairs Minister Dumiso
Dabengwa told parliament Wednesday that the Zimbabwean police
will soon be receiving a consignment of 1,500 vehicles procured

<P>
He was responding to a question on the state of transport and
on whether the police had made provision in the current budget to

areas.
</P>
<P>
The minister said priority would be given to rural police
stations.
</P>
<P>
"Once we get the vehicles we will distribute them to the rural
areas," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will ensure that every rural police post receives at least
one Landrover (Britain-made jeep)," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We know that lack of adequate vehicles were causing hardships
for the police resulting in them not reacting in time," the minister
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- China has made
significant progress in health-care services and improved the
national status of people's health, a Chinese delegate told the
United Nations Commission on Population and Development.
</P>
<P>
There are 189,000 different kinds of health-care establishments
with 5,420,000 medical and health personnel, Chinese
Representative Li Honggui said at the on-going general debate on
the national experience in population matters: health and
mortality.
</P>
<P>
The number of hospital beds per 1,000 persons has reached 2.34
while the number of doctors per 1,000 has gone up to 1.58, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Regarding rural health, he said, over 64 percent of the
counties in China have either satisfied or are approaching the
minimum standard set by the Primary Health Care plan.
</P>
<P>
The health-care insurance systems in urban and rural areas have
also been expanded and the government has provided free medical
services to employees working in administrative and institutional
sectors.
</P>
<P>
He added that Chinese enterprises offered health-insurance
coverage to their employees.
</P>
<P>
The planned immunity rate and the vaccine inoculation rate have
reached 85 percent of the townships and measles has declined by
over 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
Besides, a total of 2,957 "Baby-Friendly Hospitals" have been
established.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the world population problem, Li pointed to the fact
that some developed countries have reduced official assistance in
this area, thus failing to keep their promise to increase such
assistance.

<HEADLINE> US Religious Leaders Visit Prison in Lhasa (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Visiting US religious
leaders Rabbi Arthur Schneier, president of the Appeal of
Conscience Foundation, and Archbishop Theodore McCarrick of the
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Newark today toured the main prison of
the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
During their stay in the prison, they talked with two prisoners,
who were nuns before their incarceration.
</P>
<P>
About four o'clock this afternoon, Schneier and his party
arrived at the prison in the northern suburbs of this capital of
the region.
</P>
<P>
The American visitors talked with Norbu, head of the prison
administration, about the prisoners there.
</P>
<P>
Norbu said that the prison was set up in 1960, and it has more
than 600 prisoners now, some 100 of whom were once nuns or lamas.
</P>
<P>
He said that so long as they obey the regulations of the
prison, the prisoners have freedom of belief in religion.
</P>
<P>
McCarrick said that in the United States there are some stories
about prisoners being ill-treated in the prisons in Tibet, and he
asked Norbu what he thought of the stories.
</P>
<P>
Norbu said that the "stories" are after all "stories" and he
suggested that the American guests see the prison for themselves.
</P>
<P>
Schneier and McCarrick visited the prisoners' cells, a recreation
room, a carpet workshop and a classroom building.
</P>
<P>
In the courtyard of the prison, Schneier picked out a prisoner
from a row of inmates and asked what crime he had committed and
how long his sentence was.
</P>
<P>
The prisoner answered that he was sentenced to death with
reprieve for embezzlement.

Norbu explained the meaning of death sentence with reprieve to
the American guests.
</P>
<P>
In the workshop of the prison, scores of inmates were weaving
blankets, with some humming popular songs.
</P>
<P>
"One major aim of making the inmates take part in labor is that
they are expected to learn some skills so that they can earn their
livings after release," Norbu said.
</P>
<P>
In a tidy classroom, scores of inmates were attending classes
taught by a Tibetan teacher. Most of the inmates are illiterate,
so they have to study and raise their educational levels, Norbu
said.
</P>
<P>
The one-hour visit was accompanied by questions and answers
between hosts and guests. After the visit, Schneier and his
companions said they really wanted to see some monks and nuns in
the prison.
</P>
<P>
Two ex-nuns were brought to the American guests. Schneier
inquired about the nunnery they used to belong to, the crimes they
had committed and the lengths of their sentences.
</P>
<P>
One inmate, named Gaisang Zholma, said that she had lived in a
nunnery in a suburban county of Lhasa, and had been sentenced to four
years in prison for harming state security.
</P>
<P>
Asked about their plans after being released, they said they
had not worked out any plans yet.
</P>
<P>
Schneier expressed his gratitude for the cooperation of the
prison authorities and wished them a happy Tibetan New Year.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, in a telephone conversation with
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at 21:30 pm (Beijing
Time) today, said that the agreement reached between the United
Nations (UN) and Iraq has removed the main hurdle to the weapons
inspection issue, marking a key step forward for a peaceful
solution of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Qian told Albright that China is pleased to take note of the
popular welcome and support of the international community for the
agreement.
</P>
<P>
He noted that if the agreement can be ratified by the UN
Security Council a foundation will be laid for the settlement of
the crisis in a peaceful, just and reasonable manner.
</P>
<P>
Albright explained the US stand on the agreement, saying that
the US welcomes the efforts of UN Secretary General Kofi Annan,
but holds that some details of the agreement need to be clarified.
</P>
<P>
She also said that the US hopes for a resolution approved by
the UN Security Council on the matter to ensure complete
implementation of the agreement by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The US is prepared to maintain close contact with the Chinese
side on the issue, she added.
</P>
<P>
Qian said a priority task is for the agreement to be fully
implemented as soon as possible. He also said that the UN Security
Council should discuss how to implement the agreement.
</P>
<P>
It is important that the five permanent members of the UN
Security Council continue to keep in agreement with each other in
a constructive way as regards this issue, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
China hopes that Iraq will strictly carry out the agreement and
fully implement the relevant UN resolutions so as to create
conditions for an early discussion on lifting sanctions against
Iraq, Qian said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Pct Growth for German Economy in 1998: Industry Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The German economy would grow by
a real 3 percent this year despite the effect of the economic
turmoil in Asia on the country's exports, the German Commerce of
Industry and Trade (DIHT) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The influential organization made the forecast after a survey
of 25,000 German firms for its annual spring report.
</P>
<P>
It said Germany's gross domestic product this year would have a
real growth of about 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
"(Germany's) upswing is winning in depth and breadth and the
main supporting pillar remains exports," said DIHT director Franz
Schoser.
</P>
<P>
The DIHT survey showed only a limited number of German
companies exporting goods to the Asian countries -- Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and South Korea -- are
suffering from the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
However, Schoser cautioned that the potential threat to German
exports would be the cheaper goods from these Asian countries,
which might reduce Germany's share in markets in China, Japan and
North America.

<P>
LHASA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Residents of this capital of
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region, celebrated this evening
the arrival of the new year by the traditional Tibetan calendar
with bonfires and fireworks.
</P>
<P>
Today is December 29 by the Tibetan calendar, when Tibetans
traditionally start their celebration of the New Year. Usually
they first have a family reunion dinner at home, and then go out
in the streets to drive all evils and ghosts away with torches and
firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
At eight o'clock in the evening the deafening sound of
firecrackers erupted, and the sky was lit up by colorful fireworks.
</P>
<P>
Lhasa residents, carrying torches in their hands, gathered at
the street intersections near their houses and lit bonfires, which
they believe can expel evil spirits and bring about good fortune
in the new year.
</P>
<P>
The three-member family of Cering Norbu was the first to reach
the crossroads near the square in the center of Lhasa, right at
the foot of the Potala Palace, the symbol of Lhasa, where they
jubilantly set off fireworks and kept on shouting to the
passers-by: "Happy New Year and good luck!".

Cering said that his family last year earned more than 100,000
yuan (12,000 US dollars) by running a store, and it is now leading
a much better life than before.
</P>
<P>
"We hope our business will get even better in the new year," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Dundrub, a beef vendor from Nagqu Prefecture in northern Tibet,
traveled to Lhasa to join the New Year celebrations. Since last
September his hometown has been stricken by the worst blizzards in
Tibet in decades, and half of the livestock kept by his family has
been frozen or starved to death.
</P>
<P>
"Though we had bad luck last year, I'm sure that the situation
will turn better quickly, especially with the care and assistance
of the government," he said, smiling and busy letting off
fireworks.
</P>
<P>
There were also quite a few people of the Han nationality
joining the Tibetan people in the festivities this evening.
</P>
<P>
"I have lived in Lhasa for eight years and made a lot of
Tibetan friends. I'm here to extend festival greetings to them,"
said a young Han man named Wang Mingxiang.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon's Computer Networks Attacked by Hackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Defense Department
said Wednesday that its unclassified computer networks had been
subjected to "fairly heavy cyber attacks" in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
It was the most organized and systematic attack the Pentagon
had seen to date, John Hamre, deputy secretary of defense, told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Hamre said that the event had "all the appearances of a game"
and apparently was perpetrated by "a small number of individuals."
</P>
<P>
He said the attacks appeared to be directed at unclassified
information, such as personnel records or payroll matters and
they were widespread and modestly sophisticated.
</P>
<P>
But they did not appear to be connected with the ongoing Iraq
crisis, Hamre said. The apparent hackers attempted to enter
networks handled by all the military service branches.
</P>
<P>
"All the services had penetration to some degree," the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Department has been trying to update its defenses
against such attacks in the last few years, but Hamre said, "We
have to do a good deal more in this area."
</P>
<P>
Hamre said Pentagon officials suspected the Pentagon was not
the only institution under attack and that networks in the private
sector also might have been subject to hacking.
</P>
<P>
The deputy defense chief said it was a major "wake-up call" on
the vulnerability of sensitive information in government and
corporate computers.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government to develop a monitoring program and
a network of contacts so that the government can more quickly
verify such attacks and identify the perpetrators.

BONN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Germany's electronic giant
Siemens Wednesday announced that it would build the largest
biomass-based power plant in Europe, which would be entirely
fueled by wood scraps.
</P>

million U.S. dollars), was given by the Dutch electricity company
PNEM for the turnkey facility to be built near Eindhoven.
</P>
<P>
The plant is planned to begin operation in 1999. It would burn
250,000 tons of wood shavings a year to produce 25 megawatts

<HEADLINE> UNITA Still Raiding Govt Institutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Despite the repeated warnings,
the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA),
is still building up its troops and attacking government
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The government warned Tuesday that Angola risked sliding back
into civil war with the escalation of armed raids by UNITA
ex-fighters in some parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Local media reported that UNITA military men killed two
policemen in central Angola's Huambo Province in an assault at
the police headquarters there early Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The military men also took away two rifles and some cattle.
</P>
<P>
UNITA military men also set fire on the pro-government
farmers' houses at Catavola Town in the province and create
horrors in the area.
</P>
<P>
In another incident, UNITA men attacked one village in
Benguela Province Sunday. They killed two men, raped women and
took some hostages after looting.
</P>
<P>
It is said that about 360 UNITA men were gathering in
Bailundo, one of the two UNITA headquarters, ready to recapture
Chicuma and Casseque towns they had formerly controlled.
</P>
<P>
An Unknown number of UNITA troops are gathering in its
controlled Districts to rehabilitate the former UNITA military
bases as is reported by local media.
</P>
<P>
UNITA still has a significant number of at least 5,000
soldiers who are prepared to resume hostilities, a government
official asserted.
</P>
<P>
Along with these killings and lootings, UNITA is busy
recruiting new members for its army. Everyday some young men are
reportedly taken by force into the UNITA troops to transport
ammunition for its military bases in the central part of the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A consortium involving
Rolls-Royce and two other partners has won a 25 million pound (50
million U.S. dollar) contract in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The contract to provide the 500/150kv Pedan substation and
Ungaran to Pedan 500kv transmission lines has been won by the
Rolls-Royce Indonesian business group Dwipanggi Sakti Phma and
KEC, part of the RPG Group in India.
</P>
<P>
The contract, which also includes 75km of 500kv single-circuit
overhead line and 6km of 150kv four-circuit overhead line, was
awarded by the Indonesian electrical utility PLN, Rolls-Royce
announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 500kv system will be in operation in early 1999 to connect
major parts of PLN's existing 500kv network, ensuring efficient
use of the new power sources as they come on stream.
</P>
<P>
The consortium will supply the equipment including Royrolle
500kv circuit breakers with closing resistors and Peebles
transformers.
</P>
<P>
The Pedan substation will be the second supplied to PLN by
Rolls-Royce. The first was at Samarinda to be linked to a 60mw
power station now being completed.
</P>
<P>
Stan Jones, Rolls-Royce transmission &AMP; distribution managing
director, said, "Our success is largely due to our working as part
of an Indonesia-based business consortium. This new project
confirms the status of Rolls-Royce as a key supplier to PLN."

<HEADLINE> British Prime Minister to Visit Middle East in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair, whose country is the current European Union (EU) president,
is planning to visit the Middle East in an effort to give Europe a
higher profile in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office source said Wednesday that Blair will
visit Israel, Palestine and Egypt in April in a bid to show Arab
states that the EU countries seek justice for Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"The UK presidency of the EU will thereby try to give Europe a
higher profile in the Middle East peace process," the source said.
"Lack of progress in the Middle East peace process should never
give Saddam Hussein an excuse to break U.N. Security Council
resolutions."
</P>
<P>
Paving the way for Blair's Middle East tour, British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook will visit the Middle East in mid-March, the
source added.
</P>
<P>
Political commentators said that EU diplomacy alone is unlikely
to end the current stalemate between Israel and the Palestinians,
but it could help spur the United States into renewing its own
mediation efforts.

<HEADLINE> Burundi: Military Court Sets Ex-ruler Bagaza Free </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A Burundian military court
Wednesday freed former President Jean-Baptists Bagaza, saying it
did not have the authority to judge him and others accused of
plotting to topple the government of Pierre Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. humanitarian information unit IRIN said in a press
release that the war council, a military court established by
Buyoya, opened the so-called "Bagaza file" last Friday, but the
council's competence was immediately challenged by the defense.
</P>
<P>
Bagaza refused to appear at the initial hearing because,
according to a source close to him, "as a former head of state,
it is his right to be tried only by the supreme court."
</P>
<P>
Eight other people, including soldiers and a senior
magistrate, were accused of plotting with Bagaza to overthrow
Buyoya in March last year.
</P>
<P>
Bagaza had been under house arrest since then without any
telephone links and few visitors, but was released on bail
pending the supreme court appearance.
</P>
<P>
Bagaza, head of the mostly ethnic Tutsi Parena Party, was
toppled by Buyoya in a 1987 coup. Buyoya later handed power to
an elected rival, but was reinstalled as military ruler after
another coup in July 1996.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Humanitarian Staff Return to Baghdad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- About eighty U.N.
humanitarian staff who pulled out of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad
last week to escape the threatened U.S. and British military
strikes are going back to work, U.N. officials here said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Staff are from the U.N. humanitarian office in Baghdad. Between
50 and 60 of nearly 400 personnel belonging to the office left for
Jordan and autonomous northern Iraq late last week.
</P>
<P>
They will drive back Thursday in view of the successful peace
mission to Iraq by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, the
officials said.

Annan, who clinched a deal Monday to defuse a row over U.N.
weapons inspections in Iraq, retuned to the U.N. headquarters in
New York Tuesday, receiving a hero's welcome by hundreds of U.N.
officials and staff members.
</P>

BAGHDAD, February 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. weapons inspectors
Wednesday continued their work of monitoring and searching for
banned weapons in Iraq, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Husam Mohammed Ameen, director general of Iraqi

</P>
<P>
A UNSCOM team in charge of maintaining monitoring cameras
made routine visits of those monitoring instruments in two sites
outside Baghdad, Ameen said.
</P>
<P>
He said that a technical team of International Atomic Energy

team arrived in Baghdad early this month to examine the file of
nuclear weapons.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Refuses to Meet British </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash has said that he will not meet British special envoy for
Cyprus David Hannay who will arrive here Thursday for talks
with two Cypriot communities on the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot press Wednesday quoted Denktash as saying
that he will not meet Hannay in protest against Britain's
decision last month to introduce visas for Turkish Cypriots who
want to visit Britain.
</P>
<P>
London has said the measure was taken after increasing cases
of Turkish Cypriots asking for political asylum in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Hannay is expected to have meetings with Cyprus President
Glafcos Clerides and Foreign Minister Ioanuis Kasoulides on Friday
morning, which will focus on the Turkish Cypriot participation in
the European Union (EU) accession talks with Cyprus due to start
at the end of March.
</P>
<P>
A British Foreign Office spokesman Monday expressed regret
over Denktash's unwillingness to see the British envoy on this
occasion.
</P>
<P>
"The EU wants the Turkish Cypriots to have a real say in the
accession talks and Mr. Denktash, the Turkish Cypriot leader, has
a crucial role to play," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Denktash, however, said he would not meet with any EU
officials.
</P>
<P>
He warned that unless his breakaway state in northern Cyprus
is recognized, the Cyprus problem could not be solved.
</P>
<P>
Denktash's positions on the Cyprus issue were hardened after
the EU summit in Luxembourg last December reaffirmed its decision
to start accession talks with the Cypriot government in late March.
</P>
<P>
The decision was rejected by Denktash who insisted that Cyprus
can not join the EU before its problem is resolved.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriot leader has suspended bicommunal activities
and contacts with the Cypriot government since last December in
retaliation for the EU decision, and further threatened to seek
union with Turkey if the EU membership talks proceed as planned.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops landed and took over the northern third of the island
following an abortive pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" in northern part of the island,
which was only recognized by Turkey.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Wednesday
released here over 80 names of the leaders of the former rebel
UNITA movement to be subjected to the U.N. sanction.
</P>
<P>
The sanction decided in October 1997, is a follow-up action
the U.N. has taken against the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The UNITA leaders and their relatives are not allowed to
travel abroad under the U.N. sanction. And all UNITA offices
oversea are to be closed in accordance with the sanction.
</P>
<P>
UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi tops the list, with UNITA Vice
Chairman Antonio Dembo and UNITA General Secretary Paulo Lukamba
Gato following.
</P>
<P>
Altino Sapalalo, a famous UNITA military leader, Horacio
Junjuvili, the deputy representative of UNITA delegation at the
joint committee of the Angolan peace process, and UNITA
secretaries for foreign affairs and Information, are also in the
list.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. decision makes it clear that those who have become
members of Angola's National Assembly and the government of
National unity and reconciliation are excluded in the list.
</P>
<P>
The United Nation decided to impose further sanction on UNITA
as it fails to cooperate with the Angolan government in carrying
out the 1994 Lusaka Peace Protocol ending the civil war in
Angola.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus, Greece Agree on Concerted Diplomatic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The foreign ministries of
Greece and Cyprus decided here Wednesday to undertake an
international campaign to promote their positions regarding the
Cyprus issue and Cyprus' European Union (EU) accession course.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced following talks between the two
Foreign Ministries' delegations headed by Cypriot Foreign
Minister Ioanuis Kasoulides and Greek Foreign Under-Secretary
Yiannos Kranidiotis respectively.
</P>
<P>
The talks were held in view of anticipated renewed efforts for
a Cyprus settlement and the start of EU accession talks next
month.
</P>
<P>
"We decided to revitalize our working groups, which deal with
the Cyprus problem and Cyprus' accession course, to study issues
arising from the membership talks," Kranidiotis said.
</P>
<P>
Both Kasoulides and Kranidiotis stressed that EU accession
talks with the government of Cyprus will open on March 30-31 and
said this fact can not be questioned.
</P>
<P>
They also reiterated that Turkish Cypriots are welcome to
participate in the EU talks, provided they are part of the
official delegation and there is no recognition of the illegal
regime unilaterally established in northern Cyprus in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said a formula for the participation of Turkish
Cypriots will be worked out before the accession talks begin
after consultations with the Greek-Cypriot political party
leaders, the Greek government and EU officials.
</P>
<P>
"We would like to see our invitation to the Turkish Cypriots
accepted and have them with us in the negotiating team," the
Cypriot minister added.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit last December reaffirmed its decision to start
membership talks with Cyprus in late March, a move angrily
rejected by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
But the EU is working on a formula for Turkish Cypriot
participation in the accession talks.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Cyprus problem, the Greek official said there
is convergence of views between the two governments and added "we
decided on the tactics and the policy we shall follow."
</P>
<P>
Conditions for an immediate and concerted international effort
in support of the U.N. efforts exist, he said, noting that all
those who wish to assist the U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
should direct their attention to Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis pointed out, however, that the Greek government
fully backs a proposal put forward by President Glafcos Clerides
in 1993 for the demilitarization of the island.
</P>
<P>
On the relations between Greece and Turkey, he stressed that
they "cannot be normalized unless there is a solution to the
Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis pointed out that Greece wants to improve relations
with Turkey, which must be based on international law and
conventions.
</P>
<P>
Kranidiotis, who arrived in Cyprus Tuesday night, had a
meeting with Clerides Wednesday morning, during which he
congratulated Clerides on his re-election for a second five-year
term and conveyed to him an invitation by Greek Prime Minister,
Costas Simitis, to visit Athens on March 10.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Business Spending to Reach Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Canadian business spending for
plant and equipment is expected to reach a record high of 120.1
billion dollars (84 billion U.S. dollars) this year, up 5.5
percent over 1997.
</P>
<P>
Investment plans for 1998 show growth coming from both
investments in machinery and equipment and non-residential
construction, Statistics Canada said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Servicing-producing industries are expected to account for 55
percent of the total increase in investment, with goods-producing
industries accounting for the remaining portion," the statistics
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Investment in machinery and equipment is expected to be higher
across many industries with chemical, railways, electric power and
banking leading the growth.
</P>
<P>
Spending for building and engineering assets will post the
strongest year-over-year increase in four years, spurred largely
by petroleum and gas, electric power and pipeline companies.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, housing investment should top 41.1 billion
dollars, 41 percent above the 1995 level.
</P>
<P>
Canada's spending boom is being fueled by low interest rates,
strong exports, soaring business profits and near record use of
available facilities, the agency added.

<P>
The new company, in which Commercial Union will have 53.6
percent of the whole shares and General Accident 46.4 percent,
will be called CGU and have its headquarters in London.
</P>
<P>
The merger will produce a company with strong market positions
in Britain, continental Europe, North America and the Asia Pacific
and a growing presence in a number of emerging markets.
</P>
<P>
Bob Scott, chief executive of the new company, said that
negotiations had been going on for "a couple of months." The deal
was a "meeting of minds," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, the announcement of the merger caught many in the
industry by surprise, despite persistent rumors that more deals
were likely in the insurance industry following Royal Insurance
and Sun Alliance's 6 billion pound merger in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The merger, which is conditional on shareholder and regulatory
approval is expected to be implemented around the end of June.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Staff Will Not Give Up to Threats: U.N. Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- United Nations staff
will not give up to threats when performing their missions for
peace and progress, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the meeting on the security and independence
of the international civil service, the first of its kind in U.N.
history, Annan said U.N. staff "will continue to rise to the
challenges placed before them."
</P>
<P>
"Let us do our utmost to ensure that staff have the
independence and protection to which they are entitled and which
they deserve," he added.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that before 1992, security was not a major issue
with the U.N. personnel. Killing of non-military staff was almost
unheard, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, since then violence in many conflict zones
has been aimed deliberately at civilians with a total of 219 U.N.
civilian staff killed.
</P>
<P>
"Since 1994, another brazen violation of civilized norms --
hostage-taking -- has become a new threat: 130 staff members have
been held in 43 separate incidents," Annan added.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 12 months, 22 civilian and 43 military staff
members lost their lives in the the performance of their duties
and the fate of another 50 detained or missing throughout the
world is still unknown, U.N. data show.
</P>
<P>
Annan urged those governments where the U.N. personnel are
stationed to take serious protection measures according to the
U.N. Charter.

<HEADLINE> U.N.: Africa, Major Supplier of Cannabis, Cannabis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Despite some
eradication efforts and significant seizures in some countries in
Africa, the region remains a major supplier of cannabis and
cannabis resin to domestic illicit markets and to Europe, a U.N.
report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report of the International Narcotics Control Board for
1997, released here Wednesday, said cannabis from Africa has also
been finding its way to North America.
</P>
<P>
The report said several seaports and airports in Africa have
become major transit centers for cocaine from South Africa
destined for Europe and for heroin from Asia destined for Europe
and North America.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse is on the increase, particularly in big cities in
Africa, the report said. Cannabis remains the main drug of abuse.
The abuse of psychotropic substances has been reported in a number
of countries.
</P>
<P>
The abuse of cocaine and heroin has emerged mainly in the
proximity of seaports used by illicit traffickers for the
trans-shipment of those drugs, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The report said the medical consumption levels of narcotic
drugs and psychotropic substances are low in most countries in the
region. According to the board, there is a need to increase the
quantities of such drugs and substances to be made available to
meet medical needs.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Chief Urges Haiti to Move Forward in Judicial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Wednesday strongly urged the Haitian authorities to
move forward urgently in the area of judicial reform and called on
the international community to provide necessary assistance in
that regard.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council of the United
Nations, the U.N. secretary-general said the international
community is deeply concerned that Haiti is still without a
functioning government after more than eight months.
</P>
<P>
Annan said not only does the political impasse have
consequences for the economic and social development of a country
in dire need of economic relief, it also jeopardizes the
consolidation of democracy and seriously compromises international
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief reiterated his appeal to the Haitian authorities
and political leaders to negotiate an end to the crisis, including
the electoral dispute in a spirit of tolerance and reconciliation,
with a view to reaching an agreement that will allow their country
to start moving again towards democracy.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the Haitian national police continues to make steady
progress. Nevertheless, the absence of a functioning judicial
system severely hinders its ability to carry out its tasks and to
ensure the prosecution of those officers who do not conduct
themselves properly, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. secretary-general stressed a respected and effective
judicial system is one cornerstone of a functioning democracy.

<P>
TEHRAN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister
Lamberto Dini is expected to arrive here next Saturday to pay an
official visit, kicking off ministerial contacts between the
European Union (EU) and Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi announced
Wednesday that the visit will take place at the invitation of
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted Mohammadi as
saying that Dini will discuss with Iranian officials regional and
international issues and the prospects for Iran's cooperation with
the EU as well as bilateral relations in political, economic and
cultural areas.
</P>
<P>
The EU Monday decided to resume contacts with Iran at
ministerial level, which was banned last April after a German
court rule had accused Iranian leaders of sponsoring state
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi Tuesday voiced Tehran's welcome to the EU decision,
saying that Iran is always interested in having relations with all
countries based on mutual respect.

<HEADLINE> PNA Urges US to Save Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States should
exert its new efforts to revive the Middle East peace process and
bring it back on the right track, said an advisor to Palestinian
President Yasser Arafat in Gaza Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rodaineh, information advisor to Arafat, told the
Voice of Palestine radio that the meetings between the
Palestinians and Israelis on reviving the peace process have
produced nothing.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Chief Negotiator Saeb Erekat and Israeli Cabinet
Secretary Danny Naveh held a round of talks in Tel Aviv Tuesday
night on issues of Gaza seaport, airport and the safe passage
between the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, but no substantial
progress was made. This was the third round of talks in a week.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Rodaineh urged the United States to pressure Israel
to implement the agreements signed with the PNA as what the
Washington did to Iraq, criticizing U.S. leaders for applying
double standards in the two cases.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials on Tuesday also rejected a proposal made
by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday night to
hold an isolated, Camp David-style summit at which Palestinian and
Israeli officials would hammer out the issues at hand until an
agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
Erekat has said the PNA would only agree to such a proposal
after Israel carries out the three-phase withdrawal from the West
Bank as agreed upon before.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Israeli peace group "Peace Now"
held a protest at the grave site of the Israeli murderer Baruch
Goldstein in Hebron Wednesday, calling on the Israeli government
to continue the stalled negotiations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Goldstein went on his murderous rampage in the
Machoela Cave in Hebron, killing 29 people.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, residents of Qalandia Refugee Camp near the
West Bank town Ramallah clashed with Israeli troops and six
refugees were wounded by bullets fired by the Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The refugees were protesting against the sealing-off by Israeli
soldiers of the main entrance to the refugee camp.

<HEADLINE> E. African Countries Pledge to Co-operate in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda
Tuesday pledged to co-operate in the fight against drug crime in
order to combat increasing drug trafficking and abuse in East
African region, according to a Kenya News Agency report Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The pledge was made at the end of the Fourth Operational
Meeting held by chiefs of Criminal Investigations Departments of
the three East African countries in Nyeri, about 170 kilometers
northeast of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
At the two-day meeting concluded Tuesday, the three countries
decided to conduct joint cannabis eradication and interdiction
operations along the common borders.
</P>
<P>
The three member states will continue to exchange information
and intelligence on drug trafficking, and to do risk analysis of
passengers, parcels and containers.
</P>
<P>
According to resolutions adopted at the meeting, a protocol on
combating drug trafficking and abuse will be drawn up to seek
increased cooperation among the three countries.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Noah arap Too, Director of Kenyan Criminal
Investigations Department, said that Kenya is a transit point for
heroin, cocaine and mandrax.
</P>
<P>
Koli Lue Kouame, Regional Representative of the United Nations
Drug Control Program, told the meeting that Kenya was the center
of the drugs trade in the region owing to its geographical
location.
</P>
<P>
He said that drug barons preferred Kenya as "a port of call"
because it is approachable by sea and has a big tourism industry
and a lucrative market for phamaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. official pointed out that Kenya's air links with
India and Dubai had accelerated the illegal drug trade.

<HEADLINE> AL Hails Baghdad Accord Victory for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Arab League permanent delegate
to the U.N. Hussein Hassounah said Wednesday that the U.N.-Iraq
deal signed in Baghdad on Monday is actually "a victory for peace
and stability in the Mideast."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Voice of Arabs Radio over
telephone from New York, Hassounah credited the signing of the
agreement on weapons inspection to good offices of the world
community in pursuit of peace.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement came as a result of endeavors by several
parties as well as the intensive contacts conducted by (Egyptian)
President Hosni Mubarak with the Iraqi leadership along with a
number of Arab and European countries," said the Arab diplomat.
</P>
<P>
The agreement signed by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz is designed to bring about
Iraqi compliance with the U.N. Security Council resolutions and
avert imminent U.S. military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The success of Annan's mission in Baghdad has accentuated the
importance of the U.N.'s role in settling disputes through
peaceful means while securing the implementation of
U.N. resolutions, Hassounah said.
</P>
<P>
"This raises hopes in the future that the United Nations will
work for implementing similar resolutions on the Palestinian cause
and the Mideast peace process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hassounah also stressed the need to adopt objective and
clear-cut measures instead of double-standards in dealing with
international affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Iraq crisis has dented the peacemaking efforts on
Palestinian-Israeli track that has been deadlocked since last
March due to Israel's construction of new Jewish settlements in
Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. failure to kick start the peace talks is widely blamed
on its bias toward Israel.

<HEADLINE> WFP Succeeds in Delivering Relief Food to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) said Tuesday that it had succeeded in delivering relief
food by road to Northern Bahr El Ghazal, Southern Sudan, and
would send more road convoys with food to the region.
</P>
<P>
In a press release issued here Tuesday, WFP said that the
first trucks with 120 tons of sorghum arrived in Mapel area on
Sunday after a three-week journey of 900 kilometers rough and
broken roads.
</P>
<P>
The release noted that WFP planned to take advantage of the
remaining four to five weeks of dry season weather to send more
convoys of trucks with food to needy areas in Southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
WFP estimates that 75,350 tons of emergency food aid would be
required in 1998 for 2.4 million war and drought-affected
civilians in the region, mainly women, children and the elderly.
</P>
<P>
The release quoted David Fletcher, Head of WFP's Southern
Sudan Operation and Deputy Coordinator for Operation Lifeline
Sudan (OLS), as saying that "the situation is still serious
because only one-quarter of the population in Northern Bahr El
Ghazal can be reached by road".
</P>
<P>
On February 4, the Sudanese government suspended flights by
OLS relief agencies to Bahr El Ghazal where 100,000 people have
been displaced by recent fighting in the areas and are in urgent
need of food and other relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
Surveys conducted by U.N. agencies in late 1997 show that
hundreds of thousands of Sudanese will be unable to survive
without food aid, especially during the food deficit period from
April to August this year.
</P>
<P>
As Sudan enters its 15th year of civil war, more than four
million people living in the south will require outside help just
for keeping alive, said U.N. relief agencies at a joint press
conference held here last week.

<HEADLINE> 73 Zambian Coup Suspects Appear in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Seventy-three suspects who are
allegedly involved in last October's foiled military coup in
Zambia and jointly charged with treason appeared before a Lusaka
magistrate Wednesday, according to Zambia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
It was alleged that the suspects plotted to overthrow the
government of President Frederick Chiluba by "unlawful" means
between June 1995 and October 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Magistrate Gertrude Chawatama took about an hour to read the
charge and the various overt acts. And seven local languages were
used to interpret the charge to the accused who said that they
understood it.
</P>
<P>
The case was adjourned to March 11 and the accused, said
Chawatama, will appear before her every 14 days for mention while
awaiting to be committed to the high court.
</P>
<P>
However, State Prosecutor John Katongo told court he is still
waiting for instructions from the director of public prosecutions
on when to commit the accused to the high court.
</P>
<P>
The accused appeared in court Tuesday but the charges could
not be read to them because they were taken late, said Times of
Zambia published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The number of suspects allegedly involved in the coup and so
far charged with treason is 76, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The subsequent arrests following last year's foiled coup has
reached 97, among whom are former president and opposition leader
Kenneth Kaunda, another opposition leader Dean Mung'omba and
Nakatindi Wina, parliament member and chairperson of the women
affairs of the ruling Movement for Multi-party Movement.

UNITED NATIONS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The level of drug abuse
is different in each of the three countries in North America, a
report of the International Narcotics Control Board said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report released here Wednesday said that the last-month
prevalence of illicit drug abuse is highest in the United States,
6 percent, and lowest in Mexico, 0.45 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the abuse of cannabis, cocaine, heroin
and lysergic acid diethylamide among youth appears to be slightly
increasing in Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The board also said that in the United States amongst teenagers
the perception of cocaine being a risky drug is diminishing,
therefore the board believes that there is a real future danger of
increased cocaine abuse among youth.
</P>
<P>
Despite significant seizures, cocaine and heroin continue to be
smuggled on a large scale through the territory of Mexico, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The report added methamphetamine continues to be clandestinely
manufactured in Mexico and the United States and abused in Canada

NICOSIA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' Cabinet Wednesday
held its last meeting during which the eleven ministers submitted
their resignations to President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the meeting, government spokesman Manolis
Christofides said the new cabinet will give its affirmation to

Clerides, who was re-elected for a second five-year term in

<P>
The report released here Wednesday said that the last-month
prevalence of illicit drug abuse is highest in the United States,
6 percent, and lowest in Mexico, 0.45 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the abuse of cannabis, cocaine, heroin
and lysergic acid diethylamide among youth appears to be slightly
increasing in Canada and the United States.
</P>
<P>
The board also said that in the United States amongst teenagers
the perception of cocaine being a risky drug is diminishing,
therefore the board believes that there is a real future danger of
increased cocaine abuse among youth.
</P>
<P>
Despite significant seizures, cocaine and heroin continue to be
smuggled on a large scale through the territory of Mexico, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The report added methamphetamine continues to be clandestinely
manufactured in Mexico and the United States and abused in Canada
and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Norway Praised for Supporting S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela on Wednesday spoke highly of Norway's support in
the struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
In a banquet in honor of visiting Norwegian King Harald and
Queen Sonya in Cape Town, Mandela said South Africa would never
forget the selfless support and unstinting generosity of the
Norwegian people during the struggle against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the royal couple, who are on their first state visit
to South Africa, were received with the customary pomp and
ceremony, including a 21-gun salute, as a host of South African
cabinet ministers and deputy ministers looked on.
</P>
<P>
King Harald also received South Africa's highest honor for
visiting head of state, the Order of Good Hope, in a private
ceremony at Mandela's Cape Town office, Tuynhuys.
</P>
<P>
A major business delegation led by Norwegian Trade Minister
Lars Sponheim is joining the royal visit.
</P>
<P>
Norway has been giving South Africa about 80 million Rand (16
million U.S. Dollars) a year in aid since before the landmark all
-race elections in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian diplomats said King Harald's visit marked the end of
Norway's anti-apartheid support and the start of a "new era" of
bilateral cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Germany's Warning Over Hofer's Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Iran Wednesday rejected a
warning by German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel that the
improvement of Bonn-Tehran relations would depend on the fate of
a German national sentenced to death in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi said the
case of German citizen Helmut Hofer was a judicial one and had
nothing to do with bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted Mohammadi as
saying that Hofer was found guilty of violating Iranian laws and
the legal proceedings took place with his rights fully observed.
</P>
<P>
Hofer was arrested in Iran last September and was sentenced to
death for having sexual relations with an Iranian Muslim
woman. Iranian laws ban sexual relations between a Muslim woman
and a non-Muslim man.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel Tuesday warned that Hofer's execution would cast a
large shadow over relationship between Germany and Iran. His
warning came one day after the European Union announced to lift
the 10-month ban on ministerial contacts with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi expressed "surprise at Kinkel's attempt to politicize
Hofer's case," saying that this would not help provide a positive
atmosphere for improving bilateral relations, but it could
further complicate the current situation.
</P>
<P>
"The (Iranian) Judiciary has examined Hofer's case beyond
political propaganda and is studying his appeal," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, head of the Iranian Judiciary Ayatollah
Mohammad Yazdi stated that the judicial bodies would review
Hofer's case as the German businessman claimed he has converted
to Islam before having a case with the Iranian woman.
</P>
<P>
Yazdi said that the rule on Hofer might be changed if his
claim was proved by necessary documents.

MOSCOW, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Russia and Iran stand against
laying an oil pipeline on the bottom of the Caspian Sea, visiting

Wednesday.
</P>

After the meeting with Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny

He also called for setting up an economic cooperation
organization of the countries in the region.

<HEADLINE> Mossad Chief's Resignation Triggered by Another </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The resignation of Israeli
spy agency Mossad's head Danny Yatom was triggered off by another
failure of intelligence mission, local media revealed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both Israel Radio and State Television reported that the
unexpected timing of Yatom's resignation was connected to another
operation failure. But due to the sensitivity of the security
issues, no details on the failed operation were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Yatom tendered his resignation letter to Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu Tuesday to take the blame for the failed
assassination attempt against Hamas leader Khaled Mashaal in
Jordan last September.
</P>
<P>
Yatom originally vowed to fight for his job despite the severe
criticism heaped on him by the investigating committee.
</P>
<P>
The Mashaal affair created an international furor, damaging
Israeli relations with Canada, which protested the use of forged
Canadian passports, and more importantly with Jordan, which has
suspended security cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Ciechanover Committee investigating the Mashaal affair
harshly criticized Yatom for some cracks in the planning and
operation of the assassination attempt, but Yatom defended himself
in his resignation letter, saying he could not accept the
committee's findings.
</P>
<P>
The committee unexpectedly cleared Netanyahu of any
responsibility in contrary to the popular speculation. Netanyahu
was the only man who had the final say in giving the go-ahead to
the operation.
</P>
<P>
The Mashaal affair has dealt a serious blow to Mossad, which
was renowned for its prestige in carrying out secret missions
abroad. The public has called for reorganization of the agency,
which plays a crucial role in protecting Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
Yatom's resignation created an uproar in Israeli political
spectrum, as opposition politicians demanded Netanyahu take major
responsibility for the Mashaal affair.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party leader Ehud Barak, who met Netanyahu Wednesday to
discuss the Iraq situation, said Netanyahu should be also
responsible for the failure. Even former prime minister Yitzhak
Shamir placed the top responsibility on Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
But politicians from both the ruling coalition and opposition
agreed that Mossad needs urgent reorganization to repair its
tainted image. Meretz leader Yossi Sarid demanded Netanyahu choose
the new chief according to needs of the agency rather than
political considerations.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Wednesday that he would appoint the new Mossad
chief within a week. Top on the list of candidates are former
deputy Mossad chief Efraim Halevy, former Army intelligence chief
Uri Saguy, head of Army's Northern Command Amiram Levine and
Defense Ministry's Director-General Ilan Biran.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Allies Support Attack on Iraq Next Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States said on
Wednesday its allies would support military action against Iraq if
it reneged on the arms inspection deal reached this week with the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
"If he (Iraqi President Saddam Hussein) reneges on this
agreement..., we have very firm assurances from our friends and
allies...that they will be more supportive of the use of military
force," State Department spokesman James Rubin told reporters.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, U.S. officials said that there were questions and
ambiguities in the agreement, which appears -- temporarily at
least -- to have resolved the crisis over U.N. inspections of
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said the Clinton administration in the last 24 hours had
"received assurances on major points."
</P>
<P>
These included assurances that Richard Butler, the chairman of
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), would remain in charge of
the weapons inspection operation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We're focusing on substance. It's not about the words of an
agreement, it's not about the words of the secretary-general in
characterizing Iraqi views about UNSCOM," he said.
</P>
<P>
"There are no concessions," Rubin said. He said Iraq had
reversed course on paper and the question now was whether it would
reverse course in fact.
</P>
<P>
Assurances from the U.N. chief also include that Butler will
not be reporting to some new political adviser in the
secretary-general's operation.
</P>
<P>
"The relationship between Chairman Butler and the United
Nations Security Council will remain unchanged," said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal signed between Saddam and Annan, senior
diplomats will accompany the inspectors when they conducted the
inspection in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sales of Existing Homes Topple Record in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Stimulating by dropping
mortgage rates, the U.S. sales of existing homes rose 0.7 percent
in January to an all-time high, the National Association of
Realtors said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Existing single-family homes were sold at a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 4.4 million homes last month, up from a revised
4.37 million units sold in December, according to the association.
</P>
<P>
Overall, 1997 registered sale of a total of 4.21 million
previously owned homes, which was the best year on record since
the association began tracking home sales in 1968.
</P>
<P>
Sales are also expected to be strong this year, said R. Layne
Morrill, president of the association. "The outlook is promising.
All the factors are in place: a healthy economy, favorable
mortgage rates and confident consumers," said Morrill.
</P>
<P>
Consumer confidence surged to a 30-year high this month, the
Conference Board reported Tuesday, and mortgage rates in January
edged below 7 percent for only the second time in three decades.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide median price of an existing home was 126,100
dollars in January, up 4.6 percent from a year ago.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
spoke to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan by telephone
on Tuesday night about the agreement Annan signed with Iraq, the
White House said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It was a good conversation and the U.N. chief might come to
Washington next week to meet Clinton, said White House spokesman
Joe Lockhart aboard Air Force One on the way to Florida with the
president.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the U.N.-Iraq deal, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright said on Tuesday there were ambiguities on some of the
procedures for inspecting so-called presidential sites suspected
of housing weapons.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration want to be assured that the new
procedures for inspecting eight presidential sites do not bypass
the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), which is in charge of
scrapping Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"We are still working through some issues, particularly on how
the agreement will be implemented... That will be going on today
in New York," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, Stated Department spokesman James Rubin said the
Clinton administration in the last 24 hours had "received

<HEADLINE> OAU Council of Ministers Meets in Addis Ababa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The 67th ordinary session
of the Council of Ministers of the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) was officially opened Wednesday afternoon at the United
Nations Conference Center here.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
called on Africans to draw lessons from the 1994 genocide in
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the need for us to know about what actually
happened for the genocide to take place and about what went
wrong, becomes not only a moral imperative but an absolute
necessity of major practical import."
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of the establishment of an
international panel of eminent personalities to investigate the
genocide in Rwanda and the surrounding events.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also called on the OAU to ensure the panel
is composed of "truly eminent personalities with the necessary
objectivity, integrity and with the requisite knowledge of the
region as well as with the courage to call a spade a spade".
</P>
<P>
In his statement at the opening ceremony, OAU Secretary
General Salim Ahmed Salim said that the attainment of peace,
security and stability will remain Africa's main preoccupation
and will continue to engage most of Africa's efforts as long as
African continent is torn apart by devastating conflicts, with
the immense suffering they inflict on African peoples.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need to inculcate a culture of peace, to
cultivate a spirit of tolerance and to persevere in Africans'
efforts to promote peaceful solutions to conflicts.
</P>
<P>
After talking on situations in Somalia, Burundi, Comoros and
Sierra Leone, Salim said "it is equally evident that African
countries and our continental organization will, as expected,
continue to play a pivotal role in the search for the solution of
these crisis."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the ceremony, Executive Secretary of the United
Nations Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) K.Y. Amoako said
that Africa's fundamental economic situation continues to
strengthen, but African social progress needs to gain momentum.
</P>
<P>
"Asia's financial problems are not affecting us here, partly
because our ties with global markets are weak yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Africa will reap far greater rewards from
integration in the world economy if Africa's own house is
integrated first.

JOHANNESBURG, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The South African
Communist Party will set up a school to teach Marxist-Leninist
studies, a senior official of the party announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The institution will be built in the country's eastern
province of Mpumalanga in honor of Philip Hadebe, the late leader
of the party and a member of the provincial legislature.
</P>
<P>
Radio of South African Broadcasting Corporation quoted the
party's regional secretary for Mpumalanga, Mudu Mkhoza, as saying
that the school will teach communist doctrines to its members.
</P>
<P>
The school will also analyze government policies and the way
they affect daily lives of ordinary South Africans, using
Marxist-Leninist principles, said the official.
</P>
<P>
He also said the branch executive of the party in Mpumalanga
province will meet Thursday to discuss the program of action.
</P>
<P>
The party is a long-time ally of the ruling African National
Congress, ANC, in the struggle against apartheid, which was
abolished in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The party was banned together with the ANC for its strong
opposition to apartheid.

<HEADLINE> Justice Dept. Reviewing Independent Counsel's Tactics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
is reportedly continuing its review of independent counsel Kenneth
Starr's controversial tactics in probing an alleged relationship
between President Bill Clinton and a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
But any final action by the department in the review will have
to wait on a decision out of federal court, according to United
Press International.
</P>
<P>
Chief U.S. District Court Judge Norma Holloway Johnson has not
yet ruled on a motion by Clinton's lawyer that Starr be sanctioned
for alleged leaks out of his office.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's lawyer David Kendall filed the sealed motion earlier
this month. Attorneys for former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky said earlier they would do the same but have since
declined to confirm any secret filing.
</P>
<P>
Any decision by Johnson would probably not be made public.
Grand jury proceedings and most court actions affecting them are
generally kept secret.
</P>
<P>
Starr is using a federal grand jury to investigate whether
President Clinton urged Lewinsky to lie under oath about a
purported affair.
</P>
<P>
Leaks to the media about the grand jury process by personnel in
Starr's office -- if they occurred -- would be a violation of the
Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and leave prosecutors open to
a contempt citation.
</P>
<P>
While Attorney General Janet Reno cannot interfere with Starr's
investigation she has the power under the Independent Counsel Act
to fire Starr for "cause."
</P>
<P>
So far, Representative John Conyers, a ranking Democrat on the
House Judiciary Committee, and Senator Robert Torricelli, a
Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, have demanded that
Reno investigate Starr under the authority of the Independent
Counsel Act for a number of alleged improprieties to determine
whether he should be fired.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky's lawyers made a separate request to the Justice
Department's Office of Professional Responsibility earlier this
month for an investigation under the Ethics in Government Act.
</P>
<P>
The attorneys' letter accuses Starr of "abuse of power" and
demands that Starr and his principal prosecutors undergo polygraph
tests concerning the alleged leaks "in order to ferret out the
truth."

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Takes over S. Leone's Second Largest City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping
force known as ECOMOG announced another major victory in Sierra
Leone after the capture of the country's second largest city Bo
in the south.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG chief of staff Brig.-gen. Abdul One Mohammed said in
the Monrovia headquarters the Nigerian-led sub-regional force "is
in control" of Bo and welcomed by local residents.
</P>
<P>
According to him, ECOMOG troops, which sacked the military
junta in the capital Freetown two weeks ago, began to move to Bo
from Kenema in the east on Monday and consolidated their
positions there by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are now trying to clear all the dead roads coming into
Bo," he said, quoted by the British Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"Our intention is to open the roads immediately so that
economic life in Bo will return to normalcy."
</P>
<P>
The general said his troops did not encounter much resistance
from the remnants of the junta troops and their allied rebel
fighters of the Revolutionary United Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
"All that we have found are burnt houses and barracks," he
said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, so many people in Bo have run away during
the occupation of the junta forces and their rebel allies.
</P>
<P>
The general assured the thousands of people in Bo will enjoy
security under ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
He said the defeated junta forces and RUF rebels had fled into
the hinterlands in the west and north, where ECOMOG troops will
move as their next destinations.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was sent to Sierra Leone in the wake of the coup that
toppled the elected government last May. It took over Freetown on
February 12 and is preparing ground for the return of the exiled
government.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Gulf Deployment Costs Grow to 600 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
already spent more than 600 million U.S. dollars on the U.S.
military buildup near Iraq and the costs are growing, the Pentagon
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The cost "just for actions through today and the mobilization
is well over 600 million dollars," Deputy Defense Secretary John
Hamre told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The United States has substantially strengthened its forces in
the Gulf over the last four months to press Iraq to
unconditionally allow U.N. inspections in the country.
</P>
<P>
"Basically, that is just actions to date. It is going to be
more than that," Hamre said, adding that an additional 6,000 Army
troops were still flowing into Kuwait to join 1,500 sent
previously for military exercises with Kuwait forces.
</P>
<P>
Hamre did not say if any Gulf state such as Kuwait and Bahrain
would help pay the cost. But he said Saudi Arabia pays about 300
million dollars of the estimated 900 million dollars in annual
costs for the U.S. military to keep watch over a "no fly" zone in
southern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the 600 million dollars was in addition to
routine costs by U.S. forces that had been in the Gulf before the
beginning of the buildup four months ago.
</P>
<P>
The United States has increased its force in the region to more
than 25 warships, including two aircraft carriers, and 350 planes.
</P>
<P>
Although immediate attacks on Iraq have been averted by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's Iraqi trip, U.S. President Bill
Clinton insists that the U.S. reinforcements will remain in the
region at least over the short term to see whether Iraq will
comply fully with the U.N. inspections as it agreed. So the costs
of the military build-up there will continue to grow.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia to Dismantle Axum Obelisk Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The National Coordinating
Committee of Ethiopia for the Return of the Axum Obelisk
Wednesday announced that scaffolding has already been erected in
Rome, Italy and dismantling of the obelisk will soon begin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference held at the Ministry of
Information and Culture here, Ahmed Hassen, chairman of the
public relations and support coordination sub-committee of the
national committee, said the mayor of Rome has conceded to the
request of the International Center for Restoration of Monuments
(ICROM) to cordon off the area surrounding the obelisk which has
been in Italy for the last sixty years.
</P>
<P>
He said, the obelisk is expected to return home until the end
of next May, adding that "experts from Ethiopia and Italy will be
working together to oversee the final stages."
</P>
<P>
The obelisk which is standing in Rome was looted by then
Italian aggressors in 1937. According to the committee, the
obelisk weights 140 tons and its length is estimated to be 21-22
meters.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia is preparing to celebrate the return of the obelisk
from Rome. According to the committee, dignitaries from all over
Africa will take part in the celebrations. At the same time,
commemorative stamps and special magazines will be issued and
public festivities be organized by all regions of the country.
</P>
<P>
Axum obelisks are most striking relics of ancient Axum Kingdom
established about 2,000 years ago in Axum, an ancient town
located 600 kms north of Addis Ababa. They are made of single
blocks of granite carved in the representation of multi-storey
buildings.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Slams Greek Response for Peace Initiative </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkey Wednesday blasted Greece
for its rejection of Turkey's call for direct dialog to solve
their disputes over the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a regular press conference here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said that Turkey is disappointed
with Greece's negative response to the peace initiative.
</P>
<P>
"Greece has once more displayed before world public opinion
that its foreign policy is to maintain the current tension in the
Aegean and keep all problems with Turkey unresolved," Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
A five-point peace proposal was conveyed by Turkish Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem to the Greek government on February 12 to call
for direct contacts for the settlement of the Aegean problem.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested that the two countries' foreign ministries
hold a high-level meeting in Ankara or Athens to discuss the
thorny issues which have been preventing the normalization of the
Turco-Greek relations.
</P>
<P>
The Greek government made an official response Tuesday saying
that the Greco-Turkish disputes over the Aegean should be solved
through international arbitration instead of bilateral talks.
</P>
<P>
Direct dialog is sure to get nowhere since the two governments
failed to see eye to eye regarding this issue to date, Greek
officials said.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey proposed a very constructive approach, but the Greek
government failed to follow suit," Utkan said, adding that Greek
response showed the uncompromising attitude of Athens.
</P>
<P>
He said "by adopting a policy of maintaining tension, Greece
has unilaterally and in advance taken the responsibility for any
unwanted future accident in the Aegean and its dangerous
consequences."
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Greece, two traditional rivals, have long been at
odds over the Aegean Sea, including the airspace limits, sea-bed
mineral resources as well as the sovereignty of many small islands.
</P>
<P>
Ankara is opposed to the Greek suggestion that the Aegean
disputes be solved by the Hague-based International Court of
Justice, thinking that the European-dominated judicial body will
place Turkey in a disadvantageous position.
</P>
<P>
The warships and military jets of Turkey and Greece are
frequently involved in small-scale clashes in and over the Aegean
Sea, triggering off endless mutual accusations.
</P>
<P>
The argument over the Kardak or Imia, an uninhabited islet in
the eastern Aegean, brought the two countries to the verge of war
in early 1996.

<HEADLINE> Russian Government Shifts Strategy to Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Russian government has
decided to shift its focus from overcoming economic crisis to
pursuing growth.
</P>
<P>
At a government meeting on Thursday, President Boris Yeltsin
defined the political and economic objective for 1998 as "a
transition from the strategy of overcoming crisis to the strategy
of growth".
</P>
<P>
In a report to Russia's deputies, Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said that the rate of economic growth rather than the
level of inflation had become the main priority for the Russian
government.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that a stable economic growth, which will reach at
least 5-6 percent by the year 2000, was the government's main
objective.
</P>
<P>
According to Chernomyrdin, Russia's gross domestic product
(GDP), industrial output and retail turnover increased by 1.3
percent, 1.5 percent and 5 percent respectively in January against
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also urged the deputies to adopt the draft
budget for 1998.
</P>
<P>
Referring to cabinet reshuffles, Chernomyrdin said that changes
in the government must be natural.
</P>
<P>
"I oppose endless bureaucratic reshuffling and hectic
reorganization, I favour a natural course of events," he noted.
</P>
<P>
But he vowed to seriously improve the efficiency of the
government, including the role and personal responsibility of
ministers and heads of federal agencies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders for Durable Goods Go Up in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. orders to factories
and plants for big-ticket manufactured goods climbed up by 0.7
percent in January after a sharp drop in the previous month last
year, the Commerce Department reported here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The department said that orders for durable goods, items
expected to last at least three or more years, increased by 1.3
billion U.S. dollars in January to 185.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In December, durable goods orders had plunged by 5.5 percent,
the worst performance in six years. The big drop reflected a
plunge in the highly volatile aircraft sector, which some analysts
believed due to the economic crisis in Asia, a big market for the
U.S. passenger jets.
</P>
<P>
In another separate report Thursday, the Labor Department said
that new claims for unemployment benefits increased by 10,000 last
week to 320,000.
</P>
<P>
Some economists are worrisome that the steep plunge in currency
values in many Asian countries and the resulting economic
slowdowns will cut heavily into U.S. exports while increasing the
level of Asian imports coming into the United States.
</P>
<P>
The resulting expansion of the trade deficit is expected to
shave between one-half and a full percentage point off economic
growth this year.
</P>
<P>
For January, the government reported that the 0.7 percent
increase in durable goods orders was led by a 3.4 percent surge in
demand for electronic goods, primarily telecommunications
products. The January increased followed an equally strong 3.6
percent rise in December.
</P>
<P>
The transportation sector, which includes aircraft, rebounded
somewhat in January, rising by 2.1 percent after a huge 23.1
percent drop in December. The January advance was attributed to a
large increase in aircraft and parts, which offset weakness in
autos.
</P>
<P>
Orders for industrial machinery picked up 1.2 percent in
January, following an increase of 1.4 percent in December. But
orders for primary metals fell by 1.9 percent in January following
an even bigger 3.2 percent decline in December.
</P>
<P>
Demand for durable goods excluding defense was up 1.1 percent
last month while demand for military goods dropped a sharp 9.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
The overall increase in demand for durable goods represented
the sixth advance in the last eight months.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of durable goods, however, have been showing weakness
in recent months. Shipments dropped another 1.4 percent in
January, the third decline in the last four months.

<HEADLINE> Provincial Ministers of PML'S Major Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Ministers belonging to the
Awami (People's) National Party (ANP) in North West Frontier
Province (NWFP) Thursday resigned from their posts as a protest
against the ruling party's refusal to accept their demand to
rename NWFP as Pukhtoonkhwa province.
</P>
<P>
According to the Associated Press of Pakistan, all the three
Provincial Ministers including Bashir Ahmed Bilour, Farid Khan
Toofan and Hashim Khan read out their resignations individually
during a crowded press conference in Peshawar, capital of NWFP.
</P>
<P>
Later, they handed over their resignations to Provincial Chief
of ANP Begum Nasim Wali Khan and asked him to present it to the
Governor of NWFP.
</P>
<P>
The resignations are reported to have been written in Pushto
language in which NWFP is mentioned as Pukhtoonkhwa Province,
which means a place where Pushto-speaking people live.
</P>
<P>
Nasim Wali Khan individually invited her party's ministers to
read out their resignations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Additional Advocate General of NWFP Fazlur Rehman
Khan tendered his resignation from the post and expressed loyalty
with ANP.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Federal Communication Minister Azam Khan Hoti resigned
from the post as a protest against the ruling Pakistan Muslim
League (N)'s (PML-N) decision.
</P>
<P>
Reading out his resignation at a press conference at Peshawar
Thursday morning, Hoti said that "I am elected to the National
Assembly on ANP ticket and inducted in the Federal Cabinet as its
nominee. Since ANP has withdrawn its support from PML, I
therefore, resign from the Federal Cabinet."
</P>
<P>
ANP is PML(N)'s major alliance party in NWFP. As expected, the
nine-year old alliance between the two parties became history
Wednesday night as the third round of talks between the two sides
failed to break the log-jam on the issue of renaming NWFP as
Pukhtoonkhwa province.
</P>
<P>
With the withdrawal of ANP from the alliance, PML(N) is to
loose two-thirds majority in the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Mottahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) has given a
24-hour ultimatum to the PML government, its coalition partner in
Sindh Province, for arresting the killers of its eight supporters
in the southern port city of Karachi.
</P>
<P>
"If the government fails to do so, MQM is expected to draw
another line of action within the ambit of constitution and
democracy," said a report appearing Thursday on the English Daily,
the Frontier Post.

<HEADLINE> Record-Breaking Feat Highlights World Cup Swimming Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese teenager Hu Xiaowen
broke the world record in the women's 100-meter individual medley,
hightlighting the World Cup Short-course Swimming meet which
concluded here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
The 17-year-old Hu from Liaoning province dashed ahead in
1:00.60, surpassing the previous world mark of 1:01.03 set by
Louise Karlolsson of Sweden in November, 1992 in Espoo, Finland.
</P>
<P>
"Hu has surprised me a lot and I am glad that she won the title
in a world record," said coach Han Bingyan, "however, we're not in
the mood to celebrate her victory as the short-course events are
not included in the official swimming competition agenda in the
Olympics."
</P>
<P>
The coach said that Hu, in a height of 1.68 meters, has great
explosive powers and will probably become a star in the future
should she spare no efforts in training as a medley swimmer.
</P>
<P>
"Her speciality was the breaststroke, but she can even beat
world champion Chen Yan in every event of the 200-meter medley
separately," said Han.
</P>
<P>
"However, her upperhands were doomed to be overtaken once the
four events are combined to become the 200m medley," the coach
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Hu was first recruited into the national squad in 1995, but was
sent back to the Liaoning province in the following year due to
her mischievous behaviors.
</P>
<P>
Besides Hu, German Sandra Volker also won the aura as the sole
triple champion in the two-day competitions by taking the women's
100m freestyle Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
Following her victories in the 50m backstroke and 50m freestyle
on Wednesday, the German woman outpaced her rivals to win the 100m
freestyle in 54.41 seconds, beating a pair of Chinese swimmers to
the second and third respectively.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Alexdander Popov of Russia justified his
prowess in the pool by taking his second title in the 50m
freestyle following his victory in the 100m freestyle on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Popov clocked his winning time of 21.90 seconds in the toughest
event, beating Loreneo Vismara of Italy and Geoff Huegill of
Australia to second and third respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, Huegill also reapt his second title in the 100m
butterfly where he clocked in 52.08 seconds, following his win in
the 50m butterfly on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
His woman compatriot Julia Greville also had her second title
in the 400m freestyle in 4:11.88 as Chinese top swimmer Chen Yan
was absent from the entry list. On Wednesday, Greville won the
200m freestyle in 1:07.90.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian Svetlana Bondarenko became another double champion by
taking the women's 50m breaststroke in 31.51 seconds following her
win in the 100m breaststroke yesterday in 1:07.90.
</P>
<P>
Russian Andrei Korneev savored his second breaststroke title by
taking the 100m title in 1:00.09 after his victories in the 200m
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tomislav Karlo awarded Croatia the second gold and also his
second title by winning the 50m backstroke in 24.87 seconds, after
he took the first in the 100m backstroke yesterday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
German duo of Christian Keller and Jorg Hoffman, both bagged
home their second gold medal through the men's 200m individual
medley and the men's 800m freestyle.
</P>
<P>
Rogerio Romero won Brazil's first title by winning the men's
200m backstroke in 1:57.80, while France also savored its first
medal through Bremond Karine who finished third in the women's
200m breaststroke.
</P>
<P>
As the two-day competitions concluded, China stood atop the
medal tally with 12 golds, 17 silvers and 15 bronzes, beating
Germany to second on a 7-4-3 slate.
</P>
<P>
Australia ranked third with five golds, five silvers and three
bronzes, Russia was fourth with four golds while Ukraine had 3-1-1
to its credit.
</P>
<P>
Croatia had two golds while the remaining gold was taken by
Brazil.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Acquires Germ from West in 1980s: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq took advantage of the free
exchange of scientific materials and information from the West to
build biological weapons in the 1980s, reported French newspaper
Le Figaro Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The American Type of Culture Collection, a U.S. laboratory
based in Rockville, Maryland, in the mid-80's offered Iraq three
stocks of "vollum" type of pathogenic bacillus dust, which can be
developed into bacteriological weapons such as anthrax, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The report is based on a testimony by Raymond Zilinskas, a former
member of the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) in charge
of inspecting chemical and biological arms in Iraq who is now a
researcher at the University of Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Researchers of the Maryland laboratory have confirmed the report
by Zilinskas, but refused to offer the exact date of the transfer of
bacillus dust to Iraq, said Le Figaro.
</P>
<P>
Iraq began developing biological weapons in 1985, at the height
of its war with Iran. It later used the weapons against Iranian
troops and Kurdish rebels and civilians, the report said.

<HEADLINE> F-16 Issue Has Negative Fallout on Pak-U.S. Ties: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Failure of the United States
to resolve the F-16 issue is having a negative fallout on its
relations with Pakistan, Foreign Minister of Pakistan Gohar Ayub
Khan said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
An amicable and early resolution of the F-16 issue with the
U.S. is on top of the Pakistani government's agenda, Ayub Khan
told the National Assembly, according to the Associated Press of
Pakistan (APP).
</P>
<P>
"We shall continue to pursue it with vigor and determination to
ensure its early and satisfactory resolutions," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "we are also in the process of preparing ourselves
for legal recourse in a U.S. court and have engaged a law firm to
study all aspects of the matter."
</P>
<P>
Pakistan entered into a contract with the U.S. in 1989 for
purchase of sixty F-16 aircraft and paid 658 million dollars for
the purchase.
</P>
<P>
However, neither the planes have been delivered nor the money
refunded to Pakistan, the APP said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. further suspended all military and economic assistance
to Pakistan on October 1, 1990, saying Pakistan had violated the
provisions of the Pressler Amendment.
</P>
<P>
The APP said that the F-16 issue had been raised by Pakistan
during all high-level meetings between officials of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, during his meeting with
U.S. President Bill Clinton last September in New York, also
emphasized that the U.S. should either deliver F-16 aircraft or
refund the money to Pakistan, said the APP.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Praises China's Role in Asian Financial Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- German Vice-Foreign Minister
Werner Hoyer today spoke highly of China's role during the Asian
financial crisis, saying "China's role as political and economic
stability anchor in Asia has never been so evident as currently."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a visit to China last week, Hoyer,
state minister of the German Foreign Ministry, said that during
the recent Asian crisis, China had come up with a strong sense of
responsibility to keep a constant exchange rate of Renminbi (RMB)
and to keep the Hong Kong dollar's peg to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed confidence that Beijing would be able to
withstand the Asian financial crisis this year. If RMB failed to
hold against the crisis, it would exert a massive "shock effect"
in the Asian markets, with negative impact on all Western
industrialized countries, he added.
</P>
<P>
Hoyer started his China visit on February 16 in Hong Kong with
a meeting with Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, who is also due to
pay a visit to Germany early next month. In Beijing, Hoyer also
held talks with Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister Wang Yingfan and
vice-governor of China's central bank, Chen Yuan, on February
18-19.

The Detroit News reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bag, to be placed beneath the driver's floor mat, will
be presented at the Society of Automotive Engineers convention in
Detroit, the stronghold of U.S. car-makers, said the report.
</P>

The bag, designed by Siemens AG, will be first installed in two
kinds of European luxury cars, which will appear next year as
scheduled, and in American cars shortly afterwards. (U.S.-Air Bag)

LOS ANGELES -- Luxury car sales rose 6.5 percent in the United
States in 1997 despite a three percent fall in the car sales as a
whole, said a U.S. car organization on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
American consumers also bought a record number of sport-utility
vehicles, pickups and minivans -- a category known as light trucks
-- which are generally more expensive than cars, said the American
National Automobile Dealers Association.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the buyers spent an average of 22,400
U.S. dollars on new vehicles last year, a three percent increase
over 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid rise in median incomes during 1997 merged with
stable vehicle prices to bring about a consumer-friendly buying
environment," said David Littmann, a senior economist of
Commercial Bank in Detroit, the stronghold of U.S. car makers.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Hu Breaks World Cup Short-Course World Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese teenager Hu Xiaowen
stole the limelight by breaking the world record in the women's
100-meter individual medley in the World Cup Short-course Swimming
meet here Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
"I am glad that Hu won the title in a new world record," said
coach Han Bingyan, "however, we're not in the mood to celebrate
her victory as the short-course event is not included in the
official swimming competition agenda."
</P>
<P>
Hu touched home first in 1:00.60, bettering the original world
mark of 1:01.03 set by Louise Karlolsson of Sweden in November,
1992 in Espoo, Finland.
</P>
<P>
"She has great explosive powers and can even swim faster than
world champion Chen Yan in every event of the 200-meter medley
separately," said Han.
</P>
<P>
"However, she usually lost her upperhands in the 200m medley
whenever the four events combined," said the coach.
</P>
<P>
"Should she keep training hard, Hu would probably become a
budding star in the 200m medley in the future," coach Han said.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1980, Hu, with a height of 1.68 meters, earlier was a
breaststroke swimmer but only finished ninth in her speciality in
the National Games last October.
</P>
<P>
Hu was first recruited into the national squad in 1995, but was
sent back to the Liaoning province in the following year.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian population
in the Gaza Strip, West Bank and East Jerusalem at the end of 1997
reached 2.89 million, the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics
(PCBS) announced Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Abu Libdeh, head of the PCBS, said this number, in
comparison with just over 2 million in the mid-1990s, is the
preliminary results of the first Palestinian census.
</P>
<P>
There are 210,000 Palestinians living in East Jerusalem, he
said. Some figures were obtained independently in Jerusalem and
others through fax and other channels because the Israeli side
barred the census takers from the city.
</P>
<P>
The census figures were scheduled to be announced on January 4
this year.
</P>
<P>
This was the first census conducted by the Palestinians
themselves in the Palestinian territories so far and the census
was of great political significance to the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Through this census, the PCBS has not only collected the
population figures, but also gathered informations on education,
economic and professional status of the Palestinians, which would
help the Palestinian leadership and authorities concerned
formulate future development plans more properly, Libdeh said..
</P>
<P>
The PCBS announced the figures in its headquarters in Al-Bireh,
a town near the West Bank city of Ramallah.

<HEADLINE> China Formulating Regulations on Execution by Lethal Injection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China's paramount judicial
bodies are now working on a set of regulations on carrying out the
death sentence by means of lethal injection, an official with the
Supreme People's Court said here today.
</P>
<P>
The official, who asked not to be identified, said that the
regulations, which are expected to be completed soon, would
guarantee a better implementation of articles related to execution
in China's new Criminal Procedures Law, which came into effect one
year ago.
</P>
<P>
"Lethal injection is an easier and simpler way of execution. It
saves manpower, materials and money, and helps avoid
accidents," the official commented.
</P>
<P>
According to the newly-amended Criminal Procedures Law of
China, capital punishment can be carried out by a firing squad
or through lethal injection on an execution ground or in other
designated places of custody. The executions should be announced,
but the execution scenes should not be open to the public.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming regulations are thought to include detailed
stipulations on the approval of and the site and instruments for
lethal injection executions, and even the appropriate body parts
for injection.
</P>
<P>
A Supreme People's Court judge explained that lethal
injection is adopted to reduce the suffering of the condemned
criminal.
</P>
<P>
"Since this kind of execution can be carried out right in the
place of custody, it is no longer necessary to parade the
condemned criminals on their way to the execution ground," he added.
</P>
<P>
The judge also refuted the allegations by some Western human
rights groups and media that China has adopted lethal injection
for the convenience of obtaining organs from executed criminals
for the purpose of transplants.
</P>
<P>
"Lethal injection has been adopted by many countries in
criminal executions, and there is no such thing as using the
criminals' organs in any death sentence carried out by Chinese
courts," the judge claimed.
</P>
<P>
China's first lethal injection execution was carried out by the
Kunming Intermediate People's Court in southwest China's Yunnan
Province on March 28, 1997. Since then, several similar
experiments have been made by courts in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
On November 4, 1997, the Kunming Intermediate People's Court
executed four condemned criminals by lethal injection. Witnesses
said that all the criminals died within one minute without any
painful reaction.
</P>
<P>
Law experts said that the old way of execution, by firing
squad, was adopted in the early years after the founding of New
China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
Under the special circumstances at that time, this kind of
execution, along with the parading of criminals on the way to the
execution ground, did have some deterrent effect on would-be
criminals.
</P>
<P>
But the experts said that, with the advent of a more civilized
society, an increasingly complete legal system and the people's
growing legal awareness, it is already time for China to
replace the old way of execution with a more advanced method in
a spirit of humanitarianism.
</P>
<P>
Doctors appointed by the relevant courts administer the
injections.

<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of visitors viewed
celebrations at the Yonghe Lamasery here today as the traditional
Tibetan New Year of 1998 -- the "Year of the Tiger" -- falls
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The festivities, part of the lamasery's annual celebrations for
the coming year, featured traditional Tibetan dances, religious
ceremonies and prayers for a bumper grain harvest.
</P>
<P>
Such holiday activities performed by nearly 100 lamas residing
at the temple have been going on for a week.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan New Year's Day, the most important festival
observed by the Tibetan people, falls around the Spring Festival
(the Lunar New Year's Day of Han Nationality). It is decided
according to the traditional Tibetan calendar, which is similar to
the Han lunar calendar.
</P>
<P>
The Yonghe Lamasery, covering an area of 66,000 sq m, is
the country's largest Buddhist temple of the Yellow Sect outside
its native Tibet Autonomous Region. It was built in 1694,
originally as the residence of Emperor Yongzheng of the Qing
Dynasty before he ascended the throne. After his death, his son,
Emperor Qianlong, ordered it turned into a temple for lamas in
memory of his father, a devout Buddhist, and for the sake of the unity
of nationalities in China.

<HEADLINE> EU Urges Japan to Deregulate As Stimulus to Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission
Thursday urged Japan to implement an ambitious new deregulation
package from April to help stimulate its economy.
</P>
<P>
The executive agency of the European Union is going to press
the Japanese authorities at next Monday's meeting in Tokyo to take
up a substantial number of the key deregulation proposals it
submitted late last year.
</P>
<P>
The Tokyo meeting will be held between senior officials from
the 15-nation union and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Japan can and should do two things," said European Commission
Vice-President Sir Leon Brittan.
</P>
<P>
"First, it should give a substantial fiscal stimulus to the
economy. Second, it should bring forward and implement a
wide-ranging package of deregulation measures capable of producing
real economic effects."
</P>
<P>
Brittan said that at a time when the Japanese economy was in a
weak condition and when export-led growth is neither politically
nor economically appropriate, it was vital that the authorities in
Japan take the lead by implementing measures to stimulate domestic
demand.
</P>
<P>
"Effective deregulation is a win-win option for all," the
commission vice-president added. "It will reduce costs, improve
market access, and widen consumer choice in Japan. The needs of
both Asia and the world economy, as well as the interests of Japan
itself, make it intensely desirable for Japan to act now."
</P>
<P>
Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has
estimated that deregulation in five key sectors alone would
generate 39 trillion yen (about 30.9 billion U.S. dollars) in
fresh investment and boost the country's economy by around 6
percent between 1995 and 2001.
</P>
<P>
Consumer prices would fall by 3.4 percent while real income of
consumers would rise by 370,000 yen (2,936 dollars) per
household, added the ministerial estimate.
</P>
<P>
Deregulation in Japan is all the more necessary, explained
commission officials, because of the slowdown in Japanese economic
growth after the bursting of the "bubble economy" in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
They said that the persistent large investment imbalance
between Japanese investment abroad and foreign investment in Japan
also indicates the need for change.
</P>
<P>
The current ratio of Japanese investment abroad and foreign
investment in Japan is six to one.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong to Introduce Fixed Rate Mortgages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will introduce
fixed rate mortgages as an additional choice for home buyers, who
want to shield themselves from fluctuation in interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The government-financed Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation Limited
(HKMC) will go full stream ahead to develop necessary
infrastructure to promote fixed rate mortgages, as decided by its
Board of Directors at a meeting here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
To offer such mortgage products is one of many endeavors the
HKMC is making to enhance the liquidity of local residential
mortgage market. The Corporation is now drawing up specific
proposals to develop the market.
</P>
<P>
"With the full support of the Board, we will proceed to
consult the banks and institutional investors, including the
Housing Authority, once we have formulated the detailed
proposals," said Peter Pang, chief executive officer of the HKMC
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Market reception to fixed rate mortgages will ultimately
depend on market conditions, including notably the interest rate
environment," he added.

<HEADLINE> SAR to Further Upgrade HK's Education: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region will further upgrade Hong
Kong's education and train up local teachers through injection of
large resources, Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Education is the key of Hong Kong's future," Tung reiterated
this idea at a ceremony to mark the official opening of the new
campus of the Hong Kong Institute of Education in Tai Po.
</P>
<P>
The total expenditure on education for the year 1998/99 will be
increased to 53.2 billion HK dollars (6.82 billion U.S. dollars),
accounting for 18.4 percent of the total public expenditure, and
constituting the greatest share of Hong Kong's public spending,
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Excluding an allocation of five billion HK dollars (641 million
U.S. dollars) for the setting up of a fund for the development of
quality education, the real growth in expenditure amounts to 12.7
percent, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of basic education, the real growth is recorded as
high as 16.4 percent, he added.
</P>
<P>
"The opening of the institute's new campus adds a new page to
teacher education in Hong Kong," Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
The new campus, located in a 12.5 hectare scenic site in Tai Po
at a cost of 2.5 billion HK dollars (320 million U.S. dollars),
mergers the four existing colleges of education and the Institute
of Language in Education into a unitary, autonomous tertiary
institution dedicated to providing quality teacher education.
</P>
<P>
"Teachers and students, who had to attend classes at scattered
premises in the past, can now gather together on unified campus
and take advantage of all the state-of-the-art teaching facilities
at international standards," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"This new campus is going to be a place for inter flow and
cultivation of a sense of belonging shared by both teachers and
students," Tung added.
</P>
<P>
Teachers are pillars of Hong Kong's education system and are
commissioned with the important task of providing education to the
children, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's reunion with China, Hong Kong is now marching
towards the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have great expectations of the younger generation,
especially our young teachers," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that the young teachers should be persons with
all-rounded development in ethics, intellect, physique, social
skills and aesthetics and persons who have deep love of the
motherland and are committed to the development of the mainland as
well as Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to grasp both Chinese and English and to be
fluent in Cantonese, Putonghua (standard Chinese) and English,
Tung said.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to be persons with immense and extensive
knowledge, independent thinking, creativity and enthusiasm, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The young teachers are also expected to be persons who are
caring and eager to serve the community and persons with lofty
ideal and high moral standards, who are ready to shoulder the onus
in the education of the younger generation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong Institute of Education is the largest institute
entrusted with the heavy and long-term responsibility of teacher
training in Hong Kong, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
He said he is confident that the council members, teachers and
students of the Hong Kong Institute of Education will work with
dedication and enthusiasm for the development of quality education
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In his welcoming speech, Simon Ip, chairman of the Council of
the institute, said that the chief executive has given special
attention and priority to teacher education in his first Policy
Address published in October last year.
</P>
<P>
"We stand ready to assist Mr. Tung in the implementation of his
policies in this important area," Ip noted.
</P>
<P>
In her vote of thanks, Professor Ruth Hayhoe, director of the
institute, said that the new campus, with its high-tech
facilities, well-equipped library, resource centers and other
staff and student amenities, will undoubtedly provide an enhanced
teaching and learning environment for students and staff.
</P>
<P>
It will also "enable us to play a pivotal role in the future
development of quality teacher education in the region", Hayhoe
said.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the chief executive at the ceremony signals his
clear commitment to a strong emphasis on education as the
foundation for a better tomorrow, Hayhoe said.
</P>
<P>
In a new and changing era, an all-round education, with equal
emphasis on moral values and life-long learning skills, as well as
the ability to understand and use technology is key to the
well-being of Hong Kong, she added.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Sees Improvement in Jets Delivery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Aircraft manufacturer
Boeing said Wednesday that it would deliver 115 commercial jets
the first quarter of 1998, compared to 80 in the last three months
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Boeing regarded the increase as a signal that it is recovering
from the problems caused mainly by its out-of-date management
culture and one of the most inefficient assembly line in
U.S. industry.
</P>
<P>
Work came to a standstill on the 747 and 737 lines last
November because of production problems. Boeing was forced to
pay 1.6 billion U.S. dollars for late deliveries.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Boeing announced that it had a loss of 178
million U.S. dollars last year -- its first annual loss in half a
century.
</P>
<P>
Contributing to the loss were the 1.4 billion dollar cost of
phasing out former McDonnell Douglas production lines, and an
additional 1.6 billion dollars to straighten out production
bottlenecks in two giant plants.
</P>
<P>
This year Boeing expects to spend one billion dollars more to
get its assembly lines running smoothly and pay for late delivery.
</P>
<P>
A Boeing executive said that parts shortages, behind-schedule
jobs and out-of-sequence work will continue to be reduced in the
assembly factories in Seattle.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Maintain Surplus Imposed by IMF: Ramos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government can
maintain the 5 billion peso (125 million US dollar) surplus
imposed as a condition set by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) for the country to exit from the world body next month.
</P>
<P>
The assurance was made by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
said on Thursday the level set by the IMF is "very doable", the
Philippine News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
To ensure that the country will attain the 5 billion peso
surplus, Ramos earlier ordered a belt-tightening measure among all
the government agencies.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that belt-tightening is not just a reduction of
expenditures but also measures to wisely use public investment.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is expected to exit from the IMF on March 30,
after more than three decades under its supervision and scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
The country could have exited from the IMF last year but had to
be postponed several times because of failure of Congress to pass
important legislations such as the Oil Deregulation Law and the
Comprehensive Tax Reform Program required by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Now that these bills have been passed by Congress and signed
into law by Ramos, the stage is set for the country's exit from
the IMF next month.

<HEADLINE> GCC Fails to Attract more Japanese Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) states have failed in the past years to attract
more Japanese investment, according to an official economic
report received here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Japan's direct investment in the GCC states, which are the
main source of energy for the country, is estimated at less than
one percent of its worldwide investment, said the report of the
Gulf Organization for Industrial Consulting (GOIC).
</P>
<P>
"Over the past half a century, Japanese investment in the Gulf
has not exceeded 6.3 billion U.S. dollars, less than seven per
thousand of total Japanese investments abroad," the GOIC report
said.
</P>
<P>
This was due to GCC states' restrictive investments laws and
poor participation of GCC private sector in trade talks with
Japanese businessmen, it said.
</P>
<P>
"Gulf states should open up to Japan, cooperate in setting up
joint industrial ventures to attract more Japanese capitals," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"The private sector in the GCC should play a key role in
attracting Japanese capitals. So far, the meetings with the
Japanese side on economic and trade cooperation have been
dominated by the GCC governments," it said.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Liberalize Fund Management Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore has announced
broad measures to liberalize its fund management industry in a
continued effort to develop Singapore into a financial hub.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at an investment management seminar here on Thursday,
Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that "Our vision is to
develop Singapore into the premier fund management hub in Asia
over the next five to ten years."
</P>
<P>
"Regulatory, institutional and policy weaknesses have held us
back from realizing our full potential," said the Deputy Prime
Minister, who is also Chairman of the Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MA), the de facto central bank of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
As one of the measures to boost the fund management industry,
Lee said that in the next three years, the government will
increase the amount placed out to fund managers with Singapore
offices from ten billion Singapore dollars (about 6.13 billion
U.S. dollars) to 35 billion Singapore dollars (about 21.47 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) "aims
to farm out up to 50 percent of its Asian portfolios to private
fund managers," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore government will also issue ten-year government
bonds and allow government-linked corporations to issue bonds for
infrastructure projects, so as to foster the development of local
bond market.
</P>
<P>
The rules on the listing of foreign companies will also be
reviewed to attract more international securities, Lee said.

JERUSALEM -- The Israeli Transport Ministry published tenders
on Wednesday for the operation of 22 urban and inter-city bus
lines in Israel, according to the daily.

with land, sea and air ways to define the species and quality of
the goods that enter the country, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
During the two phases, the labs in Riyadh and Jeddah have been
connected to the Quality and Control Department of the Trade

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100 people of Taiwan
origin held a forum here today to mark the 51st anniversary of the
"February 28 Uprising," a large-scale democratic patriotic
movement that fought against the imposition of Kuomintang
dictatorship on Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Kehui, president of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government
League, presided over the forum and said that the patriotism and
democratic spirit shown in the uprising fully demonstrated that
the fate of the Taiwan compatriots is closely related to that of
the whole Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
It is a distortion of history when some pro-"Taiwan
independence" people label the event as the beginning of "Taiwan
independence", he noted, adding that the purpose of commemorating
the "February 28 Uprising" is to show the world the Chinese
people's respect for patriotism and democracy.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also called on all the Chinese people to carry forward
the uprising's legacy of patriotism and boost the progress of
cross-straits relations on the principle of "peaceful
reunification, and "one country, two systems", as well as
President Jiang Zemin's eight-point proposal.
</P>
<P>
Some Taiwan compatriots who witnessed the uprising also
delivered speeches at the forum. They pointed out from their own
experience and from historical facts that the uprising was not
launched by pro-independence forces on the island, and stressed
that peaceful reunification is the only way out for the people of
Taiwan.

<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen said Thursday that the government was ready to
declare a ceasefire if its rivals announced a truce first.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen made the promise in a meeting with representatives of
Britain, France, Germany and the European Union, Hun Sen's Advisor
Prak Sokhon said.
</P>
<P>
The second prime minister was responding to a proposal put
forward by the Japanese government last week to solve the conflict
between Hun Sen's government and the forces of his ousted
co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo suggested that the ousted first prime minister cut off
any military cooperation with the Khmer Rouge and announce a
ceasefire immediately.
</P>
<P>
In return, the government should guarantee the prince's "safety
and security" and allow him to take part in the coming general
elections.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen told the foreign ambassadors that the government was
waiting for a response from the Ranariddh side to announce the
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
According to Sokhon, the Council of Ministers on Thursday
decided to postpone by one more month the deadline for candidate
registration so that more time is available for all candidates
including Prince Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
"There will be no more obstacles for Prince Norodom Ranariddh
to participate in the elections," the advisor added.
</P>
<P>
Candidates should be registered 120 days before the polling
date, scheduled on July 26.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: S. African Gold Industry Faces Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- High-level delegations
from labor, government and business gather here Thursday to
thrash out a plan to bale out the mining industry amid widespread
retrenchments, a depressed gold price and high production costs.
</P>
<P>
The National Union of Mine-workers (NUM), in the wake of mass
retrenchments last year, initiated the gold mining summit, which
would deal with a social plan for the industry and other measures
to ensure sustaining the industry as a labor-intensive one.
</P>
<P>
Labor Minister Tito Mboweni, head of the government
delegation, said the government would table proposals on the
social plan and mechanisms to keep a closer watch on the
industry.
</P>
<P>
Such proposals would seem to fit in with some of the NUM's
proposals for the government to take on a watchdog role in
down-sizings the gold mining industry.
</P>
<P>
The NUM has called on the government to play a much more
active role by ensuring that the labor department is given
legislative powers to instruct mining houses to ask permission
regarding retrenchments affecting 10 percent or more of the work
force.
</P>
<P>
Other measures relate to establishing a permanent statutory
commission to manage down-scaling the industry.
</P>
<P>
The South African Chamber of Mines hinted last week at a
15-point plan for the sustainable survival of the industry.
</P>
<P>
The chamber, in a document submitted to the NUM, outlined a
framework to "transform South Africa's mineral resources into
wealth to the benefit of all stock-holders".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Association of South Africa, a
federation of trade unions of the country's affiliate operating
in the industry, said the only way to secure jobs was through a
"meaningful and sincere commitment by all concerned with
increasing productivity".
</P>
<P>
At the same time the labor court failed Wednesday to consider
the merits of a case brought by the NUM to halt the closure of a
number of the Freegold shafts by the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
The union applied for an interdict on the basis that
insufficient consultation had taken place.
</P>
<P>
The court struck the matter off the roll after agreeing with
an argument by Anglogold that a NUM branch chairman did not have
authority to bring the matter before the court, based on the
union's constitution.
</P>
<P>
The union said it would reintroduce the matter before the
labor court.
</P>
<P>
Anglogold said Freegold was close to concluding sale
agreements with various parties to buy some of the shafts which,
it was hoped, would ensure the retention of several hundred
mining jobs.

<HEADLINE> Communique of 2rd Plenum of 15th CPC Central Committee (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Having made a comprehensive analysis of China's current
economic situation, the Plenum holds that the overall situation is
good. The policy decisions and plans of the CPC Central Committee
on economic work are entirely correct. The whole Party must
earnestly carry out these decisions and plans.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the financial crisis that has hit some Asian
countries, the most important task for China is to make a success
of its domestic economic work, so as to increase its capabilities
to withstand and resist risks.
</P>
<P>
We enjoy a comparatively solid material and technological
foundation, a correct theory, line, principles and policies suited
to China's national conditions, and have a collective central
leadership able to skillfully handle various complicated
situations.
</P>
<P>
As long as all comrades of the Party adhere to the Party's
basic theory, line and program, rely firmly on the broad masses of
the people, correctly handle the relationship between the reform,
development and stability, and earnestly solve evident problems in
the course of advance, we will certainly be able to maintain the
momentum of sustained, rapid and sound development of the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
The Plenum points out that the key to accomplishing this
year's various tasks and attaining the goal of trans-century
development set by the 15th CPC National Congress lies in
improving the quality and efficiency of all cadres.
</P>
<P>
Cadres at all levels, especially leading officials, must study
harder, improve their abilities through practice, and devote
themselves to various kinds of work with perseverance and diligence
and in the pioneering spirit.
</P>
<P>
It is necessary to create a favorable environment for the
emergence of outstanding professionals, and to train a contingent
of highly competent cadres.
</P>
<P>
The Plenum calls on the whole Party and people of all ethnic
groups across the country to unite more closely, hold high the
great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, and, under the leadership by
the Party Central Committee with Comrade Jiang Zemin at the core,
work hard in unity and in the pioneering spirit, in order to
constantly score new successes in the great cause of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics. End

<HEADLINE> Rehabilitation of Benguela Railway in Angola </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- With the joint efforts by the
governments of Angola and Italy, rehabilitation work on Angola's
major railway -- the Benguela line -- has started. The work will
be completed in three years.
</P>
<P>
The 1,340-km Benguela line runs across the central part of
Angola, starting from the port of Lobito in the west, and ends in
Luan city near Angola's border with the Democratic Republic of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
The Benguela line, which links Tazara via the railway in the
Democratic Republic of Congo, is also a major line in south
Africa. However, damaged seriously during the civil war, the
line is almost paralysed.
</P>
<P>
The clearing of land mines along the railway is most important
for the rehabilitation. Last Monday, four teams consisting of 80
Italian experts started clearing the land mines.
</P>
<P>
The work was undertaken by an Italian company Tor de Valle,
with an investment of 250 million U.S. Dollars. In return,
Angola will allow the company to develop the country's largest
eucalyptus forest along the railway line, which amounts to over a
million trees.
</P>
<P>
Rehabilitation on the Benguela line is part of the
government's Lobito Corridor program, which includes the
equipping of Lobito port, the repairs on Lomaum hydro-power
station along the line, and the enhancing of the capability of
river and sea transport.
</P>
<P>
Benguela railway runs across five provinces, with an
employment of 13,232 workers in the past.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Olympics Unveils Ticketing Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Tickets for the 2000 Olympic
Games will be issued by ballot when the demand exceeds the number
available, the organising committee (SOCOG) for the 2000 Games
said in Sydney on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG's ticketing strategy, which was unveiled on Thursday,
offers tickets in four main ways.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of tickets will be sold through the public
subscriptions, although the exact number and the cost of tickets
are still to be decided.
</P>
<P>
A further 72,000 tickets will be given to people who join the
Olympic Club, which was also officially launched on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, members of the public can join the club at a
cost of between 150 and 500 Australian dollars. By doing so, club
members will be eligible to win tickets which will be drawn each
week leading up to the games.
</P>
<P>
Other tickets will be made available through various
competitions and promotions provided by SOCOG's Olympic sponsors.
</P>

Gold and Platinum passes, enabling individuals to "buy" a
permanent seat at the main stadium for the duration of the Games.

<HEADLINE> Increase in Mainland Immigrants Quota to Macao Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Macao government's
announcement to increase the quota of immigrants from the Chinese
mainland to Macao from March 1 has been praised here as a "wise"
and "acceptable" decision.
</P>
<P>
The Macao government announced on Wednesday that after
negotiations with related departments on China's mainland, the
quota of mainland residents to immigrate to Macao will be raised
to 280 a month from March 1, double the previous figure set in
1983.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News and several other leading Chinese
newspapers praised the decision in their Thursday commentaries as
"wise" and "good," saying it will enable more separated families
to achieve reunion as soon as possible, thus contributing to
social stability.
</P>
<P>
"The decision is commendable," said the Va Kio newspaper. "Many
people have waited for moving to Macao, either for family reunion,
or for employment, investment, study, cooperation in business, or
for claiming inheritance."
</P>
<P>
It added that the problem of children who have the right of
permanent residency in Macao but now live on the mainland should
be resolved as early as possible.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are 6,000 children, including 3,000
in East China's Fujian Province, waiting to emigrate to Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Daily News said the quota could be further raised
after some time to increase the permanent population in Macao so
that Macao's economy could be boosted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, local real estate businessmen and some legislators
also praised the decision. But they warned that the government
should make adjustments in employment and social welfare policies
to cope with the increase in new immigrants.

<HEADLINE> State to Implement Regulations to Prevent Computer Viruses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Public
Security will soon put into practice some regulations on the
prevention of computer viruses.
</P>
<P>
The ministry will be in charge of research projects on computer
viruses and publicity on the epidemic situation, according to one
of the regulations.
</P>
<P>
Units and individuals will not be allowed to collect and store
computer viruses for two years if they have a record with police
for violating laws and regulations by harming the security of
computer networks, another regulation said.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises have to register at the local departments of public
security before they can be involved in studies on computer
viruses, and must apply for sales certificates for their
anti-computer virus products.
</P>
<P>
Computer monitoring departments at the county level will deal
with minor cases of computer virus contamination and should report
them to departments at higher levels, while departments of public
security at prefecture and city levels deal with major cases and
report to the higher authorities, according to the regulations.
</P>
<P>
Computer networks have become more popular in China in recent
years, with the Internet covering more than 30 large and
medium-size cities in China. Cases, which involve "hackers" who
damage computer systems with their intrusive techniques also have
cropped up.
</P>
<P>
It is difficult to detect and crack down on computer crimes,
which can seriously harm social security and cause big economic
losses, said Zhu Entao, an official at the Ministry of Public
Security.
</P>
<P>
He added that public security departments at all levels are
trying to launch stricter measures to prevent and crack down on
such crimes in accordance with the new edition of the Criminal
Law, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
The regulation on the management of special products for
maintaining the security of computer systems has also been issued
and will be put in use after the implementation of the regulations
on computer virus prevention.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia to Announce New Rules on Foreign Equity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Deputy Prime
Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Thursday that the government is
expected to announce further liberalization of foreign equity
ownership in Malaysian companies.
</P>
<P>
When talking with reporters here after chairing a cabinet
committee meeting on social issues, Anwar, who is also finance
minister said the government is committed to the process of
liberalization and "there would be no reversal of this policy" in
continuing to enhance and expedite the process of liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said that the move to allow non-bumiputera
(non-aboriginal) firms to buy equity in bumiputera (aboriginal)
firms might not necessarily be temporary but the whole mechanism
of how it would be implemented was still being worked out by the
government and it could be implemented very soon.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the National Economic Action Council
(NEAC) Tun Daim announced two days ago that non-bumipteras would
be allowed to buy equity in by bumiputera companies affected by
the current economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said these were necessary adjustments which had to be
made in view of the current economic difficulties as well as
Malaysia's commitment to liberalize the economy under the World
Trade Organization's requirements.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners are allowed to hold up to 30 percent equity in
public-listed companies while bumiputera equity in these companies
should not be less than 30 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Share prices continued to
rise on the Singapore market as the benchmark Straits Times
Industrials Index (STII) gained another 11.73 points to close at

<P>
Dealers said that the stock prices finished higher amid a
foreign fund buying spree as part of an asset allocation in favor
of the Southeast Asian region.
</P>
<P>
They said that the firmer undertone in regional stock markets
and the strength on the regional currency front had buoyed
sentiment on the bourse. They also cheered the government's list
of reforms announced earlier to boost the asset management
industry.
</P>
<P>
The total market volume shrank to 401.64 million units, valued
at 496.37 million Singapore dollars (about 304.52 million US
dollars). Advances overwhelmed declines by 339 to 61, while 212
other counters remained unchanged.

<HEADLINE> India to Host Conference on Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- India will play host to a
regional conference on money laundering to be held here next week,
Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) sources said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the conference are to increase the
international commitment within the region to fight money
laundering by introducing necessary countermeasures and to promote
harmonization of strategies and policies regionwide.
</P>
<P>
It is expected to adopt recommendations and draw up an action
plan for countries in the South-West Asia region after considering
issues like methods and techniques of the money-laundering
phenomenon and examine it in legal context and trade
globalization, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
It is well realized that the single most significant impact of
money laundering on the legitimate economy is that it undermines
the integrity of the financial system with devastating
consequences at national and international levels depending on the
extent and rapidity of loss of confidence. Money laundering is,
therefore, recognized as a global problem in need of a global
response.
</P>
<P>
Representatives and experts from Bangladesh, Bhutan, Iran,
India, The Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and
Thailand are expected to participate in the conference, which is
being jointly organized by the Indian government, the Global
Program against Money Laundering and the United Nations
International Drug Control Program.

<HEADLINE> S. African Security Guards Strike Enters Fourth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The nationwide strike by
South African security guards to demand higher pay entered its
fourth consecutive day Thursday as talks between security
employers and striking unions showed no sign of an agreement.
</P>
<P>
The South African National Security Employers' Associations
(SANSEA) and the 13 unions participating in the strike continued
negotiations Thursday for the third straight day under the
supervision of the Council for Conciliation, Mediation and
Arbitration (CCMA).
</P>
<P>
The CCMA, a statutory body, said that no one has given up the
effort to seek a solution despite the outstanding differences
between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The strike has cost the industry millions of Rand and resulted
in violence and chaos in downtown Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Police arrested 17 security guards carrying firearms Wednesday
at a gathering of thousands of guards at Johannesburg downtown
Library Gardens, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Six policemen were seriously injured and dozens of civilians
hurt in stone-throwing after police erected a razor-wire cordon
around the guards to prevent clashes similar to Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 30,000 to 100,000 security workers began striking
Monday in cities across the country after their demand for a pay
hike and other benefits were turned down by employers.
</P>
<P>
The workers demanded a 12 percent wage increase, an annual
bonus of 100 percent monthly wage, double pay on Sundays and the
establishment of a national bargaining forum.
</P>
<P>
The employers are offering a 10 percent pay rise and a 20
percent monthly wage annual bonus.
</P>
<P>
A union spokeswoman, Emily Fourie, said the offer was
unacceptable, considering that the majority of security workers
earned only about 1,130 Rand (229 U.S. dollars) a month, with
which guards had to cover all medical costs on their own.
</P>
<P>
Police had laid charges against the marchers for gathering
illegally at Library Gardens on Tuesday and Wednesday. But the
unions had successfully applied to continue gathering in an
adjacent area until March 3.
</P>
<P>
Employers said they will apply for an interdict in the Labor
Court Thursday to have the strike declared unlawful. They also
threatened to fire striking guards.
</P>
<P>
SANSEA President Don Masterson said they want the strikers
ack at work as soon as possible to restore some normality to the
industry.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, Iran to Frustrate Anti-Friendly Attempts: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and Iran are
determined to frustrate attempts of their common enemies to damage
their deep-rooted relations, a spokesman for the Foreign Office
said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
When expressing his deep anguish over the recent killing of two
Iranian engineers in Pakistan's southern port city of Karachi, the
spokesman said it was no more secret that the common enemies
wanted to harm relations between Pakistan and Iran.
</P>
<P>
"It is well-known that external elements are behind the
barbaric acts in which not only residents from the brotherly
country are killed, but also our own people have become victims,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He further said that an Iranian team would visit Pakistan soon
in connection with the unfortunate incident.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the spokesman said that the Pakistani government
would take all possible measures to protect lives of foreigners
living and working in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are fully aware of our responsibility to provide protection
to foreigners," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, two Iranian engineers working at a bridge
project in Karachi were killed by a group of unidentified people.

<HEADLINE> India Lifts Trade Embargo on Fiji </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- India has lifted its
10-year-old trade embargo on Fiji in an effort to rebuild its
bilateral economic relations with that country, an official press
release said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The trade embargo was lifted by the Commerce Ministry of India
effective from February 24.
</P>
<P>
"With this change now, it is hoped that India's trade relations
with Fiji will flourish," the release said.
</P>
<P>
India had imposed the trade embargo on October 14, 1987 after
Sitveni Rabuka staged a coup with the help of the Fijian army to
oust a government headed by a native Indian. Following the coup,
the position of Indians, who had gone to the country to work on
sugarcane fields, was undermined and the role in running the
country was reduced in favor of the local tribes.
</P>
<P>
Recently, Rabuka conceded that he had meted out injustice to
native Indians and restored the Indians' role in that country.

<HEADLINE> Longest Tunnel In Pakistan Comes into Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Malakand, (Northern Pakistan), February 26 (Xinhua) -- Millions
of acres of barren land in northern Pakistan will turn into lush
green fields as the country's longest irrigation tunnel formally
came into operation Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 3.5-Kilometer-long tunnel, located in Malakand of the North
West Frontier Province (NWFP), is the key part of the grand Swabi
Salinity Control and Reclamation Project (SCARP).
</P>
<P>
The Project was formally inaugurated by NWFP Chief Minister
Mahtab Ahmed Khan Thursday morning at the construction site in the
Dargai mountains, about 200 km north of the Federal capital city
of Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
The Project, costing about 23 million U.S. dollars and funded
by the Asian Development Bank and the Swiss Development
Corporation, was undertaken by China Geo-engineering Corporation
(CGC).
</P>
<P>
The 10-million-dollar tunnel, excavated by the CGC after two
years' strenuous work, is aimed at realizing the full agricultural
potential of the area covered by the project, improving farm
incomes and boosting local economic activities.
</P>
<P>
"The tunnel is another great achievement made by a Chinese
company in Pakistan and it will benefit the local agriculture a
lot," the NWFP chief minister told Xinhua after an impressive
inauguration ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"We really appreciate the commendable contributions China has
made to the development of Pakistan's national economy," he said,
adding that "I hope China will continue and enhance their friendly
cooperation with our country."
</P>
<P>
Zia-ul Din, a senior official from the Water and Power
Development Authority, expressed satisfaction over the performance
of the Chinese company in this project.
</P>
<P>
"They have completed the tunnel on time and the quality is
quite satisfactory," the official said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking highly of the quality of the work, Charles Mann,
tunnel expert from British Haswell Consulting Engineers, said that
"the Chinese engineers were proved to be very capable and has a
good future in undertaking overseas projects."

JOHANNESBURG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The total destruction of
money before being taken by robbers in cash-in-transit heists was
one of the options now being considered by SBV, a company
transfers money for all major South African banks.
</P>
<P>
"We are looking at the total destruction of the money before
it falls into the hands of the robbers. Maybe this will then
deter them from robbing the convoys," the Citizen daily Thursday
quoted SBV managing director Colin Gregor as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If you take away what they want, there is no reason for them
to rob the vans anymore," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Gregor told the paper that negotiations in this regard with
the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) started
in August last year.
</P>
<P>
He said he was expecting the final recommendations from the
CSIR at the end of next month. Implementing the precautionary
measures would follow within a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
International advice on the problem will also be sought, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of last year, 11 SBV security guards were
killed in several major heists in which the company lost more
than 50 million Rand (10 million U.S. Dollars).

-- According to General Romeo Dallaire, a military officer who
served in the United Nations peacekeeping force in Rwanda in 1994
and who testified at the International Court on genocide in Rwanda,
the genocide of one million Rwandan Tutsis could have been avoided,
if the United Nations Security Council approved a military
intervention against the Hutu militias. He said he asked on the
eve of the massacres the then U.N. assistant secretary in charge of
peacekeeping, Kofi Annan, whether a military intervention should be
launched, the answer was ``no.''
</P>
<P>
--The United Nations Security Council is divided over whether a
new resolution should be adopted on Iraq obliging Baghdad to allow
U.N. arms inspections following the agreement reached by U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan with Iraqi leaders. Britain, supported
by the United States, has asked for the move, while China, Russia
and France consider it unnecessary, as the U.N. Secretary-General
is entitled by the U.N. Charter to sign an agreement as
representative of the world body.

-- In the middle of 1980s, the Iraqi military authorities took
advantage of the international rule of free exchange of
scientific materials and information by obtaining bacillus dust
from the West to produce bacteriological weapons. A U.S.

were among the providers of chemical and bacteriological materials
to their ``Iraqi colleagues.'' But the British had rejected
Iraqi demand for such materials.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China today expressed its
resentment and regret over Jordan's insistence on inviting
Taiwan's Lien Chan for a visit.
</P>
<P>
"In disregard of repeated solemn representations by the Chinese
side, the Jordanian government insisted on permitting Lien Chan to
visit Jordan and arranged official meetings for him, thus openly
conniving at Lien's activities to create `two Chinas', or `one
China, one Taiwan'," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao.
</P>
<P>
When asked to comment on the issue at a news briefing today,
the spokesman said such activities have seriously hurt the
feelings of the Chinese people and jeopardized China-Jordan
relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese side has made solemn diplomatic representations on
this issue, and at the same time sincerely hopes that the
Jordanian government will strictly adhere to the "One China"
policy and work to maintain rather than impair bilateral ties, Zhu
said.
</P>
<P>
It has been universally acknowledged by the international
community that there is only one China, Zhu said, and the
government of the People's Republic of China is the sole
legitimate government representing the whole of China and Taiwan
is an inalienable part of it.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the Taiwan authorities will never succeed in
their attempt to engage in divisive activities around the world
under various excuses against the will of the entire Chinese
people, including the Taiwan compatriots.

<HEADLINE> ANP Formally Breaks Alliance with Ruling PML </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Awami (People's)
National Party (ANP) Thursday formally broke its nine-year old
political alliance with Pakistan Muslim League(PML) following
categorical "No" by the PML leadership regarding renaming of the
North West Frontier Province(NWFP).
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by ANP's parliamentary leader in the NWFP
Assembly, Begum Nasim Wali Khan, while addressing a hurriedly
called press conference in Peshawar, capital of the NWFP, after a
brief meeting with party's stalwarts, according to the Associated
Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
While explaining her party's future planning after quitting the
government, Begum Nasim said "ANP has no intention to form the
government in the province and has firmly decided to sit on the
opposition benches so as to bolster the opposition."
</P>
<P>
"This is our belief that strong opposition is better than the
weak government," she added.
</P>
<P>
She said that the ANP joined the government in a bid to protect
the rights of the province and steer it out of the economic
crises.
</P>
<P>
However, the present government believed in strong federation
instead of strong federating units, she said.
</P>
<P>
The ANP had entered into an agreement with the PML leadership
which indicated that the PML leadership would soften the
atmosphere for renaming the NWFP as Pukhtoonkhwa within six
months, she said.
</P>
<P>
She regretted that the PML leadership backed out of its
commitment in their talks with ANP leaders.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Luxury car sales rose 6.5
percent in the United States in 1997 despite a three percent fall
in the car sales as a whole, said a U.S. car organization on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
American consumers also bought a record number of sport-utility
vehicles, pickups and minivans -- a category known as light trucks
-- which are generally more expensive than cars, said the American
National Automobile Dealers Association.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the buyers spent an average of 22,400
U.S. dollars on new vehicles last year, a three percent increase
over 1996.
</P>
<P>
"The rapid rise in median incomes during 1997 merged with
stable vehicle prices to bring about a consumer-friendly buying
environment," said David Littmann, a senior economist of
Commercial Bank in Detroit, the stronghold of U.S. car makers.
</P>
<P>
Analysts expect slow growth in vehicle spending this year
because most of those who want to buy more expensive cars have
already bought them.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Knesset Approves Ministerial Appointment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Knesset (Parliament)
has approved the appointment of two cabinet ministers, the
Jerusalem Post newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Transportation Minister Yitzhak Levy of the National Religious
Party took the post of education minister, and his original
portfolio went to a Knesset member of his party, Shaul Yahalom, on
Wednesday night, the daily said.
</P>
<P>
Levy was elected chairman of the National Religious Party last
Sunday to succeed Zevulun Hammer, who died last month.
</P>
<P>
But due to the opposition of the Shas, another religious party
in the Likud-led coalition, Levy failed to inherit the post of
deputy prime minister, a largely ceremonial position, held by
Hammer.
</P>
<P>
He also accepted Shas' condition that he will be a figurehead
religious affairs minister and stay away from daily operation of
the ministry when he takes over the portfolio from a Shas member
in July.
</P>
<P>
The two parties have agreed before to share the portfolio in
rotation.
</P>
<P>
The National Religious Party opposes any more concessions in
the peace process, unless the Palestinians fulfill their
commitments and obligations to the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
And Levy said on Monday that he would continue school programs
on democracy, Zionism and Judaism.

<P>
HARARE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Salini-Impregilo Joint
Venture, an Italian company and contractor of the Tokwe-Mukorsi
Dam in Masvingo, south Zimbabwe, signed an agreement Wednesday
with Zimbabwe for the construction to begin.
</P>
<P>
Joyce Mujuru, Zimbabwean Minister of Rural Resources and Water
Development, said on the signing ceremony that the 35 million
U.S. Dollars dam, which will begin its construction in Masvingo
in south Zimbabwe and is expected to be completed in 2002, was
partly funded by the Italian government through a soft loan, local
paper The Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Mujuru did not disclose the amount.
</P>
<P>
A proposal for the construction of the dam was made almost 10
years ago but the project failed to take off because the
government had no money.
</P>
<P>
The government had to divert undisclosed funds from some
projects in the Ministry of Rural Resources and Water Development
for the dam. Seventy-five percent of the cost for the project
has to be paid in foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
Hydro-electricity generation at the dam will become the
country's biggest inland dam with an annual yield of 340,000
megalitres.

<HEADLINE> Legal Framework Established for Socialist Market Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The primary goal of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC) centered on setting up the legal
framework for the socialist market economy has been basically
accomplished, according to an unnamed senior official.
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC)
announced the achievement on the eve of the First Session of the
9th National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The 8th NPC formulated 118 laws and regulations, some 50
percent of which dealt directly with the socialist market economy,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
The retiring congress drafted the Corporate Law, Business
Partnership Law and the Commercial Banking Law to standardize
mainstays of the market, in addition to drafting the Law against
Unfair Competition, Foregin Trade Law, the Real Estate Law and
Advertising Law to adjust market order.
</P>
<P>
The 8th National Congress also promulgated the Budget Law and
the Central Bank Law to strengthen state macro-controls, and the
Labor Law to govern social security.
</P>
<P>
Ju Jiaren, director of the Economic Law Office under the NPC
Financial and Economic Committee, said that the formulation of
laws in four specific areas indicates the basic establishment of a
legal framework for the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for the past five years, the tenure of the 8th NPC,
clearly indicate that China has accelerated legislative efforts,
with the number of the laws drafted during the period accounting
for one third of total since China introduced the opening drive in
late 1978.

"The fact that legislative work on the market economy witnessed
rapid growth over the past year is widely acknowledged," according
to Ju.
</P>
<P>
China confirmed the establishment of a socialist market economy
in the form of Constitutional amendments in 1993, and the
Legislative Strategy for the 8th NPC was formulated following
another year of research and deliberation.
</P>
<P>
The strategy defined economic legislation as the primary task
and requireed that the establishment of a legal framework for
the socialist market economy be completed within the tenure of the
8th NPC.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the NPC Standing Committee said that the 9th
NPC will also be expected to pay close attention to economic
legislation.
</P>
<P>
Legislative work concerning all aspects related to government
departments, the judiciary, the environment and education will be
strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predict that a comparatively complete legal system
with Chinese characteristics will govern the socialist market
economy, and will play a still greater role in all aspects of life
by the beginning of the next century.

<P>
FUZHOU, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment has played
an important role in strengthening tourism facilities in east
China's Fujian province.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the coastal province has used 1.7 billion
U.S. dollars of contractual funds from overseas in developing 233
tourism projects.
</P>
<P>
Fujian boasts many scenic spots, including the Wuyi mountain
resort in the north and the ancient harbour of Quanzhou in the
south.
</P>
<P>
So far, the Wuyi mountain resort alone has signed 38 contracts
with overseas investors, with a contractual capital of 438 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment has mostly flowed into cities of Zhangzhou,
Quanzhou, Shishi and Xiamen, where tourist resources are abundant.
</P>
<P>
The province now has 180 hotels catering to overseas visitors
with more than 30,000 beds and 206 travel agencies. A tourism
system has been formed to meet the demands of various travellers.
</P>
<P>
Improvement has also been seen in areas such as transportation,
shopping and entertainment in Fujian province.

<HEADLINE> Subsidence Reported Along Yangtze River Dike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- No casualties or economic
losses have been reported as a result of subsidence along the
Yong'an Section of the Yangtze River Dyke near the city of
Jiujiang in east China's Jiangxi Province.
</P>
<P>
Several incidents of subsidence have occurred along a 350 meter
section of the dike since February 6, with one section subsiding
by as much as 0.9 meters.
</P>
<P>
The local government has basically controlled the situation by
dumping 4,000 cu.m. rock at the base of the dike, according to Luo
Xuyu, a local official.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted that ensuring complete safety will require an
additional 70,000 cu.m. of rock. Workers are currently engaged in
an all-out effort to repair the dike.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the subsidence to last winter's heavy rains
which raised the water levels of both the Yangtze River and Boyang
Lake. The resultant pressure exerted on either side of the dike
was also a contributing factor.
</P>
<P>
The city reinforced the dike in the 1980s, the official noted.

<HEADLINE> China Promotes Service Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economists divide the service industry into two categories --
technology-intensive and labor-intensive.
</P>
<P>
The first category, which covers the high-tech industry,
consulting and information services sectors, has attracted great
attention for all levels of government.
</P>
<P>
The latter, especially the chain store, transportation and
community services sectors, will also be granted priority in terms
of state investments amd will serve as outlet to ease the mounting
pressure of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
China's stock and insurance markets have also witnessed brisk
business. Numerous unemployed and laid-off people in various
cities have filled the void by working as insurance agents.
</P>
<P>
The deepening of reform and burgeoning development will enable
the service industry to attract an increasing number of redundant
workers from the manufacturing and agricultural sectors, said one
CPC official, adding that the shift will rationalize the
proportional employment of said industries.
</P>
<P>
The service industry accounted for 31.1 percent of China's 1996
gross domestic product (GDP) and employed 26 percent of the
nation's total work force. Both figures were significantly lower
than levels in developed countries and, in fact, were lower than
average levels in most developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Economists agree that gradually increasing government support
will enable the industry to reach a new peak.
</P>
<P>
China is currently exploring capital, financial, land-use,
information and personnel polices which will stimulate the
industry.
</P>
<P>
Projections call for the service industry's business volume to
grow by 1,600 billion yuan over the next four years, with its work
force rising to over 40 million people.

MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' trade deficit

increased by 15.5 percent to 61 billion dollars from 53 billion

billion dollars.

to this January combined to pull inflation down to a level which
was thought by many economists to be close to the lower tuning
point in its current down-cycle.
</P>
<P>
Local economist Loyiso Jiya forecast inflation to drop to 5.5
percent in February, but other economists said it was unlikely
that inflation would fall below five percent this year.
</P>
<P>
The core inflation rate dropped from 7.7 percent in December
to 7.2 percent in January while inflation calculated on the basis
of a three-month average change in the CPI dropped from 4.1
percent in December to 3.1 percent in January, the CSS said.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar
finished stronger Thursday in Sydney and in a more exuberant mood
as new economic data signaled that Australian domestic demand and
confidence remain strong, despite the economic crisis in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The local currency ended at 66.92 U.S. cents, from 66.32 U.S.
cents previously.
</P>
<P>
The December quarter new private capital expenditure report
from the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) provided
surprisingly upbeat news about business expenditure and investment
intentions.
</P>
<P>
"The data was stronger than expected and the Aussie did get a
nice 'up' on that to the highs," Paul Macarounas, treasury manager
with Rothschild Australia Ltd., said.
</P>
<P>
But Macarounas said the currency was unable to sustain a break
through 67 U.S. cents. Talk in the market suggested that this was
due to options-related activity, perhaps by U.S. institutions.
</P>
<P>
The ABS said capital expenditure rose 5.2 percent, seasonally
adjusted, in the December quarter to 8.04 billion U.S. dollars
from 7.642 billion U.S. dollars in the September quarter.
</P>
<P>
But the market was more interested in the first estimates of
expected business capital expenditure for fiscal 1998-1999
included in this report.
</P>
<P>
The first estimate for the year was 25.77 billion U.S. dollars,
19.2 percent higher than the corresponding estimate for the fiscal
year of 1997-1998, which will end on June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The news indicated business confidence in Australia appears to
be withstanding the onslaught of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Separately, the Australian dollar closed in Sydney at 85.94
Japanese yen, from 84.19 previously, and at 1.2145 Deutsche marks,
from 1.1802.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Demands Immediate US Pullout from Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has demanded an immediate
pullout of United States troops from the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
"The best way out for the U.S. is to withdraw its troops from
the Gulf and let the people in the region live in peace," an Iraqi
official spokesman said Wednesday night while commenting on a
claim by Bill Richardson, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Richardson said earlier that it was U.S. forces in the Gulf
that had compelled Iraq to open all sites to U.N. arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and the U.N. last Monday signed an agreement, under which
Iraq will grant unfettered and unconditional access to all sites
to the U.N. Special Commission in charge of overseeing the
elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi spokesman said Arabs and Muslims in this region are
opposed to external military threats and interference.
</P>
<P>
Even Jesse Helms, hardline chairman of U.S. Senate Foreign
Affairs Committee, has admitted that Americans are "in the
disgraceful position" of either going along with whatever deal the
U.N. has reached with Iraq or being regarded as "bad guys who
rejected peace and insisted on war," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Iraqi people will not be scared by U.S.
military threat, and that the Iraq-U.N. agreement will show the
world that no weapons of mass destruction are hidden in Iraqi
presidential palaces.

<HEADLINE> Regional Government Chairman Vows to Boost Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A double blessing descended
upon Li Zhaozhuo last month: He was elected chairman of the
People's Government of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and a
deputy to the coming Ninth People's Congress, China's top
legislature.
</P>
<P>
"I am fully aware of the heavy responsibility of the two posts
at the turn of the century," the 54-year-old Li told the first
news briefing after his election.
</P>
<P>
"I will live up to the great expectations of the people of all
ethnic groups in Guangxi and devote myself to the region's
economic growth and cultural progress," he said.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi is a multi-ethnic region in south China. Its population
is more than the combined total of the other four autonomous
regions in China -- Tibet, Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia and
Ningxia. The economic growth rate of Guangxi was higher than the
national average for the past five years.
</P>
<P>
The first thing Li did after he assumed the two posts was to
bring relief funds and materials to the homes of temporary jobless
workers, poor urban families and dependents of soldiers and
revolutionary martyrs to assist them during the country's longest
traditional Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
Graduated from Guangxi University in 1963, Li has served as a
technician, director of a hydro-electric power bureau, planning
commission chairman and Party secretary at the county, prefecture
and city levels.
</P>
<P>
Wherever he works, he stressed the importance of being
realistic and playing an exemplary role. Local people describe him
as an amiable Party secretary.
</P>
<P>
On regional development, Li said Guangxi will accelerate
agricultural development, readjust industrial structure, promote
common development of different ownerships, reduce the poor
population by 1.1 million, and build more infrastructure
facilities.
</P>
<P>
"As an NPC deputy, I will convey the demands and wishes of the
people and perform the duties entrusted by the people," he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientists Seek Breakthrough in AIDS Research (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are studying
a unique vaccine development for the human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV) based on research of an effective antidote to a fatal horse
disease similar to AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from China's top acquired immune deficiency syndrome
(AIDS) research body -- the AIDS Reference Lab of China's Academy
of Preventive Medicine -- and the Harbin Veterinary Institute of
the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), discoverer of
the Equine Infectious Animial (EIA) vaccine, have reached an
agreement to jointly launch the research program.
</P>
<P>
Shao Yiming, director of the AIDS Reference Lab, said his group
will launch gene variation research on the mechanism of the
China-developed EIAV to guide the HIV vaccine development.
</P>
<P>
Shao, a researcher, told Xinhua that EIA is described as "horse
AIDS" by some experts as two kinds of viruses belonging to the
same family and genus in taxonomy. Both are transmitted mainly via
blood.
</P>
<P>
Researches indicate that at least half of the gene structure of
AIDS and EIA is exactly the same and their appearance is almost
indistinguishable under an electron microscope.
</P>
<P>
Shao said that, among seven kinds of viruses that could lead to
such defective immune system diseases as human AIDS and animal
AIDS, only EIA is a killer. The EIA vaccine is expected to provide
a research model for developing a human AIDS vaccine.
</P>
<P>
Feng Jinglan, deputy head of the Animal Husbandry Department of
the Ministry of Agriculture, noted that in the past dozen of years
a large number of horses have been injected with the EIA vaccine,
which has resulted in total control of the deadly horse disease.
</P>
<P>
Shao said that his lab will start research on the EIA vaccine's
gene variation mechanism, make a comparison between EIA
vaccine-provoked immune function with the immune functioning of
AIDS patients who have survived for a long time.

<P>
Scientists will also adopt ways of in-vitro fertilization and
animal transmission of the virus to gradually break the hereditary
barrier in a bid to acquire an attenuated vaccine, he added.
</P>
<P>
Shao said he believes that AIDS scientists have, in past
decades, been focusing too much on genetic engineering, and have
neglected either the traditional technique for developing a
vaccine or combining the traditional technique with modern
molecular biology.
</P>
<P>
Shen Rongxian, head of the EIA research group at Harbin
Veterinary Institute in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province,
said he found out during his 30 years of research that if a donkey
is infected with the EIA virus, the fatality rate is only 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
Shen, an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering,
said he developed the horse disease virus by 100 generations
inside the donkey and developed another 100 generations of the
virus externally with donkeys' white blood cells.
</P>
<P>
After 200 generations of virus development, the toxicity of the
virus has been reduced gradually. Injected with the vaccine, a
horse would not be infected with the deadly disease as the vaccine
provokes an effective immune response.
</P>
<P>
Shen went on to say that China's EIA vaccine research has
aroused keen interest among foreign scientists. The U.S. Cancer
Research Institute and the Academic Medical Center of the
Netherlands' Amsterdam University signed a letter of intent in
January for establishing a data bank on EIA vaccine research.
</P>
<P>
Scientists from the three countries are expected to launch
researches on attenuating the virus and immune mechanism of the
EIA vaccine to seek a breakthrough in AIDS research, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China has accelerated
development of its service industry to accommodate more unemployed
people and promote improvements in the industrial mix.
</P>
<P>
Development of the service industry, which includes the
banking, insurance, real estate, tourism, community services and
cultural sectors, will provide greater opportunities for an
economic upsurge, according to economists.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the industry has witnessed rapid development in
recent years, combined with the overheated construction of large
department stores, has worried some economists and the
government. Nonetheless, "Bright prospects remain for development
of the overall service industry," according to Jin Ping, with the
the Long-Term Planning Sector under the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
The tourism sector, which has been listed high on the
development agenda, recorded a 1997 business volume of 310 billion
yuan, up 25.14 percent on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Economists also predict that the housing sector will maintain a
rapid growth rate. Efforts will center on promoting housing reform
and establishing housing construction as a new driving force in
the national economy. China has promised to make major
breakthroughs in creating a favorable financial environment,
adjusting housing rent and wage scale and establishing a mortgage
system.
</P>
<P>
The telecommunications sector has experienced the most rapid
growth over the past several years and the momentum is expected to
continue throughout 1998. Projections call for 9.7 percent of
China's population to have telephones by the end of the year, with
the figure for urban areas expected to hit 30 percent. The figures
indicate an increase of 12 million telephone subscribers during
the year.

</P>
<P>
"A young beauty specialist covered my face with massage cream
and rubbed softly. I felt so comfortable that I took a short
nap. When the whole process was completed, all my fatigue seemed

</P>
<P>
Since then, she has visited the beauty parlor four or five
times a month at a cost of about 100 yuan, equivalent to 10

to improve their appearance as their living standards are
improving.
</P>
<P>
A recent national survey shows that the per capita consumption
of cosmetics in China exceeded 100 yuan in 1997, 20 times the
figure for the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Sales of cosmetics across China topped 20 billion yuan in 1995
and increased by 20 percent in each of the last two years. And the
total spending on cosmetics and beauty aids nationwide soared to
120 billion yuan last year, a commerce trade official said at the

<P>
The country has more than 2,700 factories engaging in cosmetic
production. Their products fell into 10,000 varieties and
specifications.
</P>
<P>
China's exports of cosmetics were 57 million U.S. dollars
last year, more than twice the imports.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of hairdressers, cosmetic centers and beauty
shops have been opened in large cities such as Beijing, Shanghai,
Tianjin, Chongqing and Guangzhou.
</P>
<P>
In Nanjing, a medium-sized city in terms of economic growth,
the number of beauty parlors has increased from one in 1989 to
2,000 last year. They offer a variety of services including
make-up, eye-brows, wrinkles, eye-liner, breast enlargement and
figure-shaping. Traditional Chinese herbal medicine is now used
as an ingredient in face masks to stimulate blood circulation and
enrich vital energy.
</P>
<P>
Daguangming Beauty Parlor in downtown Nanjing has a thriving
business since it opened in December of 1996 . It is equipped with
up-to-date facilities imported from the United States and Germany
and creates a cozy environment.
</P>
<P>
"We receive an average of 40-to-50 customers a day," said Shen
Yonglan, the shop owner and a member of the International Beauty
Art Association." Among them were officials, workers, medical
personnel and artists. The daily profits around the Spring
Festival were more than double that in ordinary days."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, an increasing number of males have joined the
ranks of beauty shop clients. The sales volume of perfume for
men's use made up 13 percent of the national total last year,
according to figures released by the Ministry of Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
A lecturer at the Nanjing Academy of Arts named Zhou is a
frequent visitor of Yuan's shop.
</P>
<P>
"The pursuit of beauty is not the special line of women. Why
not let men have equal shares with them in this regard," he said.

<P>
HARARE, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean National War
Veterans' Association will soon acquire 10 aircraft for medical
air rescue service and tourism venture in accordance with deals
it clinched with Hungarian companies.
</P>
<P>
The association's National Chairman Chenjerai Hunzvi, who
returned a few days before from a trip to Hungary and Yugoslavia
to seek assistance, said that his trip had yielded more results
than expected, local newspaper The Herald reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of the aircraft is expected in Harare next
month.
</P>
<P>
Several deals were made with companies in Hungary and
Yugoslavia, he said, adding that the association's dream to have

<HEADLINE> China Makes Breakthrough in Handling Overdue Rent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- China has made a breakthrough
in dealing with overdue rent, an issue which has plagued its
financial leasing sector in recent years, according to Wednesday's
International Business Daily.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1997, agreements had been concluded on payment of
75-to-85 percent of the 370 million U.S. dollars of overdue rent,
a result of government guarantees before June 20, 1988.
</P>
<P>
The remaining 15-to-25 percent is expected to be solved in the
first half of this year, said the newspaper, attributing the
problems to China's immature market and credit systems.
</P>
<P>
The settlement of the issue was assured only after the State
Council agreed to turn 200 million U.S. dollars of foreign debt
into domestic debt in 1995 and great efforts were made by
concerned departments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, concerned leasing companies have made numerous
concessions, and they hope that the government can agree to let
them put the lost profit on account in the next few years to be
charged off along with their profit in the future to avoid
bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
However, the avoidance of new rent problems in this sector has
been put on the agenda, and experts are doing theoretical studies
and considering legal remedies.
</P>
<P>
One official suggested that leasing companies can make correct
decisions in choosing projects in the future and take every
measure to avoid rent-collection problems.
</P>
<P>
China's financial leasing sector, mostly joint ventures, has
entered its 18th year in 1998 engaging in the introduction of
foreign investment and support for the technological
transformation of the country's state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in the past 18 years China's financial
leasing sector has introduced more than 5 billion U.S. dollars for
China's industries covering electronics, textiles and other light
industries, post and telecommunications, power, petrochemicals and
transportation.

<HEADLINE> Versatile University President Does Well in Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Pan Yunhe has many roles. He
is a university president, an engineering academician, a computer
specialist and a painter. And, most recently, he was elected a
deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's top
legislature.
</P>
<P>
The Ninth NPC will hold its first annual session next month in
Beijing. "The session will be one of great significance as China's
reform and opening-up enter a new stage and key reform will be
under way in many fields," said the bespectacled president of
Zhejiang University in east China.
</P>
<P>
"I can feel the heavy responsibility on my shoulders,"
52-year-old Pan Yunhe said, explaining that although he had taken
government jobs before, this is the first time that he will
deliberate weighty state affairs with other NPC deputies on the
country's overall situation.
</P>
<P>
During his boyhood, Pan received professional training in fine
arts and majored in architecture at Tongji University in
Shanghai. He obtained a master's degree in artificial intelligence
while taking traditional Chinese painting as an elective course.
</P>
<P>
Since he began devoting himself to computer graphics in 1980,
he has been absorbed in the limitless and imaginative realms of
both modern computer technology and traditional Chinese drawing.
</P>
<P>
Through arduous endeavors during the past decade and more, Pan
and his assistants managed to develop advanced computer-aided
drawing systems which matched similar creations by foreign
computer experts. The systems have been widely applied and brought
about remarkable social and economic returns.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Pan was elected vice-president of Zhejiang University
after serving as dean of the university's computer department and
director of the artificial intelligence institute. A year later,
he became the president.
</P>
<P>
Under Pan's leadership, the university undertook diversified
reforms in teaching, scientific research and recruitment, and put
special emphasis on fostering students with profound knowledge,
professional competence and comprehensive quality.
</P>
<P>
He said he was making an overall review of his teaching and
research work during the past decade so that he could contribute
more to promoting the country's scientific and educational
undertakings both at the NPC session and in his future years at
the university.

<HEADLINE> Warm Blast from El Nino Greens Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The temperatures on February
22 and 23 in Romania went up to 22 degrees centigrade, the highest
for February for 100 years, the National Institute of Meteorology
and Hydrology announced today.
</P>
<P>
Romanian meteorologists linked the El Nino phenomenon to the
present record-breaking warm weather.
</P>
<P>
The institute said that since mid-February, a wave of warm air
has swept across the European continent, and in Romania the
average lowest temperature was 5.2 degrees centigrade higher than
usual, while the average highest temperature was 7.1 degrees
centigrade above normal.
</P>
<P>
The meteorological institute has forecast that such
extraordinary weather conditions may well last into the middle of
March and a cold flurry coming after that will make temperatures
drop 12 degrees centigrade and snow storms will hit Romania again.
</P>
<P>
According to historical records, the years of 1939, 1957, 1958,
1966, 1974 and 1994 also saw a warm February. In these six years,
El Nino was also extremely active.
</P>
<P>
In Bucharest now, under warm sunshine, trees are turning green
and many young people are wearing T-shirts and mini-skirts.

<P>
HANOI, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Relations between Russia and
Vietnam will undergo greater development this year, a Russian
diplomat said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Russian Ambassador Victor V.Ivanov told a press conference that
his country has always attached importance to friendship and
cooperation with Vietnam. Russia highly valued Vietnam's role as a
coordinator for Russian relations with the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
He said the visit to Vietnam by Russian Prime Minister Victor
Chernomyrdin last November created a new momentum for bilateral
cooperation in many areas.
</P>
<P>
Russia wanted to take part in the construction of Vietnam's
first oil refinery in the central province of Guang Ngai, Ivanov
said.
</P>
<P>
Russia had prepared a cooperative plan for a 1.5 billion
U.S. dollar cost refinery project which is under feasibility study
by the Vietnamese government, he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia was also interested in participating in the development
of Vietnam's energy industry, such as the building of Son La
Hydro-electric Power Station which would have a capacity almost
double that of Hoa Binh Hydro-power Plant built with the help of
the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
The trade value between the two countries last year was 330
million dollars, 17 percent above 1996.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka to Frame Health, Population Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
taken steps to frame a five-year health and population strategy,
the independent United News of Bangladesh reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Health and Family Secretary Muhammad Ali disclosed this while
addressing the 31st session of the U.N. Commission for Population
and Development in New York last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The strategy aims to provide health care and population
services to people on a cost-effective, sustainable basis with
emphasis on quality of care and the needs of clients particularly
women, children and the poor, the secretary explained.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh is the only country among the 20 least-developed
countries which has achieved fertility reduction over the last
decades, he noted.
</P>
<P>
A noticeable increase in the use of contraceptives from 4
percent in 1972 to 49 percent in 1996-97 contributed to a dramatic
fertility decline from seven births per woman to 3.3 in the same
period, he said.
</P>
<P>
Life expectancy improved from 45 in 1970 to 58 in 1995 due to
lower child and maternal mortality, he stated.
</P>
<P>
In spite of a remarkable drop in the infant mortality rate from
130 per thousand in 1975 to 77 in 1996-97, he said, it is still
the highest rate in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that about 70 percent of mothers suffer from
nutritional deficiency anemia, more than 60 percent of the
population has no access to basic health care and 75 percent
pregnant women neither have antenatal care nor get assistance from
a trained attendant.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the rebel Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) will resume their
low-level peace talks Thursday in a southern Philippine city.
</P>
<P>
Al Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs, said
Thursday that the two sides agreed to move the meeting venue to
Marawi City, capital of Lanao Del Sur Province at the request of
Lanao provincial officials.
</P>
<P>
The three-day peace talks were originally scheduled to take
place in Cotabato City, capital of Maguindanao Province.
</P>
<P>
The talks will focus on the identification of the
MILF-controlled areas and the finalization of an agenda for formal
peace talks, Murad said.
</P>
<P>
Murad said the meeting is also set to discuss the military's
failure to pull all the 2,000-strong government troops out the
MILF stronghold, Camp Abubakar, in Maguindanao Province as called
for in an earlier agreement.
</P>
<P>
The government had agreed to move back its troops by some five
kilometers away from the defense lines of Camp Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
But MILF field commanders reported that they can still see
soldiers near the perimeters of Abubakar, Murad said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Murad said the MILF will press for the recognition
by the government of its 30 major camps and 20 satellite
headquarters during the talks.
</P>
<P>
Murad said the identification and recognition of their camps
are necessary in order to prevent future skirmishes between MILF
guerrillas and government soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Recently, MILF rebels and government troops have been involved
in a series of skirmishes in Maguindanao, killing scores of
combatants from both sides and displacing thousands of villagers.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, which claims to have 12,000 members, is currently the
strongest anti-government force in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government began exploratory peace talks in
January 1997, but failed to agree on an agenda for formal peace
talks.

MOSCOW, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The gross domestic product
(GDP) in Uzbekistan increased 5.2 percent last year, President
Islam Karimov announced Wednesday in Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
According to an Interfax Agency report, the president
summarized the country's 1997 social and economic development
during a government conference.
</P>
<P>
He said the increase in production was remarkably higher than
the increase in population, and the increase involved all economic
fields.
</P>
<P>
The average inflation rate per month was 2.1 percent, less than
half the figure in 1996, he said.
</P>
<P>
Due to the stability of the economic situation, the government
spent more money improving social welfare. The amount spent
totalled about two-fifths or 40 percent of the annual budget, the
president added.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Reputation Restored in Gulf Crisis, Says Italian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Rome, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi said Wednesday that the U.N. has recovered its role on the
question of the weapon inspections crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"I believe it's a turning point in world politics," Prodi said
in a televised speech.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan Sunday reached an agreement
with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on unlimited weapons
inspections over Iraqi facilities, averting a U.S.-led military
strike on the Gulf state.
</P>
<P>
Prodi also said that Italy has gained international reputation
because it opposes the use of force against Iraq from the
beginning.
</P>
<P>
The Italian prime minister said the economic sanctions against
Iraq should be eased and eventually lifted because the target of
the sanctions is the weak. But he said the easing of the sanctions
should come after the completion of the weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
Iraq should abide by the agreement, otherwise "Italy would
punish Iraq together with its allies," he said.

MEXICO CITY, February 25 (Xinhua) -- More than 25,000
Guatemalan refugees living in southern Mexico have returned to
their homeland thanks to a 1996 peace agreement, a Guatemalan
official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Juan Reynoso, representative of the Permanent Commissions, said

<HEADLINE> Guatemala Oil Production Up Threefold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala's petroleum
production increased 300 percent from 8,000 barrels a day in 1996
to 32,000 barrels a day in 1997, Energy and Mines Minister Leonel
Lopez said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said production in 1998 is expected to meet domestic demands
of 45,000 barrels a day.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that Guatemala's petroleum reservoirs amount to more
than two billion barrels, Lopez attributed the increase to the
1996 peace agreement which ended a 36-year civil war in the
Central American country.
</P>
<P>
Lopez said that before peace agreements signings, petroleum
camps suffered from constant guerilla assaults.
</P>
<P>
The cessation of sabotage had restored security for foreign
companies exploring for oil deposits.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, only two hydrocarbon companies were established in
northern Guatemala. The number grew to nine in 1997 and is
expected to reach 12 by the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Becomes State Natural Reserve for Endangered Harbor Seals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, February 26 (Xinhua) -- This, northeast China's port
city, has recently been named by the State Council as the
country's only one natural reserve for harbor seals at the state
level.
</P>
<P>
Harbor seals, also known as common seals or spotted seals, are
generally whitish or greyish at birth and as an adult are
generally grey with black spots. They can be found throughout the
Northern Hemisphere including the Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, Sea
of Japan and China's seas.
</P>
<P>
The harbor seals that migrate from the Sea of Japan into
China's waters every December all move into Liaodong Bay. They
reproduce there on floating ice, and move southward in mid-March
of the next year.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of harbor seals has been declining sharply
in Liaodong Bay because of worsening environmental pollution since
the early 1970s. The seals that arrive at Liaodong Bay every year
usually are no more than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
China started taking measures to protect the seals in
1992. Dalian City built a natural reserve on the western coast of
the Bohai Sea to protect and study the endangered animals.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city started rescuing young seals blown ashore
by wind from the start of spring every year.
</P>
<P>
So far, the city has saved more than 40 young harbor seals.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Wei, an engineer for the Dalian Natural
Reserve, the site will have an area of 909,000 hectares. It will
be the country's sixth natural reserve for aquatic animals.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Concerned Over Situation in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria Wednesday expressed
serious concern over the worsening situation in Kosovo, an
autonomous province of Yugoslavia, and called on regional forces
to mediate in the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Foreign Ministry spokesman Radko Vlaikov expressed
apprehension, which is shared by the international community, that
a possible ethnic conflict in Kosovo might spread to other states
in the region.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo has a 90 percent ethnic Albanian majority which has been
seeking independence from Yugoslavia since 1981. Violence there
has been growing this year following the non-implementation of an
education agreement reached between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and the leader of the ethnic Albanians, Ibrahim Rugova.
</P>
<P>
"We do not want the region to be an area of conflict yet again,
and we do not want southeastern Europe to be viewed with concern
yet again," Vlaikov noted.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that a preventive diplomacy in this case is one of
the best ways to act before a conflict erupts," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that Bulgaria, Greece, Turkey and Romania, which bear
exceptional responsibility for security in southeastern Europe,
must take emergency measures to prevent further deterioration of
the situation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the need for the four countries to issue a joint
declaration calling for a sincere dialogue between the Yugoslav
authorities and the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian Foreign Minister Nadezhda Mihailova, who had
initiated the four-country joint efforts, on Tuesday invited
Macedonia to join the concerted efforts.

<HEADLINE> IMF, Philippines Agree on New Economic Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of the
Philippines and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) have agreed
on the terms of a new economic and financial program that will
replace the existing one which expires on March 31, a local
newspaper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new program, called the precautionary arrangement, will
last for two years, Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson was
quoted as saying Wednesday by the Manila Times.
</P>
<P>
The program will begin sometime in July, when the new
government is already in place after the May general elections.
</P>
<P>
The new program will allow the government to borrow 1.6 billion
U.S. dollars from the IMF and 1 billion dollars from other
multilateral financial institutions for balance of payments (BOP)
support.
</P>
<P>
One of key policy measures being envisaged in the new program
is the reform of the banking system. Singson said the government,
under the program, is committed to introducing amendments to the
existing banking laws to achieve the reforms.
</P>
<P>
The program also emphasizes the attainment of single-digit
inflation and stable exchange rates this year through tight
monetary stance that will almost surely result in high interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
Most economists expect the inflation rate to hit double-digit
levels this year due to the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
While the IMF insists on tight monetary stance, it has relaxed
targets for the fiscal component of the program. The IMF has
agreed to reduce the government budget surplus this year from 16
billion pesos (400 million U.S. dollars) to only 5 billion pesos
(125 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
It has also agreed to a 26 billion peso (650 million dollars)
deficit target for the consolidated public sector financial
position, the combined cash balances of the government,
state-owned firms and financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is expected to get free from the decades-long
IMF economic supervision with the expiration of the Extended
Facility Program at the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
But the government is seeking a precautionary program with the
IMF after its graduation from the IMF's tutelage in order to get
IMF loans to help the country recover from the current currency
crisis.

MOSCOW, February 25 (Xinhua) -- A hostage crisis in western
Georgia ended Wednesday with the release of four U.N military
observers held captive for one week, Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The 15-member kidnap ring surrendered to Georgian security
authorities peacefully, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers, headed by Gotsha Esaybua, claimed to be
supporters of late president Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who was ousted in
a 1992 coup and died a year later.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers were demanding the release of Gamsakhurdia
supporters who were arrested this year after a bloody February 9
assassination attempt on Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze,
and the withdrawal of Russian troops from the ex-Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
The hostage crisis ended after Shevardnadze met supporters of
Gamsakhurdia to discuss the situation.
</P>
<P>
The four U.N. observers -- a Czech, a Swede, and two Uruguayans
-- were taken hostage last Thursday from their headquarters in
Zugdidi, Georgia.

BANGKOK, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan asked Canada to extend financial support for a proposed
international conference in Bangkok on displaced people and

</P>
<P>
Surin made the request during a meeting Wednesday with Canadian

</P>
<P>
He said Cananda is concerned in bringing stability to the
region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Thai foreign minister also asked Canada to help
Thai students suffering from the economic downturn by foregoing
tuition fees and arranging odd jobs, as the United States, Britain
and Japan have done.
</P>

country would coordinate with Thai counterparts to ensure the

supporters of late president Zviad Gamsakhurdia, who was ousted in
a 1992 coup and died a year later. Esaybua was demanding the

following the withdrawal of Russian troops from the ex-Soviet

<HEADLINE> Enterprise Managers Concerning About NPC Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 26 (Xinhua) -- A recent study shows that most
Chinese enterprise managers are paying close attention to the
annual meetings of the National People's Congress (NPC) and the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
scheduled to open early next month.
</P>
<P>
According to the results of an investigation conducted by
the Beijing Zero Point Investigation Company in Guangzhou, Beijing and
Shanghai, nearly 61.7 percent of the 1,012 managers polled
said that they are "highly concerned" or "substantially concerned"
with the two meetings.
</P>
<P>
What they are concerned about most, they said, are the new
economic policies to be adopted, new directions to be taken by the
new Chinese government, change of government leaders and new
bills to be passed.
</P>
<P>
It is said that managers of the state-owned enterprises are
paying more attention than private entrepreneurs to these two
meetings, since state enterprises need to reform their ownership
and solve the problems of laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
About 53.35 percent of the people interviewed said that they
are concerned about the policies to be taken to speed up economic
development, particularly measures related to the reform of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
And 20.79 percent of the managers are interested in the
contents of the new government work report, with 14,9 percent
particularly interested in the new bills and laws, and 10.2
percent interested in anti-corruption measures.
</P>
<P>
Many of those interviewed acknowledged that they support
measures to promote the marketization of enterprises, the lifting
of administrative restrictions and the downsizing of workforces.
</P>
<P>
About 86.7 percent of the private enterpreneurs claimed that
more job opportunities will be created by developing the non-state
economy, and that the private sector should receive more government
support and its expansion should be encouraged.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is among the top 10
countries in the world in terms of diabetes incidence rate.
</P>
<P>
A national survey conducted by the Diabetic Association of
Pakistan (DAP) reveals that there are now some 4.3 million
diabetics in Pakistan and the figure is likely to reach 14.5
million by 2025.
</P>
<P>
Chief coordinator of the survey, Abdus Samad Shera, told
journalists Wednesday that while Pakistan is trying to control
various infectious and preventable diseases, the triad of
hypertension, diabetes and obesity has emerged to be one of the
most common cause of morbidity and mortality in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Shera said the situation could be changed provided diabetes or
impaired glucose tolerance is detected earlier.
</P>

Since diabetes and hypertension can be controlled, emphasis
should be on prevention through awareness, screening and control,

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Restructuring enabled the
light industry sector in south China's Guangdong Province to
generate an output value of 478.7 billion yuan (57.67 billion US
dollars) in 1997, up five percent on the previous year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, enhanced market competitiveness since June last
year has helped the sector overcome deficits and increase
surpluses.
</P>
<P>
Supplies of most light and textile products have basically
fulfilled nationwide demand and pressured the local industrial
sector to improve its product mix.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four major light and textile group companies operated
solidly during 1997 as a result of transferring brand-name
products, technology and capital,
</P>
<P>
The majority of local ventures which experimented with the
modern enterprise system have been transformed into shareholding
or limited liability companies. More than half of small light
industrial and textile companies have introduced shareholding
systems.
</P>
<P>
Technological upgrades have also contributed to easily
recognizable changes in the industry, with the sector winning
awards for a number of scientific and technological achievements.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Star Kanu Set for Friendly With Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian football star Nwankwo
Kanu is to play in a friendly match between Nigeria and Germany
on April to prove his worthiness of a position in the nation's
World Cup team.
</P>
<P>
Bora Milutinovic, the technical adviser of the Nigerian
national team Super Eagles, made the disclosure to the News
Agency of Nigeria in Kingston, Jamaica, after a friendly match
that ended in a 2-2 draw.
</P>
<P>
Bora said he would assemble his World Cup team in May after a
series of scheduled international friendlies, adding that he
intends to give all Nigerian players opportunities to prove their
mettle before drawing his final list.
</P>
<P>
The coach, who recently made a tour of Europe to monitor
Nigerian players' current forms, said that he was pleased that
Kanu was making a comeback at Inter Milan of Italy.
</P>
<P>
"In his last match, he played for 38 minutes. That was much
better," Bora said.
</P>
<P>
Kanu, captain of the Nigerian team that won Africa's first
Olympic gold medal in Atlanta, U.S., in 1996, is the African
footballer of the year 1996.
</P>
<P>
He was, however, found with a dangerous heart disease after
the game and received a heart surgery in the U.S. in late 1996.
</P>
<P>
Since then, he has been in a slow recovery and was rarely seen
in the field.

CANBERRA, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The nation's peak medical body Wednesday night branded the
federal government's 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.12 billion
U.S. dollars) private health insurance incentive scheme a failure.
It accused the government of being unable to manage private health
insurance.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald:
</P>
<P>
-- The Federal Treasury has written off any chance of a
long-awaited recovery in Japan's economy, and warned that the
Asian crisis is "by no means over." The impact is "still to be
felt in some countries in the region."
</P>
<P>
The Age:
</P>
<P>
-- The rural doctor shortage could be twice as bad as expected,
with a desperate need for new practitioners, the Rural Doctors
Association warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review:

<P>
-- The Asian financial crisis will slice at least 1 percent off
Australia's economic growth rate next year, the Federal Minister

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, February 26 (Xinhua) -- The local legislature of this
capital of northeast China's Jilin province has tested 40 out of
42 officials who are scheduled to be appointed members of the new
municipal government on basic legal knowledge.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of an effort by the Standing Committee of the
municipal people's congress, the local legislature, to implement
the basic principle of "the rule of law".
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the testing said,"If the leading
officials don't master the law, how can they administer the city
in accordance with the law."
</P>
<P>
Two officials who were absent for the test -- one being on an
official trip and the other on sick leave, were examined later.
</P>
<P>
The committee has decided that government members who are
scheduled to be appointed by the committee must be tested first,
and those who fail may not be appointed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the committee requires new government members to
make oral pledges to the committee before their appointment.
</P>
<P>
And one year after taking office, the officials have to undergo
appraisals sponsored by the committee.

BRUSSELS, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Nico van Kerchhoven was on
target twice Wednesday en route to leading hosts Belgium to a 2-0
win over the United States in a World Cup warm-up game.
</P>
<P>
The Belgian midfielder scored a goal in each half of the
friendly game. He first went it alone down the left frank to beat
a U.S. defender and then the goalkeeper to score the opener at the
24th minute.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen minutes into the second half, van Kerchhoven volleyed
home a rebound off the near post from a hammering freekick. His
volleying shot hit off the far post for another goal.
</P>
<P>
The American eleven demonstrated some nice soccer insight in
front-court tactics but off-time connection and off-mark finish
touch betrayed the visitors several times during the friendly.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sells Silver Coin Honoring Black Patriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday began to offer for sale a silver coin commemorating the
5,000 black Americans who fought in the Revolutionary War.
</P>
<P>
The dollar coin features escaped slave Crispus Attucks on one
side and a black colonial family on the other. A total 500,000
coins will be offered for sale through by the U.S. Mint at prices
beginning at 30.00 dollars each.
</P>
<P>
The money from the sale will be used to help finance a new
memorial to black patriots on the National Mall in central
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony at the National Archives, Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin said that it is fitting that the coin honors Attucks,
who was the first person killed by British soldiers during the
Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770.
</P>
<P>
"Certainly one of the great paradoxes of American history is
that the first American to die for the cause of freedom in our
revolution was an escaped slave," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that by producing these coins we will broaden
recognition of the role of African-Americans in the American
Revolution."
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to receive 10 dollars from each
commemorative coin sold and to collect a total of 5 million
dollars for the Black Patriots Memorial.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriot Leader Rebuffs EU Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktas reiterated Wednesday in Nicosia, capital of Cyprus, that
he will not join the Cypriot government delegation for membership
talks with the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"The Greek Cypriot EU application on behalf of the entire
island is unacceptable," Turkey's semi-official Anatolia News
Agency quoted Denktas as saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Britain, as a guarantor country of Cyprus,
should have vetoed this application at the very beginning.
</P>
<P>
Denktas also denied media reports that he had received an
invitation from British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook to call for
Turkish Cypriots' participation in the Cypriot government
delegation for the upcoming talks with the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU leaders made an official decision at last December's
Luxembourg summit inviting Cyprus to the EU expansion process
along with several other eastern European nations.
</P>
<P>
This angered both Turkey and Turkish Cypriots, which claimed
that the Greek Cypriot-controlled Cypriot government has no right
to hold talks with the EU on behalf of the whole island.
</P>
<P>
Denktas affirmed that he will not hold talks with British
Cyprus envoy Sir David Hannay, who is scheduled to visit Nicosia
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus, a small island in the eastern Mediterranean, has
remained divided since 1974 when the Turkish forces landed and
took over the northern third of it in response to an abortive
coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and international community have gone to
great efforts to seek a reunification of the island but so far no
tangible results have been achieved due to two sides' grave
differences.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Mourns Lives Lost in Florida Tornadoes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) --U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Wednesday mourned lives lost to Florida tornadoes and pledged
federal assistance in rebuilding homes.
</P>
<P>
"Americans are praying for you and pulling for you, and
whatever it is within our power to do to help you return to normal
lives, we will do," Clinton told survivors and rescue workers at
Kissimme, Florida.
</P>
<P>
A severe storm with tornadoes cut through central Florida on
Monday, killing at least 38 people, injuring more than 250 others
and destroyed hundreds of homes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has declared 34 Florida counties disaster areas, making
victims and local governments eligible for low-cost loans and some
grants.
</P>
<P>
James Lee Witt, director of the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, said the El Nino-driven tornadoes' damage in Florida would
be up in the millions.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Department has made a grant of 3 million dollars for
temporarily unemployed Floridians as the first federal aid to the
disaster region.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "What I'm trying to figure out is whether we can
get some sort of satellite system (to act as a) buzzer system with
bells and whistles to make sure people get advanced warning."
</P>
<P>
Clinton will flow to San Francisco on Wednesday afternoon to
discuss with local officials the Bay Area disaster recovery. El
Nino related storms and flooding have struck California for times.
FEMA planned to spend an estimated 250 million dollars on the
recovery in the state.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House of Representatives Increases Penalties for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

WASHINGTON, February 25 (Xinhua) -- Facing increased instances
of witness intimidation, particularly in gang-related crimes, the
U.S. House of representatives voted on Wednesday to make it a
federal crime to cross a state boundary with the intent of
influencing a witness in a state criminal trial.
</P>
<P>
The legislation, passed 366-49, would impose penalties of up to
10 years in prison for intimidating a witness to a maximum of 20
years if a witness is injured. A person who crosses a state line
and kills a witness could be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
"There is an awful lot of crime being directed and conducted
out of prisons today," said Representative Bill McCollum, a
Republican and chairman of the Judiciary crime subcommittee. "And
much of it is gang-related, and much of it involves witness
intimidation."
</P>
<P>
He called the bill part of a pattern "to try to get control
over this extreme violence that is happening in our country
today."
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday the House approved legislation to increase mandatory
penalties for federally related crimes involving guns.
</P>
<P>
Supporters cited surveys showing that half the prosecutors in
larger cities view intimidation of victims and witnesses as a
major problem.
</P>
<P>
The bill, which has yet to be considered by the Senate, also
promotes notification among law enforcement agencies of the
interstate relocation of people in witness-protection programs.
